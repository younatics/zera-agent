"(CNN) -- Millions of Americans have been shocked by the devastation caused by the tornadoes in Oklahoma. Having toured the area, it's impossible to put the scope of the damage in words. Not just homes but entire neighborhoods are gone. Americans also may have been surprised to hear about a disagreement in Washington about delivering disaster aid to victims. The good news is this disagreement doesn't exist. No one in Washington is opposing delivering aid to victims. In fact, there is no aid bill for Oklahoma to even debate. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has $11.6 billion available in the fund for assistance to victims in all federally declared disasters, and this is likely more than sufficient to help victims in Oklahoma. As the ranking member of the Senate committee that oversees FEMA, I'm confident Oklahoma will receive the assistance it needs. The bad news is some in the media have persisted in reporting on this nonexistent funding fight -- although it might happen in the future if FEMA runs out of money. My view is that focusing on funding questions now is premature and insensitive. Although I've never been shy about telling reporters and my constituents where I stand on tough questions, focusing on a fight that isn't happening is crass and irresponsible journalism. Instead of reporting the facts about disaster spending, many news outlets have used the tragedy to talk about ""dilemmas,"" ""binds"" and ""divisions"" among Republicans. At this point, these stories are only figments in the imaginations of a few journalists and editors who are having a difficult time keeping their opinions to themselves. Case in point is Wednesday's Washington Post story, where I learned about my alleged dilemma on tornado aid. But The Post buried the real news in the 15th paragraph, which reads: . ""At this point, all these questions are theoretical. There is no Oklahoma disaster relief bill. There may never be one. ... At the moment, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has a large stockpile of funds to pay for disaster response; members of Congress estimated it at $11.6 billion."" The article goes on to say that most legislators agree that the fund is adequate to handle the Oklahoma disaster, and it quotes Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as saying ""Right now, we don't need the money."" In other words, the real news is no Oklahoma disaster relief bill exists and, as Reid says, ""we don't need the money."" Still, I have no objection to stating unequivocally that if FEMA runs out of money, I will encourage my colleagues to pay for any new assistance for Oklahoma, or anywhere else by reducing lower-priority spending rather than borrowing new money. Let me explain why this principle is important. Under congressional budget rules, if disaster funds are exhausted, Congress can pass an ""emergency supplemental spending"" bill that does not count against that year's budget caps. In other words, Congress can simply borrow new money without setting priorities or making hard choices about where to cut the budget elsewhere. At a time when we're losing $200 billion a year because of waste and duplication, not setting priorities doesn't make sense in any circumstance. Why respond to one disaster by creating another one for taxpayers? Some have suggested it is hypocritical for me to support disaster aid in my state after opposing the Sandy emergency aid bill for the Northeast. But my position has been the same for my entire service in Congress, starting when I pushed for offsets to the Oklahoma City bombing supplemental bill in 1995. My position has never been to oppose all forms of disaster aid. My position has been to oppose politicians who use disasters to spend money that has nothing to do with helping victims of disasters. The hard truth is both parties have abused the emergency spending process in Congress for many years. For instance, when the Gulf Coast was ravaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, many in Washington were appalled by my suggestion that times of tragedy and disaster are precisely the times for politicians to tighten their belts and make hard choices. One of the sacrifices I proposed was to divert funds from a $223 million bridge in Alaska -- known as the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" -- to a bridge over Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana that was damaged by Hurricane Katrina. My colleagues fumed: How dare I force such choices? My response was -- and is: How dare we not force such choices? The Superstorm Sandy package, unfortunately, is another recent example. I supported a scaled-down $25 billion version of disaster aid for Sandy, but I strongly opposed a $50 billion package that was an all-you-can-eat buffet for politicians and politically connected contractors. Much of the larger Sandy package had little to do with helping victims of the disaster. More than $5 billion was directed to the Army Corps of Engineers -- more than the Corps' annual budget. Even NASA was in on the game. NASA said its damage from the storm was minimal, but Congress wanted to give it $15 million anyway. The most revealing aspect was more than 70% of the $50 billion would not be spent for two years, which meant it was an economic stimulus package, not a disaster aid bill. I don't believe anyone in the Senate wants or anticipates a Sandy- or Katrina-like fight about emergency spending offsets for Oklahoma. Still, if any politicians in Washington hope to use Oklahoma's tragedy as vehicle for pork, don't bother. State Rep. Mark McBride from Moore, Oklahoma, put it best this week on MSNBC: ""We don't want anything. We don't want anything extra. We just want to rebuild our city. And whatever they can do for us they can cough up, and whatever they don't, we`ll make it up. That`s the way we roll here."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sen. Tom Coburn.","Sen. Tom Coburn: Despite reports, nobody in Congress is debating Oklahoma disaster aid .
Coburn: FEMA has $11.6 billion for assistance, more than enough to help tornado victims .
But if FEMA fund runs out, Coburn will stick by policy to deny aid without cuts elsewhere .

"(CNN) -- The parents of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl who's been waiting more than a year for a lung transplant says the girl has essentially been ""left to die."" Sarah Murnaghan, who has had cystic fibrosis since birth, could die within weeks without a transplant. She has been waiting 18 months for another pair of lungs as her ability to breathe has rapidly deteriorated. She is at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her six-state region. Doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her, and adult lungs become available much more often. But children under age 12 aren't prioritized for adult organs, under federal rules. So Sarah could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has called on officials to review the nation's lung transplant policy for children, but any change could take up to two years. Organ donation by the numbers . A statement from Fran and Janet Murnaghan welcomed the policy review as a ""positive step."" ""However, Sarah, and other children like her who need a transplant now, do not have the luxury of time to wait for a lengthy bureaucratic change,"" the parents said. ""Essentially, Sarah has been left to die."" The department said Sunday it is sympathetic to the many parents facing similar circumstances. ""Our heart goes out to any family that is dealing with a loved one who is on a waiting list for an organ transplant,"" the statement said. ""Given the significant disparity in the number of transplantable organs to the number of people in need of an organ, (the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network) has regulations and policies to ensure that decisions are based on the best medical science and the most equitable process in a very difficult situation."" The Murnaghans asked that other parents consider naming Sarah as a transplant recipient should they or one of their children face death in the coming weeks. ""If you want to directly donate your loved one's lungs to Sarah, the law cannot change that. And Sarah will use that and create a positive and wonderful life and legacy for your loved one,"" Janet Murnaghan told CNN. ""I'm praying that somebody sees this story and is in a position to save my baby."" Sarah had a setback Sunday night, suffering from a fever and increased carbon dioxide levels, according to a post on Janet Murnaghan's Facebook page. ""I am feeling anxious and praying,"" she wrote. The United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit that manages the nation's transplant system under federal contract, agreed to the review Friday, the same day Sebelius sent an urgent request for it to look at its policy, UNOS spokeswoman Anne Paschke said. But because the review process involves research and public comment, which take time, and because there are not enough organ donations for children, the nation's transplant system may not be able to save Sarah's life. Her family wants Sebelius to step in. ""We are going to let a kid die over red tape. Somebody needs to stand up that this isn't right, this is a human issue. This isn't politics, this is a human issue,"" Janet Murnaghan said. Paschke urged more Americans to look at an organ donation website. Sebelius' request to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network called on officials to look at the age categories used in lung transplant cases. Sarah's struggle has ignited a fight for new rules governing organ donations. She's been in a Philadelphia hospital for months due to her cystic fibrosis. Tens of thousands of people have signed a petition on Change.org, and a congressman has called on the Obama administration to take quick action. Sarah's mother told CNN she was ""shocked"" when she learned the rules a couple of weeks ago. Sebelius asked for the policy review in a letter to Dr. John Roberts, board president of OPTN. Sebelius cited the significant disparity between the number of transplantable organs and the number of people in need of an organ, especially among children. She also directed HHS's Health Resources and Services Administration Division of Transplantation to consider new approaches for promoting pediatric and adolescent organ donation. ""With 1,819 pediatric patients on organ transplant waitlists and only 852 pediatric organ transplant donors each year, it is especially clear that we can and should, if possible, do more to encourage the public to become registered organ donors,"" Sebelius wrote. OPTN issued a statement last week noting that there is a separate policy for children because the ""biological needs and circumstances of candidates younger than age 12 are different from either adolescent or adult candidates. One key difference is the size and lung capacity of donors and patients among these age ranges."" Children younger than age 12 are prioritized for donations from other children of similar age and size within a 1,000-mile radius. Policies allow ""status adjustments for specifically defined groups of candidates with unique medical circumstances not addressed by the overall policy,"" the statement said. The network routinely reviews policies and considers ""public input as well as medical data and experience,"" the statement said. Dying girl's plight sparks fight over organ transplants .

"(CNN) -- It's been 145 years since Abraham Lincoln appeared on a ballot, but admiration for the man who saved the union and sparked the end of slavery is as strong as ever, according to a new survey. Abraham Lincoln, seen in an 1861 photo, tops the list of former presidents in a new survey of historians. Lincoln finished first in a ranking by historians of the 42 former White House occupants. The survey was released over Presidents Day weekend. The news wasn't quite as good for the latest addition to the nation's most exclusive fraternity: George W. Bush finished 36th in the survey, narrowly edging out the likes of historical also-rans Millard Fillmore, Warren Harding and Franklin Pierce. James Buchanan -- the man who watched helplessly as the nation lurched toward civil war in the 1850s -- finished last. ""As much as is possible, we created a poll that was non-partisan, judicious and fair-minded,"" said Rice University professor Douglas Brinkley, who helped organize the survey of 65 historians for cable television network C-SPAN. The survey -- which asked participants to rank each president on 10 qualities of leadership ranging from public persuasion and economic management to international relations and moral authority -- was the network's second since 2000.  See which presidents ranked highest and lowest » . The hero of Springfield, Illinois, finished first nine years ago as well. ""It's fitting that for the 200th birthday of Abraham Lincoln that he remains at the top of these presidential rankings,"" Brinkley said. ""Lincoln continues to rank at the top in all categories because he is perceived to embody the nation's avowed core values: integrity, moderation, persistence in the pursuit of honorable goals, respect for human rights, compassion,"" Howard University's Edna Medford added. Founding father George Washington finished second in the new survey, followed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, and Harry Truman, in that order. Bill Clinton registered the greatest gain among recent presidents, jumping from 21st to 15th in the survey. Ronald Reagan edged forward from 11th to 10th overall, while George H.W. Bush moved up from 20th to 18th. The prize for the greatest jump in approval from historians over the last nine years, however, went to a president who has often sat near the bottom of such rankings: Ulysses S. Grant. The Civil War general jumped 10 notches, from 33rd to 23rd. Grant has traditionally received poor marks for corruption among people in his administration and the failed postwar reconstruction effort he presided over. But the nation's 18th president may be getting a bounce from all of the recent attention focused on Lincoln, Medford said. ""Grant won the war for Lincoln,"" she noted during an appearance on C-SPAN's ""Washington Journal."" ""A new look at the totality of his career may be improving his presidential stature,"" she said. ""Bill Clinton and Ulysses S. Grant aren't often mentioned in the same sentence -- until now,"" historian Richard Norton Smith said. ""Participants in the latest [survey] have boosted each man significantly higher than in the original survey conducted in 2000. All of which goes to show two things: the fluidity with which presidential reputations are judged, and the difficulty of assessing any president who has only just recently left office."" In his final news conference before stepping down last month, George W. Bush made it clear he wasn't concerned with poor initial judgments of his presidency. ""There is no such thing as short-term history,"" Bush said. ""I don't think you can possibly get the full breadth of an administration until time has passed."" The survey's participants ranked Bush 41st on international relations and 40th on economic management -- ahead of only Herbert Hoover.","65 historians ranked former presidents on various leadership qualities .

"(CNN) -- The most destructive fire in Colorado's history is now 90% contained, officials said Wednesday. The Waldo Canyon Fire near Colorado Springs burned more than 18,000 acres after starting June 23, prompting the evacuation of several neighborhoods days later. The wildfire destroyed 346 homes, according to InciWeb, a website that gathers fire information from various U.S. agencies. It called the fire the most destructive in state history. The Colorado Office of Emergency Management says it is monitoring four other major fires in the state, two of which were contained as of Wednesday evening. The threat of fire is still high across the state. As a result, no Independence Day fireworks are allowed on public lands, said Rick Barton, an information officer for the Pine Ridge Fire burning near Grand Junction. Other fireworks shows are being allowed only by special permits, he said, and no charcoal grills are allowed outside in most of the state.","The Waldo Canyon Fire destroyed 346 homes .

"XENIA, Ohio (CNN) -- ""It's the magic of dogs."" Karen Shirk's nonprofit 4 Paws for Ability has placed 319 service dogs with people with disabilities since 1998. That's how Karen Shirk explains the ability of service dogs to help children suffering from autism. ""I'm sure there's some sort of scientific explanation,"" she says. ""But I call it magic."" Since 1998, through her nonprofit 4 Paws for Ability, Shirk has helped partner service dogs with people with a wide range of disabilities. It was Shirk's own challenge in getting a service dog that led her to start 4 Paws. In the late 1980s, while employed as a social worker in the field of mental retardation and autism, Shirk suddenly went into respiratory arrest. She was hospitalized off and on until 1992, when she was finally diagnosed with a rare neuromuscular disease. Confined to a wheelchair and reliant on a respirator, Shirk set out to get a service dog so she could be more independent -- but agencies turned her down, saying she was too disabled for a dog to make a difference in her life. Frustrated, Shirk eventually decided to obtain a dog on her own. She found Ben, a black German shepherd puppy that, with the help of a trainer, became her service dog. With Ben by her side, Shirk regained a sense of optimism and control over her life. ""He gave me a reason to get up in the morning,"" Shirk remembers. ""I went from existing to living."" Knowing there must be others like her, Shirk started 4 Paws in her apartment to help people who've been told they're ineligible to get a service dog. ""We don't discriminate against anyone who has a need,"" she says. Since many agencies have age restrictions, she now specializes in providing dogs to children. The dogs help kids with a variety of issues, from mobility problems to seizures, but from the start Shirk wanted to find ways to assist children with autism. ""I knew [autistic children] connected to animals,"" she remembers. ""I knew that service dogs would be able to help."" She developed a program to train autism assistance dogs, and of the 319 dogs she's placed since 1998, nearly 70 percent have been partnered with autistic children. ""The biggest problem that's faced by families that have children with autism is isolation. They actually quit going out because they can't keep their child safe,"" says Shirk. Shirk's service dogs are taught a variety of methods to help keep kids with autism safe. Since many children tend to wander away and get lost, 4 Paws uses a technique called ""tethering,"" where the kids are tethered to their dogs while in public. The parent -- who always holds the leash -- ultimately remains in control of both the dog and the child. Many dogs are even trained to track children who stray from home by following their scent.  Watch a mother talk about the importance of her autistic son's 4 Paws service dog » . Shirk says service dogs also give autistic children valuable emotional support. They're taught to intervene when a child is frustrated, reducing tantrums commonly known as ""meltdowns."" But Shirk believes one of the most important benefits is that the dogs are companions to kids who are often isolated. ""For our children with autism, their dog might be the only friend that they have.""  Watch Shirk explain the powerful impact service dogs can have on autistic children » . Shirk's 4 Paws for Ability requires that families raise $12,000, on average, to pay for their service dog. Each dog is trained for the child's specific needs, and the entire process takes between nine and 18 months. In the end, families come to Ohio to meet their dogs and receive training. For Shirk, seeing the kids bond with their dogs makes her efforts worthwhile.  Watch how Shirk partners service dogs with children with disabilities » .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- He's only 5½ years old, and yet he's practically memorized the entire New York subway grid. Gwenyth Jackaway started to wonder if Donor-X passed on a genetic component to her son, Dylan, who is autistic. He reads at the fourth-grade level, plays two-handed piano compositions and is better versed than most adults about the Fibonacci code, a complex mathematics sequence. Dylan loves Italian music and draws pictures that artist Jackson Pollock would be proud of. He also happens to be autistic. Gwenyth Jackaway, Dylan's mother, is a professor at New York's Fordham University. She's single but had always wanted to have a child. So she contacted California Cryobank, one of the largest sperm donor banks in the country. Cryobank doesn't reveal the identities of donors but allows people to choose based on the traits they'd like their child to have. Jackaway decided on ""Donor X"" because he appeared philosophical and intelligent on paper. He liked music, loved to travel and had a high IQ and a degree in economics. What she couldn't know then is that her son would have autism. So she started to wonder whether Donor X might carry a gene that could have contributed.  Dylan tells Randi Kaye how to take subway back to work » . The cause or causes of autism are not known and are hotly debated. Most experts believe that genetics are a component, making a child predisposed to autism or responsive to an environmental trigger. ""It's a combination of being genetically vulnerable and then having some kind of social or toxicant exposure that tips you over,"" according to Dr. Gary Goldstein of the Kennedy Krieger Institute. Researchers have found some genetic areas associated with autism, but it could take years before the gene or genes that cause autism or contribute to it will be determined. Until then, Geri Dawson, chief science officer for the Manhattan-based advocacy group Autism Speaks, says there's no way to screen for those genes and prevent them from being passed to a child. ""We wouldn't be able to screen a donor for autism because we don't yet know the specific genes that are contributing to autism,"" Dawson said. ""But there is a lot of research going on, and I would say in the next five to 10 years, we will have identified between five and 10 genes that we know raise the risk for autism."" Once the autism gene or genes have been identified, it would theoretically be possible to screen for those genes, according to Dawson. Jackaway says she went into a period of mourning when Dylan's autism was diagnosed at age 2. ""When you're handed a diagnosis of some sort of developmental disorder, you have to let go of the child you thought you were going to have,"" Jackaway said. ""There's a sense of loss of the child, a grieving process. There's denial, there's rage, and then there's the tremendous sadness, and hopefully you get to a place of accepting."" Jackaway says she had to accept that ""I don't have that child I thought I was going to have. But I have this child instead, who's right here in front of me."" Through a Web site called Donor Sibling Registry, she reached out to other women who used Donor X. She found six families who had used the same donor. Two years ago, she visited Theresa Pergola in the New York area; she had given birth to triplets using sperm from Donor X. Just minutes into their meeting, Jackaway noticed Pergola's son, Joseph, 2, exhibiting some of the same behavior as her son. ""He was walking on his toes; he was flapping his hands. There seemed to be eye contact issues,"" recalled Jackaway, who immediately suggested screening Joseph for autism. ""She told me that she saw characteristics of autism, and it was very upsetting to me at that time,"" Pergola said. ""I didn't know what to expect from that point on. I know I was scared, and she was there to let me know that it was going to be OK."" Pergola says she was afraid because she had an image of autism in her head and believed her son would be ""in the corner and rocking and not talking."" She says Jackaway reassured her that wouldn't be the case. One month later, a test confirmed what Pergola already knew: Joseph was autistic. The diagnosis brought her to tears, and now these two women whose sons share a father were immediately connected by another bond: autism. ""She was terribly upset,"" Jackaway remembered. ""That moment is a terribly frightening moment. You get handed a diagnosis, and you get handed an entirely new future."" In six families Jackaway contacted that had used Donor X, three of the children are autistic, and one is showing signs of autism. But would Jackaway be happier today if there had been a way to screen Donor X for an autism gene? ""I've done a lot of thinking about this, and to say yes to that is to say that I wish Dylan isn't Dylan,"" Jackaway said. ""I love my son and everything about him, and that means loving his autism also. Loving your children means loving everything about them. Our children don't have autism; they are autistic. It's part of who they are.""  There is currently no way to screen for autism, and in a statement, the company said in part: . ""There is no current genetic test to detect autism. California Cryobank (CCB) employs one of the most thorough and rigorous donor screening processes in the industry, with less than 1% of all applicants actually becoming donors. The standard CCB procedure for screening donors involves extensive physical, genetic and health screening ..."" Since the discovery of autism in some of the families that used Donor X, Cryobank had this to say about his samples: . ""... per CCB policy, the donor's samples were removed from the general catalog. These vials may only be sold to a client who has previously used specimens of this donor and is interested in ordering additional specimens. In this case the client is made aware of the new medical information and potential issues ..."" The families don't blame the sperm bank. In fact, Theresa Pergola says she's still uncertain about an autism screening process, if and when it ever becomes available. ""It can go either way, on the one hand it could be helpful so that people could make choices about what risks they want to take,"" says Pergola. ""On the other hand it's like, what else are they going to screen for, you know? Are they going to screen for certain personality traits? It's hard to say. It's really hard to say.""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The rallies are over, the students have been sent home and the people of Tehran braved searing heat and impenetrable traffic to select a new president Friday from a field of six candidates. Despite the assertion by some residents here that it doesn't matter who wins -- all of the candidates have been vetted by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and are likely to continue the anti-Western policies that have formed his world view since he came to power in 1989 -- a feeling of excitement has been notable here. Part of the sense of excitement may have nothing to do with politics -- instead, it could be because many residents began their weekend at noon Thursday. The bazaars visited by CNN were thronged with people. But that wouldn't explain the presence in recent days of thousands of people -- some of them lured by sweets handed out by organizers -- at rallies for the various candidates. Many of them expressed their views, including complaints, to CNN reporters as government security agents hovered nearby. What's at stake in Iran's presidential election? At a rally for Saeed Jalili, a hard-line candidate and the nation's chief nuclear negotiator, men and women attended in separate groups, the women's heads and bodies covered by the loose robe favored by some Muslims. ""Death to America! Death to Israel!"" chanted the crowd when Jalili spoke of a nuclear scientist who had been killed. But the sentiment appeared more political than personal. Afterward, approached by a reporter they recognized to be from the United States, many of the participants appeared welcoming and eager to talk. ""I don't have a problem with the people of the United States,"" said one person. ""But I have a problem with people who trample on our inalienable rights to nuclear power."" The unifying impact of Iran's nuclear program is hard to underestimate: a nuclear symbol appears on the ubiquitous 50,000 rial note, which is worth about $1.50, and many here say that it's their country's right to pursue a nuclear program. Report: Iran takes key step in nuclear reactor construction . Tehran says that program is intended solely for peaceful purposes; officials from the United States and some other Western nations say they suspect Iran is seeking to join the elite club of nations with nuclear arms and have imposed international sanctions to dissuade Tehran from doing so. State-run Press TV said 285 polling stations had been set up overseas for Iranians abroad. At the campaign headquarters for moderate candidate Hassan Rohani, his campaign manager told CNN that Rohani would be open to talking to the United States about such matters. ""I think he would do it,"" Mohammad-Reza Nematzadeh said as a number of supporters buzzed around him. ""But it doesn't mean right away."" Though thousands of fliers supporting various candidates littered rally sites on Wednesday, nearly all of the election signs had been taken down on Thursday -- in compliance with the law ordering an end to electioneering a day before the nation's 66,000 polling stations open. A few posters extolling the candidacy of the popular mayor of Tehran, Mohammad Ghalibaf, remained affixed to walls in the capital. ""I'm for him because the sanctions are hurting us so badly, and I know he can fix them,"" one person said, citing Ghalibaf's economic platform. At one rally, a group of conservative women said they did not like any of the candidates and would not vote. Another group, this one of self-described liberals, offered the same rationale for their plans to stay home. Though a few expressed concerns about speaking publicly to a reporter, others appeared eager to talk. The election is being covered by 430 reporters from 40 countries, 15% more than were here four years ago, according to Alireza Shirvani, head of the Foreign Reporters Bureau of Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. If no candidate wins more than half the votes, the top two will face each other in a runoff on June 21. In the 2009 election, massive anti-government demonstrations erupted in violence, followed by reports of dozens of deaths and claims of vote rigging in the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is barred from running for a third term. Efforts appear to have been made to minimize the possibility of a recurrence of violence. College students, who played a major role in the demonstrations four years ago, were sent home when colleges were closed early. Government officials said that that was done to give the students an early break for the summer. ""Foreign media reporters have expressed satisfaction with the government's cooperation and praised the Iranian people's desire to participate in the election,"" Press TV declared flatly on Thursday. Several people complained about the sanctions and the struggling economy. In fact, prices for nearly everything have doubled since last summer. Even the increase in the cost of watermelon, produced aplenty here, has outstripped inflation. By official figures, the inflation rate is 31%; observers say it's more than that. And many here grouse that their costs are rising faster than their salaries. Shrimp was $22 per pound at one store on Thursday. According to the CIA World Factbook, 15.5% of the nation is unemployed. Still, not everyone is tightening their belts. Luxury car dealerships remain open -- with vehicles shipped here from other countries in the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait.

"(CNN) -- On the same day peace delegates met at the United Nations in Switzerland on Monday to talk again about how they want calm to come to Syria, European Union nations agreed Monday to end an arms embargo against Syrian rebels, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague said. ""It was a difficult decision for some countries, but it was necessary and right to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria,"" he said in a written statement. The violence continued in the war-torn nation as bloody children were rushed into a dirty makeshift clinic in the Syrian city of Qusayr. Qusayr, near the border with Lebanon, is a strategic area where food, medicine and other supplies are hustled along routes used by government fighters and those trying to oust the government. CNN talked via Skype on Monday with a citizen journalist who described a desperate and horrid situation. The main hospital in Qusayr has been obliterated by fighting, the source said, not wishing to be named out of concern for security. The wounded are being crammed into homes. And, as one YouTube video shows, they apparently being treated at a makeshift clinic. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video. It's hard to watch. A boy wearing a purple shirt comes in screaming, his head bloody. The camera closes in on a baby. The child wails as people holding a steel instrument trying to dislodge something from the child's ear. The walls are smeared with blood. Catherine Ashton, EU High representative, announced the end of the embargo, reading a declaration from the organization's Foreign Affairs Council. Part of it states: ""With regard to the possible export of arms to Syria, the Council took note of the commitment by Member States to proceed in their national policies as follows: The sale, supply, transfer or export of military equipment or of equipment which might be used for internal repression will be for the Syrian National Coalition for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces and intended for the protection of civilians.""

Human Rights Council's three-week conference, said the situation has deteriorated to an ""intolerable affront to the human conscience,"" and the International Criminal Court must mete out justice to those who've violated the rights of Syrians. ""I feel utter dismay,"" she said. Read Navi Pillay's full remarks to the rights council . Pillay reminded listeners that the war in Syria began in March 2011 as a peaceful demonstration against President Bashar al-Assad and has devolved into a complicated bloodbath of sect battles and terrorist fighters. ""Whenever their governments cannot or will not protect them, frightened human beings are dependent on the international community for protection and assistance,"" she said. ""We cannot -- we must not -- continue to ignore their plea."" Amid the backdrop of the Geneva conference came word that Sen. John McCain was inside Syria on Monday and met with rebels, making him the highest ranking U.S. official to visit during the war. The senator's communications director, Brian Rogers, confirmed the trip. Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director for the Washington-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, said McCain met with 18 commanders of the Free Syrian Army about 1 kilometer from the border with Turkey in northern Syria. ""Their main message was that we are desperate for ammunition, we are desperate for weapons,"" Moustafa said. ""They are confident that if the weapons are given to the supreme military council, that it will not fall in the wrong hands."" McCain met with the commanders, which included the top leader of the rebel force, for about an hour. It's often difficult to discern exactly what is happening Syria because al-Assad has made it difficult if not deadly for foreign journalists to enter the nation. A state TV reporter, Yara Abbas, was killed in Qusayr on Monday, according to Syria state television. She died after ""terrorists targeted"" a state TV crew near al-Dabaa airport north of the strategic city near Lebanon, where rebels and government forces run supply routes. In Geneva, Pillay talked about Qusayr. ""I am extremely concerned at current reports suggesting that hundreds of civilians have been killed or injured, and thousands may remain trapped, by indiscriminate shelling and aerial attacks by government forces in Al Qusayr,"" Pillay said. Safe passage must be given to any civilians wishing to leave."" Outside reports indicate rebels continue to fight for the cause that began the unrest: ousting al-Assad and allowing Syrians greater freedom, something akin to the goals of the wider Arab Spring movement. Those who want al-Assad gone claim that the president has ordered his forces to slay families and indiscriminately shell neighborhoods across the country, which is about the size of Washington state. Al-Assad says his forces are trying to save the country from ""terrorists."" ""These war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot be allowed to go unpunished,"" Pillay told delegates from around the world. ""We must make it clear to both (the Assad government) and the armed opposition groups that there will be consequences for those responsible. And the world must take action to end this terrible conflict."" Pillay's remarks came as U.S. Secretary John Kerry met in Paris with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The two diplomats spoke briefly to reporters Monday before heading off to a private dinner with the French foreign minister. Kerry expressed concern about any possible use of chemical weapons and the need to determine what is happening on the ground, while Lavrov stressed the situation in Syria isn't getting any better and that he wants to do everything in his power to stop the bloodshed. For months during the Syrian war, Russia appeared to be supporting al-Assad. But that tide may be turning, at least gaining some wiggle room for the Russians to help broker an end to the violence. CNN's Security Clearance: Russia blasts Obama's recognition of rebels . U.S. officials want to start talks between the government and groups that want al-Assad gone. But not everyone involved in Syria wants to engage. The Syrian National Council, based in Istanbul, is part of the main opposition umbrella group and is considered to be composed of hardliners who've said they'll never talk or negotiate with anyone representing the Assad regime. The group was having meetings over the weekend in Istanbul to consider attending the Geneva conference. Syrian National Coalition spokesman Louay Safi said the group wants to hear ""more clarity about the purpose and the intentions of the Syrian regime. ""So far,"" he said, ""the signals have been not positive."" At the start of May, the U.N.'s point man on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, called Lavrov and Kerry's cooperation to forge a solution to the Syrian conflict ""the first hopeful news concerning that unhappy country in a very long time."" Lavrov told Foreign Policy recently that the United States and Russia have a lot in common. Asked about his ""famously contentious relationship"" with Bush administration Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Lavrov laughed. ""Well, I don't engage in comparing my partners,"" he said. ""John Kerry is a professional. He is pragmatic. And this is a very important quality for a diplomat and especially for a secretary of state. ""He has very good knowledge of things around the world. He has keen interest in moving some of the old problems out of the deadlock."" Lavrov also was asked about Kerry's criticism that Russia is still selling weapons to Syria. ""Well, you know on the arms sales, we never, we never tried to hide that we are implementing the contracts which have been signed quite some time ago, long before all this started,"" he answered, saying his country has provided Syria with defensive weapons. ""We have been consistent,"" he told Foreign Policy. ""We have been saying that for us priority No. 1 is to stop the bloodshed and to save lives, and therefore cessation of hostilities and dialogue without any preconditions is the best way to achieve this desired goal."" While diplomats talked, on Monday at least 35 people were killed in Syria, including two women and two children, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees in Syria.

"(CNN) -- Foxconn, the high-profile electronics company that builds Apple's iPhone and other products in China, is back in the headlines after workers rioted at its Taiyaun factory. Foxconn has attracted attention in the past for poor working conditions and a series of employee suicides. Fang Zhongyang, one of the factory workers, told Bloomberg Businessweek that ""The guards here use gangster style to manage. We are not against following rules, but you have to tell us why. They won't explain things, and we feel like we cannot communicate with them."" On Friday, a labor rights group reported that Foxconn workers had gone on strike over production demands for the iPhone 5; the company denied there was a strike. Although employees at Apple and Foxconn are treated very differently, the two companies are known for keeping their workers and others in the dark. Yet both are enormously successful, causing many people to question whether the popular management advice in favor of ""openness"" actually makes business sense. I was reminded of this when speaking at this year's TED Global conference. The conference's theme was radical openness, an idea I helped develop a number of years ago in a book I co-authored entitled ""The Naked Corporation."" My talk argued that openness has several meanings, and for each there is a corresponding principle. One meaning of openness refers to transparency, with a company making available pertinent information to stakeholders such as customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. I believe companies can often benefit from being more transparent with these groups. TED.com: The self-organizing computer course . Another meaning of openness applies to the sharing of intellectual assets. I believe a company can benefit by sharing some of its intellectual property given the right conditions. In the subsequent discussion on TED.com, some challenged my thesis by citing Apple. How could I explain the company's success, since it is known for the shroud of secrecy within which it operates? But when you look closely at Apple, a different picture emerges. Apple has become more open in a number of areas, and the pressures of the market forces I describe are forcing it to open up even further. Transparency . To begin, Apple is more transparent than one might think. Like all companies it has four major stakeholders: customers, employees, business partners and shareholders. Apple is obviously super-secretive with its customers about product announcements. And at the moment it can get away with this behavior because it so powerful in the niche markets in which it operates, and it has a small array of products. But as it tries to expand its share of the corporate market, business customers will demand to be well briefed regarding Apple's intentions and its product road maps. RIM is a good example of this. The struggling company is forced to share details about its upcoming Blackberry 10 platform. It hopes to release the product early next year, and it is trying feverishly to pump up the buzz around the software to encourage its customers to stay loyal and developers to make apps. And as Apple continues to lag well behind Android in market share, eventually it will be forced to be more open with consumers, as well. TED.com: The currency of the new economy is trust . Apple's customers aren't alone in being kept in the dark; the company treats its employees the same way. The vast majority of them have few details about what is in the company's product pipeline. But such opacity does not derive from some inherent benefits of closed work systems. Rather it is purely in aid of ensuring secrecy of its product strategy with customers. Apple doesn't want its workers leaking information to the media or blogosphere. But increasingly Apple pays a price for this employee secrecy. It doesn't get the serendipitous collaboration across company silos that many other businesses enjoy. That among other things could have prevented the premature release of defective mapping software on the iPhone 5. Think of Google and how its workers are encouraged to dream up new products. In terms of its supply chain, Apple itself has huge transparency and visibility. It can see down through Foxconn all the way to suppliers two levels below. True, this visibility had not extended to the rest of the world, but in this age of transparency Apple can no longer keep its supply chain practices secret. As a result, everyone knows about Foxconn's labor relations and how its factories are run under tight security and employees are treated and compensated poorly. This is an enormous problem for Apple, not just for its reputation, but also the disruptions such working conditions can cause in the supply chain. So as Apple becomes naked it is being forced to get buff -- to clean up its supply chain practices. (In March, a report on working conditions at Foxconn by auditors from the Fair Labor Association, a watchdog group hired by Apple, found serious violations of worker rights and salaries too low to cover living expenses. Foxconn promised to improve conditions, and Apple said ""We think empowering workers and helping them understand their rights is essential."") As for transparency with its shareholders, Apple is actually very open -- respected as being one of the best companies on the planet for providing shareholders with pertinent information. The only area in which it had been faulted is whether it had been sufficiently candid about Steve Job's declining health. Sharing . Paradoxically Apple's success is largely due to another kind of openness. The iPhone or iPad are nice pieces of hardware, but that's not what created their market success. But by opening up what are called ""application programming interfaces"" Apple has enabled its customers and the world of software developers to build apps on its platform. In this sense Apple's corporate borders are quite open and porous. It is a design and marketing company at the heart of an enormous business web of suppliers and software developers -- based on openness. TED.com: The future of business is ""the mesh"" To be sure, Apple is obsessed with guarding its intellectual property and has sought refuge in outmoded intellectual property laws and in courts that today stifle innovation in our economy. But increasingly this comes at a cost, too. Android, the open-source software platform developed by Google, quickly became the dominant operating system in the mobile marketplace. Open-source software stimulates creativity and attracts attention, and over time openness tends to win out in the market. Google was smart to release the Android software's inner workings so that manufacturers could tweak the operating system to their specific devices. Other companies have made equally smart moves. IBM gave away $400 million worth of software to the open-source Linux movement and in exchange received billions of dollars in savings and new business. Apple also has failed miserably in terms of sharing within society and the global community. It is sitting on $100 billion in cash but during the Jobs era made little effort to be a good corporate citizen and reach out to the larger community. It has long provided lower-cost computers to schools and universities, but purely as a marketing strategy, and otherwise has done little to help America's education system. It has been a philanthropic miser and has declined to take part in important social partnerships. TED.com: The new open-source economics . With Tim Cook now having been CEO for a year, Apple seems to be increasingly aware that in the long term, business cannot succeed in a world that's failing. It has started to make more donations and is joining social causes, which will prove popular with its customers, especially with young people who increasingly want to do business with companies that behave well. In fact, Apple should consider taking a large portion of its $100 billion and applying it to transforming some important institutions like education. Such a bold move would benefit everyone, including shareholders, and Apple could be positioned to dominate some important emerging markets. Apple became the world's most valuable company for a number of complex reasons, including the design genius of its brilliant founder. But when you look under the surface, it is more open than you might think, and there is no real evidence that its secrecy has helped it succeed. And increasingly as it comes under more intense competitive pressures, Apple will need to become an even more open company. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Don Tapscott.","Don Tapscott: Apple seems like an exception to idea that openness helps companies .
He says Apple is more open than many people realize, and it is becoming more transparent .

"(CNN) -- Typhoon Haikui slammed into the east coast of China on Wednesday morning, pummeling the area around the business metropolis of Shanghai with heavy wind and rain. The storm's winds were at ""severe typhoon"" strength when it made landfall in the province of Zhejiang, about 225 kilometers (140 miles) south of Shanghai, the China Meteorological Administration said. The winds diminished to typhoon strength as Haikui moved inland. A severe typhoon is considered to have maximum sustained wind speed of between 150 and 184 kilometers per hour (93 and 114 mph). A typhoon has maximum sustained winds of between 118 and 149 kilometers per hour (73 and 93 mph). Think it's hot? Imagine living here . Hundreds of thousands of people had been evacuated from Haikui's path as it approached, the third tropical cyclone to hit China's east coast in less than a week. Chinese officials had relocated 374,000 people from Shanghai and 250,000 from Zhejiang, according to the state-run newspaper China Daily. Although the storm's winds are expected to weaken as it moves overland, it will continue to dump large amounts of rain on the surrounding area, raising the risk of landslides and flooding. What's behind Asia floods? ""The rain is the bigger impact going forward,"" said CNNI Meteorologist Taylor Ward. ""We have already had up to 8 inches in some locations."" Ward said another 6 to 10 inches of rain were expected to fall, with ""maybe isolated amounts greater."" Haikui was moving northwest at 20 kph (12 mph) but was expected to slow over the coming two days, he said. More rains worsen Philippines floods .

"(CNN) -- The government of Alberta, Canada, will provide $1 billion in funding for recovery and reconstruction after the province's devastating floods, Premier Alison Redford said Monday. ""We are going to do -- please listen to my words -- whatever it takes to get everyone back to a place where they can continue to live their lives,"" Redford said. More than 100,000 Albertans have been affected by the floods, which began last week after heavy mountain rains swelled rivers flowing to the east. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated in Calgary, Medicine Hat and elsewhere, along with the entire town of High River, where three people died in the floods. Another Canadian city braces for flooding, evacuates 10,000 . ""Yesterday, I saw families in Calgary emptying their entire basements out; wet furniture was strewn across front lawns,"" Redford said in a statement. ""And at the evacuation site in Nanton, I met families who feel they've lost everything and don't know when they'll get home to High River."" The $1 billion will be used to help rebuilding efforts and support displaced families. They will receive pre-loaded debit cards of $1,250 per adult and $500 per child to help with housing needs and day-to-day purchases, Redford said. Waters have been receding in some parts of the province while others are now dealing with flooding. Some 65,000 residents in Calgary got the all-clear to return home. Downtown Calgary, where the Bow and Elbow Rivers converge, was especially hard-hit, but power was restored to a large portion of it, and the city expected to reopen nearly all of downtown by Tuesday, Mayor Naheed Nenshi said. In Alberta, misery rises along with floodwaters . In High River, about 40 miles south of Calgary, the flooding has now stopped, but some water is simply not receding, said Constable Janice Schoepp of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. That makes it difficult to assess the extent of the damage in High River, though it's safe to say the town is in a ""critical situation"" with extensive damage, said Katrina Bluetchen, a spokeswoman for the Alberta government. The South Saskatchewan River flowing through Medicine Hat, in southeastern Alberta, crested Monday but was still overflowing its banks, Schoepp said. Medicine Hat was able to stave off some damage because it saw the extent of flooding to the west days before it reached the city and was able to prepare, she said. ""I think it made a big difference,"" Schoepp said. The city said Monday it is starting to return residents to their homes. New flooding was occurring Monday in Drumheller, known as the dinosaur capital of the world for the dinosaur bones and fossils found there, and at the Siksika Indian reserve, east of Calgary, Schoepp said.","NEW: Power is restored to much of downtown Calgary .

"(CNN) -- An Argentine court has sentenced former President Carlos Menem to seven years in prison for his role in illegally smuggling weapons to Ecuador and Croatia. An appeals court found Menem guilty of aggravated smuggling earlier this year. Menem, 82, is serving as a senator and has immunity from going to prison, but lawmakers could vote to strip him of that protection. On Thursday, the court also sentenced former Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion to 5Â½ years in prison. Menem was Argentina's president from 1989 to 1999. He has maintained his innocence. The case against him and other government officials began in October 2008. Hundreds of witnesses testified, according to judicial officials. In 2011, a court absolved him of charges that he violated international weapons embargoes, but prosecutors won an appeal earlier this year. Prosecutors alleged that Menem authorized the illegal sales of weapons to Ecuador and Croatia between 1991 and 1995. Both Ecuador and Croatia were involved in armed conflicts at the time, and prosecutors said the weapons sales violated United Nations and Organization of American States embargoes. In 2011, Menem told judges at a Buenos Aires court that his actions as president were ""limited to signing decrees exporting weapons to Venezuela and Panama."" ""From there, all the proceedings that were carried out were out of control of the president,"" he said. Journalist Ivan Perez Sarmenti contributed to this report from Buenos Aires.","Carlos Menem, 82, is sentenced to seven years for arms smuggling .

"(CNN) -- German company GoalControl GmbH has won the race to be the first provider of goal-line technology (GLT) to the FIFA World Cup -- for now. The system will be rolled out for June's Confederations Cup in Brazil, which serves as a warm up event for the 2014 tournament. Should the system perform adequately, GoalControl GmbH will be the official GLT provider when the World Cup heads to Brazil for the second time next year. The technology, which uses 14 high-speed cameras (7 per goal) around the stadium, beat off competition from three other providers. This came even though GoalControl was the last of the four to receive a FIFA license, only doing so last month. ""While all four companies had previously met the stringent technical requirements of the FIFA Quality Program,"" said football's world governing body in a statement, ""the final decision was based on criteria relating more specifically to the tournaments in Brazil, including the company's ability to adapt to local conditions and the compatibility of each GLT system in relation to FIFA match operations."" ""The respective bids were also judged on cost and project management factors such as staffing and time schedules for installation. The use of GoalControl-4D in Brazil is subject to a final installation test at each stadium."" Following a tender process that began in February and involved presentations to FIFA as well as visits to some of Brazil's leading stadiums, the companies that missed out were CAIROS, GoalRef and Hawk-Eye. While both CAIROS and GoalRef use magnetic fields around the goal and need to insert a chip in the ball, Hawk-Eye and GoalControl use a 3D imaging system to determine the precise location of the ball. The successful bidder, GoalControl, believes that one of its strengths is the fact that neither the ball nor goal structure need to be changed for the system to work -- with referees receiving a vibration and optical signal in their watches to inform them of a successful score. Nonetheless, it will still cost an estimated US$260,000 to install the system into a stadium while the running costs are considerably lower -- at just under US$4,000 per game. GoalControl's high-speed cameras are located high in the stadium and, according to the company's website, are ""connected to a powerful image processing computer system which tracks the movement of all objects on the pitch and filters out the players, referees and all disturbing objects. ""The remaining object is the ball and the system knows its three dimensional position with a precision of a few millimeters in the coordinate system of the pitch."" The British company Hawk-Eye aside, the three other companies bidding for the FIFA tender were all German. Coincidentally, it was a World Cup match between Germany and England, at the 2010 finals in South Africa, that prompted a FIFA rethink on GLT. FIFA president Sepp Blatter had long denied the need for such technology but he changed his mind after seeing Englishman Frank Lampard have a goal ruled out in a 4-1 loss even though the ball had clearly crossed the line. The theory is that such human refereeing error will be eradicated following the implementation of GLT, which was first used at December's Club World Cup in Japan. However, the system was never put to the test during a competition won by Corinthians of Brazil since all the goals that were scored clearly crossed the line. Before every game, match officials will conduct tests to determine that the GLT system is working correctly -- with FIFA hoping to showcase GoalControl's technology prior to this year's Confederations Cup. While FIFA are embracing GLT, European football body UEFA are steadfastly refusing to use the new technology -- with president Michel Platini saying it is too expensive. The Frenchman says he would prefer the cost of installing the system in Europe's leading stadiums, which he says will cost some US$70m, to be spent on youth football. Meanwhile, Pierluigi Collina, the former Italian referee who now serves on UEFA's Referees Committee, has previously expressed his belief that no GLT system can ever be perfect. ""I'm not sure that technology can be 100% perfect -- for example, my mobile phone and my computer sometimes don't work,"" he told CNN. ""I would have been happy to have had two more sets of eyes in the penalty area,"" added Collina, effectively registering support for UEFA's system of using extra officials behind the goal-line.","Camera-based GoalControl GmbH win tender to provide goal-line technology for FIFA .

"(CNN) -- The second edition of an online al Qaeda magazine has surfaced with frank essays, creatively designed imagery and ominous terror tips such as using a pickup truck as a weapon and shooting up a crowded restaurant in Washington. The magazine is called ""Inspire"" and intelligence officials believe that an American citizen named Samir Khan, now living in Yemen, is the driving force behind the publication. The latest edition was emerged on the 10th anniversary of the suicide attack on the guided missile destroyer USS Cole -- struck as it refueled in Aden, Yemen. The first edition came out in July. Christopher Boucek, a Yemen expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the timing is no coincidence. ""It also comes on the heels of a busy week for al Qaeda in Yemen. They released an hourlong video last week. There was also an attack on a British Convoy in Sanaa [Yemen's capital] last week. And an audiotape was released two days ago.  Al Qaeda in Yemen is good at amplifying its message and that shows the organization is still active, that they're still able to function,"" he said. An article titled ""The Ultimate Mowing Machine"" calls for using a pickup truck as a ""mowing machine, not to mow grass but mow down the enemies of Allah."" The article says that such a plan could be implemented in countries where people back the ""Israeli occupation of Palestine, the American invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq or countries that had a prominent role in the defamation of Muhammad."" It said a four-wheel-drive pickup truck is needed -- ""the stronger the better."" ""To achieve maximum carnage, you need to pick up as much speed as you can while still retaining good control of your vehicle in order to maximize your inertia and be able to strike as many people as possible in your first run,"" the article says. Another tip in the magazine includes the use of firearms. ""For this choose the best location. A random hit at a crowded restaurant in Washington DC at lunch hour, for example, might end up knocking out a few government employees. ""Targeting such employees is paramount and the location would also give the operation additional media attention."" An idea in the first edition, ""Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,"" is touched on again. ""The pressurized cooker should be placed in crowded areas and left to blow up. More than one of these could be planted to explode at the same time. However, keep in mind that the range of the shrapnel in this operation is short range so the pressurized cooker or pipe should be placed close to the intended targets and should not be concealed from them by barriers such as walls."" Adam Raisman, senior analyst at SITE Intelligence Group, said the ""very well-presented magazine"" covers a variety of topics, is meant to reach a wider audience, and tries to be tongue-in-cheek in its presentation. ""The magazine has suggestions, ideology it attempts to instill in the reader, and it includes tips for technology,"" Raisman said. Boucek said the ""big takeaway"" is that the magazine is focusing on what the individual can do. ""The message to the lone actor is to be patient -- that you can do it -- you can participate in this,"" he said. There are writings in the magazine by Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who U.S. authorities have linked to the failed attempt to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner in December. Samir Khan wrote an article titled ""I Am Proud to be a Traitor to America."" There is also recycled material. The latest issue includes recent commentary from Adam Yahiye Gadahn, who is an American, about President Barack Obama.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods returns to golf on Thursday insisting he is ready to win and has no regrets over firing his long-time caddie Steve Williams. The former world number one has been out of action since May with a knee injury but is preparing to make his long-awaited comeback at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational on Thursday. He will do so without Williams, who was on his bag for 13 of his 14 major wins. Instead, friend Bryon Bell will be on caddie duty until Woods can find a full time replacement for the New Zealander, who reacted to the split by claiming he had ""wasted two years of my life"" while Woods was engulfed in a sex scandal and battled to find his best form. ""That's what he says and what he feels,"" Woods told a press conference. ""I felt it was time for a change. I felt that Stevie and I have had an amazing run -- Stevie's an amazing caddie. ""He's helped my career, and I think I've helped his as well. We won a bunch of tournaments, but I just felt like it was time to change things up a little bit. ""I feel comfortable with the move and I've got Bryon on the bag this week. Bryon and I go way back -- we're very comfortable on the course together. I don't have a permanent caddie, but we'll see going forward."" Woods said he had informed Williams of his decision during a ""man-to-man"" conversation after the AT&T National tournament in early July. The 35-year-old said his new caddie would have to be someone who could handle the spotlight and revealed his vacancy had attracted plenty of applications -- not all of them desirable. ""Caddies out here [on tour] -- a few have applied. People who are not caddies out here -- a ton,"" Woods joked. ""We've had a lot of ... interesting ones. ""[I'll be looking for] Someone that understands the game and can handle the pressure, of coming down the stretch on the back nine on Sunday. Someone who has been there before, can understand it and deal with that."" Woods claims the work he has put in with coach Sean Foley is starting to benefit his game as he prepares to swing his first club in anger since pulling out of the Players Championship on May 12. He added: ""I have been hitting more solid than I have in the past. Some of the things I'm working with Sean are starting to make sense. I can see what he's trying to get me to do. ""I've had some good practice sessions of late and just need to tee it up and do it on Thursday. I'm here to try and win a golf tournament.

"(CNN) -- The chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court says he has evidence to prove Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir is guilty of genocide, even though he is not charged with the crime. Omar al-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since warrant was issued. Luis Moreno-Ocampo spoke to CNN on Wednesday, two days after he appealed to the court to add genocide to the existing arrest warrant for al-Bashir. The court issued the warrant in March on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to his five-year campaign of violence in western Sudan's Darfur region. ""The evidence shows it is genocide,"" Moreno-Ocampo said. The warrant was the first one ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands. It includes five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape. It also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. Al-Bashir remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued, even though any country that is party to the ICC has an obligation to hand him over to The Hague, the court says. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. In his appeal to the court Monday, Moreno-Ocampo complained that the judges' standard for adding the genocide charge to the warrant is too high. The judges want him to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that al-Bashir committed genocide, but that level of proof is not required for a warrant, which only requires a reasonable inference of guilt, he said. ""They are requesting a level of evidence that is the level of evidence required at the trial stage, not at the beginning of the process,"" Moreno-Ocampo said. Part of the reason that prosecutors cannot provide more evidence at this stage is because al-Bashir is attacking witnesses who are willing to provide information to prosecutors, Moreno-Ocampo said. Presenting more evidence could endanger the victims, he said. ""It's a legal issue,"" he said. ""The judgment by itself is very important, but in addition I cannot accept this wrong legal standard."" The judges believe the crimes that Moreno-Ocampo classifies as genocide instead fall under the category of crimes against humanity, he said. Even if Moreno-Ocampo were successful in adding genocide to the warrant, he would still face a difficult task in proving the charges at trial, said Mark Ellis, the executive director of the International Bar Association. ""Genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet (than war crimes and crimes against humanity) because you have to show in proving genocide that there was an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race,"" Ellis told CNN. ""Obviously the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial."" But if Moreno-Ocampo loses the appeal, Ellis said, it would not minimize the seriousness of the case. ""The charges that have been (alleged) on war crimes and crimes against humanity are still very serious charges and they are egregious acts,"" he said. A ruling on the appeal is likely within six months, Moreno-Ocampo told CNN.","Luis Moreno-Ocampo calls for genocide to be added to al-Bashir's charges .

"SINGAPORE (CNN) -- Director of Arup, Peter Head is leading the company's new department of Planning and Integrated Urbanism. 'Eco cities are about smart responsive simplicity, taking away the layers of complexity.' Taking a primary role in the development of the eco cities being built in China, he told his fellow panelists and the audience at the second Principal Voices debate how he believed the design world was moving into a new paradigm. He said that more long-term strategic thinking was needed in urban development and believes that when creating new cities, cultural roots are as important as the technology and innovation behind them. Below are some of his key quotes from the debate. On moving into a new paradigm of design . ""I'm learning more and more everyday, because my team is learning more everyday, we're interacting like we are today, so this is a really fast developing system of all components. Everywhere I go in the world, we're having these same conversations, so I think this is a global movement that is racing ahead."" ""I think what we're finding and what other people are finding really hard is connecting the products and the buildings and the individual components with the high level policy and strategy. I think that's the area where we are in a bit of a leadership position."" ""I think there's a tremendous confusion as to what the real objectives are; and this is the great problem. Every place has its own objectives and we have the global objectives too, so design has to be really relevant to the history and culture and authenticity of the place while addressing global issues."" On China and developing countries . ""Everything in China at the moment is happening four or five times quicker than most other countries, therefore the scale, speed of implementation and learning that goes on is quicker. Young people in China will learn in five years what their counterparts in Europe and the U.S. will learn in 25 years, so from all points of view China is really important."" ""In developing countries it's absolutely critical that land use planning and sophisticated thinking is put into place and that takes account of low carbon and the ecological paradigm, so it's locked into the framework of the planning. And that's a really big challenge, but it has to happen quickly because otherwise we're not going to solve the problem. We cannot do it piece-meal at a lower level."" On design and nature . ""Arup is using the biomimicry principals in a lot of our work, and all of our eco city design work is using biomimicry to look at what is essentially a transition from an industrial model to an ecological model of civilization. If we look at the 10 principals of bio mimicry, gathering and using energy efficiently etc, we [designers] currently don't do any of them."" On eco cities . ""When you're designing a new place you have to reach deep into the cultural roots of the place. If you bring that through with the community you can maintain that attachment people feel to a city."" ""Communication systems and governance are really important; the way eco cities are governed will be different, and I think it will be linked to responsive feedback loops, more like the Facebook type world that we're moving into that governance will somehow embody these ideas."" ""I don't want people to think these are expensive beasts; they're not. We're talking about 'smart responsive simplicity', taking away the layers of complexity, not having many roads, more walking and cycling; things that are not expensive build or maintain either. I'm very optimistic about this. I think we're talking about a paradigm which is really attractive for investors.""","Second Principal Voices debate took place in Singapore on July 9 .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Earlier this week, the case of Hiroki Ando, the Japanese 11-year-old boy who was denied a heart transplant in Japan, highlighted the vast cultural divide in attitudes towards organ transplant and availability worldwide. Hiroki plays catch at the Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital. Hiroki had to travel to the U.S., where he is awaiting a heart, because Japan prohibits organ transplants involving children. His story highlights the wide range of policies around the world regarding organ donation.  Watch Hiroki's trip to the U.S. » . Organ donation has saved and improved countless lives. But medical advancements have led to a rise in demand for organs that is outpacing donation rates. Some countries, particularly Spain, have succeeded in raising the number of organ donors, but there is still much room for improvement, according to Leo Roels, managing director of the Donor Action Foundation. ""What we see in our experience in so many countries is that there is still a lot of potential when it comes to identifying donors,"" he told CNN. The Donor Action Foundation is a non-profit group that helps hospitals implement programs designed to improve their donation rates. It's active in 17 countries worldwide. Looking at deceased donors per million population -- a commonly used benchmark -- rates vary widely around the world. Spain leads internationally with 34 deceased donors per million population, according to figures from the International Registry of Organ Donation and Transplantation. Australia, on the other hand, noticeably lags countries with comparable health care systems with just 12 deceased donors per million population. Would you be willing to donate your organs when you die? Why or why not? Tell us in the SoundOff box below . A variety of factors impact organ donation rates, from the legal environment to training to cultural obstacles, experts said. In Japan, the law prevents children from donating organs, but there is also an overall reluctance to donate organs that is rooted in Shinto and Buddhist attitudes towards death. Japan didn't legalize organ transplants from brain-dead donors until 1997, according to the Japan Organ Transplant Network, a non-governmental group. Although, the government is currently looking at changes to the law that could pave the way for more transplants. ""Even among medical professionals, the support for the concept of brain death in Japan is significantly lower than in European countries,"" Roels said. Even in the U.S., which is one of the leading countries for organ donations, there are still some cultural obstacles and religious concerns about what constitutes death. It's a mixed picture for donor rates in the U.S., according to Joel Newman of the United Network for Organ Sharing, which runs the country's only organ transplant network. Deceased donor rates are well above levels from the late 1990s and early 2000s, but they have hit a plateau. ""People in their own lifetime, even if they have positive feelings about organ donation, don't make a commitment,"" he said. ""They don't fill out donor cards or have a conversation with their family."" Countries like Spain, Belgium and Norway have passed ""presumed consent"" laws where individuals are automatically considered an organ donor unless they opt out. While these laws have helped improve rates of organ donation, success in countries like world leader Spain has largely been attributed to the organizational measures it has implemented. Spain established a nationwide transplant co-ordination network in 1989 to help doctors and transplant coordinators to identify potential donors. The so-called Spanish Model has achieved results such that its organizational measures have been recommended by the World Health Organization. The UK is one country emulating aspects of the Spanish system. It's in the process of overhauling its transplant network in a bid to improve its effectiveness. The percentage of potential donors who actually donate organs -- a measure of the efficiency of a transplant network -- is around 50 percent in the UK, according to Chris Rudge, the UK's national clinical director for transplantation. By comparison, the Spanish system has a so-called conversion rate of 80 percent to 85 percent and the U.S. is targeting around 75 percent, he said. ""What we're trying to do in this country is change the attitude toward organ donation. At the moment it's unusual, and we want to make it usual,"" Rudge told CNN. In the aims of getting more families to give consent, the UK is more than doubling the number of transplant coordinators in its hospitals to 250. Hospitals in the UK are required to obtain consent for organ donation from individuals or families. These coordinators, who will receive specialized training to work with families and handle ethical issues, will team up with senior doctors in intensive care units of hospitals to identify potential donors. The framework for the collaborative program should be in place by April of next year. The presence of transplant coordinators is important, but it's just one of many measures that need to be taken in order to get a grip on the organ shortfall problem, Roels noted. ""There is a need to combine factors like training, education and better identification. It's a combination of these factors that will improve donor rates further,"" he said.","Transplant patients worldwide face shortfall of organs .

"(CNN) -- A former justice of the peace and his wife have been indicted on charges of capital murder in the killings of two Texas prosecutors and the wife of one, authorities announced Thursday. The Kaufman County Grand Jury presented the indictments charging Eric Lyle Williams and his wife, Kim Lene Williams, in the deaths of Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, District Attorney Michael McLelland and Cynthia McLelland, the current district attorney, Erleigh Norville Wiley, said in a statement. Hasse was killed in January on his way to work at the courthouse; McLelland and his wife were fatally shot two months later at their home near Forney. ""The murder of a public official, such as a judge a prosecutor or a law enforcement officer, is an assault on all the people of the state, because it's an attack of the rule of law,"" Kirby Dendy, chief of the Texas Rangers, said in April. Deaths may have stemmed from ex-employee's grudge . Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes previously said the killings stemmed from Eric Williams' ""past legal problems with the criminal justice system of this county"" -- a 2012 conviction on burglary and theft charges that led to his removal from office. His wife has confessed to involvement in the murders and implicated her husband as the trigger man, according to court papers. Byrnes said Eric Williams fired the fatal shots in both slayings. In Hasse's death, Kim Williams was the getaway driver; in the McLellands' killings, she was a passenger, ""and Eric did the killing,"" he said. ""We do not believe there were any other major actors in this case,"" Byrnes has said. Hasse and Michael McLelland both believed that Eric Williams blamed them for his removal from office, a sheriff's sergeant noted in Kim Williams' arrest paperwork. The prosecutors carried handguns for their protection after the Williams trial ""because they believed Eric Williams to be a threat to their personal safety."" Williams threatened police probing slayings . Eric Williams also was indicted for allegedly making a terroristic threat. He was arrested in April after a sheriff's affidavit accused him of using his home computer to threaten police investigating the McLellands' killings. Jack Stoffregen, chief public defender for the Lubbock-based office for the Regional Public Defender for Capital Cases, did not immediately return a call Thursday seeking comment. His office represents Eric Williams. CNN was unable to reach Kim Lene Williams' attorney. Eric Williams' public defender released a statement in April saying that he ""has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice.""","Eric Lyle Williams and his wife Kim Lene Williams are charged with capital murder .

"(CNN) -- A-list celebrities and big pay packets are overflowing in the Paris Saint-Germain dressing room, but you won't find Zlatan Ibrahimovic complaining. In fact he is absolutely delighted that David Beckham has joined him at PSG. Was it because of Beckham's ability to hit pinpoint crosses and corner kicks? That helps. But mostly Beckham's arrival in the French capital has meant the paparazzi are leaving Ibrahimovic in peace. The 31-year-old Swede was sold to PSG from AC Milan as part of a summer clear-out by the Italian club while Beckham, one of the most recognized people in the world, signed with the French club on a free transfer in January. ""I think it's good for me that Beckham came so he gets more attention than me, so they leave me a little bit alone,"" Ibrahimovic told CNN. ""Since I came here, everybody said don't worry, as a football player you can walk in the city and nobody will disturb you because as a football player it is not like it is in Italy. ""But since the day I came here it's been totally stressful. Everybody is chasing me with their scooters. I don't even walk in the streets. ""So when David came he got more of the media (attention). That's good because he takes care of that and I can play football and focus on football."" When PSG signed Beckham, many said the move was simply an exercise in public relations meant to bolster the profile of the team, which is backed by wealthy Qatari owners -- the Qatar Investment Authority. But Beckham has been frequently used by PSG coach Carlo Ancelotti, though the Englishman was criticized by the French press for his performance against Barcelona -- one of Ibrahimovic's former teams -- in the Champions League quarterfinals last week when the sides played to a 2-2 first-leg tie in Paris. A surprise starter, Beckham was substituted with 20 minutes remaining. Experience . However Ibrahimovic believes that the former England captain's experience will help PSG as it seeks to upset Barcelona and also claim the French league title for the first time since 1994. ""I think he has been very important for us,"" Ibrahimovic said. ""The club has been changing from a normal club to a top club and Beckham gives you some kind of confidence. ""He has a quality, big quality. He has a touch that I haven't seen many players have. And he is very elegant when he plays."" Despite the criticism leveled at Beckham, Ancelotti has said he would once again start the midfielder in Wednesday's second leg. If the game at the Camp Nou is as dramatic as the first leg at the Parc des Princest, fans should expect a memorable evening. After Lionel Messi gave Barca a first-half lead, Ibrahimovic drew PSG level from an offside position in the 79th minute before Xavi restored the visitors' one-goal advantage with an 89th minute penalty. But instead of the visitor walking away with a 2-1 victory, Blaise Matuidi boosted PSG's second-leg prospects with a deflected effort four minutes into injury time. Another boost for PSG would come if Messi doesn't play Wednesday, and he is a doubt after sustaining a hamstring injury in the first leg. After the first leg, Barcelona lodged an official complaint to UEFA, angered about the standard of refereeing. Besides Ibrahimovic's offside goal, the Catalans were upset that German referee Wolfgang Stark allowed play to continue when Javier Mascherano and Jordi Alba collided in the second half, leaving both Barcelona defenders prone on the ground. Bayern Munich will be favored to advance against Juventus in Wednesday's other quarterfinal second leg, holding a 2-0 advantage. Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund progressed Tuesday to reach the semifinals.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic says less people chase him now that David Beckham is around .

"(CNN) -- The thought came to Don Walker during that most quintessential of American outings -- a baseball game. Caught in a crush of people on his way into Atlanta's Turner Field, he couldn't help but think about what had just happened in Boston -- sports fans crowded into a small space, a bomb tucked into a backpack, and then death. Not that it stopped the Morgantown, West Virginia, man from enjoying his Atlanta vacation. ""You just watch things more closely,"" he said. Americans are doing a lot of that these days, especially after Monday's attack on the Boston Marathon, where three people died and more than 180 were wounded when a pair of bombs exploded near the finish line: . â€¢ A palpable sense of fear and confusion played out in the nation's capital, at a Senate office in Michigan and on television screens across the country as authorities scrambled to deal with a spate of suspicious package reports. The first floor of Washington's Hart Senate Office Building was evacuated at one point. Among the concerns were letters that initial tests suggested contained ricin, eerily echoing fears raised by letters containing anthrax mailed to lawmakers after the 9/11 attacks. Capitol HIll Police Chief Terry Gainer acknowledged ""a bit of anxiety"" in a letter to senators. ""The bottom line of this multifaceted event was a positive one,"" Gainer wrote. ""The packages were not dangerous; they contained nothing hazardous; and the person of interest was, while interesting, not particularly harmful although terribly disruptive. He was admonished but released."" Gainer added, ""This is the price of an open campus. The suspect in the ricin case, Paul Kevin Curtis, was arrested at his home in Corinth, Mississippi, on Wednesday. He has been charged with making threats against the president and sending threatening letters, the Justice Department said Thursday. Terrorists make us lose sight of the real dangers . â€¢ In Oklahoma City, an unattended rental truck set off momentary panic Wednesday before police sounded the all-clear. The incident happened nearly 18 years ago to the day after Timothy McVeigh set off a devastating bomb outside a government building there, killing 168 people. â€¢ And then there's New York, where nervous residents of that normally steely city made nearly four times as many suspicious package calls the day after the Boston bombings than they did in a typical day the year before, New York police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Tuesday. Vigilance is what authorities call it. ""Always looking for a way out"" is what Linda Simmons of Douglasville, Georgia, calls it. But it's not just Boston that's put her in that mindset. It's the September 11 terror attacks. The bloodbath last year at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. The Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings. ""All of it, everything that's happened,"" she said. The reaction is understandable, said Michelle Majewski, a professor at Marian University in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. The kind of mayhem unleashed Monday in Boston reminds us, she says, of things about which we'd rather not think. ""That we're all vulnerable,"" she said. That vulnerability is something police recognize all too well. Law enforcement stepped up security across the country in response to the Boston bombings. Hundreds of National Guard troops remained on duty in Boston on Wednesday, backing up police. As did many other cities, perennial terror target New York ramped up its security measures and will keep them in place, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday, ""until we learn more about what actually happened in Boston."" In London, authorities vowed to take another look at precautions for the big marathon scheduled there this weekend. But security experts will tell you it's just not possible to prevent every bomb, every gunshot, every tragedy -- especially not when it comes to large outdoor events, such as road races. The impact of heightened security on travelers . ""It's extremely challenging because it's not a secure environment,"" said police Cmdr. Noah Johnson of Tempe, Arizona, where an annual charity run in honor of slain Army Ranger Pat Tillman is scheduled for Saturday. ""We can't put fences around it; we can't put an officer every 2 feet,"" he said. ""So we rely on every set of eyes out there."" So, as it often does in a free society, it comes down to us, to that word, to vigilance. ""Remain vigilant. You have to,"" said Mike Brooks, a law enforcement analyst for In Session and HLN and a former detective in the intelligence division for the Washington Metropolitan Police Department. But security experts worry that down the road, many Americans may weary of maintaining such a high level of cautiousness. ""We as a country tend to lull ourselves into a false sense of security over the passage of time,"" said Andy Lamprey, vice president of the security firm Andrews International and a former Los Angeles Police Department senior SWAT supervisor. The interest in the Boston terrorism case ""will last for a few days and perhaps a week, and then it will become a distant memory for most people,"" he said. It happened after the September 11 attacks. A month after them, nearly six in 10 Americans were worried that they or someone they loved would become a victim of a terrorist attack, according to a Gallup Poll at the time. By 2011, the number had fallen to a little over one in three -- nearly what it was at its lowest point before the 2001 attacks. ""It's the old story about crying wolf and eventually people turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to it. They get weary of hearing it,"" Lamprey said. ""It's very difficult to remain at that heightened state of awareness. You can't do it all the time."" In Oshkosh, Wisconsin, runners will head out this weekend for a half-marathon. Sure, race director Gloria West told CNN affiliate WBAY-TV, they'll think about security just that much more. Boston will be on their minds. But they won't be deterred, she told the station. ""We want to send a message,"" she said. ""We can't all go home and stay in our houses.""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Troubled relations between North and South Korea suffered a fresh blow Friday after Seoul decided to withdraw all its remaining citizens from the manufacturing zone jointly operated by the two. The televised announcement by South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae followed North Korea's dismissal of a request for talks about the deteriorating situation at Kaesong Industrial Complex. Pyongyang halted activity at the complex this month amid heightened tensions in the region. The South Koreans' imminent departure bodes ill for the future of the zone, the last major symbol of cooperation between the two countries. It had continued to operate throughout previous inter-Korean tensions during the past eight years. In the past two months, tensions on the Korean Peninsula has been rich in saber-rattling and short on concrete actions. But the Kaesong complex, which is on the North's side of the border and houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies, appears to have become a significant victim. Growing suffering . Ryoo said the decision to withdraw the roughly 175 South Koreans was a result of their ""growing suffering caused by the unjust actions of the North,"" which has been preventing workers, as well as food and medical supplies, from crossing the border into the zone for the past several weeks. In an apparent last ditch attempt to resolve the crisis Thursday, South Korea proposed formal talks with the North, warning of serious consequences if the offer was rejected. 'Deceptive' offer rejected . But the North spurned the proposal. In a statement on state media Friday, a spokesman for the North Korean National Defense Commission described Seoul's offer of talks about the complex as ""deceptive."" It said that if Seoul ""keeps aggravating the situation,"" it would ""be forced to take the final decisive and crucial measure first."" The South Koreans who remain in the complex are believed to have been looking after the idle factories there. Ryoo said Friday that the South Korean government would support the companies invested in the complex so they can continue with their business activities. Suspending activity . Earlier this month, during a frenzy of fiery rhetoric directed at South Korea and the United States, the North began blocking South Koreans from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border. It then pulled out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone's factories, saying it was temporarily suspending activity there. The move surprised some observers since Kaesong was considered to be a key source of hard currency for the regime of Kim Jong Un. The situation on the Korean Peninsula deteriorated after the North carried out its latest underground nuclear test in February, prompting the U.N. Security Council to tighten sanctions on the regime in Pyongyang. The tougher sanctions, together with joint U.S.-South Korean military training exercises in South Korea, intensified North Korea's threats against Washington and Seoul. The North's ominous language, which unnerved the United States enough for it to move missile-defense systems into the region, had appeared to calm somewhat recently. And the U.S.-South Korean military exercises are due to end in the coming days. Remarks against 'U.S. imperialists' But at an event to celebrate the anniversary of the creation of the North Korean military on Thursday, senior officials made remarks that revived the theme of nuclear attack against ""U.S. imperialists,"" something the North repeatedly used in its rhetoric over the past two months. 'One click away' North Korean pilots ""once given a sortie order, will load nuclear bombs, instead of fuel for return, and storm enemy strongholds to blow them up,"" the state-run news agency cited one commander, Ri Pyong Chol, as saying at the event in Pyongyang on Thursday. And Strategic Rocket Force Cmdr. Kim Rak Gyom was reported as saying that North Korea's ""inter-continental ballistic missiles have set the dens of the brigandish U.S. imperialists as their first target and officers and men of the Strategic Rocket Force are one click away from pushing the launch button."" Earlier this month, a U.S. congressman disclosed a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that judged with ""moderate confidence"" that the North can deliver a nuclear device with a missile, though with ""low"" reliability. But James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, later told the Senate Armed Services Committee that other U.S. intelligence agencies don't share the DIA's conclusion. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","NEW: Seoul says it will support the companies invested in the zone .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal ended Wigan's eight-year stay in the Premier League with a ruthless 4-1 victory at the Emirates to keep their Champions League dreams alive and relegate the FA Cup winners. The result had numerous repercussions but Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger will concentrate on the fact that his side can secure a 16th successive season of Champions League football by taking three points at Newcastle on Sunday. Goals from Lukas Podolski (2), Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey moved the Gunners up to fourth in the Premier League with 70 points, crucially one more than North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur with one game of the season left. ""We've got another big game on Sunday and we'll give it all again,"" Frenchman Wenger, whose side trailed Spurs by eight points in February, told Sky Sports. ""It is sad (Wigan) go down because they play good football with intelligent players."" The defeat that sent Wigan back to the second tier Championship came just three days after Roberto Martinez's side won the FA Cup, stunning Manchester City with a 1-0 victory at Wembley. In the long history of English football, Wigan become the first side to be relegated in the same season as winning the FA Cup, a tournament that was first contested in 1871. Nonetheless, the Wembley win means Wigan garnered more silverware during their eight years in the Premier League than rivals Arsenal, whose last trophy came when winning the FA Cup at the end of the 2004-2005 season. ""I never expected this to happen,"" said Martinez, whose side briefly rallied when Shaun Maloney made it 1-1 on the stroke of half-time. ""The group of players we have at the club are an incredible bunch, and we didn't deserve this. I am glad they showed what they were capable of -- winning the FA Cup was an incredible achievement -- but this is a tough day for the club."" Despite the disappointment, Martinez -- who has been heavily linked with taking the vacant Everton job in recent days -- preferred to focus on the positives of his side's top flight adventure. ""We had an incredible eight years in the Premier League and we need to build for the future,"" the Spaniard added. ""It's great to win the FA Cup. It's an achievement that will live forever. The relegation is something we can rectify. ""The club is on a fantastic financial footing. We are stronger than ever. It's important we make our fans really proud. They supported us like they always do. ""It's a difficult time. It's a time to look forward to the future."" As the Latics joined Queens Park Rangers and Reading, who lost 2-0 at home to Manchester City on Tuesday, in the Championship, fans of Sunderland and Aston Villa all breathed a huge sigh of relief as their Premier League survival was ensured. During their spell in the Premier League, Wigan often flirted with relegation -- twice surviving on the final day -- but the 2012-2013 season proved a step too far. One of the Wembley heroes, goalkeeper Joel Robles, was in tears at the final whistle. Reading were another team departing the Premier League and they ended their home campaign with their 21st defeat of the season, as visiting City fans thanked Roberto Mancini for his tenure at the club. The Italian was dismissed on Monday despite delivering Manchester City's first major trophies in over three decades, with assistant coach Brian Kidd taking charge of the team at short notice. Goals in each half from Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko saw City finish the season in second place, with the victory ensuring that Wednesday's Europa League finalists Chelsea could no longer catch them. With Chilean Manuel Pellegrini strongly tipped to take charge of City, the club's supporters unfurled banners and sang songs in praise of Mancini -- who delivered the 2011 FA Cup and 2012 Premier League title during his spell in charge.","Arsenal maintain Champions League bid with victory that relegates Wigan .

"(CNN) -- Brazil moved into the final of the Confederations Cup following a tense and dramatic 2-1 victory over Uruguay. Following another day of protests in Belo Horizonte, where anti-government protesters clashed with police, the nation's football players gave its people some brief respite. A late header from Paulinho was enough to push the samba stars over the line in a game where it was given a huge scare by its South American rival. Diego Forlan squandered a glorious opportunity from the penalty spot in the first half before Fred fired Brazil ahead. Edinson Cavani leveled after the break from close-range, but Paulinho's late effort sealed his country's place in the final against either Spain or Italy. Contests between these two countries are always fiercely fought affairs with the Brazilians still scarred by their defeat in the 1950 World Cup final in Rio. Then there was the pre-match spice added by Uruguay captain Diego Lugano, who accused Brazil star Neymar of diving. Ironically, it was Lugano who hit the turf first, although there were no suggestions that he dived to win a first-half penalty. The defender was wrestled to the ground by Chelsea defender David Luiz and referee Enrique Osses pointed to the spot. Forlan, Uruguay's leading scorer, stepped up to take the kick but his effort was saved by Julio Cesar to send those draped in yellow inside the Estadio Mineirao into ecstasy. That miss appeared to wake Brazil from its slumber and with just two minutes of the first half remaining, Neymar flicked the ball into Fred's path and the striker fired home with aplomb. Uruguay responded almost immediately after the interval when Cavani stroked home, while Forlan wasted a fine opportunity to win the tie when he fired straight at Cesar. Liverpool's Luis Suarez headed just over as Uruguay turned the screw against a fragile looking Brazilian backline. But with the prospect of extra time looming, Paulinho rose highest at the far post to meet Neymar's corner and spark wild scenes of celebration. Isco . Meanwhile, Real Madrid president Florentino Perez confirmed Wednesday that his club has agreed a deal for Malaga's Spain under-21 star Isco. Isco is expected to become new manager Carlo Ancelotti's first signing since taking over from Jose Mourinho. ""There is already an agreement with the club and the player,"" Perez told Spanish National Radio. ""Isco will be presented next week, he just needs to pass the medical."" Italian side Juventus has confirmed the signing of Manchester City and Argentina striker Carlos Tevez on a three-year deal. Tevez, 29, cost an estimated $13 million with the fee rising to a possible $15 million.","Brazil defeated Uruguay 2-1 to reach final of Confederations Cup .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's a familiar refrain from the media-shy U.S. Supreme Court: Judge us by what we write in our rulings, not in oral arguments, speeches or interviews. But the court term that ended this week in dramatic fashion reveals how difficult it can be to create a coherent picture of this dynamic bench, one that moves easily, if stealthily, across ideological lines on a range of hot-button cases. This body, led by a relatively youthful 58-year-old chief justice, is one that is thinking long-term: conservative and cautious. The drama that played out over three days looked like a ping-pong match: . • On Monday the court allowed affirmative action to continue in college admissions, while making it tougher in the future for public institutions to promote diversity in the classroom. Two liberal justices agreed with the five conservatives. Supreme Court sidesteps big ruling on Texas affirmative action . • Tuesday, it was back to a familiar 5-4, conservative-liberal split when the majority struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act, leaving the federal government without its major enforcement tool to fight discrimination against minority voters. Court strikes down part of historic voting rights law . • And the finale Wednesday, giving gay rights supporters a major political and social boost by striking down part of a federal law that did not recognize same-sex marriage in states where it was legal and essentially clearing the way for homosexuals to wed in California. Same-sex marriage rulings hailed as historic victory . One case was split along ideological lines, with moderate-conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy the ""swing,"" or deciding, vote; the other produced an unusual coalition in the 5-4 divide. Missing was an overarching ""equal protection"" right allowing gays and lesbians to marry in all states. The court is nowhere near that legal destination. So anyone in the political branches hoping for reliability from the current court, especially on social issues, may be disappointed. ""This is a conservative court -- conservative ideologically and conservative in the sense that they like to take baby steps,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of the well-respected SCOTUSblog.com. ""There are times when the court decides to act aggressively over time, for example limiting the use of race in government decision-making like affirmative action. Then there are other times when the court is more uncertain and wants to move more modestly. In the same-sex marriage cases it doesn't want to force the entire country in one direction or another."" By the numbers . It may surprise some, but the nine justices, despite their ideological differences, do like each other personally. And they readily find room for agreement. Sometimes. Half the 78 decisions from argued cases this his term were unanimous, 9-0. But 30% were split 5-4, including voting rights, the two same-sex marriage cases, DNA testing for arrested criminal suspects, government electronic surveillance, and Native American adoptions. That is a higher percentage than in past years, according to SCOTUSblog, which annually compiles the numbers. Ten of the 23 cases decided by one vote had the familiar five conservatives prevailing: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito. But six times Kennedy sided with his more progressive colleagues: Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. In probably a first for this court: Thomas -- perhaps the most right-leaning -- was the decisive vote when he joined the four liberals in a criminal sentencing appeal. Scalia, too, was a friend of the left on several other criminal procedure cases. Cockeyed coalitions seem almost routine. But the figures overall show what court watchers have long known: Roberts, and especially Kennedy, played the greatest behind-the-scenes roles. Kennedy was in the majority 91% of the time this term, and in the majority 87% of the time in the 5-4 cases. That includes the three blockbusters this week, a display of the power he wields. Kennedy often high court's swing vote and power broker . Kennedy, who turns 77 next month, separately offered a broad embrace of gay rights, but a limited endorsement of federal authority in voting rights. Colleagues on the losing sides of the biggest cases spared no rhetoric slamming Kennedy's personal views of the court's ""primary role in determining the constitutionality of a law"" as he wrote in the federal Defense of Marriage Act case, overriding the will of Congress. In supporting DOMA, Scalia said Kennedy was promoting ""judicial supremacy"" over the other branches of government. In supporting the Voting Rights Act and the power of Congress to oversee states with a history of minority discrimination, Ginsburg noted the ""sad irony"" when she said, ""Hubris is a fit word for today's demolition of the VRA. ... Where is the court's usual restraint?"" Even lawmakers have learned to accept the you-can't-win-them-all reality of the court's jurisprudence. ""As disappointed as I was yesterday, I am happy today,"" House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said when the same-sex marriage decisions were announced. Roberts rules . If Kennedy is on the winning side more than any of his bench mates, the chief justice is not too far behind. Roberts' key role crafting the opinion striking down part of the Voting Rights Act came after years of careful, incremental strategizing to limit the effect of racial classifications. In 2006, with just months on the job, Roberts lamented, ""It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race."" A year later discussing a case that struck down a voluntary school integration plan, he said firmly, ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" Then in 2009, Roberts and the conservatives on the court sent a clear message to Congress: Fix the Voting Rights Act and its federal enforcement scheme or the court would have ""no choice"" but to act as the constitutional arbiter. When lawmakers did not respond, the court in large measure did as it promised this week, in stunning fashion. President Barack Obama said he was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision, quite a shift from a year ago when Roberts led the court in upholding the Affordable Care Act, the president's signature health care reform effort. Back then the president called that decision ""a victory for people all over this country."" While Kennedy dominates the 5-4 decisions, Roberts was in the majority only 61% of the time. But many conservative legal scholars say the chief justice has a years-long view of the law and of his own power. That gives them hope for the future, even when they do not prevail today. ""It's disappointing to see the representatives of the people in Congress having been overruled here,"" said Carrie Severino, chief counsel at the Judicial Crisis Network, about the DOMA ruling. ""But I think the silver lining is that we see, as the chief justice pointed out, that actually this is a somewhat narrow decision in terms of leaving it to the states to be worked out there in the future."" What worries many progressive activists is the conservative court's consistently united voice on business-related cases, which typically dominate the docket. These disputes don't generate the same political pulse as race and marriage, but carry a hefty legal consequence. ""As opposed to issues like the dismantling of affirmative action, where the court's conservative bloc is divided and has trouble agreeing about how far and how fast to take the law, the court's conservatives are completely united"" on this front, said Doug Kendall, head of the Constitutional Accountability Center. ""Corporate America wins; workers, consumers, mom and pop shops, and other individual Americans asserting their rights in federal court lose. Again and again."" The excitement of this term will spill over when the justices resume their work in October. Among the closely watched petitions: . • Another affirmative action dispute and a Michigan voter referendum that bans racial preferences in public university admissions, state employment and government contracting. • Public prayers in town council meetings. • The validity of Obama's recess appointments to a federal agency when the Senate was in a ""pro forma"" session. Each member of the court at some point in their tenure begins to think about a personal legacy. Some of the (relatively) younger ones may think long-term; the elder justices may realize they only have a few more years to make their mark. Three of the justices are in their 50s, three are in their 60s or early 70s; three are 75 or older. That and the shaky ideological makeup create a court with subtly different agendas and demands. The tension over the 5-4 cases, the mixed-result efforts by Roberts to forge consensus, and the fact each of the chambers operates essentially as their own independent judicial shop means fixing a unified adjective on these nine justices is impossible. Several of the justices privately acknowledge this unique relationship among themselves. As one told CNN a few years ago, ""If we can agree, we will. If we can't, we don't. That's how we look at it, and that really is how it has been, at least as long as I have been on the court. And I expect it will continue.""","Supreme Court term ends this week in dramatic fashion with rulings on three hot-button topics .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Civilian casualties resulting from Afghanistan's war have spiked, jumping some 24 percent above figures from last year, the United Nations reported Friday. An Afghan child allegedly hurt during a U.S.-led air strike earlier this year. The Human Rights Unit of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan announced it recorded 1,013 civilian deaths in Afghanistan during the first six months of this year. That compares to 818 Afghan civilians who were killed during the same period in 2008, while 684 civilians were killed during the first half of 2007. Insurgent roadside bombs and suicide attacks, as well as air strikes conducted by U.S. and NATO forces, are the two deadliest tactics being used in Afghanistan. Fifty-nine percent of this year's civilian casualties resulted from insurgent bombs. Western military airstrikes killed 30.5 percent of the civilians. The report concluded that Taliban insurgents are ""basing themselves in civilian areas so as to deliberately blur the distinction between combatants and civilians, and as part of what appears to be an active policy aimed at drawing a military response to areas where there is a high likelihood that civilians will be killed."" The UN highlighted a pattern of deadly Taliban attacks, targeting humanitarian workers, government employees, medical and educational staff... and in particular, girls' schools. Meanwhile, the UN noted that NATO forces have redrafted their tactical directives, in an effort to reduce civilian casualties. Despite the creation last year of a military commission to track civilian deaths, Western airstrikes ""remain responsible for the largest percentage of civilian deaths"" attributed to foreign troops in Afghanistan. The UN stated that these civilian casualties are counterproductive for the Western military coalition, because they are ""undermining support for the continued presence of the international military forces and the international community generally."" The United States has nearly doubled the number of American forces in Afghanistan since last year. US-NATO troops have mounted on of the biggest military operations of the eight year war, in an effort to route Taliban insurgents from safe havens in Southern Afghanistan, ahead of August 20th presidential elections. The intensified military activities have contributed to making June the deadliest month for Western forces for the war. At least 44 American service members died in the conflict zone this month, in addition to some 29 Coalition forces.","Civilian casualties in Afghanistan war have spiked by 24 percent .

"(CNN) -- Wimbledon holds a special place in the tennis calendar, an elegant tournament rich with tradition, style and sporting majesty. The modern era of the men's game there has been defined by the legacy of Pete Sampras, who won a record seven titles in eight years. However, it was not exactly love at first sight for the confident young American, who -- despite winning his first grand slam at the age of 19 -- suffered early exits in his first three visits to the famous grass-court venue. ""I didn't like grass at all and when people ask me about grass and when I first went over there, I tell them I hated Wimbledon. I hated the surface,"" he told CNN. Calendar of the court: The six seasons of the tennis year . But, speaking to Open Court's Pat Cash, a fellow Wimbledon champion, Sampras quickly qualified his remarks. ""I loved Wimbledon and what it meant, but the surface felt uncomfortable. I just didn't like it, I was a hard-court guy, a Californian kid. ""On hard courts the ball is going to be just there, but with grass you have to adjust, so the first two, three years I had to adjust and came out with a bad attitude."" Sampras paid tribute to his former coach Tim Gullikson, who tragically lost his life to brain cancer in 1996. The 'owner' of Wimbledon . ""He helped me. I had these long swings, and he shortened them up and told me my attitude had to be more positive at Wimbledon,"" the 40-year-old recalled. The fruits of their labors came in 1992 when Sampras advanced to the semifinals before being beaten by big-serving Croatian Goran Ivanisevic, who subsequently lost to Andre Agassi in the final . Success was just around the corner the following year. ""Mentally I felt better. By '92 I felt really comfortable, I was the owner of the place for the next seven years."" Only a quarterfinal defeat to eventual winner Richard Kracijek in 1996 interrupted an incredible run which saw Sampras claim seven of the next eight Wimbledon crowns. His 1999 victory in the final over Agassi in straight sets was rated one of his best performances as he demolished his arch-rival. ""That sixth Wimbledon (title) against Andre I got in the zone,"" he said. ""I felt if I was serving well, I would do well, get into the net, be aggressive. It was bit more high risk, I was okay with that."" In 2001, Sampras was beaten in the fourth round by a youthful Roger Federer as he sought an eighth Wimbledon title, and he retired the following year after winning the U.S. Open in fairytale fashion. He is still involved in tennis and plays the occasional exhibition or seniors Champions Tour event, but spends most of his time with his wife Bridgette Wilson and their two children at his home in California. Federer domination . Federer began his era of domination in 2003, but the 16-time grand slam champion is still one short of the Wimbledon record held by Sampras -- whose tally is matched only by the seven won by Britain's William Renshaw in the tournament's formative years of the 1880s. Sampras believes that the Swiss maestro can still claim another, but he may struggle with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic -- who he was to face in Friday's semifinals -- and Rafael Nadal in their prime. ""Roger needs to find a way to be creative, stick to his game and serve and volley now and again,"" Sampras said. ""He's won 16 majors in a certain way, he's not going to change now."" The task of giving Federer advice falls to his current coach Paul Annacone, who also guided Sampras in the latter part of his career. The American acknowledges the difference in their playing styles but told CNN that both shared a key ingredient to success. ""Both these guys are superstars in regards to handling pressure,"" Annacone said. Sampras accepts that his style of big serving and volleying at Wimbledon is from a bygone era, and he regrets its passing. ""It's sad to see Wimbledon today with the players staying back, with the balls being different, but grass is grass -- you can still get into the net but it's a lost art, and it's unfortunate.""","Pete Sampras admits he ""hated"" playing on Wimbledon's grass in his early years .

"(CNN) -- In the decade following the September 11, 2001, attacks, four CIA officers directly collaborated with the New York Police Department to expand NYPD's counterterrorism capabilities, according to a newly disclosed report. The CIA inspector general's report -- completed in late 2011, but just declassified in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by The New York Times -- raises concerns about the relationship between the organizations. The investigation found ""irregular personnel practices"" and ""inadequate direction and control"" by CIA managers ""responsible for the relationship."" ""As a consequence, the risk to the Agency (CIA) is considerable and multifaceted,"" said a memo from Inspector General David Buckley to David Petraeus, who was the CIA director at the time. ""While negative public perception is to be expected from the revelation of the agency's close and direct collaboration with any local domestic police department, a perception that the agency has exceeded its authorities diminishes the trust place in the organization."" CIA agents are prohibited from taking part in domestic spying and the report's release comes in the immediate aftermath of leaks by National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. The investigation was launched after an Associated Press story that alleged ""inappropriate CIA involvement in the activities of the New York Police Department,"" the inspector general's report said. The AP reported that the NYPD Intelligence Division dispatched CIA-trained undercover officers into minority neighborhoods to gather intelligence on daily life in mosques, cafes, bars and bookstores. It said New York police have used informers to monitor sermons during religious services and police officials keep tabs on clerics and gather intelligence on taxi cab drivers and food-cart vendors, who are often Muslim. The New York Police Department blasted the report as ""fictional,"" at the time. A year ago, New Jersey Muslims filed a lawsuit against New York City, accusing police of using unconstitutional tactics to spy on them in the years after September 11. The NYPD later said the surveillance never produced a lead that linked to a potential terrorist plot. While the inspector general's report found no reason to order a full investigation into the relationship, it did note that the ""risks ... were not fully considered."" NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne hailed the cooperation between the agencies. ""We're proud of our relationship with CIA and its training expertise, which is in part responsible for the fact that the 11 years since 9/11 and the anthrax attacks soon thereafter mark the first decade in the last six in which there hasn't been a single casualty of a terrorist attack in New York City,"" he said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- A watchdog group meant to guard Americans' right to privacy against overreach by government cyberintelligence has been around for years. If that makes you feel safer, consider this: . It had no leader until May, and lawmakers delayed for years to fully staff it. President Barack Obama met with the group for the first time Friday over the phone and e-mail record-gathering scandal involving the National Security Agency. The president wants to enlist the group to ""structure a national conversation"" on government cyberintelligence and civil rights. Who are the watchdogs? The group is called the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), and though it was created in 2004, it does not appear to have been very active. It initially answered directly to then-President George W. Bush in an advisory role, but later became an independent agency in 2007 following advice from the 9/11 Commission, according to the White House. Why little will happen to change how we snoop . Five years later, the PCLOB really only existed on paper, a group of conservative libertarians complained. In a May 2012 letter to Senators from the group -- led by former Republican Representative Bob Barr of Georgia -- blasted Washington for dallying on staffing the board, while lawmakers were already considering cybersecurity legislation. What's next for Snowden? ""We are deeply troubled by the fact that it has been almost five years since Congress enacted legislation to create an independent PCLOB with meaningful oversight authority, and yet the Board has not yet come into existence,"" the letter read. Washington lawmakers had bounced nominations to the PCLOB that Obama made in December 2010 back at him, only to have him nominate them again, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Rand Paul: Clapper was lying . Their mission? ""Minimizing any impact on privacy and civil liberties"" while the government expands its fight against cyberthreats, the White House posted on its blog a year after floating the nominees. It encouraged their swift confirmation. Officials cite thwarted plots . The conservative advocates adamantly backed the liberal president. ""We implore you to act without further delay to move these nominations forward,"" they wrote to senators. Last month, Obama appointed financial and economic attorney David Medine to chair the board. Obama wants to expand its duties to include ""big data"" -- how private companies like Google or Facebook treat information they collect from their customers, he said in an interview with journalist Charlie Rose this week. Nine years after its inception, PCLOB may begin with its task, now that the NSA's intelligence activities have been exposed. ""We discussed with the president our recommendation that every effort be made to publicly provide the legal rationale for the programs in order to enhance the public discussion and debate about the legality and propriety of the country's counterterrorism efforts,"" the group said in a statement after Friday's meeting, noting it would produce a public review of the recently revealed surveillance programs. The NSA controversy . Earlier this month, Edward Snowden, a former employee of a government contractor, leaked to the media that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. It also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said. The NSA and many Washington politicians, including the president, have justified the surveillance program, called PRISM, as necessary to preventing terrorist threats. They emphasize that agents are not randomly listening in on phone conversations and only monitoring the internet activity of ""non-U.S. persons."" They mine the data to see who may have contact with known or suspected terrorists, the NSA said. And their work is subject to scrutiny of a court. Critics complain that the court operates in secrecy, which prevents it from offering a real check to the NSA's activities. They say that the exposed top-secret program amounts to a gross encroachment by the government upon citizens' rights to privacy. PRISM has helped thwart more than 50 terrorist acts worldwide, NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander has said. But CNN terror analyst Peter Bergen doesn't think such broad surveillance has helped foil significant plots on U.S. soil. Normal police work has done the job in the overwhelming majority of cases. PRISM's supporters and critics are divided between both parties, creating unlikely alliances between Democrats and Republicans to defend or condemn PRISM. Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor promised ""serious investigations into potential wrongdoing"" over the program, while his party colleague, Rep. Peter King of New York, said journalists involved in reporting stories about the surveillance programs should be investigated for violating national security. Snowden has fled to Hong Kong. Lawmakers in Washington are building a criminal case against him.","NEW: Obama meets with watchdog group .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of kidnapping and holding captive three young women in his Cleveland house for 10 years will be arraigned this week on 329 counts. Ariel Castro, 52, was indicted Friday in a case that shocked neighbors who never suspected anything out of the ordinary was going on in the house -- and prompted Castro's daughter to call him ""the most evil, vile, demonic criminal."" One charge accuses Castro of aggravated murder for purposely causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy, authorities said. One of the young women was allegedly impregnated five times by Castro, and another bore a child fathered by him, police have said. The indictment charges Castro with 139 counts of rape, 177 counts of kidnapping, seven counts of gross sexual imposition, three counts of felonious assault and one count of possession of criminal tools, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said in a statement. The charges cover only half of the 10 years the three young were held captive -- from August 2002, when the first of three women disappeared off a Cleveland street, to February 2007. The three women were freed last month after one shouted for help while Castro was gone from the house. The prosecutor's capital review committee will consider whether the case is appropriate for seeking the death penalty once the indictment process is complete, the prosecutor's statement said. ""Today's indictments represent a first major step in the criminal justice process,'' McGinty said in a statement. ""Our investigation continues, and we will present our findings to the grand jury.'' 'Please don't let me go,' kidnapping victim told officers . The indictment alleges that Castro taped the legs and mouth of one woman identified as Jane Doe 2 and also chained her to a pole in the basement with a motorcycle helmet placed on her head. Castro also allegedly used a vacuum cord around her neck during a felonious assault and chained her to inside of a van, the indictment said. Castro allegedly used chains and tape in the basement to restrain another woman identified as Jane Doe 3, the indictment said. Source: Michelle Knight was suspect's main 'punching bag' The victims were earlier identified by police as Michelle Knight, abducted at age 21 in August 2002; Amanda Berry, abducted at age 16 in April 2003 and who has a 6-year-old daughter by Castro; and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus, who was 14 when kidnapped in 2004. Jim Wooley, attorney for Berry and DeJesus, and Kathy Joseph, attorney for Michelle Knight, expressed satisfaction with the indictment. ""We have a great legal system, plus confidence and faith in the prosecutor's office and its decisions. Now, we need to stand back and let the judicial process unfold,"" the attorneys said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- New York police on Sunday identified the man fatally wounded the day earlier by officers a short walk from Manhattan's Times Square as a 51-year-old from nearby Long Island. Darrius Kennedy, who the New York Police Department named in a press release and said was from Hempstead, New York, died after being shot Saturday afternoon. Police said he threatened officers with a knife and repeatedly resisted their attempts to arrest him. The incident began shortly after 3 p.m. around 7th Avenue and 44th Street, an area popular with shoppers and tourists. Officers there approached a man because he was smoking what appeared to be a ""marijuana cigarette,"" Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said Saturday. After becoming agitated, the man ""placed the marijuana cigarette in his pocket and pulled out an 11-inch knife, raised it above his head and began to put a blue bandana on his head,"" police said on Sunday. Kennedy moved south down 7th Avenue, refusing officers' attempts to arrest him and their pleas that he drop the knife, according to police. Video shot by CNN iReporter David Fowler shows several officers -- at least three of them with their guns drawn -- following the man through the middle of Times Square. Some people can be overheard yelling ""they can't shoot him"" as the man backs down the street. iReport: ' looked back saw him holding the gun...' Officers deployed pepper spray six separate times during the drawn-out ordeal, ""to no avail,"" police said. Around the intersection of Seventh Avenue and 37th Street, the man ""advanced on uniformed officers, refusing officers' repeated commands to drop his weapon,"" Browne said. Kennedy was then shot in the torso by two officers, according to police. The wounded man was transported to Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital and pronounced dead at 3:42 p.m. Saturday. The two officers who shot him were taken to the same hospital for tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, presumably from the sound of the gunshots. A third officer who'd been exposed to pepper spray was treated for eye irritation, police said Sunday. Browne said Saturday that the officers involved in the shooting will be on required administrative duty while the incident is reviewed. Shaking up 'Kila-delphia' with cameras .

"Washington (CNN) -- Moments after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a pair of same-sex marriage cases, the handful of Democrats considering running for president in 2016 stumbled over themselves in a rush of celebratory reaction, blasting out a salvo of congratulatory press releases and tweets. Rulings hailed as historic victory . Voting 5-4 in each of two decisions, the justices struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in California. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose husband signed DOMA into law in 1996, applauded the decision. ""By overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, the court recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union,"" Clinton said in a joint statement with her husband, Bill Clinton. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley called the rulings ""a powerful step forward."" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the opinions were ""groundbreaking."" Obama directs Cabinet to implement marriage ruling . Their responses make political sense. Public opinion on same-sex marriage has shifted dramatically from the time President Clinton signed the bill into law almost 17 years ago, after the legislation was approved by overwhelming majorities in both the Republican-controlled House and Senate. In 1996, just 27% of Americans said gay and lesbian marriages should be recognized by law, according to CNN polling. By 2007, the number had jumped to 40%. Today, a majority of Americans -- 55% -- say that marriages between gays and lesbians should be recognized as valid, with 44% opposed. More than two-thirds of young people support same-sex marriage, a recent Pew survey found. Poll: Majority backs same-sex marriage . Democrats who support same-sex marriage are now playing on increasingly friendly political turf, a circumstance that prompted a raft of Democratic senators to reverse their positions on the issue earlier this year in quick succession. By the numbers: Same-sex marriage . ""The battle lines are now clearly drawn for future elections,"" said Lis Smith, a Democratic consultant who advises O'Malley. ""Democrats, like the majority of Americans, support freedom and equality. Republicans embrace the stale and exclusionary policies of the past. Like immigration and women's health in 2012, this is an issue that will haunt the Republican Party for years to come."" Meanwhile, the court's rulings Wednesday were met with something less than unbridled enthusiasm by the GOP political class. ""My interest in weighing in on this topic approaches zero,"" said one veteran Republican working on a 2014 Senate race when asked to opine on the cases. The reason is clear enough: Republican tacticians understand that winning modern races often means surviving the obstacle course of a conservative-dominated primary before having to appeal to general election voters who, nationally, view same-sex marriage as a non-issue. Republican leaders in Washington expressed dismay at the ruling, but seemed eager to wash their hands of a polarizing national issue that, thanks to the court's opinion on Proposition 8, will now be considered in state capitals instead of the corridors of Capitol Hill. ""A robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square, and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman,"" said House Speaker John Boehner in a prepared statement. Opinion: Supreme Court got it wrong on gay marriage . The political fight over marriage is felt most acutely, perhaps, in Iowa, where three state Supreme Court judges were removed from the bench in 2010 in a recall election after they ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in the state. Defending traditional marriage -- between one man and one woman -- has become an animating issue for Iowa's vibrant social conservative community since that initial ruling in 2009, and a litmus test for Republican candidates seeking their approval, either in contested primaries or in the state's presidential caucuses. At the beginning of last year's GOP presidential primary fight, Rick Santorum narrowly won the Iowa caucuses with the backing of a dedicated network of pastors and home-school families who rallied to his side because of his furious opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage. But other Republicans in Iowa say the party is consigning itself to minority status by failing to embrace the shifting opinions about marriage that Wednesday's court ruling seemed to ratify. What happens next? ""We can't afford to create a litmus test for the party,"" said David Kochel, who steered Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in Iowa and said he was pleased with the ruling. ""There are too many young people, and too many people who frankly care far more about other issues, and people in the liberty movement who simply have no problem with same sex-marriage. We have to maintain a kind of open-armed stance on this."" But Iowa Republicans seeking their party's Senate nomination in 2014 aren't quite jumping on Kochel's bandwagon. None of them cheered Wednesday's decisions. The one Senate candidate who did celebrate was Bruce Braley -- the likely Democratic nominee. Sam Clovis, a suspender-wearing college professor and former talk radio host running for the Iowa seat, blasted the DOMA ruling and said it opens the door to ""polyamorous"" marriages between more than two people. While Clovis acknowledged that being a modern-day opponent of same-sex marriage presents a political challenge for himself and other Republicans, he said conservatives are fed up with being attacked by the left for simply stating their principles on the matter. ""Every time you advance the notion that you are a conservative and that you believe in traditional marriage, you get hammered,"" Clovis said. ""People who have strong beliefs have been silenced. You can't talk about it except among your own friends."" Opinion: For gays, progress stunning, fast . For Republicans, the same-sex marriage rulings were something of a Rorshach test, exposing the almost timeless fault line between the party's pragmatists and its ideologues. For figures in the party's establishment like Kochel, the rulings were met with a sinking feeling that same-sex marriage is increasingly a settled matter for voters and a potent wedge issue that Democrats can exploit for political gain in battleground states and in national elections. Statements from the establishment wing of the party Wednesday were either risk-averse or nonexistent. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus issued no comment on the ruling. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell dodged a question about it. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan said he opposes same-sex marriage but called for ""respect,"" ""civility"" and ""understanding"" as people work through their ""honest disagreements."" Most of the Republicans considering presidential bids in 2016 proceeded with caution, aware that their statements will likely be revisited if they ever become the party's standard-bearer in a general election. Potential 2016 contenders take a stand on Supreme Court rulings . Florida Sen. Marco Rubio issued a nearly 500-word commentary explaining his opposition to same-sex marriage. But for outspoken conservatives who tend to get rewarded in Republican primaries, the opinions were greeted with fury -- general election consequences be damned. Santorum, who is expected to make another play for the White House in 2016, attacked the ""activist judges"" on the court. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a freshman senator who harbors obvious national ambitions, called the rulings ""a regrettable overreach against the will of the people."" These harsh denouncements had the added benefit of stoking outrage among family values conservatives around the country who contribute financially to their causes. The mood was similar among Republican candidates further down the ballot, who are running in gerrymandered House districts where winning a GOP primary is the only victory that matters -- providing little political incentive to side with gays and lesbians. Take this year's special election in Alabama's ruby red 1st Congressional District, where former state Sen. Bradley Byrne, a front-runner for the seat, wasted little time in hammering the court. ""I am disappointed in today's decision, but know that Alabamians stand strong in supporting our states' right to define marriage without intrusion from the federal government,"" Byrne said. In Byrne's hometown of Mobile, as in the rest of the South, there is less appetite for same-sex marriage than in other parts of the country. In the Northeast, 63% of Americans favor legal rights for same-sex couples, according to a recent CNN poll. In the West, 58% of Americans say the same. But in the Midwest, the number of people who approve of same-sex marriage is 51%, and in the South, it's 49%. Those also happen to be regions where Senate Democrats find themselves in potentially difficult re-election fights -- suggesting that while opinions about marriage may buoy Democrats nationally and in swing states, the issue is more perilous for the party in places such as Louisiana, North Carolina and Arkansas, where incumbent Senate Democrats will be on the ballot next year.

"(CNN) -- Five-time world champions Brazil needed to come from two goals down to beat underdogs the United States 3-2 in the final of the Confederations Cup in South Africa on Sunday night. Brazil celebrated a third Confederations Cup triumph following victories in 2005 and 1997. Captain Lucio headed an 84th-minute winner to end the hopes of the plucky Americans, who scored twice in the first half-hour in Johannesburg. Clint Dempsey, who netted in the shock 2-0 win against European champions Spain in the semi-finals, put the U.S. ahead in the 10th minute. A massive upset seemed to be on the cards when captain Landon Donovan doubled the lead in the 27th minute, but Brazil reduced the deficit just 41 seconds after the half-time break through Luis Fabiano. The striker then leveled with his fifth goal of the tournament in the 74th minute before Lucio rose highest to ensure that Brazil retained the title. Brazil went into the game seeking a massive improvement on their dismal showing in laboring to beat hosts South Africa 1-0 in the semi-finals. But Bob Bradley's U.S. team, beaten 3-0 by Brazil in the group stage, took a shock lead when Dempsey found space in the penalty area to guide home Jonathan Spector's fierce right-wing cross for his third goal of the tournament. Goalkeeper Tim Howard continued his fine form to keep the Brazilians at bay, then Donovan finished off a superb counter-attack that the South Americans would have been proud of. The veteran, who earlier in the tournament said his worst footballing memory was a 7-0 drubbing by Brazil when playing for the U.S. under-23 side, set the speedy Charlie Davies free down the left. He then controlled the return pass to cut inside Ramires and slot past Julio Cesar -- extending his national goalscoring record to 41. Howard then saved a low angled shot from Fabiano, then the Sevilla forward headed over the bar 10 minutes before the interval. But Fabiano struck a killer blow soon after the restart when otherwise-impressive U.S. defender Jay DeMerit allowed him to collect Kaka's pass inside the penalty area and swivel to fire past a helpless Howard. Brazil surged forward in search of an equalizer, and Real Madrid's new signing Kaka thought he'd scored it when Howard beat out his downward header via the underside of the crossbar while the Everton keeper appeared to be behind the line. However, the referee ruled otherwise to the Brazilian's disgust, which seemed to be justified by television replays. Howard denied Fabiano when clear through on goal in the 70th minute, but soon after the forward was on hand to poach the leveler. Kaka beat full-back Spector down the left and his low cross was deflected into the path of Robinho, who prodded the ball against the underside of the bar -- and Fabiano headed home the rebound. With the Americans visibly tiring, it was no surprise when Brazil claimed the winner. Lucio found space in the box to powerfully head a corner from second-half substitute Elano into the net off the left-hand upright, with the U.S. defense having crucially left the post unguarded. It was Brazil's third Confederations Cup triumph, having also won in 1997, and represented a 14th victory in the last 15 meetings with the U.S. Coach Dunga has now presided over seven wins in 20 days, with five at the Confederations Cup and two in World Cup qualifiers.","Brazil come from two goals down to beat U.S. 3-2 in Confederations Cup final .

"(CNN) -- A camera that can see around a corner? I know this sounds like something in a sci-fi movie or a superhero comic, but this is a real-world technology we've made possible with a camera that is aware of the travel time of light, an imaging technique that can create movies of light in motion with an effective rate approaching a trillion frames per second: the speed of light. Before I joined the MIT faculty in 2008, I had done deep research in ""computational photography,"" a field of new imaging techniques dramatically improving the capture and synthesis of photos. But, I knew there was more to photography than just depicting what the eye can see. I wanted to create a camera that could see beyond the line of sight. The speed of light isn't infinite: light travels about a foot per billionth of a second. If I could build a camera fast enough to analyze light at high speeds in room-sized environments, I knew we could then create cameras to solve major problems in scientific and consumer imaging, and enable completely new functionality. I spoke to top researchers in ultrafast lasers and photonics to understand what was currently possible. When I did, most of them asked some version of: ""Why? Why spend years building a camera to look around corners when no commercial application is screaming for it and no funding agency has a call for it?"" In addition, it's rare to shoot light pulses and analyze at such high speeds in large environments. Ultra-fast imaging experiments are usually limited to centimeter- or smaller-size samples. I continued the work and in the spring of 2008, with James Davis from UC Santa Cruz, wrote a proposal that laid out the mathematical foundation and various experimental solutions for exploration. TED.com: Boaz Almog 'levitates' a superconductor . I also began working with Media Lab graduate student Matthew Hirsch to build a prototype, hoping that we would have something to demonstrate within a few months. The grant proposal was rejected for administrative reasons (I made a paperwork error!), which meant we had to wait nearly a year to apply again. But those two years didn't yield any meaningful results, as our lab components weren't designed to be used the way we wanted. After nearly three years of experimental work, the team -- especially postdoctoral associate Andreas Velten and MIT professor Moungi Bawendi, many students, and several collaborators -- cobbled together pieces of the puzzle and built a software program to create a first demonstration of looking around corners. Very soon afterward, we could also start creating surreal movies of light in motion. We call this new imaging technology femto photography because we capture a segment of the image with a flashlight (in this case, a laser pulse) on for a few millionths of a billionth of a second (or a few femtoseconds) and an exposure time approaching a trillionth of a second. Just how fast is femto photography? Think of it this way: if we took one-thousandth of a second of footage from the femto camera video output and slowed it down to the speed of 30 seconds per frame -- the approximate speed of a standard TV broadcast -- it would take us a lifetime to watch. Photographers know that at very short exposures and even at the most sensitive setting for dark scenes, we will record barely any light. So what about in a trillionth of a second? We actually record and average millions of photos to get enough light, each photo made to look the same via carefully timed synchronization with the light pulse. So even if our exposure time is indeed nearly a trillionth of a second, to get sufficient light we must take an average. Thus, as of now, we can only record repeatable events, but this is not a fundamental limitation. TED.com: A robot that flies like a bird . Unlike conventional cameras, our femto camera captures an image as one thin slice at a time of one-dimensional space using a ""streak tube,"" a laboratory instrument that is commonly used by chemists to study light passing through chemical samples. We then take hundreds of these narrow videos (each shot at a slightly different angle) and create a carefully synchronized, slow-motion composite of the light pulses. It takes about an hour to collect and aggregate the data (view a demonstration of a light pulse as it travels through an ordinary Coca-Cola bottle). To see around the corner, we use femto photography to analyze scattered light. We bounce light off of visible parts into hidden parts and then measure the time and direction of returned light. Usually the scattering of energy is considered a nuisance -- whether driving in fog or poor reception from a cell phone tower -- and most techniques either try to avoid it (by turning on fog lights) or reduce the impact of scattering (by selecting energy for the phone only from direct paths). In contrast, we exploit the scattering. For the camera, a laser pulse is fired at a wall, and the impact of hitting the wall causes the particles of light to scatter. Some of the scattering particles return to the camera at different times. This is repeated about 60 times per image as the camera measures how long it takes for the light to travel back and where the particles land. An algorithm then crunches the data to reconstruct the hidden image. This technique even allows us to see a three-dimensional object such as a mock-up of running person. TED.com: Test for Parkinson's with a phone call . As exciting as this work is, don't look for this technology to be in practice tomorrow -- we're still years away from bringing this to market. But, we can already imagine multiple ways that it could have a significant, positive impact on our everyday lives. By allowing us to ""see"" around a corner, for example, this technology added to our cars could let us know if there's another vehicle approaching around a blind curve. It also could give us a new way to look deep inside our bodies without X-rays, or to look through a window into a burning building from a distance to see if anyone is left inside --without risking a firefighter's life. When I gave a TEDGlobal talk on femto photography in June, I began with a reference to Doc Edgerton, a very popular MIT professor of electrical engineering who, in 1964, wowed the world with an image of a bullet in midair, having just passed through an apple. He accomplished this by using a strobe light to freeze the action of the bullet at a millionth of a second. What we're talking about here -- the speed of light --is a million times faster, and is opening the door to a complete rethinking of what we mean by, and can do with, photography. It is a first step toward a new world of imaging that far exceeds human ability, resynthesizing data and depicting it in ways that are within human comprehensibility.

"(CNN) -- Art enthusiasts ranging from aficionados to the causal tourist queued up in New York on Wednesday to catch a glimpse of Norwegian artist Edvard Munch's ""The Scream,"" which went on display in Manhattan's Museum of Modern Art for a six-month exhibition. The exhibit opened Wednesday and runs through April 2013. ""Seeing it in real life is so special,"" said Julianna Rees, a San Francisco resident who attended the opening. The iconic work fetched nearly $120 million at Sotheby's auction house in May. Previously, the most expensive artwork ever sold there was Pablo Picasso's painting ""Nude, Green Leaves and Bust,"" which brought in $106.5 million two years ago. The previous record for a Munch work of art tallied just over $38 million.

"(CNN) -- It wasn't easy for David Kizelewicz to make ends meet as a single father of four on a construction worker's salary after his first divorce. But he did his best to cook dinner each night and to spend quality time with his kids on weekends, and somehow, ""they ended up smarter than me,"" he jokes. Fast forward a few decades and Kizelewicz, now 63, is raising another family. He still makes dinner most nights but now he has a bigger home, a stable job and a wife whose additional income makes things much easier. Some people cautioned him against remarrying at 49, saying he was too old to start a new family. He had two complicated marriages behind him when his now-wife Natalie -- his son's coworker -- agreed to a date. He was 48 and dating for the first time since his children left the home; she was 29 and had just ended what she described as an emotionally abusive marriage to her first husband, with whom she had a daughter. She resisted at first because of the age difference, but when she finally gave in they immediately hit it off during their first date at Olive Garden. Now, 13 years and one child later, David and Natalie say they're happier than they ever were in their previous marriages. They know what they want from the relationship and from each other. Lifetime friendship is medicine for the soul . ""In your first marriage, you're starting out and struggling,"" said Kizelewicz, now a construction supervisor who lives north of Orlando. ""It's a lot easier to raise kids when you have money to raise them and give them the things they want."" It's been a long road to happiness. David Kizelewicz was married to the mother of his children and another woman after that, but both relationships ended in divorce. With this his third marriage and Natalie's second, in some ways the couple is beating the odds. A 2009 study found that, because boomers divorce and remarry in such large numbers, it is more likely that later-in-life remarriages will end in divorce. But the Kizelewiczs and others say lessons learned from past marriages can help nurture future relationships. ""We're just so grateful to have a good marriage this time that there's nothing to really fight over,"" Natalie Kizelewicz said. ""We rarely argue and I think it's because we get along so well."" They also draw upon David's experience raising children. ""All the tricks the kids try to pull, if they try to lie or pull the wool over our eyes, he already knows and he knows what to do,"" she said. Second marriages often fail because individuals don't take the time to figure out what went wrong in the first union or acknowledge their role in the unhappy marriage, said psychotherapist and relationship specialist Lisa Brateman, who has a private practice in New York. ""Everyone likes to blame the other person and say he did this or he was too controlling, but were you so passive that you let it continue?"" she said. ""What were you so fearful of that you lost your voice for so many years?"" Dating after 50 . For some women, being on their own after years of financial dependency causes them to rush into relationships without considering whether the person is right for them, she said. The more you know yourself, your wants and your needs, the healthier your decisions will be if you're 18 or 55. ""Relationships are about enhancing your life rather than giving you a life,"" she said. As divorces rates among couples over 50 have doubled in the last 20 years, many are remarrying and starting new families. In 1980, 19% of married people ages 50 and older were in remarriages compared with 30% in 2009, according to a study by the National Center for Family & Marriage Research. Not everyone is looking for marriage, but the desire for love and companionship is still alive and well, said Terri Orbuch, psychologist and relationship expert at OurTime.com, a dating website for the 50-and-over crowd. But for those who have done a bit of soul-searching, the approach to finding a new mate often is more refined. ""Baby boomers are more settled in their behaviors and patterns of life. They are concerned about whether it is worth changing ... to allow someone new into their life,"" she said. ""And, the majority of baby boomers are more focused on compatibility, and finding someone who makes them happy, than they were when they were younger."" Boomers who spoke with Orbuch for her forthcoming book, ""Finding Love Again: 6 Simple Steps to a New and Happy Relationship,"" had three major takeaways from unsuccessful marriages, she said. The first is that communication is key, and not just ""maintenance communication."" ""You can't only talk about work, family, who does what around the house or your relationship. To communicate well, partners need to reveal more about themselves."" On turning 40 . Second, make sure you partner knows that he or she is important to you. ""Life gets busy and stressed and it is important that your spouse knows you don't take them for granted. Give them frequent affirmation, though simple gestures (hug, kiss, turn on the coffee pot in the morning, bring in the newspaper) and words (thank you, you are the best partner, you look so beautiful today)."" And last but not least, talk about money, early and often, she said. Fifty percent of the divorced singles in her study said that they fought so much about money in their first marriage that they anticipated money will be a problem in their next relationship. ""Divorced singles said they have learned that they would discuss money with their partner early on and more often, so that it isn't such an issue. They would devise a plan they both could live with,"" she said. David and Natalie Kizelewicz both had jobs when they started dating and still do, which helps them maintain a comfortable lifestyle with some money left over for a vacation each year. They were also able to buy a car for Natalie's daughter and help her with living expenses while she's in college, something David was unable to do for his first four children. ""My older kids might be a little resentful of the younger kids because they can see that they have an easier life,"" he said. ""But I gave them the best years of my life. If they wanted to go to college, they could, and now they're all happily married or own homes and have good jobs. They're successful in life."" In order to maintain their lifestyle, he estimates he'll be working for at least another 10 years until their youngest goes to college. But, that's OK, he said. ""I hate being bored."" When it comes to a blended family, they have it all: adult children from previous marriages and grandchildren who are older than their 13-year-old daughter. Plus, they've had custody of Natalie's 7-year-old nephew since he was an infant. The staggered ages and familial ties are confusing to outsiders, but everyone gets along, he said. His grandchildren play with his children younger as if they were cousins. When David's grandson was in the same school as his daughter, he got a kick out of telling everyone she was his aunt, he said. The do's and don'ts of dating after 50 . It wasn't much of a stretch for David's adult children to adjust to Natalie, especially since his oldest son set them up, the couple said. Early on, Natalie's family and daughter approved of him despite the age difference because he treated her so well, she said. ""They said he was the best thing that ever happened to me,"" she said. ""I saw how he raised his kids and doted on them, so I knew he would be a good father."" The Kizelewiczes have also dealt with medical problems, a common issue for couples marrying late in life. Two weeks after the birth of their daughter, David had prostate surgery after being diagnosed with cancer a month before the baby's due date. Years later, he has it under control as a result of the couple's combined efforts to stay on top of appointments and medications, Natalie said. Otherwise, Natalie no longer feels the age difference as much as she used to, she said. David has slowed down a bit, but so has she. Their 7-year-old nephew seems to notice, asking how old David will be when the boy reaches his age. ""He tells him, 'I'm going to live until I'm 100; don't you worry,'"" she said. David also thinks about it sometimes -- when Natalie is 60, he'll be 80. ""Though we have a really good life right now, that's the only thing I kind of worry about,"" he said. ""That's time to come, but so far it's been great. Age hasn't really caught up to us."" Follow CNN Living on Facebook and Emanuella Grinberg on Twitter .

"Paris (CNN) -- It was a confident decision and it paid off. The Duchess of Cornwall could have chosen other cities for her first solo overseas tour, but she chose Paris, a city closely -- and tragically -- associated with Diana, the first wife of Prince Charles. But Camilla came here despite that, not because of it. This is more about Camilla's long-term rehabilitation from being ""the other woman"" to queen-in-waiting and the strategy is working. Diana may have been a fashion icon who famously championed Dior handbags, but Camilla didn't shy away from accepting an invitation to Dior in Paris in her own right. A Clarence House spokeswoman told me the duchess was, ""delighted to accept as she was keen to highlight the wonderful skill and craftsmanship involved in this renowned french fashion house."" And I saw her clearly fascinated by the intricacy of the work being done in the couture workshop on the top floor. Camilla, unlike Diana, isn't defined particularly by fashion. She's more about country living and was in her element watching an equine display by the Republican Guard in Paris. She went behind the scenes to meet the horses and speak to the farrier making their shoes. She's a hands-on duchess, unafraid of getting her hands dirty. She's as comfortable with a farrier as she is with presidents and prime ministers. She is something of a social chameleon, able to move between easily different groups with ease, including the press pack. In a typical Camilla moment, she arrived Paris with a smile and greeted the media with a big hello, then went on to admit nerves. Camilla's common touch came out during an unannounced visit to a street market. A butcher asked her to try a sample. She of course obliged and he was struck about how nice she was: ""Very agreeable, bearing in mind her status,"" he told me. At another stall, she bought five dresses for a grand-daughters from a trader who described the duchess as polite and said she ""loved everything. She was very respectful."" A royal source in the past described to me how the duchess is a ""professional grandmother."" There's more to the Duchess of Cornwall than you see: invariably she manages to win people round when she comes face to face with them, despite the Diana back-story we all know so well. We will be getting more insight into her character as she takes on more official duties. The queen is cutting back on her travel and Prince Charles with Camilla are increasingly being asked to represent the monarchy, which will one day be theirs. We're being given in a sense Camilla, queen-in-waiting, not just Prince Charles's wife.","The Duchess of Cornwall began her first solo overseas tour in Paris on May 28 .

"(CNN) -- A Maryland man severely injured in an alleged assault at a Baltimore Orioles baseball game was revived by an off-duty state trooper at the scene who apparently didn't know immediately the victim was a childhood friend. Nathan Steelman was seated a few sections away on Wednesday night at Camden Yards when Matthew Fortese, 25, was punched in the side of the head during an apparent argument with two other men and fell off a wall, police records show. His head hit the pavement below with a loud thump. The incident apparently was triggered when the men sitting in the section behind Fortese apparently taunted him about his New York Yankees hat and threw beer on him, his brother, James, said. Fortese was not breathing and was bleeding badly from behind his head when Steelman reached him. Steelman pried open his mouth and cleared his airway, allowing Fortese to breathe on his own, Steelman said. It wasn't until later that Steelman realized he had known Fortese for years. ""I think instinct kind of kicked in,"" Steelman told CNN on Friday. ""I didn't know it was Matt at the time."" ""I grew up with him playing baseball together,"" Steelman said. Fortese remains in intensive care in stable condition with a fractured skull at Maryland Shock Trauma Center, James Fortese said. ""He's not confrontational,"" his brother told CNN. ""He was just trying to enjoy the game."" Two men were charged in the incident and were held on $50,000 bond, authorities said. Orioles spokesman Greg Bader confirmed the team was aware of the incident but had no further comment.

"(CNN) -- Braxton Bielski didn't have a 5-pound bass on his mind when he recently took his cane pole to a reservoir in south Texas. Instead, he and his father were looking to bag a big alligator. They weren't disappointed. Bielski, 18, caught an 800-pound, 14-foot, 3-inch specimen, the largest to be certified in Texas. ""He's wanted to hunt alligators for years,"" Troy Bielski said of his son, according to a statement from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department. Braxton, a high school senior, went on his first alligator hunt at Choke Canyon Reservoir in the James E. Daughtrey Wildlife Management Area. The Bielskis were among 481 applicants vying for 10 alligator permits for the public hunt. After undergoing an orientation, father and son placed their baited lines near a large gator they spied in a cove. ""When the two hunters returned the next morning, they realized they had their work cut out as both lines were down indicating they had two alligators hooked,"" the wildlife department said. ""A hook and line set baited with raw meat is used to catch the alligator; only after it has been hooked can a gator be dispatched at close range with a firearm."" Braxton caught the gator on May 7. His father is a Houston police officer. Some may wonder whether there is something in the water at Choke Canyon Reservoir that makes for such a behemoth. Actually, the area is relatively new to gator hunting and most are left alone to live to old age. Braxton's catch may have been as old as 50, officials said.","Texas teenager goes on his first alligator hunt .

"(CNN) -- Lampooning politicians in Kenya's The Nation newspaper has been cartoonist Godfrey Mwampembwa's job since 1992, but it was his vocation long before that. Better known by his pen name Gado, Mwampembwa started drawing as a teenager and soon found that blending satire with his drawings could lead to a career. Freelance jobs at newspapers and magazines in Tanzania and Kenya followed for Dar es Salaam's Daily News, Business Times and The Express. Since 1992, Gado has worked as an editorial cartoonist and illustrator for the Kenyan-based Daily Nation, the largest newspaper in East and Central Africa. But now the cartoonist has taken his 2D black-and-white satirizing from the page to the screen. Mwampembwa was the brains behind ""The XYZ Show,"" Kenya's first satirical puppet TV show that aired earlier this year. ""The XYZ Show"" is based on the hugely popular ""Spitting Image"" show that aired in the UK from 1984 to 1996, and France's popular ""Les Guignols,"" featuring latex caricature puppets of politicians and celebrities. ""The XYZ Show"" had been in the pipeline since 2002, but Mwampembwa found it a tough sell to broadcasters in areas where more Western-style satire had not been seen before. There was also the issue of keeping editorial control over the project. ""We said, 'We would control the content, because we know where we want to take this. We want it to be independent. We want it to be fair. We want it to be hard-hitting,'"" Mwampembwa told Variety magazine. In the end, financial support from the Ford Foundation arrived to breathe life into the project and its latex puppets. While entertaining, the show is also making people think about and discuss the issues that made Mwampembwa pick up his pen and get ""The XYZ Show"" on air. Kenya's disputed election in December 2007 added even more fuel to his exposé of Kenyan politics. ""After the 2007 elections, we argued that it was the right time for a show like this, that Kenya needed a show like this: We have one [coalition] government and no opposition so we needed to strengthen criticism,"" Mwampembwa told the Global Post. Many don't take kindly to the criticism; Mwampembwa has allegedly faced threats to his personal safety during his career. But that ""The XYZ Show"" could be broadcast shows a freedom of media in Kenya that Mwampembwa appreciates. As for keeping a keen eye on the country's politicians, he believes it's not his job alone. ""I think it's everybody's duty,"" he told the BBC. ""You can't put that responsibility on one individual, as every Kenyan should contribute to expose what is happening and to expose corruption.""

"(CNN) -- Hospitals near Aurora, Colorado, were flooded with victims after a movie theater shooting Friday morning. An Aurora Fire Department call log reveals the urgency of the situation. ""If they're dead just leave them,"" a voice tells a fire department responder who reported that police said there may be a number of people dead inside the theater. ""We're in a mass casualty situation at this time. Please make sure that you guys set up some kind of transport officer over there that can contact the hospitals so we don't overload one."" The emergency department at Denver Health Hospital was chaotic as staff prepared for the arrival of patients from the shooting, said Dr. Christopher Colwell, director of emergency medical services there. The hospital received seven victims, but called in extra personnel and was ready to take in more patients. ""You're not sure how they're going to arrive to you, so you prepare for the worst,"" he said. Shooter had 100-round rifle magazine . Gunshot wound patients are fairly regular at Denver Health, although not on this scale, he said. In a mass shooting situation, staff assess the severity of the wounds and what steps must be taken -- some need to go straight to the operating room, others can wait, still others may not require surgery. Colwell was a physician who treated victims at the scene of the Columbine High School shootings in 1999. Five patients were transferred to Denver Health; all survived. ""We have obviously done a lot of training exercises since then to try to prepare for an event like that,"" Colwell said. Dr. Frank Lansville, medical director of emergency services at Aurora South Hospital, told CNN his hospital had seen 18 patients so far, 12 of whom suffered from gunshot wounds. There were several tear gas victims who were stable, he said. They had been seen, decontaminated and discharged. ""The others had horrific gunshot wounds to various parts of their body,"" he said. At Aurora Medical Center, the first victim of the movie theater shooting came in before the staff had even heard about the attack, said Tracy Lauzon, director of EMS and trauma services at the hospital. Few hints of movie-theater shooting suspect's past . Soon after, the trauma surgeon learned more victims were headed their way. Four other trauma surgeons, two orthopedic surgeons and various other physicians came to help. Six patients have gone through surgery. Aurora Medical Center has taken in 15 patients from the shooting, she said. Eight have been treated and discharged from the emergency room; the other seven were admitted. ""We do drills twice a year anticipating this kind of thing, so people are very well prepared and the hospitals are very well prepared,"" Lauzon said. Most of the hospitals in the Denver area follow established federal guidelines for emergency response, said Nicole Williams, spokeswoman for Swedish Medical Center, which treated four victims from the shooting at the movie theater. ""We were extremely prepared coming into this,"" she said because the hospital has already completed a couple of disaster drills this year. During such a drill, a mass page goes out to the hospital administration alerting officials that EMS has multiple patients who could be transported to area hospitals, and the staff is told be on standby. Emergency workers call the hospitals to see how many beds are available and how many critical patients they can take. Then, the hospital brings in essential staff, in addition to extra trauma surgeons or other specialists as needed. ""It's a very controlled atmosphere,"" Williams said. ""We all try to stay very calm and just serve the community to the best of our abilities."" Theater shooting unfolds in real time over social media . Staff at Swedish Medical Center's command center fielded hundreds of phone calls ""from very panicked people looking for their husbands, their wives, their children,"" Williams said. Swedish Medical Center was still treating three patients for gunshot wounds: an 18-year-old male in fair condition, a 20-year-old male in critical condition and a 29-year-old female in critical condition. A fourth patient, a 19-year-old female, came in a few hours after the shootings with minor injuries, possibly caused by shrapnel. She was treated and released. The family members of the victims at the hospital have been notified, Williams said. ""All of the victims have loved ones -- family or friends -- by their side, while they're here,"" she said. Kari Goerke, Swedish Medical Center's chief nursing officer, worked in the operating room in the aftermath of the Columbine shootings of 1999. Swedish Medical Center treated four Columbine victims, all of whom survived. ""We had them all in the operating room within an hour of the event,"" Goerke said. ""That gives them much better chances."" The staff responded with expertise and compassion both in 1999 and on Friday morning, she said. Aspiring sports reporter killed in shooting . ""Afterwards you kind of think about what's happened and the shock and awe of the whole situation and how horrific it is,"" she said. Her voice cracked as she discussed the emotional aftermath.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A restaurant shut down by police last week for repeatedly violating Spain's tough new anti-smoking law will reopen next month smoke-free, the owner of the establishment said Thursday. Jose Antonio Arias, the owner of El Asador Guadalmina, defiantly vowed a week ago that no one would close his business. But Thursday he said he had decided to obey the law out of concern for his 16 employees and their families. ""I have decided to accept the law,"" Arias told reporters at a news conference at his restaurant, hours after regional health authorities said he had written to them, agreeing to adhere to the law that prohibits smoking in all indoor bars and restaurants. Authorities said he still faces a nearly $200,000 fine for allowing smokers in his locale for nearly six weeks after the new law took effect January 2. Arias last week told Spanish media he would never pay the fine, and health officials sent police on February 10 to close his restaurant, located near the popular southern Mediterranean resort of Marbella. The closure of the restaurant was believed to be the first nationwide since the law went into effect, a Spanish health ministry spokesman said last week. Before the shutdown, Arias said, ""I am using my constitutional rights as a citizen and I'm not going to be run over by this dictatorial, Marxist, terrorist government."" The twice-elected Socialist government won backing for a law in 2006 that essentially allowed many bars and restaurants to choose if they would prohibit smoking. But as smoking continued across Spain, parliament followed up with the tougher one that banned such indoor smoking. The law puts Spain in line with the strictest European countries -- Britain, France and Italy -- which prohibit smoking in all enclosed public spaces. The Spanish government says most of the nation's 300,000 bars and restaurants are complying with the new law. Many have added to their outdoor terrace space, or put in outdoor heating, so that clients can step outside for a smoke, where it is allowed. Regional health inspectors visited Arias' restaurant Wednesday to confirm that large signs which previously stated ""this law will not be applied in our establishment"" had been replaced with others that say smoking is prohibited, a regional health service spokeswoman told CNN. Arias, at his news conference on Thursday, claimed he faced the potential fine because of the signs stating his disobedience to the law, and not for letting people smoke in his restaurant. He vowed to continue a signature-gathering campaign across Spain to rally support to overturn the law, which Spain's hotel and restaurant federation says has caused a loss of business for many establishments. Arias said his restaurant will reopen March 10. Until then, he added, the staff will have a vacation.","El Asador Guadalmina will reopen in March and comply with the smoking ban, owner says .

"(CNN) -- Kandi Burruss has broken her silence in the wake of the death of her fiancé, Ashley ""A.J."" Jewell. Kandi Burruss, shown in July at her recording studio, is grappling with the loss of her fiance. The newest cast member of Bravo's hit reality show ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta"" released a statement after Jewell died Saturday following a fistfight. ""I am devastated by the loss of AJ,"" said a statement released by Burruss through her publicist. ""His death comes on the heels of the passing of my beloved Uncle Ralph, and with both of them gone my heart is heavy with grief. ""I had spoken to AJ two hours before I got the call that he was in the hospital,"" the statement went on to say. ""Never in a thousand years did I think it was going to be the last time I heard his voice. There are so many things that I should have said to him, wanted to say to him... But now it's too late."" Police said Jewell and another man fought Friday night in the parking lot of the Atlanta strip club Body Tap. According to police reports, Jewell was taken to a hospital, where he died of blunt force trauma to the head. Fredrick Richardson was arrested on a charge of voluntary manslaughter after witnesses identified him and he was interviewed by police. Burruss, an award-winning singer-songwriter and former member of the R&B group Xscape, also posted a blog on the site ""Hello Beautiful"" in which she hailed Jewell for not only being a good father to his children, but also to ""other children that he raised and loved like his own, including mine."" ""So AJ was a father to many,"" Burruss said in the blog posting. ""It truly bothered him the way he has been portrayed in the media and actually it has bothered me too. AJ was NOT a 'Scrub' like so many people like to blog and say. He had his own when we got together."" The reality show documented Burruss' mother's disapproval of Jewell as a single father of six. Burruss spoke openly of negative comments about Jewell that appeared on Web sites and in the media. On her Twitter account, Burruss mentioned her surprise that Jewell had apparently set up an account on the networking site the day he died. ""She neva took care of me, I paid the bills! Scrubs don't drive high line luxury cars that I own & buy 5 karat rings seriously,"" a post from that Twitter account said. ""No Scrubs"" was a Grammy-winning hit song co-written by Burruss and performed by the platinum-selling girl-group TLC. Burruss had reportedly told a radio station in August that the couple were on hiatus from their relationship, and the person posting to the Twitter account Burruss refers to as Jewell's identified himself as ""Kandi's ex-fiance."" Cast mates on the ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" offered their condolences via Twitter. ""Please Pray for my dear friend Kandi and her loss.I adored AJ and he will be misssed [sic] dearly,"" cast member Kim Zolciak wrote. In her blog, Burruss advised readers to be cognizant of time. ""When you're young you automatically assume that you got all the TIME in the world but then something like this happens and you realize that you're not guaranteed TIME,"" the blog said. ""It brings to life so many sayings that people say like, 'Tell them that you love them everyday cuz you may never get to say it again' or ""Don't go to bed mad cuz they may not be here tomorrow.'""","Kandi Burruss releases statement after the death of Ashley ""A.J.""

"(EW.com) -- A comedian who didn't risk looking foolish wouldn't even be in the game. In ""The Heat,"" which has the scruffy honor of being the first female buddy-cop action comedy, Melissa McCarthy does more than risk looking foolish â€” she risks coming off as borderline insane, like a dissolute biker--turned--homeless person, like she's royally out of control. Is it any wonder that she shocks the audience into laughter in more scenes than not? With her naughty-angel features, and her italicized gumption that's so stylized it turns sarcasm into a blunt-witted form of sincerity, McCarthy plays Shannon Mullins, a proudly slobby lethal weapon of a Boston police detective who favors fingerless leather gloves, keeps an arsenal of firearms (including a rocket launcher) in her refrigerator, and doles out cut-to-the-quick insults the way that most of us say ''Hello!'' Movies: 10 All-Time Greatest . Mullins gets paired with her opposite number: Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock), an uptight, by-the-book FBI agent in ugly off-the-rack pants suits. Ashburn may be great at catching criminals, but she's so smug about it that she drives even her FBI boss (Demian Bichir) crazy. The laws of the buddy-cop comedy are as basic, familiar and inviolable as the rules of checkers. A pair of law enforcers get yoked together, and they don't pretend to like each other. One is a tut-tutting straight-arrow, the other a wild-card screw-up. And no matter how thick the jokes get, the gods of gunfire and major vehicular damage must be served. There's no reason to think that this time-honored testosterone formula, with two actresses now planted at the center of it, would change all that much, and in ""The Heat,"" it doesn't. Except in one crucial way. Funny ladies packing 'Heat:' Not your typical buddy cop movie . The director, Paul Feig, possesses a highly developed radar for the alternating currents of competition and camaraderie in female relationships. As he proved in ""Bridesmaids"" (2011), the one other major film he's directed, Feig understands how women who don't like each other express their antipathy â€” in ways both more direct and less direct than what men do. In ""The Heat,"" Feig stages scenes like Richard Donner (""Lethal Weapon"") with a touch of George Cukor (""The Women""). He has made a piece of smash-and-grab policier pulp that, through the interplay of Bullock and McCarthy, spins to its own snarly/confessional feminine beat. Movie Style: 20 All-Time Greatest . There's a very funny scene in which Ashburn and Mullins, who have teamed up to nab a drug lord, go undercover at a dance club, where Mullins tries to transform Ashburn's ''bank teller'' outfit into something halfway clubby. She rips off Ashburn's sleeves, then her pant legs, revealing a pair of Spanx. Yet even as Mullins is shredding her partner's clothes and shredding her ego even more, her hilarious lack of mercy comes off as a version of sisterly compassion. Forget the mid-level dealer whose phone they're out to bug. She's trying to save this poor woman from herself. Ashburn's problem is that she's all head and no instinct, a kind of Quantico-trained robot; she doesn't know how to bond. McCarthy plays Mullins' repugnance at her partner's inhuman professionalism with a cringing spontaneity, as when she puts up her hand for a high five, and Ashburn has to go and wreck it by slapping and then clasping that hand. (It's far from the only time in the movie when Mullins looks like she wants to throw up, a motif you would not see in a male buddy comedy.) As long as these two are at loggerheads, ""The Heat"" has a catchy, lock-and-load hostility. It's much more clever than, say, the two ""Bad Boys"" films, and less cartoonish than either the ""Rush Hour"" movies or the ""Lethal Weapon"" sequels (though not ""Lethal Weapon"" itself). With Bullock doing a variation on her ""Miss Congeniality"" geek-tomboy-who-has-to-bloom character, and McCarthy letting her acidly oddball observations rip, the two actresses make their interplay bubble. When Mullins confuses Ashburn's overly fussy pair of pajamas with a tuxedo, it's all wrong, yet somehow right. And when the partners go to an old man's bar and do shots all night, dancing to Deee-Lite's ''Groove Is In the Heart,'' the drunken craziness is infectious enough to make you want to join them. But once these two get to be friends, the comic tension dissipates, and the film's boilerplate drug-dealer plot takes over and goes on and on. ""The Heat"" is fresher than a lot of the male-centric movies it takes off from, because there's little about aggressive guy banter that hasn't been worn to the ground by Hollywood. You can tell how much the times have changed when Ashburn gets an oyster-shucking knife stuck in her thigh, then pulled out, then shoved back, or when she performs a graphic emergency tracheotomy â€” and the blood-gushing grossness is, in every sense, a gag. It's genuinely jolting (in a way that, I suspect, may prove highly commercial) to see women go through these motions. But the motions are still market-tested and machine-tooled.

"(AOL Autos) -- As environment-friendly Martha Stewart might know, that new car smell is not a good thing. The Ecology Center found the Suzuki Forenza was one of the most toxic car models. In fact, inhaling the fumes from your new car can be toxic and are created from a literal soup of chemicals such as arsenic and formaldehyde, which can take years to completely be ""out-gassed"" from your new car's interior materials. In fact, Americans spend so much time in their cars, the ""out-gassing"" of so-called volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from new car interiors and new car seat parts like the steering wheel, dashboard, seats and carpets are a big concern as these are known contributors to acute and long-term health problems. Unfortunately, with the auto industry slowdown on the minds of car execs and politicians, combating indoor air pollution in new cars is not getting much play. Interestingly, automakers in Europe and Japan are serious about making their cars less toxic, especially for those who suffer from environmental allergies. So, can America's Big Three really take on yet another eco challenge in a market focused mostly on fuel efficiency and lowering carbon dioxide emissions? Some American automakers are already making strides to clean up chemical emissions inside their cars. General Motor's vehicles, in fact, showed a 27 percent improvement in cleaning up indoor air pollution, so says findings from The Ecology Center's annual HealthyCar.org study. Using portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) technology, The Ecology Center tests almost 300 new cars and car seats for toxic chemicals like bromine, chlorine, lead and heavy metals. These chemicals have been linked to health issues such as birth defects, liver toxicity, cancer, allergies and impaired learning. ""XRF is the dominate technology used to quickly screen products for harmful chemicals,"" said Jeff Gearhart, director of the Ecology Center's Clean Car Campaign. XRF is used by the Food and Drug Administration, Homeland Security, Consumer Products Safety Commission and many leading companies to screen harmful chemicals in consumer products. ""We still see far too many vehicles that are very chemical intensive,"" Gearhart said. ""The good news is within every vehicle class, we have vehicles we rank that have minimal use of these chemicals."" Some of the least toxic cars found in the Ecology Center study are: . Porsche 911 Honda Accord   Dodge Caliber  Saturn Astra XR  Dodge Charger  BMW M5  Toyota Tacoma  Acura RDX . The study found the following models are the most toxic: . Suzuki Forenza  Suzuki Reno  Lincoln Mark LT  Mitsubishi Eclipse  BMW 128i . For consumers thinking about buying a new car or car set, you can visit HealthyCar.org and search the findings by model or compare models. But is the testing really valid? Officials at Chrysler, which received low or moderate ratings from the Ecology Center for all of their 2008 models, disputed the findings. ""This information is meaningless, however, because the entire study was poorly designed and executed,"" said Max Gates, Chrysler's safety and regulatory communications spokesperson. Basically, Gates said, the study did not measure chemicals in the air of the passenger compartments tested. ""Rather, the test only determined the compounds contained in the materials used to assemble the vehicle. There is no way to determine how much, if any, of those compounds becomes airborne."" Gates called the Ecology Center's annual report a ""scare tactic,"" which amounts to alarming the public ""with no data to support any claims of risk."" To reduce indoor air pollution in all of its vehicles, Gates noted Chrysler has been evaluating passenger compartment air quality regularly and ""consistently screens materials and products, including new products, for their effects on air quality."" ""Chrysler is just plain ignorant of the science,"" retorted The Ecology Center's Gearhart. ""All recent studies, including ours, have found vehicles to be the most universally contaminated environment that we spend in."" Gearhart also claimed that dozens of peer review studies show these chemicals are ""ubiquitous in dust and air in our homes, offices and cars and are building up in our actual bodies."" Allergy-sensitive cars . In Europe, allergy-tested vehicles are all the rage. Surprisingly, Ford Motor Company is one of Europe's leaders in helping make car interiors free of allergens and chemicals. In fact, Ford has more than 100 materials and components tested for their allergy-causing potential by an independent lab based in Germany. ""Additionally, all components likely to have direct and prolonged skin contact such as steering wheel and seat covers, floor mats and seat belts are also dermatologically tested,"" said Adrian Schmitz, Ford of Europe's communications and public affairs director. Schmitz also said Ford avoids or tries to reduce the use of allergy-provoking substances such as latex, chrome or nickel. Ford of Europe's allergy-sensitive models -- such as its all-new Kuga crossover -- are equipped with a high-performance pollen filter, which was also tested by the same independent German lab, TUV. ""The filter effectively prevents pollen, a particular concern for allergy sufferers, from entering the vehicle's interior,"" Schmitz said. Ford offers seven allergy-sensitive models in Europe including the Ka, Focus, C-MAX, S-MAX, Galaxy and Mondeo. These Ford vehicles are the first in the world to have passed these stringent TÜV standards. And earlier this year, Ford became the first car manufacturer to receive the European Centre for Allergy Research Foundations seal of quality. In Japan, Toyota Motor Company says it is also minimizing the negative effects vehicles have on drivers and passengers. ""We strive to reduce the concentration of potentially harmful chemicals, such as volatile organic compounds, in our vehicle manufacturing,"" said Bill Kwong, Toyota's product communications manager based in Torrance, California. Kwong says Toyota's American-built vehicles have been asked to meet voluntary vehicle volatile organic chemical (VOC) standards set by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association by 2011. ""We are currently developing low VOC technologies that will ensure our compliance with these regulations,"" Kwong added. For example, Kwong, said Toyota has worked with its materials suppliers to reduce aldehydes by developing a grade of polyacetal that reduces formaldehyde emissions by 80 percent. ""In addition, we are developing new tape systems to reduce toluene emissions. The new technology reduces the level of toluene emitted by more than 90 percent,"" he said. Toluene can affect the nervous system, causing weakness, confusion, fatigue, vision and hearing loss, nausea and memory loss. Neutralizing that new car smell . So, what if you bought a new car and that new car smell is making you worry about possible health concerns or bothering your allergy-sensitive nose? Brookstone carries an inexpensive ($35) ionic auto air purifier. But does it really work? I tried one out recently in one of my bad-smelling road test cars. Amazingly, the Brookstone ionic air purifier truly did ""neutralize"" that toxic car smell. The purifier easily plugs right into your car's cigarette lighter socket and even includes a built-in socket so you can still charge your phone, MP3 player or personal navigation system. The fit-in-your-hand system works by emitting negatively-charged ions to help remove bad odors, smoke and other airborne pollutants. Plus, studies show negative ions are good for reducing stress and calming nerves, something you definitely need when driving on America's traffic-congested streets and highways.","Fumes from your new car created from soup of harmful chemicals .

"(CNN) -- On December 23, 1971, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act of 1971 into law. The legislation had tremendous bipartisan support and came at a time of great optimism. Many thought its passage would lead to a cure for cancer within a few years. The legislation never mentioned the word ""war,"" but some considered it the country's ""declaration of war on cancer."" The law, and the movement supporting it, brought cancer out of the shadows and put a focus on it. Forty years later, the war is still being waged, and much of the optimism has faded. This year, more than 500,000 Americans will die of cancer. Obviously, this is a war not won, and it is appropriate to ask: What have we gotten from this 40-year war? Today, we know that cancer is far more complicated than imagined in 1971. Science has provided an amazing understanding of the disease at the cellular and molecular level. This understanding is causing medical science to change the definition of cancer from that used since the mid-1840s with a light microscope to a 21st-century definition based on genetics and genomics. The National Cancer Act of 1971 gave added resources to federally sponsored research, especially those supported by the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. The bill expanded the NCI clinical trials network, created NCI-designated cancer centers and encouraged cancer specialists to practice in the community. Most important, the act intended to stimulate basic laboratory research and clinical study and link the two in what is termed translational research. Forty years later, clinical trials have shown impressive treatment outcomes, especially in the early stage of the disease. Unfortunately, few cancers can be cured after spreading from their initial site of origin. In clinical studies, many of the newer treatments for widespread or metastatic cancer extend median survival by just a few months. It is progress but clearly not satisfactory progress. Improvements in clinical trials methodology allow for better understanding of how to assess screening, diagnostic and treatment interventions rigorously, leading to the realization that some interventions have risks as well as benefits. Wisdom and caution must be used when employing new technologies. The expansion of cancer epidemiology and prevention programs combined with basic science has defined many of the causes of cancer and the ways cancer can be prevented. By 1971, studies had shown that tobacco use causes lung cancer and heart disease. Further study has linked tobacco use to 14 more cancers and numerous other diseases. Other established causes of cancer include environmental pollutants and the combination of obesity, high caloric intake and lack of physical activity. The act improved American cancer registries. These registries documented the increase in cancer mortality rates through the 1970s and 1980s and the decline since 1991. After adjusting for age, the cancer death rate has declined 18.3% from 1991 to 2008 (the last year for which data is available). Cancer control efforts have saved thousands from dying. Assuming that the American cancer death rate would have continued to rise from 1991 onward, as it had in the previous 20 years, these efforts prevented more than 130,000 deaths in 2008 alone. This success is largely due to the application of advances in basic, clinical and epidemiologic cancer research findings, both prevention and treatment, largely associated with the National Cancer Act of 1971. Research shows that there is still significant potential benefit to cancer prevention. More than 20% of Americans still use tobacco, and it is still the leading cause of cancer. There has been a dramatic rise in the rate of obesity over the past 40 years. The triad of obesity, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity could emerge as the leading cause of cancer in the United States over the next decade. Indeed, most upsetting is that research shows a substantial number of Americans are not benefiting from the advances resulting from the National Cancer Act. While it is estimated that 130,000 cancer deaths were prevented in the United States in 2008, it is also estimated that 200,000 additional deaths were avoidable. These people died because a substantial proportion of Americans get less than optimal preventive health care, and when diagnosed with cancer, a substantial number receive less than adequate treatment. These are deaths that would not have occurred if the fruits of research, known knowledge in cancer prevention, screening and treatment technologies, had been fully available and applied to the entire population. The casualty count is where the ""war on cancer"" analogy breaks down. In war, more than 200,000 avoidable deaths in one year is an unacceptable outrage. In the war on cancer, it is just forgotten. We need to recommit to the anti-cancer effort; we need to work to get every American the quality health care every human deserves. On the 40th anniversary of the ""declaration of war on cancer,"" the most pertinent question in cancer research is not one of molecular or cell biology. It is ""how do we get adequate high quality health care to include preventive care to the people who deserve it?"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Otis Brawley.","President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act of 1971 .
Legislation brought cancer out of the shadows and put a focus on it, Dr. Otis Brawley says .

What if everyone stares at me? Oh no, now my toes are going numb! These thoughts flew through my head during my second spin class a few weeks ago. Recently, our Fit Nation workouts have picked up in intensity. I have tried new activities and pushed myself beyond my physical comfort zone. When this journey began, I envisioned the biggest obstacle to my success would be physical. But after seven weeks of training, I have become acutely aware of the body part that needs the most conditioning. And much to my surprise, it's not my abs, triceps or quads. It's my mind. I've come to the conclusion that wanting to stop mid-workout has little to do with my body and everything to do with my mind. I know many folks who experience negative self-talk, where that little voice in your head tells you all the reasons you can't do something. My internal dialogue seems to be less focused on telling myself I can't do it and more concerned with developing and executing a workout exit strategy. My brain doesn't say, ""You can't."" It says, ""You shouldn't."" Oh, but I should. And I am. Change your mind, and your body will follow suit. But how do you change your mind? That's the million-dollar question. T-shirt tales: The athlete I used to be . It turns out some cliches are true. The first step is admitting you have a problem. Hi, my name is Tabitha, and I can talk myself out of a workout before I start. I had a long day at work. It's raining. I need to put gas in my car. It's Monday. Venus is in retrograde. You get the idea. Excuses and justifications are the path of least resistance. Here are some other cliches that have proved true during my training: . Listen to your body, not your head. I've been in the middle of many workouts when I desperately wanted to stop. But when I focused on what I was doing, I could ask myself, ""Do I want to stop because I am in pain? Or am I just uncomfortable because I'm sweating, breathing hard and making my body stronger?"" If I am honest with myself, the answer every time has been ""I'm just uncomfortable."" And guess what? I have finished every workout I have started. Get fit and others will follow . The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. I recently read the amazing book ""Finding Ultra"" by Rich Roll. In it he writes, ""There's only one cure for fear. Faith."" That line resonated with me. It helped me understand that as an adult, fear has prevented me from realizing my full physical potential. In the past, fear is what has stopped me from even trying. So now, if I find myself dragging my heels about a workout, I try to identify the why. Usually, it's something silly such as fearing the embarrassment of sharing a lap lane and slowing down another swimmer. Now when I go to pool and find myself in this situation, I simply watch the swimmers for a few minutes. I try to identify someone close to my speed and skill level. I then ask if I can share the lane and tell him or her upfront that I am new to training. This has worked every single time. The real key to overcoming these fears, as Roll pointed out, is faith. Have faith in your journey, in the universe and in yourself. Why being part of a team matters . A picture is worth a thousand words. Everyone, even the toughest endurance athletes, occasionally struggle during workouts. Sometimes the only way I get through particularly tough workouts is visualization. At times, it's remembering the two years I spent in nearly constant pain as I battled ulcerative colitis. Compared with that, the aches and weariness of triathlon training pale. More often, I like to visualize my eventual triathlon success. I envision myself crossing the finish line on a warm, breezy day in Malibu, California, this September. I see myself running into the arms of my husband, daughter, parents and sisters. I imagine that magical mixture of physical exhaustion, elation, pride and disbelief that I actually did it. And it keeps me going. Oh, and that spin class? I did not stop. I finished the class without stopping. And then I ran for 20 minutes afterward.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: How long can you sit on a plane without it taking off? The government has something to say about that subject. The story's coming up in just a few minutes. I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: Bank Investigation . AZUZ: First up, a hearing gets heated on Capitol Hill over one company's role in the financial crisis. Goldman Sachs is, essentially, a bank. And it's been one of the most successful companies on Wall Street for decades. Just like a lot of banks, it took a major hit from the recession and needed help from the government -- a bailout -- in order for it to stay in business. Goldman's been paying that money back. Now, some lawmakers are questioning Goldman about whether it had a role in the recession. During a Senate hearing yesterday, some of those questions got pretty tough. One senator accused Goldman of serving itself instead of its clients. Company executives insist that they did nothing wrong. That is just part of the controversy surrounding Goldman Sachs right now. Christine Romans has more for us on who and what are involved. Christine? (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Carl, this case is about the big housing crash, big money and, of course, big politics. The government agency called the Securities and Exchange Commission has charged one of the most powerful banks on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs, with fraud. The case is complicated, so before we go any further, let's look at the main characters of this story. First, the SEC, or the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is a government agency in charge of regulating Wall Street and protecting investors. Then, there's that investment bank, Goldman Sachs, one of the most profitable and revered players on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs earns money by making its own investments and by helping clients, usually other companies or pension funds or even governments, putting together their own deals. And a third character in this story, billionaire investor John Paulson. So what happened here? The SEC says that Goldman Sachs misled its clients by selling them an investment product comprised of very bad mortgages. It allegedly didn't tell the clients that the product was put together by John Paulson, the billionaire, who hand-picked the mortgages and specifically wanted the product to go south. At the end, investors lost $1 billion and Paulson made $1 billion. Well, who cares? Well, Goldman Sachs is accused of misleading those clients, and that is something that the SEC says is a problem. And Goldman Sachs denies those charges, by the way. The company said in a statement, ""The SEC's charges are completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and its reputation."" John Paulson also says that his role in the deal was ""appropriate and conducted in good faith."" To make the story even more interesting and more complicated, the SEC is now in a little bit of hot water, too. Some Republicans have implied that the agency may have timed these charges against Goldman Sachs to help pass the financial reform legislation, a big issue on Capitol Hill these days, which all Republicans currently oppose. The Securities and Exchange Commission defends its impartiality. But investigation of the investigation is now underway. On Tuesday, executives from Goldman Sachs were on Capitol Hill to answer questions from lawmakers separately. Stay tuned for more news on this case. Carl? (END VIDEO) Web Promo . AZUZ: Thank you, Christine. In that report, you heard Ms. Romans mention ""financial reform legislation."" This is something we've talked about before. Congress is looking at ways to make some changes on Wall Street to try to avoid another financial crisis. The Senate is debating how to move forward on that bill. In the meantime, if you want to learn a little bit more about it, head to the Spotlight section on our home page. You will find an FAQ about the financial reform bill, how it might work, what parts of it Democrats and Republicans agree on. It's all right there in the Spotlight section at CNNStudentNews.com. Word to the Wise . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... tarmac (noun) a road, especially an airport runway, that's paved with tar . source: www.dictionary.com . Tarmac Delay Rule . AZUZ: A new rule about how long planes can sit on the tarmac with passengers on board is scheduled to go into effect tomorrow. How long is too long? According to the U.S. government, anything over three hours. Airlines that hold planes longer than that could face a fine of up to $27,000 per passenger. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says passengers who are on delayed flights that are stuck on the tarmac ""have a right to know they will not be held aboard a plane indefinitely."" A few years ago, there were several reports of planes waiting for takeoff for more than 10 hours. That's part of what led to this new rule. Airlines have said they'll do their best to meet the rule. The head of the Air Travelers Association saying it could lead to more inconvenience for customers. He argues airlines are more likely to cancel flights to avoid fines, and he says the rule puts a time deadline on safety-related activities. U.S. Auto Makers . AZUZ: Switching gears from planes to cars. The recession hit U.S. car companies pretty hard, but things seem to be getting a little bit better. First, Ford. So far this year, the company has made over $2 billion. To compare, by this time last year, Ford had lost almost a billion and a half. The only part of the world where Ford made a profit last year was in South America. Now, it's making money in every region around the globe. But the company says keeping this pace might be hard, because the cost of the materials that Ford uses to make its vehicles is going up. Over at General Motors, plans are underway to upgrade five of the company's auto plants. The goal would be for these locations to build what GM calls a ""new generation"" of fuel-efficient engines. And that could lead to new jobs; about 1,600 of them, according to GM. General Motors has cut about 34,000 jobs from its work force since the end of 2008. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Levang's global studies class at Scott Highlands Middle School in Apple Valley, Minnesota! ""Varsity"" is a shortened version of what word? You know how to play it! Is it: A) Universal, B) Intravarsity, C) Verisimilitude or D) University? Three seconds on the clock -- GO! Varsity comes from university. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! GPAs & Sports . AZUZ: Some of the varsity athletes at East Union High in Manteca, California might have known that. Just like at most schools, if you want to stay on the team, you have to make the grade. But East Union has a unique and very public way of making sure students meet standards. Tim Daly of affiliate KXTV breaks down the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO) TIM DALY, KXTV REPORTER: It's the first thing you see on the school's website: the grade point averages of East Union's athletic teams. At the top is volleyball at 3.33; at the bottom, men's soccer at 2.42. All of them are expected to work in class as hard as they do on the field or court. JACKIE KETNER, EAST UNION SENIOR: It's a cut-and-dry policy: you don't have the grades, you don't play. If sports are really important to you, you're going to have your grades up. Really, to do anything at East Union you have to have your grades up, so there is an incentive to keep your grades up, which I think is good. DALY: It's not just the website. Posters all around East Union show athletes with an academic theme. Tyler Bylow, on the left, says the school's approach has athletes pushing other athletes. TYLER BYLOW, EAST UNION SENIOR: If you have a teammate in class, and you see him, you'll ask him, ""What did you get on that test? Did you turn your homework in?"" Stuff like that. You remind him, ""You need to get that stuff turned in, because we need you on the team."" DALY: East Union began putting team GPAs on the school's website last year. Now, very few teams lose players who let their GPAs drop below 2.0. JOHN ALBA, EAST UNION PRINCIPAL: The freshmen see seniors, and the seniors tell them you don't play here unless your grades are up, and so it becomes a culture. ERIC SIMONI, EAST UNION ATHLETIC DIRECTOR: There's a stigma on athletes in today's society that hey, it's okay to slide by and not take care of business in the classroom. I don't operate that way, and I think on this campus kids understand the fact that they're not going to operate that way either. DALY: But it's not just the students being pressured to keep their grades up. Their coaches are being evaluated, as well, on how many of their players remain eligible. Stay eligible, they might just end up on a poster. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: All right. Before we go, you might've heard of the domino effect. One Texas school is putting it in action. You may think we're showing this video just because it's a huge domino display. And in part, you're right: It is; 27,000 dominoes were involved. But the real story about this is what those dominoes represent. Dollars; one dollar for each domino. Over the past month, students at the school raised money to help out a school in Haiti that they'd partnered with a couple years back. So, you follow the effect: The students raise money, the money goes to Haiti, and helps rebuild a school that was damaged in January's earthquake. Goodbye . AZUZ: And all the dominoes fall into place. Plus, this story was a great lesson that small efforts can add up to make a big difference. We hope the rest of your day is fantastic!

"(CNN) -- The difficult question of where Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body would be laid to rest appears to have been settled. The remains of the slain Boston Marathon bombings suspect have been entombed thanks to a ""courageous and compassionate individual (who) came forward,"" police in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Thursday. Police did not say where the remains were entombed but did say that they are ""no longer in the city of Worcester,"" where the body had been at a funeral home while a relative and officials tried to determine what to do. The city's police chief ""thanks the community that provided the burial site,"" police said in a written statement. Tsarnaev's mother, meanwhile, appeared confused by the announcement. Speaking to CNN from Russia by phone Thursday evening, Zubeidat Tsarnaev said she didn't know whether her son was buried or where. ""I have no idea what is going on,"" she said. ""They say he is buried, and then he is not. It's crazy. (I hear it's been) authorized, and then it is not done yet. ""I am really sad, really dead inside."" Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni confirmed Thursday afternoon that his nephew is buried outside of Massachusetts and that he has not told Tsarnaev's parents where. He also said that there was no second autopsy: ""I did not do that, I did not do anything."" What would happen to the body of the man who, along with his younger brother, Dzhokhar, was accused of setting off two deadly explosions at the Boston Marathon on April 15 had been a nearly monthlong puzzle. What did suspect's widow know? The body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, killed in a police pursuit days after the bombings, went unclaimed for nearly two weeks. The funeral home in Worcester -- about 40 miles west of downtown Boston -- eventually accepted the remains, and Tsarni worked with the funeral home on what to do next. Tsarni asked several cemeteries, including a Muslim site in Enfield, Connecticut, to take his nephew's remains. Imam Mohamed Haidara, whose mosque oversees that cemetery, said Tsarnaev's remains are not in that city. Enfield Town Manager Matt Coppler said Haidara assured him that Tsarnaev is not there. Picketers in Worcester made it clear they didn't want the body buried there, with one holding a sign that read, ""Bury the garbage in the landfill."" And the city manager of Cambridge, where Tsarnaev lived, said he would not allow Tsarnaev to be buried in the city, asserting that possible protests and media coverage would disrupt the community. Peter Stefan, owner of the Worcester funeral home, said earlier this week that managers of three cemeteries told him they feared reprisals. It also appeared that sending the body overseas was an unlikely option -- Tamerlan Tsarnaev's parents in the Russian region of Dagestan said they would not fly his body back to Russia for burial, citing passport problems, spokeswoman Heda Saratova said. Tsarni said he is satisfied that the ordeal is over. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Paula Newton and Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","NEW: Uncle says nephew is buried out of state and there was no second autopsy .

"(CNN) -- A New York woman accused of trying to cash in on the Newtown elementary school shootings pleaded guilty Thursday to wire fraud and to lying to FBI agents, federal prosecutors in Connecticut said. Nouel Alba, 37, faces sentencing August 29 in Hartford. She is eligible for fines totaling $500,000 and could receive a 25-year prison sentence, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. She entered the plea in Bridgeport. Alba, prosecutors said, set up false bank accounts and claimed she was collecting for a ""funeral fund"" set up on behalf of one of the 20 children killed in the December attacks, Noah Pozner. The woman allegedly claimed to be an aunt of the Sandy Hook Elementary School student. Donations were solicited on a Facebook page. Donors sent $240 to a PayPal account between December 14 and 20, federal prosecutors in New York said this year. CNN was alerted to the story by a relative of the Pozner family. A CNN producer and camera crew went to Alba's home in the Bronx, New York. She said that the bank account referenced on her Facebook page did belong to her. Alba denied being involved in a scam during an appearance on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360Ëš"" in December. The U.S. Attorney's office said that FBI agents contacted Alba after seeing the CNN report and that she told the agents the same thing she told CNN. Alba falsely told agents that she did not post information related to Newtown on her Facebook account, have contact with anyone about such postings or access her PayPal account, prosecutors said in a statement. ""The thought that someone would scheme so quickly and deliberately to benefit from an unspeakable tragedy is beyond belief,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge Kimberly Mertz said in a statement. ""While there wasn't a substantial loss of money in this investigation, there were losses beyond any pecuniary measure."" At Alba's sentencing in late August, victims will be allowed to make impact statements that could affect sentencing, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. The indictment against Alba in December cited CNN's reporting.","Bronx woman posed as aunt of Sandy Hook victim, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- The glaciers in the Himalayas are receding quicker than those in other parts of the world and could disappear altogether by 2035 according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. In retreat: the roof of the world is experiencing rapid summer melting. The result of this deglaciation could be conflict as Himalayan glacial runoff has an essential role in the economies, agriculture and even religions of the regions countries. The Himalayan glaciers form the world's largest ice body outside of the polar caps. Popularly known as the ""Water Tower of Asia,"" they are the source of water for rivers that flow across the continent: the Indus River in Pakistan, the Brahmaputra that flows through Bangladesh, the Mekong that descends through Southeast Asia, the Irrawaddy in Myanmar, the Yellow and Yangtze rivers of China and a multitude of smaller rivers that flow through the Indo-Gangetic plains of Northern India. Satellite data from the Indian Space Applications Center, in Ahmedabad, India, indicates that from 1962 to 2004, more than 1,000 Himalayan glaciers have retreated by around 16 percent. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China's glaciers have shrunk by 5 percent since 1950s. Dr. Vandana Shiva, an environmental activist, physicist and leader in the International Forum on Globalization, has just returned from a ""Climate Yatra,"" a research journey to the Himalayas to study the impact of climate change and the glacial melt upon communities in Asia. ""Himalayan rivers support nearly half of humanity,"" Dr. Shiva told CNN. ""Everyone who depends on water from the Himalayas will be affected."" One area of increasing concern for Shiva is flooding. ""In Ladakh villages have already been washed away due to flash floods,"" she said. The situation has exacerbated the occurrence of Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs). Impacts include loss of lives, domestic property, cultivable land, mountain infrastructure downstream, forced migration and long-term secondary environmental degradation. In the short term, the glacial retreat could cause not just an overflow of rivers within countries, but more significantly, a cross border overflow into countries that already have a history of tension. Rivers such as the Indus, Jhelum, Ravi, Bias and Sutlej rivers, are shared between India and Pakistan (that have fought five wars since 1947) while melt-water from the Tibetan glaciers supply both India and China (that fought a war over disputed Himalayan border territory in 1962). Both India and China are exploring opportunities to harness Himalayan waters for hydroelectric power projects, and while the initial melt promises to provide plenty of water for both sides, the loss of glaciers could lead to water shortages further in the future. Underground aquifers in Asia depend heavily on snow melt during the dry summer season, and long-term implications of the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers mean that access to water could become a serious political problem. According to Wendy Barnaby, editor of People and Science magazine, the United Nations issued a warning in February this year that climate change harbors the potential for serious conflicts over water.  Watch how the U.S. military is preparing for potential climate change conflicts » . Water-related conflicts have already been witnessed in other parts of the globe such as in the West Bank and in Darfur. According to Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, almost 70 percent of the non-monsoon flows in almost all the Himalayan rivers come from glacier melt. International water security issues within Asia could be likely since the waters of the Indus, Ganges and the Brahmaptura basins flow into China in the upstream, and are shared across South Asia in the downstream. Dr. Shiva believes the situation will render major security issues, between India and China particularly, as flows reduce and demands intensify. In India, deglaciation poses the question of political and social upheaval within the country itself. According to Thakkar, the rate of retreat for the Gangotri glacier over the last three decades was more than three times the rate during the preceding 200 years. The Gangotri feeds the River Ganges, India's holiest river which has historically been a focal point for Hinduism. That the Ganges could become a seasonal river in the near future will throw a spanner in the works of Hindu religious customs, woven into the socio-economic life and culture of Northern India. Moreover, future water allocation that favors economics over religion could spark conflict in a society that already experiences religious and inter-communal strife. Even though some authorities in India do not consider the phenomenon to be particularly alarming, there is an increased understanding that the melting of Himalayan snows is real and needs to be taken seriously. China and India are expected to sign an agreement this month that will enable scientists to cooperate on cross border research with regard to the Himalayan glacial melt.","Climate change has potential for conflict over water resources .

"(CNN) -- One of the world's leading tennis players has apologized after swearing at members of the crowd at the French Open, having been angered by two people who he said were purposefully trying to put him off. Janko Tipsarevic, who has dropped outside the top-10 this year, lost his cool halfway through Saturday's defeat by Mikhail Youzhny -- which cost him a place in the last 16 of the season's second grand slam tournament. ""I just snapped, because you could really see they didn't really care what the score was or even who was playing,"" the Serbian told reporters. ""They just wanted to look nice and be at the French Open. They had no respect to the players in terms of being quiet or whatever. Interactive: The secrets of French Open champions . ""So at one point I was getting ready to serve at, I think, 30-15 on my serve and one of the guys just started screaming, calling somebody to the stands."" The duo were reportedly ejected from the stadium, but Tipsarevic said he regretted his actions. ""There is no excuse for my behaviour. I think basically the problem was that I used the F word and that was not pretty. But, on the other hand, I just snapped. It happens to everyone."" Tipsarevic, ranked 12th but seeded eighth for the clay event, lost 6-4 6-4 6-3 to Youzhny as he struggled to recover from Friday's five-set win over Spain's Feliciano Lopez in the third round. ""Youzhny was a much better player from beginning to end,"" he said. ""My feet were just not there. I've not been feeling well for two, three days now, getting half sick, feverish. The match yesterday completely destroyed me."" Youzhny, once ranked as high as eighth but now down 31st, reached the last 16 at Roland Garros for the first time since his quarterfinal effort in 2010. The 30-year-old Russian will next face 35-year-old German Tommy Haas, who needed 13 match points before finally overcoming American John Isner 7-5 7-6 (7-4) 4-6 6-7 (10-12) 10-8 in a match lasting four hours 37 minutes. Meanwhile, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic and defending champion Rafael Nadal remain on course for a semifinal showdown. Nadal, seeking to become the first man to win a grand slam eight times, again had a slow start against fired-up Italian Fabio Fognini but prevailed 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 6-4 for his first straight-sets win this week. The Spaniard, who complained Friday about the tournament scheduling that had given his opponent extra rest time, will next face world No. 15 Kei Nishikori. The 23-year-old became the first Japanese male to reach the last 16 at Roland Garros since 1938 as he beat home player Benoit Paire 6-3 6-7 (3-7) 6-4 6-1. The Frenchman criticized the chair umpire after being docked a point for receiving coaching when on the verge on clinching the second set. ""They would never do this to the top-five players. They would never issue a warning and apply a penalty point, because they know full well that you just can't do that type of thing,"" Paire said. Djokovic, seeking to win the only grand slam that has eluded him, brushed off the challenge of Grigor Dimitrov as he beat Bulgaria's rising star 6-2 6-2 6-3. It came on the day that the Serbian tennis federation announced the death of the woman who discovered Djokovic as a six-year-old boy and coached him until he was 11. Jelena Gencic, who also worked with grand slam champions Monica Seles and Goran Ivanisevic, was 77 when she passed away. Djokovic, who became the 40th player on the ATP Tour to register 500 career match wins, will next play German 16th seed Phillipp Kohlschreiber as he seeks to improve on last year's final defeat to Nadal. World No. 9 Richard Gasquet kept alive France's hopes of a first men's title in 30 years, beating Russia's Nikolay Davydenko 6-4 6-4 6-3 to earn a last-16 clash with Swiss ninth seed Stanislas Wawrinka. In the women's draw, world No. 2 Maria Sharapova and third-ranked Victoria Azarenka reached the last 16 despite struggling with their serves. Defending champion Sharapova rallied from 4-1 down in the second set against Zheng Jie to beat China's world No. 43 6-1 7-5 despite making 34 unforced errors in a match featuring 11 breaks of serve. The Russian will next play 20-year-old American Sloane Stephens, who reached the fourth round for the second successive season with a three-set victory over New Zealand's Marina Erakovic. Stephens, who reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in January for her best career result, lost in straight sets to Sharapova in Rome last month. Former world No. 1 Azarenka beat France's Alize Cornet 4-6 6-3 6-1 despite dropping serve six times. ""If I can win that match serving like this, that's pretty remarkable,"" said the Belorussian, who will next face 2010 champion Francesca Schiavone. The Italian, also the 2011 runner-up but now dropped to 50th in the rankings, crushed French 13th seed Marion Bartoli 6-2 6-1. The U.S. will have four women in the fourth round of a grand slam for the first time since 2004 after Jamie Hampton and Bethanie Mattek-Sands joined world No. 1 Serena Williams and Stephens. Hampton, ranked 54th, upset Czech seventh seed Petra Kvitova 6-1 7-6 (9-7) to earn a clash with Serbia's former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic -- who eliminated Australia's 2010 runner-up Sam Stosur despite losing the first set. Mattek-Sands followed up her win over China's 2011 champion Li Na by beating Argentine qualifier Paula Ormaechea 4-6 6-1 6-3 to reach the last 16 for the first time, equaling her best showing in a grand slam. The 28-year-old will next play Russian 12th seed Maria Kirilenko, who beat Switzerland's Stefanie Voegele 7-6 (7-3) 7-5.","World No. 12 Janko Tipsarevic rants at spectators who he said were putting him off .

"(CNN) -- A New Year's Day shooting in which a subway police officer fired a deadly shot into the back of an unarmed man has the San Francisco Bay Area demanding answers as authorities appeal for patience. Oscar Grant, 22, was killed January 1 in a shooting at a subway station in California's Bay Area. Bay Area Rapid Transit spokesman Linton Johnson told CNN affiliate KTVU-TV in Oakland, California, that the officer is presumed innocent and described him as devastated. Attorney John Burris called the shooting ""unconscionable"" and said he filed a $25 million claim with BART on Tuesday, alleging wrongful death and violation of civil rights by use of excessive force. BART has 45 days to respond, Burris said. ""It's a clear shooting in the back that should not have taken place,"" Burris said, characterizing the incident as a case of ""overagressiveness by police."" KTVU obtained at least two videos of the incident and its prelude. One video, which KTVU reported came from a train passenger who wished not to be identified, shows three young men against a wall in the crowded Fruitvale station. Karina Vargas, who also provided a video to KTVU, said the men had been pulled from the train car in front of hers.  Watch the events preceding the shooting » . Burris said Tuesday that the young men had been celebrating the new year at a popular waterfront tourist spot, The Embarcadero. They were heading home when police pulled them from the train car. Some of the young men were handcuffed, but not 22-year-old Oscar Grant. The video from the anonymous passenger shows Grant seated on the floor with his back against the wall. Grant holds up his hands, appearing to plead with police. Burris said Tuesday that Grant was asking police not to use a Taser. ""He said to them, 'Don't Tase me; I have a 4-year-old daughter,' "" Burris said. The interaction on the video is not audible. Seconds later, police put Grant face-down on the ground. Grant appears to struggle. One of the officers kneels on Grant as another officer stands up, tugs at his gun, unholsters it and fires a shot into Grant's back. Burris said the bullet went through Grant's back and then ricocheted off the floor and through his lungs. Grant, who has a 4-year-old daughter, died seven hours later, KTVU reported. ""I couldn't believe it. We was already following directions and everything, and they shot him,"" Fernando Anicete, one of the young men with Grant, told KTVU. Burris has spoken to witnesses who claim that Grant was trying to resolve the situation. ""He had been telling people to calm down. 'Be cool. Just do what they tell you to do,' "" the attorney said. Johnson said the video provided to KTVU is inconclusive. There are two surveillance cameras at the Fruitvale station, but a BART official told CNN that no video is being released at this time. The community is outraged, according to local media. CNN affiliate KRON-TV in San Francisco reported that about 20 people rallied Monday outside BART's district headquarters in Oakland. ""A 22-year-old unarmed father was executed and assassinated, and BART expects us to swallow that the shooting may have been an accident,"" protest organizer Evan Shamar of Oakland shouted through a bullhorn, according to KRON. BART says an investigation is ongoing and hasn't reached any conclusions. The San Francisco Chronicle published an editorial Tuesday demanding answers as well. ""The BART police say that they are taking the investigation very seriously, but they had better find a way to reach out to the public effectively about what is going on and why. Otherwise, public outrage over this case is going to grow exponentially with every passing day,"" the newspaper said. BART Police Chief Gary Gee released a statement this week expressing condolences for Grant's family and saying the authority is cooperating with the Alameda County district attorney's office, which is also investigating. Gee added that BART will complete an ""unbiased and thorough investigation"" and asked the public to be patient. ""As frustrating as it is, I want to stress that we cannot and will not jeopardize this case by discussing details before the investigation is complete,"" Gee said. Gee provided minor details of what preceded the shooting: BART police received a report that two groups of passengers were involved in an altercation as their train left the West Oakland Station about 2 a.m. ""BART police officers responded to the platform at Fruitvale and detained several persons,"" Gee said in his statement. BART has not identified the officer, saying only that he has been on the force two years. He has undergone drug and alcohol testing and is on administrative leave, both of which are standard procedure, according to BART. The officer has yet to make a public statement. Johnson and Gee say they are refraining from releasing further details to avoid compromising the investigation. Johnson further told KTVU that BART wanted to avoid ""polluting the potential pool of witnesses."" Burris, however, said there is no excuse for the use of force on a man being restrained by police. If BART does not grant his $25 million claim or if the authority fails to respond in 45 days, Burris intends to file a lawsuit, he said. Burris, who served as Rodney King's co-counsel in King's civil case against the Los Angeles Police Department, said he also wants criminal charges filed against the officer. He is pushing the Alameda County District Attorney Tom Orloff to press second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter charges, he said. Second-degree murder charges would be warranted if the officer shot Grant in the back when Grant posed no danger, Burris said. However, there are reports speculating that the officer accidentally shot Grant, in which case involuntary manslaughter charges would be appropriate, Burris said. ""No one wants to believe a cop would just kill somebody like that,"" he said. ""My view is, this is criminal conduct, period."" Johnson told KTVU that authorities are trying to determine whether the officer who shot Grant accidentally drew his gun instead of his Taser. He also said authorities still need to speak to all the officers but that the BART officers involved in the incident felt outnumbered and called the Oakland Police Department for backup. iReport.com: 'I'm not happy with the state of the police' ""We need to take our time and go through this thoroughly and try to figure everything out. There's more to this story than this one angle,"" Johnson told the station. Asked whether there were developments Tuesday, Johnson said he had none. Thomas Blalock, president of BART's board of directors, has urged the public not to jump to conclusions. ""Let's get the puzzle put together, and then we'll come to a conclusion,"" Blalock told KTVU. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Augie Martin and Randi Kaye contributed to this report.","Attorney files $25 million claim, calls shooting ""unconscionable""

"(CNN) -- The eight years under Mahmoud Ahmadinejad can be marked for his defiance of the West in pursuit of nuclear development. But Iranians, especially in the past two years, have paid a dear price for that position. Economic isolation, with round after round of sanctions, in a globalized world of trade and currency transactions remains painful. ""I calculate what I call a misery index. It's been since 1991 about two times as high in Iran as it even was in Egypt at the height of the Arab Spring,"" said Steve H. Hanke of Johns Hopkins University during a visit to the region. ""So in relative terms the mismanagement in Iran is just phenomenal."" More: Presidential candidates 'cry for overhaul of foreign policy' This is best reflected in the value of the Iranian real, which has plummeted as much as 80% as U.S.- and European- led sanctions target the country's central bank and other financial institutions. The basic staples skyrocketed in price last autumn during the height of the currency crisis. Chicken prices went up three fold; bread went up five-fold as the cost of imports soared with a weakened currency due to the sanctions. Empty stalls in the Iranian souk in Abu Dhabi which were filled with handicrafts of tradesman visiting from Iran each month have been replaced by garden plant shops with Indian owners. Trade between Iran and the United Arab Emirates has dropped nearly a third in the past year, according the local Chamber of Commerce. The selling of Iranian handicrafts is one matter, but it's the sanctions against Iranian crude which are hitting state coffers the hardest. Daily oil production is hovering around two and a half million barrels a day. This is the lowest in more than two decades, according to the Paris based International Energy Agency, having been cut a million barrels a day. Using a conservative calculation of $90 a barrel that lost export production is costing Iran $33 billion in revenues per annum. Read more: Who's running in Iran's presidential election? Even nations that maintain good relations with Iran, like India, have been forced to cut back on oil imports. U.S. Senator Robert Menendez helped draft the last round of sanctions at the beginning of this month. The Western- led sanctions, he says, are designed to give the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the new president a distinct choice. ""We think we can drive a clear choice for the Supreme Leader that either my country ultimately has an economic collapse or I divert myself and I can divert myself from nuclear weapons,"" said Menendez during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Jordan. In their final debate last Friday on foreign affairs in Iran, moderate voices of the carefully chosen candidates talked of a ""need to get away from extremism,"" referring to the hardened line against nuclear inspections. Opinion: Presidential elections without buzz . Iranians are eager to see if the election gives the ultimate leadership in Tehran reason to open up a new chapter in foreign relations. Iran is loaded with potential. Jim O'Neill, the creator of the BRIC acronym and author of ""The Growth Map"" said in his book that Iran deserved to be in his group of the Next 11 fast growing economies and that ""the prospect of membership could also serve to motivate countries"" such as Iran, Pakistan and Nigeria. The country is a big market, with 78 million highly educated people. It has the world's second largest gas reserves and is in the top five of proven oil reserves. Iran's geographical position at the heart of the Middle East provides excellent distribution potential to the fast growing and energy-hungry markets of China, India and Africa. But the building blocks to construct a solid, export driven economy, along the lines of the German industrial model, cannot be put in place under the current strategy according to Afshin Molavi of Oxford Analytica. ""Absent the removal of sanctions, Iran's economy will never achieve the potential that it is capable of achieving. Iran could be the Germany of the Middle East."" It could be an economic power, but much depends on whether this presidential election reaffirms Iran's appetite to defy the West and pursue its nuclear ambitions.","Iran's defiance of the West in pursuit of nuclear development puts it into economic isolation .

"(CNN) -- A member of one of the ruling royal families in the oil-rich United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Ali al Nuaimi's work as an environmental campaigner might seem an unlikely vocation. But, Al Nuaimi, 45, affectionately known internationally as the ""Green Sheikh,"" abandoned a lucrative career in the petroleum industry to pursue a vocation defending the climate. After completing a doctorate in Cleaner Production and Industrial Eco-systems, Al Nuaimi -- whose uncle is ruler of Ajman, the smallest of the UAE's seven emirates -- joined the government as environmental adviser. The Green Sheikh now works as chairman of the International Steering Committee for the Global Initiative Towards a Sustainable Iraq and is honorable president of the Zayed Environmental Impact Network, at the UAE's Zayed University. In an interview with CNN's Road to Rio, he talks about how he mitigates his own carbon footprint in daily life, his role in the forthcoming Rio+20 earth summit and says of his previous career in the oil industry: ""You want to go to paradise? First you go to hell."" CNN: Why do they call you the Green Sheikh? Al Nuaimi: It is not what people normally think of green like (the) color of an object. Green for me means, G for global, R for rethink, E for enlightenment -- we need guidance, we need a way to follow ... the other E is ethics -- morals, values; and last one is N, we can not live alone, we can not live (as) individuals, but we can live together as a network. CNN: You preach about the environment in an oil country ... Some might say they may not care about the environment. What do you think? AN: I studied chemical engineering ... but then I (converted) from polluter to protector ... I have to make a change. The change is to inspire myself, to inspire my people, to think about the capacity of natural resources. CNN: What do you think the problems are when it comes to environment in the UAE? AN: The partnership and the relationship between public, private and NGOs. I think the collaboration is important. We can say it's a problem ... we can say (it's) a challenge. I think the most important thing is cultural and behavioral change. CNN: The U.N. Conference on Sustainable Development is taking place in Rio de Janeiro in a few months. What will be your role at the conference? AN: I want to focus on the youth. Really, I love the youth because even (as) I grow, my soul is young, my heart is young. I think the youth is changing worldwide. The thing is not to tell them what to do ... As someone from (a) ruling family, you are so prestigious, you are so high, when you go down, listening to them, inspiring them, talking to them, giving them the hope ... They feel so motivated and very powerful. CNN: Will the UAE be participating in the conference? AN: Yes, the UAE from the government, from the public and the NGOs delegate, (will) go, and I will be joining them. (It) will be interesting to tell our stories about sustainability in the UAE. CNN: You could have been in the fuel industry and that would have made you more money. But instead you chose to be a protector ... how much did this decision cost you? AN: First of all, I worked in the oil industry (for) about three years. And the gas industry, and I smelled sulfur dioxide; I drank (hydrogen sulfide); I was contaminated with a lot hazardous waste. CNN: So you were an environmental criminal? AN: I was ... You want to go to paradise? First you go to hell. CNN: And, when was the day that you said, that's it? AN: I felt it from inside. My lungs, you know, becoming irritated; my breathing becoming vibrated. And I have seen people are dying, in front of me, (really) dying, when doing exercise through that environment. From that point, I went to the public. I went to the society ... empowering the public; running on the street; telling the people to save the environment -- that was 1996. A lot of people (said): 'Sheikh, are you crazy? You want to clean the road? There we have a lot of labors can do that work for you and for others.' But I said: 'No, we should do that. The cleaning is not just about removing harmful things on the road, no, we have to clean our hearts. We have to clean our mind. We have to think better.' CNN: What would you like to teach your own kids? AN: Habits, the good habits ... Like reduce your income, not income (like) money, income of consumption. If you go to buy a product, do we need (it) all? We go to a restaurant, but if we are five we order for two. I don't order, what I do, the remaining food, I eat from them. So, I keep minimizing my (input), reducing my carbon footprint. CNN: This is a country that has issues with water ... how do you use it on a daily basis? AN: Two minutes per shower. Do you know how many liters (are produced in two minutes)? Fifteen liters. If you ask any ordinary person, they will tell you (they spend)10-15 minutes shower with dancing, with singing -- that's more than 50-60 liters. CNN: The theme for the Rio conference is 'Changing Our Future', what is the future that you want? AN: We need to understand the planet we live on. I think the young people, will learn from me, what resources they are going to keep ... and this resource is not about (natural) resources, but about their future generation.","Sheikh al Nuaimi has acquired nickname ""Green Sheikh"" for his climate campaigning .

"(CNN) -- Insurance agent David Conn received a postcard recently in his Hudson, Ohio, post office box: ""Greetings from Montana."" This postcard was mailed in 1962 and arrived -- perhaps not for the first time -- at its destination in 2009. The card said Fran and Polly were enjoying their cross-country train ride and had fed deer somewhere along the way. That was all nice, and a little curious for several reasons: One, Conn didn't know anyone named Fran or Polly; two, the card was addressed to a different name at his P.O. box; and three, it had been mailed in 1962. ""This card looks like somebody just bought it at the drugstore,"" Conn told CNN. ""It's not even yellowed. It looks spankin' new."" The card was addressed to Marion White, who was editor of Hudson's North Summit Times newspaper and once held the post office box Conn now uses. She later served for more than 20 years on the Hudson Village Council. She died in 1988. A few days after receiving the card, Conn talked to White's relatives and others, who told him the sender had to be Fran Murphey. Murphey was an iconic Akron Beacon Journal reporter who lived her whole life in the same house near Hudson. She died in 1998. Murphey's life was an eccentric mixture of the mundane and the extraordinary. In her 55 years with the Beacon Journal, she became a local celebrity. She was well-known for, among other things, her preference for bib overalls, her love of travel, her sometimes salty language, her expertise on outhouses and her vast collection of postcards -- a quarter of a million of them, according to her niece Barbara Joy Godar. ""She was definitely one of a kind,"" said Godar, 73, of Akron. ""She was a corker."" Murphey's dispatch from Montana chronicled a trip she took with friend and colleague Polly Paffilas, who died in 2005. It bore a 3-cent stamp, the postcard rate in 1962, and was hand-canceled twice on July 5, 1962, with a Smokey Bear indicia at the Helena, Montana, post office. Mail sometimes falls behind machinery or is left in a discarded mail bag and languishes for years at a time, but there's no telling where Murphey's card spent the past 47 years, said Mark Saunders, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service in Washington. Victor Dubina, a postal service spokesman for northern and central Ohio, declined to surmise what happened to Murphey's card. ""Anything I'd guess would be sheer speculation,"" he said. ""Over the course of the years we've seen little things like this pop up, and it's never the same."" It's unlikely the card was lost in the mail since 1962, two antiques dealers said Wednesday. A penciled notation near the stamp indicates the card was sold for $1 at booth ""#32"" in an antique shop somewhere, said Howard Diefenbach, who owns an antique shop in Bay City, Michigan, and Grant Winchell, who sells postcards through Diefenbach's shop. ""It's common practice for most dealers make a mark in pencil on a card to indicate the price and which booth it's from,"" Diefenbach said. Dealers make the mark in pencil so the buyer can erase it without compromising the value of the card, said Winchell, who happens to hold booth number 32 in the shop but doesn't claim any relationship to Murphey's card. The $1 price would be appropriate for that type of card in today's market, he added. Conn isn't sure what he'll do with the card. He may frame it and hang it on his wall. He's also considering donating it to Hudson's historical society or giving it to the Beacon Journal to display. Whatever route the card took, it makes for an interesting artifact, Dubina said. ""This is a lost art,"" he said. ""Anymore, you either send an e-mail or send a tweet: 'I'm on the edge of the Grand Canyon.'  See the postcards that iReporters treasure » . ""Bless Fran's heart, she wrote postcards. We just don't see that much of it anymore,"" Dubina said. ""Thirty years from now, 40 years from now, who's going to say, 'Ooh, I just got an e-mail from Victor'? 'How did I get it? What happened?'"" It's something special for loved ones, too, Saunders added. ""That piece of tangible postcard, that 'Greetings from Montana,' that's almost a piece of that individual that extends beyond their life,"" Saunders said. Murphey built her postcard collection in part by mailing cards to friends while traveling and then asking for them back when she returned, Conn said. ""I can just picture her finally getting back from her trip, saying, 'OK, hey, Marion, where's that card I sent you from Montana?' and [White] said, 'I never got that card from Montana,' and [Murphey] was probably thinking, 'That's part of my collection! Where's the card?'"" Conn said. ""And here it is 47 years later, and it appears."" In her lengthy 1998 obituary in the Beacon Journal, colleagues recounted having to wait in the hallway outside Murphey's hospice room while she made phone calls for one final story. ""When she gets to heaven, I wouldn't be surprised if Fran finds some way to send news from the beyond,"" former Beacon Journal books editor Betsy Lammerding said in the obituary. Looks like she found a way.","Missive from Montana mailed in 1962 arrives at destination in 2009 .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tracy Morgan's mother says she struggled for years to provide the comedian with everything he needed as a child, but now that she's out of work and facing foreclosure he's refusing to help her. Alicia Morgan, in a phone interview with CNN Wednesday, said she called her son last month to say she needed $25,000 to pay off her mortgage, but his assistant called back and told her, ""Tracy would do a one shot deal of $2,000."" ""I was so upset, I told her to tell Tracy 'Thank you, but no thanks. I am not some person on the street asking you for a handout, I am your mother,'"" she said. ""And that was the end of that."" His sister, Asia Morgan, said their mother needs his help soon ""so she doesn't end up on the streets."" Their mother lost her job last year, reducing her income to $600 a month and causing her to fall behind on her $400 monthly mortgage on her Youngstown, Ohio, home, her daughter said. ""If her mortgage is not paid by February 23, 2012, her home will go into foreclosure,"" she said. Tracy Morgan, meanwhile, released a statement to CNN Wednesday night saying he was ""saddened that these untrue stories about me have people questioning my commitment to my family."" The one-paragraph statement continued, ""For reasons that are between us, I have not seen my Mother in 11 years and outside of a random call here and there have had little to no contact with my sister. We all have personal family issues that we have to deal with in life, but I choose to deal with mine in private and not through the media."" In her interview with CNN, Alicia Morgan said her son offered to pay her mortgage after she was laid off from her job last year. ""I faxed him my account number and my mortgage papers,"" Alicia Morgan said. ""I thought he was paying it, but after a few months I realized he didn't pay it off."" His mother said she heard through another relative that her son was angry about publicity given to the story. ""My nephew said that he spoke to Tracy and that Tracy said he wasn't going to pay me because I gave an interview,"" his mother said. ""I never talked to anyone."" Alicia Morgan has five children with Morgan's late father, Asia Morgan said. ""She has asked all of her children for help, but we are no in a position to do so,"" she said. ""We all have jobs, but Tracy is the only one in a position to help."" Their mother, now 62, says she has trouble walking, has diabetes and her unemployment benefits just expired. ""It took me 30 years or more to buy a home,"" she said. ""At times I worked two to three jobs to support my children. They always got what they wanted, including Tracy. No one took care of them but me."" Tracy Morgan, 43, grew up in Brooklyn, but his mother moved the family to Youngstown in 1995, a decade after he left home, his sister said. He rose to fame as a ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member and now stars on NBC's hit sitcom ""30 Rock."" ""We have tried to get in contact with my brother Tracy, but he changes his phone number all the time, so we have no way of talking to him,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Minnesota's House of Representatives passed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, putting the Midwestern state in line to become the 12th nationwide to take that step. Rep. Karen Clark of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota sponsored the bill, which passed Thursday night by a vote of 75-59. Supporters celebrated on the steps of the state capitol after the vote, chanting, ""Thank you, thank you."" The bill will now go to the Senate, where local news reports say it is expected to pass. Gov. Mark Dayton has said he would sign it into law, according to local news website MinnPost. On May 2, Rhode Island became the 10th state to legalize same-sex marriage. Five days later, it was the turn of Delaware, which became the 11th state to sign same-sex marriage into law. The same-sex marriage debate has polarized the United States. In March, a divided Supreme Court heard arguments over the legality of two marriage laws -- the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between one man and one woman, and California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage. The nine justices hinted at disparate views on the hot-button issue, and it was far from clear how they will rule. A decision is expected in June. Other nations around the world are also grappling with the issue. Among them is France, where lawmakers passed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage and adoption last month despite vocal protests from conservatives. Opponents have filed a legal challenge and the bill has not yet been signed into law by the president.","Minnesota's House passes a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage .

"HOBART, Australia -- Sri Lankan batsman Kumar Sangakkara received lavish praise from Australian captain Ricky Ponting and an apology from umpire Rudi Koertzen after his side's 96-run defeat in the second test at Hobart. Sangakkara trudges off in disbelief after being given out for 192. With the Sri Lankans chasing a formidable target of 507 for a win to square the two-test series, Sangakkara kept them afloat with a magnificent 192. But, with his seventh test double hundred in sight, Sangakkara was given out caught by Ponting off Stuart Clark. Television replays suggested that the ball had in fact deflected off the batsman's shoulder. Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene said Koertzen had apologized to Sangakkara for giving him out. ""Rudi came and said sorry to him. But that's it. Kumar being Kumar was fine with it,"" Jayawardene said. ""He was very disappointed at the particular moment but when you sit back after half an hour, you know it's a mistake made by a human and that's it."" Sangakkara went onto the field after the fall of the last wicket and put his arm around Koertzen's shoulder. The 30-year-old right-handed Sangakkara's innings was the highest by a Sri lankan in Australia, surpassing Aravinda de Silva's 167 in Brisbane in 1989. He faced 282 balls and hit 28 boundaries and a six in his 431-minute vigil at the crease. Jayawardene said: ""Kumar's innings was fantastic. One of the best I've seen. He batted the plan we had for him after he got his hundred yesterday, to bat through the day today while the other guys rotate around him so that we can challenge the 500-run total. ""Unfortunately, the other guys couldn't do it. But Kumar batted exceptionally well. The way he handled the situation was brilliant. ""I was very disappointed the way we got out. He's very upset about it, but that's how the game goes I guess."" Ponting, who led Australia to their 14th consecutive test win, was also full of praise for Sangakkara. ""He played beautifully today. I thought the way he struck the ball from about 120 onwards was some of the best hitting that you'll probably ever see with his back to the wall and running out of partners. ""It was a terrific knock. He's obviously been in great form lately. I read in the paper this morning that's six hundreds in his last 12 innings so he's in some good touch. ""He's a very, very good player, he's one of the best Test batsmen going around."" Sangakkara has now scored 5,741 runs in 68 Tests at an average of 55.73. Sri Lanka's hopes dipped with the loss of three wickets for seven runs early in the day but they still reached 410. Brett Lee gained the big breakthrough with the wicket of the experienced Sanath Jayasuriya 20 minutes into the day and his four for 87 gave him eight wickets for the match, 16 for the series, the man-of-the-match title and the player-of-the-series award.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people crowded into a park in central Tokyo on Monday to protest the use of nuclear power in Japan, highlighting the growing opposition to atomic energy in the country since the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant. The peaceful demonstration took place on Japan's national day in an area the size of a large sports field in Yoyogi Park, near the bustling shopping and nightlife district of Shibuya. The event attracted so many people on a hot July public holiday that many spilled out into the surrounding streets, unable to enter the main area. It brought together a broad mix of Japanese people, from seasoned environmental activists to families who hadn't participated in a protest before. The colorful flags dotting the crowd along with the warm weather gave the demonstration the appearance of a summer music festival, but its message was deeply serious. The prominent musician and composed Ryuichi Sakamoto addressed the demonstrators from a stage, calling for an end to nuclear power in Japan. Participants held banners echoing his statements and criticizing the government. Protesters then marched around the surrounding streets, chanting anti-nuclear slogans and drawing traffic to a halt. Demonstrations against atomic energy have become a regular part of Japanese public life since the devastating earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 set off the nuclear disaster at the Fukushima plant. And the protests appear to be gaining momentum. Each Friday, anti-nuclear demonstrators gather outside the Japanese prime minister's office. That protest has been getting bigger and bigger every week, especially since the Japanese government announced the reactivation of the first nuclear reactor since the Fukushima crisis. Though no deaths have been attributed to the nuclear accident, the earthquake and tsunami killed more than 15,000 people in northeastern Japan. The damaged Fukushima spewed radiation, prompting the government to evacuate tens of thousands of people. A recent report by an independent panel commissioned by the Japanese parliament said the Fukushima crisis was a ""man-made disaster"" that could have been avoided. It criticized the actions of the government, regulators and the plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co. CNN's Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo; Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.","Protesters spill out of large open space in central Tokyo .

CNN: ""The Story of Luke"" centers around a guy with autism who's trying to get a job and get a girl. What's been your connection to autism before this film? Seth Green: I don't know that I've had too much of a personal connection. I've met autistic people and I've seen the different ways Hollywood has portrayed them over the years. ""The Story of Luke"" is based on an amalgam of characters that (writer/director) Alonso Mayo met. He wanted to tell a story from the inside of a character who was unaware of something that's different about them. Luke knows he's special because he's told he's special but he doesn't understand that there's limitations to what he can aspire towards. My character is the opposite of that. He's someone on the autistic spectrum who's consistently been told that he's only there to serve as guilt and empathy for anyone that's neurologically typical. So he's become bitter and isolated. CNN: In the last 10 years, you've embraced many different media in getting your work out there. Your new film, ""Sexy Evil Genius,"" is being released on video on demand and iTunes. Is Hollywood dragging their feet in terms of getting content to fans? Is this something you think about? Green: I think about all of that stuff. It's just evolution and the more you try to keep something as you predict it, the faster it will slip away from you. We're in a day and age where anyone under 20 doesn't even understand the concept of ""convergence of media"" because it's already converged. To most teenagers or people under 25, the portal to which they watch their content is inconsequential. Whether it's a phone or a tablet or a TV or a movie theater, it's really about the content. I look for the best ways to reach the right audience for whatever project it is. Most of all, I concentrate on making the content as good as it can be. That way no matter where or when or how someone is watching it, they're still offered the same experience. I'm sure people felt the same way about the steam engine. ""Why are we building all these railroads?"" We're kind of arrogant enough to believe that where we are is the pinnacle of evolution and that there aren't going to be massive cultural changes. My goal is to make content for the rest of my life and career. To that end, it's just about being smart and staying current. CNN: It was recently announced that you're starring in ""Dads,"" Seth MacFarlane's live action sitcom. What can you tell us about the show? Green: The show is about two lifelong friends who started a successful video game company. One of them is married with kids and their father lives with them. The other best friend, me, is sort of this serial dater, perpetually breaking up with people. His father left when he was very young and now through circumstance, his father moves in with him, too. You have these two lifelong best friends, living with their dads, who one way or another, have failed to take care of themselves. Peter Riegert is my dad and Martin Mull is Tommy Dewey's dad. My character is a miserable guy who hasn't figured out how to make himself happy. He wakes up every day hating himself. It's going to be a really funny thing to play. Especially with a character like that, trying to humanize him or even (make him) sympathetic -- that's going to be a fun challenge. CNN: Is it raunchy like ""Family Guy"" can be? Green: It's a multicamera show. Alec (Sulkin) and Wellesley (Wild), the guys who wrote it, have been talking about ""Family Ties, ""Golden Girls"" and ""Cheers."" Shows like that, where all the characters are grounded in reality, where there's a lot of emotional potential, but funny because it's about real life. That's what we're all aiming to do: use this medium in a provocative way, the way the shows we grew up on did. CNN: Rumors have floated around for a while about an ""Austin Powers 4"" film. Is there any traction around that? Green: You know, I've been hearing rumors about ""Austin Powers 4"" and ""Italian Job 2"" since ""Austin Powers 3"" and ""Italian Job"" came out. I can't speak for people making plans without including me, but I will say, I have not heard any confirmable opinions in either direction.","The actor has a new indie film coming out .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- In a classroom tucked away from the world in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, students practice spelling. Ranging in age from 6 to 11, these girls all have one thing in common: They have either been raped or suffered through the rape of a loved one. Even the 6-year-old is a rape survivor. The baby of the class, she can't quite keep up with the spelling lesson but is happy to clap along. Next door, in the clinic adjoining the class, a 7-year-old boy and his mother are in for a checkup. The mother was raped and then watched, helpless, as her son was molested. Too afraid to seek help, she did what she thought would help: washed her son's wounds with hot water and salt for four excruciating days until they were found and brought here. The classroom and clinic are both part of the Elman Peace and Human Rights Center. Founded in 2011, it is the first rape crisis center in Somalia. Today, the center has bases both in and outside Mogadishu, providing a haven for the spiraling number of Somali victims of sexual violence. The figures are horrifying, with at least 1,700 women raped in camps for internally displaced people last year in Mogadishu, according to United Nations figures. The Elman Peace and Human Rights Center was founded by the parents of Ilwad Elman in the 1990s to help child soldiers, but it closed down after her father was assassinated by warlords, forcing the rest of the family to seek refuge in Canada. Eventually, she and her mother returned, and in 2011, the center reopened with a new focus: helping the victims of sexual violence. For the safety of the Elman center's staff and the victims it helps, CNN agreed not to reveal the location of the centers it visited. Rape isn't just happening in the camps for those forced from their homes by fighting, Ilwad Elman told CNN, but in the wider community, ""which is also affected by rampant abuse of sexual and gender-based violence."" Elman says she believes a multitude of factors are to blame, but the chief one is conflict -- something that has affected every Somali during more than two decades of war. ""Rape is a well-known weapon of war, so that is one thing that is undeniable,"" said Elman. ""There's also harmful traditional practices. There's also the destroyed social protection structures that were in place"" but were destroyed by conflict, she adds. Put all these factors together, she said, and ""that is why rape is so indiscriminate"" in Somalia. Social stigma . For the first time in decades, there is reason for optimism in Somalia, thanks in part to the country's newly appointed and popular president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and increased security in much of the country. But the plight of Somalia's women has seen little improvement. While the center's staff has gained some idea of the number of cases of sexual violence in Mogadishu and its surrounding area, little is known about the scale of the problem further afield. Rape in Somalia carries huge social stigma, and after the long years of conflict, there is no way of knowing how many women are suffering in silence. When the new president was appointed last year, his public commitment to punishing those guilty of sexual offenses had an immediate impact, said Elman. But those advances have been undone, she said, by events since. In February, Lul Ali Osman Barake made headlines when she reported her rape at the hands of men she says were government soldiers. They took turns raping her, she told CNN, only stopping when they thought she was dead. But when she reported the crime, it was Barake who was arrested and convicted of defaming a government institution. Eventually, she was freed after a huge international outcry, but she says her attackers have yet to face justice. And, like many of the women CNN spoke to, she has no faith they ever will. The United Nations says 70% of the rapes perpetrated in Somalia are carried out by men in military uniforms. Somali Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon admits there's a problem but insists that it is being addressed. ""There's been no effective government in Somalia for such a long time, and people are disorganized ... but now we are organizing, and I think we'll disconnect ... from the past,"" he told CNN. ""We are doing everything possible, we are taking every step to ensure that women and girls are safe. ""We have nominated a new commissioner, judiciary reforms, and ... we are constituting a new policy for making our women and children safer than ever."" 'Underground network' of women . But women's rights activists say the damage might already have been done. ""I think it's become a lot harder for women to report rape,"" said Elman. ""One clear message was sent to them: that if you do report a rape, there's as much of a chance of you ending up in jail as a perpetrator. It has not only become harder for women who are a survivor of rape to report it, but also people working with these people to work towards ending or responding to sexual violence. ""There was a very dramatic decline in the figures for the last three months. I think it was nearly 60%."" With public information limited and the stigma against speaking out so strong, the center has created ""almost an underground network of women"" to spread the word about its work, said Elman. Some women who have been supported by the center go on to help others, letting them know through word of mouth that these services exist. Other women find their own way there or meet center staff out in the community, she said. What makes the situation worse is that often, the same woman is raped repeatedly, by different perpetrators, said Elman. The center can help the woman each time, but ""without the government's support and putting in place mechanisms to protect these people, there will be no end to this impunity,"" she said. Hawa, who agreed to talk to CNN as long as a pseudonym was used to conceal her identity, told how after being raped she fled her home for what she thought was a new beginning in another part of town. In her new home -- and in spite of being pregnant with the first rapist's baby, she says -- she was attacked again. She, like Barake, has no hope that justice will ever be done. Make the perpetrators 'bear that burden' The United Nations is due to send in a British-funded team of experts on sexual violence to help the Somali government establish protection mechanisms. Delegates at an international donor conference, held this month in London by the UK and Somali governments, pledged to work together to tackle sexual violence. The issue will also be on the agenda at the G8 leaders' summit to be hosted by the United Kingdom in June. But it will take time and money to bring about change in a country that has so many pressing needs. Matt Baugh, UK ambassador to Somalia, told CNN that there were ""no guarantees,"" but the involvement of international partners should improve the chances of Somalia living up to its commitments on sexual violence. ""What needs to happen practically (is) to redress the balance, to turn this from a stigma of shame where the survivors, the victims of these horrible attacks, bear that burden, to one where it's the perpetrators who feel ashamed about it,"" he said. There is now a realization, he said, of the ""huge, huge problem facing the country as a whole, as well as women and girls,"" but it will take time to make the necessary changes to tackle sexual violence. These include better documentation of such crimes; reforming the security sector, so that the army and police come under greater government control and win people's confidence; and reforming the judiciary so that ordinary Somali families believe in the justice system, he said. ""We've got the opportunity for the first time in 20 years, based on Somali leadership and their compelling vision, to chart a way forward,"" he added. ""I think that this newfound stability and these new steps that have been made by Somalia, that the entire world is celebrating, because it is, indeed, worth celebrating, ... has to be something that everybody has access to,"" said Elman, in Mogadishu. ""We need to make sure that women are in this human space where we are moving forward."" For the moment, though, Somalia's women are relying on themselves -- and each other -- to rebuild their lives as best they can. READ MORE: Somali court clears woman alleging rape .

"(CNN) -- A nun and two peace activists could spend the rest of their lives in federal prison after being convicted of breaching one of the nation's most secure nuclear facilities. After two days of testimony, a federal jury in Knoxville, Tennessee, found Sister Megan Rice, 83; Greg Boertje-Obed, 57; and Michael Walli, 63, guilty of destroying U.S. government property and depredation against federal property exceeding $1,000. That could mean up to 30 years in prison, according to WATE, CNN's affiliate in Knoxville. The three are scheduled to be sentenced on September 23. When the guilty verdict was read Wednesday evening, the three defendants appeared content, even singing along with protest hymns before they were taken into custody, according to WATE. ""They're at peace about this, they're peace makers, and they knew that they risked this,"" Joe Quigley, attorney for Walli, told the Knoxville station. ""Nobody is happy to go jail, but they understand."" In the predawn hours of July 28, 2012, Rice, Boertje-Obed and Walli walked under the cover of darkness through the woods and up a hillside, approaching a chain-link fence surrounding the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Armed with flashlights and a bolt cutter, they cut their way through the fence, fully expecting to be arrested on the spot. Instead, they walked nearly a mile, cutting through four fences in all, breaching what was supposed to be the most tightly secured uranium processing and storage facility in the country. ""When we got to the very high security fence where there's a lethal force authorized ... I thought, maybe we should turn around,"" Boertje-Obed told CNN's David Mattingly. But they didn't. Hours later, the three activists were finally confronted by a guard after hoisting banners, spray-painting messages and splattering human blood on a building that houses highly enriched uranium. They have said they wanted call attention to the dangers of nuclear weapons, but their actions triggered a very different concern: . If three older peaceniks can easily trespass onto what was once considered the ""Fort Knox"" for highly enriched uranium, just how safe are the nation's nuclear weapons material from terrorists? Nuclear weapons interactive: Who has what? Since the incident, Congress has held a series of hearings and issued security recommendations to the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs Y-12 and seven other nuclear weapons sites. Most recently, Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in March that the Department of Energy has taken ""several major actions ... to improve security"" since the Y-12 breach, including management changes and independent security reviews. Today, changes at Y-12 are noticeable. A new security contractor is in charge. New signs and security fences are going up. While last year's security breach shed light on systematic weaknesses at Y-12, a former nuclear reactor safety manager at the Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico said he doesn't think the nation's nuclear weapons material were ever at any risk. ""What these people did was more like trespassing than gaining access to any weapons-grade material,"" said Michael Allen, who is now a vice provost and dean at Middle Tennessee State University. ""Once they got in, they could spray paint things, but it's just like if you got into Fort Knox, you wouldn't know the combination to the locks."" Allen said the country's nuclear weapons material is spread across eight sites that are ""usually out in the middle of nowhere"" to protect against threats. ""There's really only one place where the weapons are fully assembled; I'm not going to tell you which one,"" Allen said. ""And the reason there are eight places, they don't want people to have the full knowledge (of what the other facilities do). ""We almost never see an assembled nuclear weapon."" But another nuclear security expert said the Y-12 breach was more than just trespassing by a few environmental protesters. ""This was a very serious incident because they penetrated the protected area, and that's when there was supposed to be an immediate security response,"" said Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist with Global Security Program, a watchdog group that monitors the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""If they had been trained, the kind of paramilitary group that the Department of Energy is supposed to be ensuring they can protect against, with hand-carried explosives, other breaching tools, physical access to the building structure ... the guards would have already lost."" Lyman said the breach was not an isolated incident. ""It was a result of this reduced central oversight, giving contractors more responsibility for supervising themselves, and that's an invitation of corner-cutting and complacency to set in,"" he said. The incident not only broke the public's trust that the government is ""exercising good oversight"" of its nuclear weapons facilities, according to Lyman, but he said it also has ""global implications."" ""If we can't even control our own nuclear weapons material, it shows what a major challenge it is around the world ... that have comparably dangerous materials but are even less protected. And, Lyman pointed out, if the United States appears to have vulnerabilities in protecting its nuclear weapons material, ""then that not only reduces our authority to criticize other countries, it raising questions about the integrity of our own security. "" CNN's David Mattingly and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.","Three peace activists have been convicted of trespassing, defacing a nuclear weapons site .

"New York (CNN) -- The alleged madam for a high-priced escort service in Manhattan pleaded guilty to one count of prostitution in the third degree on Tuesday, according to Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero. Anna Gristina, 44, was sentenced to time served and will get five years probation. She was arrested February 22 and had pleaded not guilty to charges of promoting prostitution. She was accused of running the ring out of an Upper East Side apartment. When asked by New York Judge Juan Merchan in court whether she knowingly profited from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling and owning a prostitution business, Gristina answered affirmatively, according to the District Attorney's Office. Lawyer: NYC madam 'doesn't have 2 nickels to rub together' Gristina had allegedly made numerous claims that she had connections with the New York Police Department, the FBI, the governor's office and the District Attorney's Office, among others. ""We have not found evidence to support any of those claims. We are left with a straightforward promoting prostitution case,"" Assistant District Attorney Charles Linehan read in court on Tuesday, ""a defendant who ran a brothel for many years and who profited from the sex trade. That is all."" ""It became apparent to Anna that we could only win (at trial) by hurting people she cares about,"" Gristina's attorney Norm Pattis said. ""Anna chose love over the ordeal of a trial."" Merchan said Gristina will be officially sentenced on November 20 to six months in jail, but because she has already served several months at Rikers Island Prison, ""this essentially amounts to time served followed by probation,"" according to the District Attorney's Office.

"(CNN) -- Confession: I've fallen asleep while operating on patients. And I'm sure I'm not the only one. No, I've never passed out and face-planted into a patient's open belly. Nor have I fallen asleep in the operating room as a plastic surgeon in practice. But as a resident, I performed the dreaded head-bob several times. Here is a typical scenario: . The OR is silent, except for the rhythmic beep from the anesthesia machine. My surgical scrubs feel warm, like a pair of comfy pajamas. I sit, holding two tiny retractors, while the hand surgeon meticulously dissects the patient's carpal tunnel. It's a surgery I've assisted on dozens of times before. I blink and try to remember what day it is. It seems like forever ago that I arrived at the hospital. In fact, it's been more than 32 hours since my shift started. During this past day and a half, I've logged more than 15 hours in the OR and exactly zero minutes of sleep. My eyelids feel heavy, as if being pulled down by an invisible force. I begin shaking my knee up and down, an attempt to keep myself awake. ""Stay still!"" the attending surgeon growls. My knee stops. Heaviness returns to my eyelids. I'm dancing on the edge of sleep. Five minutes later, I lose the battle. My head briefly bobs down, then back up. I immediately look around. Has anyone noticed? Apparently not the surgeon. I look at the scrub technician, sitting to my right. She nods her head at me, knowingly. Then she digs her heel into my foot. Hard. I suppress a yelp. I'm awake now. Residency, the training to become a real, practicing physician, is brutal. During my surgical residency back in the late '90s, I was routinely expected to work up to 36 hours straight, without sleep or a designated break. Sure, I occasionally caught a few zzz's in the call room, but many nights were spent wide awake taking care of patients. I was one of the lucky ones. Although often overworked, I never considered myself abused. Some residents had it a lot worse. Things aren't quite as bad today as they were 14 years ago. In July 2011, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education implemented new resident work hour standards, instituting a maximum 16-hour shift for postgraduate first-year residents, aka interns. These new rules have created concern among residents regarding their education. A survey published in the June issue of Archives of Surgery found that surgical interns believed the new regulations would decrease their time spent operating, acquisition of medical knowledge, development of surgical skills and overall educational experience. So what's the real benefit to reducing resident work hours? The Archives of Surgery survey also found that the majority of interns believed the new regulations would improve the quality and safety of patient care. As physicians, this should be our primary concern. Proper residency training shouldn't necessitate working young doctors so hard that they're forced to make patient care decisions or perform medical procedures while excessively fatigued. Studies show that impairment in cognitive and motor performance when sleep-deprived for 24 hours is equivalent to having a blood-alcohol level of 0.1%. This is considered legally drunk. Do you want a drunken doctor operating on you? As a physician, my patients expect me to be at my best when treating them. Part of being at my best includes being well-rested. Since my residency days, I've never fallen asleep in the operating room. Not even close. But it often disturbs me when I think about how sleep-deprived I was as a resident. My patients deserved better. More from Dr. Youn: Seriously? Doctors say they're underpaid . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anthony Youn.","Many medical residents work long shifts and their sleep suffers .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court threw its legal weight Tuesday behind a Thai student whose side business selling foreign-made textbooks got him in trouble with the publisher. The justices ruled 6-3 that copyrighted works made and purchased abroad can then be resold within the United States without the copyright owner's permission. The ruling is a victory for those who buy and sell books, movies, music, and artwork, and perhaps even furniture, electronics, automobiles, and clothing -- anything that may be considered ""intellectual property."" Storefront and at-home secondary retailers, libraries, artistic venues -- even the local garage sale -- would also be affected. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority, said to rule otherwise would create financial chaos, citing public libraries as an example. ""How can they find, say, the copyright owner of a foreign book, perhaps written decades ago?"" he said. ""Are the libraries to stop circulating or distributing the millions of books in their collections that were printed abroad?"" The legal dispute had attracted interest from the Obama administration, media and publishing companies, and a range of consumer and retail groups. Competing claims of intellectual property and owners' rights in the electronic age made Supap Kirtsaeng's venture one of the most closely watched business cases at the high court this term. He bought textbooks abroad, where the prices are lower, and resold them in the United States. The justices considered the limits of two key interpretations of copyright law -- the ""first sale doctrine"" and its complex relationship to foreign distribution rights. The first sale doctrine generally gives copyright holders the ability to profit only from the original sale. It essentially means once a person lawfully buys a Peter Max lithograph or an Adele music CD in the United States, that person then can sell that copyrighted work in the United States without punishment and without having to compensate the original copyright holder. It ensures a distribution chain of retail items, library lending, gift giving and rentals for a range of intellectual property. That stream of commerce includes secondary markets like flea markets and online resellers Craigslist and eBay. The idea -- upheld by the Supreme Court since 1908 -- is that once a copyright holder legally sells a product, the ownership claim is exhausted, giving the buyer the power to resell, destroy, donate, or whatever. It's a limited idea, involving only a buyer's distribution right, not the power to reproduce that DVD or designer dress for sale. The tricky part is whether that first sale doctrine applies to material both manufactured and first purchased outside the United States. Breyer said it does: ""The upshot is that copyright-related consequences, along with language, context, and interpretative canons, argue strongly against a geographical interpretation."" John Wiley & Sons, the publishing firm that sued Kirtsaeng, argued it readily sells its products overseas at a cheaper price -- particularly to countries in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America -- to satisfy an audience that may have less income than in the States or Europe. Such differences in worldwide prices are often exploited by retail and resale firms, especially on high-end luxury and specialized items. Known as parallel sales or the ""gray market"" -- foreign-made goods obtained through second-hand sources -- the strategy costs manufacturers tens of billions of dollars a year, according to some business-generated estimates. Kirtsaeng came to the United States to study mathematics in 1997 at Cornell University and later pursued doctoral studies at the University of Southern California. To cover tuition and living expenses, he asked family and friends back home to ship him foreign editions of textbooks that often can be bought more cheaply overseas. Using the computer tag BlueChristine99, he sold the imported books online in the United States on eBay. Court records show he pulled in about $1.2 million in revenue, but both sides disagree over how much profit he made. His sales included dozens of copies of eight textbooks printed in Asia by a Wiley subsidiary. Kirtsaeng's lawyers claim his gross revenue from the Wiley sales was just $37,000. The New Jersey publisher has a thriving overseas business. Its foreign editions typically have a disclaimer: ""This book is authorized for sale in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East only and may not be exported. Exportation from or importation of this book to another region without the publishers authorization is illegal."" The company sued and a federal jury found Kirtsaeng's conduct was willful and ordered him to pay $600,000 in damages. Theodore Olson, an attorney with Gibson Dunn hired by the publisher, told CNN last year that banning the low-cost versions from the United States helps the global economy. ""The whole idea of the copyright laws is to provide people with an incentive to create books, movies, or other works of art,"" he said. ""If you take away that incentive, you're not going to have creators out there doing things that give us pleasure or educate us."" Members of the entertainment industry said a ruling in their favor was vital in the digital economy, to ensure they can divide their property and distribution rights across the global markets. But Kirtsaeng and his owners' rights supporters worried a slippery slope would quickly occur on a variety of fronts if they lost at the Supreme Court: . --Domestic manufacturers would have financial incentive to shut down U.S. plants and produce everything overseas, since they could get a monetary cut and distribution control over every resale. Kirtsaeng's lawyers said that would amount to double-dipping, with copyright holders getting paid twice for the same item's sale. --Libraries would have to either have to purge their stacks of every foreign-printed work, pay a royalty, or essentially go out of the public lending service. --American consumers would lose access to affordable and differentiated goods, and charitable donations would be stifled. --With a global consumer economy now dominated by digital and cloud-based access and transfer of information and entertainment, the cross-border lines would create chaos and uncertainty when it comes to determining where a particular copyrighted good is manufactured and then resold. Wiley, with the Justice Department in support, dismissed those scenarios. But Andrew Shore, a lawyer and executive director of the Owners Rights Initiative, which backed Kirtsaeng, speaking prior to arguments before the Supreme Court in October, said, ""The rule we want the Supreme Court to adopt is simple: you bought it, you own it and you can do with it what you please. Very clear, very clean, very easy. The copyright holders are getting paid. They're getting paid on the first sale."" In dissent Tuesday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said the majority ruling could affect future international trade negotiations. She was supported by Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia. In federal law, she said, ""Congress intended to provide copyright owners with a remedy against unauthorized importation of foreign-made copies of their works, even if those copies were made and sold abroad with the copyright owner's authorization."" The high court already had ruled in prior cases that copyright holders cannot block U.S.-made goods sent overseas from later being brought back into the country for resale. The issue in this case was whether copyright laws applied to foreign-made goods imported into the American market. Kirtsaeng, now a professor back in Thailand, never responded to CNN's efforts for an interview. He initially testified receiving advice from friends back home -- and consulting ""Google Answers,"" an online research help service -- to ensure he could legally resell the foreign editions in the United States. In court papers, he also said he was unable to afford the hefty pending judgment against him. The man's lawyers said that after the lower court's verdict, he was ordered to give the publisher his golf clubs and computer in partial compensation. The case is Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (11-697).","The court says copyrighted works from abroad can be resold within the United States .
The ruling covers libraries, artistic venues -- even the local garage sale .
The first sale doctrine generally lets copyright holders profit only from the original sale ."
"New Orleans (CNN) -- When Kenneth Purcell emerged from his New Orleans home after Hurricane Isaac churned through the city in August, he couldn't believe what he saw. Nearly all of his neighbors had poured out into the streets to help each other clean up. It was a completely different environment than the one he'd seen seven years ago, after Katrina struck. ""People started cleaning up their yards and helping neighbors that had gone away,"" Purcell said. ""It was this silent but perfectly coordinated and synchronized effort."" This is what made him and his wife, who was expecting their second child, to cancel a trip they booked to Florida in order to escape the stress of the Isaac aftermath. Purcell says it's the same sentiment that has brought people from all over the county to New Orleans in the years following Katrina and has helped spur the city's entrepreneurial movement. He moved his company, iSeatz, a travel-and-entertainment booking engine, back to New Orleans in January 2008 after relocating to New York post-Katrina. The move back to New Orleans caused him to lose almost all of his employees in New York and forced him to establish a new staff. Perhaps surprisingly, it would also prove to be a good business decision. ""The new people that I hired were here because they wanted to be,"" Purcell said. ""They wanted not just the company to be successful, but they wanted the company to help the city be successful."" An influx of entrepreneurs . Entrepreneurship has spiked in New Orleans, a city that suffered a population exodus and struggled to get back on its feet after Katrina's destruction. The Greater New Orleans Community Data Center says that 427 of every 100,000 adults in the city started a business between 2008 and 2010 -- the most recent period for which data is available -- compared to a national rate of 333 of every 100,000 during that time. It is now one of the the fastest-growing cities in America, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Forbes recently called New Orleans one of the biggest brain magnets in the country, praising its ""communal camaraderie and business incubators that have helped many of the startups get off the ground."" ""I've practiced in New Orleans for almost 40 years and I'm more excited about the future of the city today, than I ever have been,"" said Marcel Wisznia, owner of Wisznia Architecture and Development and a veteran entrepreneur. ""I've invested a lot of my life in this community and it's an exciting time for us."" This past May, Wisznia developed Beta, a shared workspace for local startups in a historic downtown building. The space is filled with 20-something entrepreneurs in a range of fields, from tech and fashion to art and music. It's currently at 65% occupancy, and Wisznia expects it to be almost 85% full by the end of the year. He said he's observed a progression of new startups in the city in recent years -- and the catalyst for this entrepreneurial spark was Hurricane Katrina. ""What Hurricane Katrina did is move a whole new generation of young people that didn't have ties to the community, that weren't complacent, that were aggressive, that were entrepreneurial, that wanted to make a difference, socially and financially,"" he said. Chris Boyd runs Apptitude, his mobile-application development company, from Beta. After spending nine years in the tech industry in Houston, he decided to start his own company. Boyd was in the process of moving to New York when he heard about NOLAbound, a program that brought 25 professionals from all over the country for an inside look at the entrepreneurial community in New Orleans. Boyd, a Louisiana native, asked city business insiders whether New Orleans could be a viable home for his company. ""I had three key questions: Is there a tech scene here? Is it sustainable? And if I were to open a business here, would I be able to survive?"" Boyd said. ""And the answer was yes, absolutely. Everybody I talked to told me, yes."" So he changed his articles of incorporation from the state of New York to Louisiana and moved to New Orleans in June. Boyd now meets with a new startup every week and networks with other Web developers through groups like NOLA Meetup and gnocode, which connect people in the city's emerging tech scene. He also started his own weekly meetup, Objective Crunk, to help local developers make apps for Apple's mobile operating system. Unique challenges . Still, entrepreneurs face hurdles launching and growing tech companies in New Orleans, which has traditionally lacked the startup culture now thriving in Austin, Texas; New York and other cities. New Orleans does not have a deep pool of developers, venture capitalists and other tech talent. ""As companies start to scale, they need high-level management to help grow,"" said Tim Williamson, co-founder of the Idea Village, a nonprofit that nurtures New Orleans entrepreneurs. ""While we're seeing people with profile start to move to New Orleans, we need more of them."" On the surface, Williamson said, New Orleans would seem to be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other cities. ""We don't have any Fortune 500 companies, we don't have tremendous wealth,"" he said. ""But there's something special here that's making this work."" Williamson sees the city as a laboratory of innovation and change. ""I think that this is a moment in time and history where we're right in the middle of a renaissance period, where the next generation of economic and civic leadership is being nurtured and cultivated here in New Orleans,"" Williamson said. Entrepreneurs here say that community engagement is what makes New Orleans different. It's why Jennifer Medbery chose New Orleans as home to her startup. A Connecticut native and Columbia University graduate, Medbery moved to New Orleans in 2008 and taught at a charter school for one year before launching Kickboard, software that provides a centralized location for teachers to record their students' progress. New Orleans has the largest proportion of students -- almost 80% -- attending charter schools of any city in the nation. Medbery believes the entrepreneurial spirit in New Orleans is unique. ""The entire entrepreneurial ecosystem in New Orleans understands that when one rises, we all rise. And so as a community, business leaders here are very committed to each other's success, because it's all part of New Orleans redefining itself.""","Entrepreneurship has spiked in New Orleans in the seven years since Hurricane Katrina .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- If the ""personology"" believers had their way, they'd want you to judge every book by its cover. Well, actually, they'd want you to judge every person by his or her facial features. Because practitioners of personology, which is a form of face reading, believe the features on our face tell, literally, the inside story of what kind of person we are. The theory of reading personality traits in facial features dates back to Aristotle. Nobody is more passionate about this facial fact-finding than the president of Face Language International, Naomi Tickle (her real name). Tickle has devoted her life to the study of personology, and she informs us in a lovely British accent that this is no fleeting New-Age fad. ""A judge in the 1920s developed the system that we use today,"" she says. ""He initially came up with about 200 traits and then narrowed it down to 68 traits with 92 percent accuracy. It goes across all cultures, so no matter where you are in the world, if you see a certain feature in a face, it is going to mean exactly the same thing in terms of personality."" So what are there traits that Tickle is talking about? Well, for example, she says ""Somebody who has very close-set eyes is very good with detail. They don't like being interrupted, and they don't like people being late. They like people to be on time. ""The flip side of that,"" she adds, ""is they can focus on things that aren't working till it becomes bigger than life. A person with wide-set eyes is much more laid back, she continued. ""They are the multi-task people. They're the ones that say, 'Oh I can do this and I can do that and I can do that as well,' and because of this behavior, they have a tendency to run late."" What? You're skeptical? Well, let's face it: It's hard for some of us to believe that our idiosyncrasies could be governed by the shape of our head or the placement of our eyes. But the theory goes back much further than the 1920s. In fact, it dates back to Aristotle, who wrote a treatise on physiognomy, or the idea that one's temperament can be discerned from his or her outward features. This later morphed into an odder head-reading trend known as the criminal head bump indicator, or phrenology. But don't lump (ahem) these items in with personology. Tickle says her method goes by the numbers. ""We actually measure the eye to determine the distance,"" she says. ""We measure the width of the eye, and we measure the space between them to see which is the bigger of the two. And so if the eye is bigger than the space between the eyes, this person is very tolerant and very good with details.""  Health for Her: Watch more on the theory of personology. » . She asserts that ""thousands and thousands of people"" report 100 percent accuracy on the personology analysis. But personology doesn't just focus on the eyes; the entire face is open for interpretation. Take for example facial width. ""The narrow-face individual builds their confidence through knowledge,"" Tickle says. ""When they get into new situations, there is a lot of hesitancy. But once they know what they are doing, they are off and running, whereas the wide-faced person will be much more self-confident. They are comfortable just winging it."" And what about our noses, sitting there smack dab in the middle of our face. With noses, shape is the key, Tickle says. ""You have to really look at that from the side profile. The Roman-shaped nose is a bossy nose. It likes to be in charge. They are also very aware of costs. How much it costs. 'Is it worth it? Can I get it for less?' Those are Roman nose-shaped questions. The ski-jump nose is a monetary carefree nose, one that likes to spend all their money without a care about saving for tomorrow."" Personology can be helpful in relationships, she says. For instance, if a Roman nose were to get involved with a ski-jump nose, the difference in the way each handles money might lead to a lot of conflict. Finally, even your hair isn't immune to some character assassination. Texture is what the personologists look at. ""We actually measure that with a micrometer,"" she says. ""The finer the hair, the more sensitive the person is to taste, touch, smell and sound. If the noise is too loud, a finer-haired person will turn it down."" People with coarse hair, she says, (""most of your politicians,"" she notes) are thicker skinned. There are many more traits that personology builds on to get a whole personality picture, but the real question is: What good is it? Tickle says that knowing these traits helps us understand ourselves and others. The more clues we have about the type of person we are, we can gauge what will make us happier in life, both in careers and in relationships. But maybe even more importantly, she believes, it allows us to understand and communicate with others. Really? What's so hard about that? Especially if the answers are written all over your face.

"(CNN) -- By the time the police officer kicked the door in, it was too late. Kerby Revelus was holding his 5-year-old sister, Bianca, and while the officer watched, he dragged a kitchen knife across her throat with such fury that he decapitated her. Samantha Revelus, 17, had called 911 for help after her brother attacked his sisters with a knife. ""It's hard to imagine that kind of horror,"" said Milton, Massachusetts, Police Chief Richard G. Wells Jr. Mere seconds passed before other officers arrived and rushed into the home in the tony Boston suburb of 25,000. Police had received a 911 call from another Revelus sibling, 17-year-old Samantha. Suffering from several deep cuts in her upper body, she was losing strength. ""It was clear that she knew she was mortally wounded,"" Wells said.  Watch police chief discuss decapitation » . Samantha managed to explain that her 23-year-old brother had attacked his sisters with a knife, police said. When she was no longer able to keep talking, the injured teen handed her 9-year-old sister, Sarafina Revelus, the phone. All the while, the kids' grandmother was doing laundry in the basement, apparently unaware of the savagery upstairs, police said. Mother Regina Revelus was at work, and father Vronze Revelus was not at home. As officers surrounded the home and rushed into every room, Kerby ran into a bedroom where Samantha was on the floor, dead. Sarafina was on the floor near her sister's body, according to Wells. Kerby Revelus then began attacking Sarafina with the knife, Wells said, prompting police to open fire and kill him. On Tuesday, the two slain siblings and their attacker were buried together. Sarafina Revelus returned home Tuesday after undergoing surgery Monday morning for wounds. It was not the first time police have visited the home answering a domestic violence call, Wells said. In September 2004, Kerby Revelus was arrested for punching one of his sisters in the face as they fought about money, the chief said. The Boston Herald identified the sibling as Jessica Revelus, who was not in the home during Saturday's attack. Jessica Revelus told officers at the time that ""she was not in fear of her brother,"" according to a police report from the incident, the Boston Herald reported. A charge of domestic assault and battery was dismissed because she refused to cooperate, Wells said. Kerby was then in his last year at Milton High School. But Kerby was in trouble a year later, in 2005, when he was charged with carrying a firearm without a license after he attempted to purchase alcohol at a Randolph, Massachusetts, liquor store. He was given a six-month sentence and was released in September 2008. CNN reached Jessica Revelus by phone Tuesday. She seemed distraught and said she had not been able to sleep. Her brother's rampage came, she said, ""out of the blue."" When asked whether he had a temper or had given any indication that he might want to hurt his sisters, she said, ""I don't know. I am not good right now. I am not good."" On Monday, Jessica Revelus told the Boston Herald that ""I was never afraid of him. I called the police because he thought he was so big and bad."" Jessica Revelus told the newspaper that her sister Samantha ""would get into arguments"" with Kerby over ""little stuff"" and that Kerby and her father were not speaking. Police are unclear about what set the brother off Saturday, and Wells said he's being careful not to speculate. Vronze and Regina Revelus said through a family spokesman that they had ""no explanation"" for their son's savagery, according to the Boston Herald. ""How much can you put on the shoulders of one family?"" Wells asked. Wells praised the first officer on the scene Saturday. ""I don't have words to articulate how this officer maintained his ability to do his job, "" he said. ""To go in and witness that first thing, just as he opens the door and stay on his radio through the whole thing ..."" He added that the horror of the day rippled through the force. ""You can bet that our officers went home after this, and they hugged their wives and their children that much tighter. I hope that for this family and for my officers, that there can be a way to get through. ""We are going to try to make them whole as soon as possible, even though the events of this past weekend will stay with them forever.""","Kerby Revelus had an arrest history involving domestic violence, police say .

"(CNN) -- A suicide car bombing targeting a coalition convoy in the heart of Afghanistan's capital on Thursday killed at least 12 people, six Americans and six Afghans, authorities said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said two U.S. service members working with ISAF and four ISAF-contracted civilians died in the Kabul bombing . The four were Americans working with DynCorp International, a contracting firm based in Falls Church, Virginia, the company said. The people worked on a program that provided mentors and trainers to support the development of Afghanistan's Defense Ministry. Three of those people were wounded. An Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman said at least six Afghan civilians were killed and 30 were injured, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. The fatalities included at least two children. ISAF commander Gen. Joseph Dunford said ""insurgents deliberately exploded a bomb today in a residential area of the most populated city in Afghanistan,"" killing and wounding dozens of Afghans. ""The insurgents use these desperate and indiscriminate acts of violence to slow the momentum of Afghanistan's progress. The insurgents cannot offer the Afghan people a better future. All they can offer is violence and oppression."" The insurgent group Hezb-e Islami, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, claimed responsibility for the attack . A one-time prime minister, Hekmatyar has been against the government and the presence of the foreign forces in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. He is not under the Taliban leadership, but operates alongside them. The incident comes during the Taliban's spring offensive.

"(CNN) -- The Internal Revenue Service has placed two employees on administrative leave in connection with a 2010 conference in Anaheim, California, which cost millions of taxpayer dollars. The employees were not identified in a Wednesday statement from IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel, nor were the exact circumstances of their alleged wrongdoing detailed. The incident involved a party inside a private suite at a hotel in Anaheim, the statement said. Food was allegedly provided free of charge, a violation of standards. Political conspiracy or overzealous scrutiny? Pending further review, the IRS has started the process of removing the employees. ""When I came to IRS, part of my job was to hold people accountable,"" Werfel said in the statement. ""There was clearly inappropriate behavior involved in this situation, and immediate action is needed."" Report shows lavish spending at IRS conference . The move came just one day after an audit of the agency showed the IRS spent millions of taxpayer dollars on everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to guest prizes to parody videos at the 2010 conference. The beleaguered agency -- already snared in controversy over its targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status -- spent $4.1 million on the conference, with ""questionable expenses"" comprising much of the budget, according to the report released Tuesday by the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration. The audit notes that a large chunk of that money -- about $3.2 million -- came from unused funds allocated for hiring. This was in the same year that the IRS began to single out conservative and tea party groups that sought tax-exempt status, in part because the agency said it did not have the personnel to handle the overwhelming amount of applications pouring in that year.

"(CNN) -- Some of the best food on the Turks and Caicos island of Providenciales is served up by small, local vendors -- Froggies on Da Beach, Blue Hills Native Cuisine, Uncle Dough's, Hole in the Wall and Middle Caicos CafÃ© are popular options. Visitors to the Caribbean vacation island, however, tend to stay close to resorts, preferring to nurse poolside glasses of rum punch during their stays. Not that there's anything wrong with that -- resorts around the famed white sands of central Grace Bay are terrific. It's just that many visitors leave the island having missed out on a gathering of the best local tastes in town, just a short cab ride away. Local party . Launched in January, the island's Thursday night Fish Fry is a weekly party that aims to get tourists mingling with locals. It takes place in a part of Providenciales (often called ""Provo"") that most tourists don't readily frequent. Island specialties such as jerk chicken, conch fritters, just-caught fish and an array of fresh seafood are cooked on the spot by the types of smaller vendors most tourists wouldn't typically come across. The rum punch, too, is mixed in a way locals swear can't be replicated by any hotel bar. A steel band punctuates the rhythm of a Junkanoo, a Bahamian-style dance and music parade. World's 50 best beach bars . ""Our goal is to get people out of their Grace Bay resorts and get them to experience our local food, culture and music,"" says local tourist board representative David Fenimore, the brains behind the Fish Fry. Reaching across the divide . Turks and Caicos is known for white sand beaches, turquoise waters, spectacular snorkeling and diving, and a heavy tilt toward high-end travelers. There's a distinct separation here between locals and tourists, who tend to stick on or close to their resorts. So it's important, Fenimore says, to try and tip the scales the other way, ""since the trickle down doesn't necessarily happen the way it should."" Longtime Providenciales resident Hazel Greenwood recalls a time when Grace Bay was nothing more than a raw stretch of beach, when expats (many of whom never left the island and became Turks and Caicos residents) and locals all knew each other and would often hang out together. ""Tourists are not really aware of where we have come from to get to where we are, and it has been hard, but I'd say that what's important here is that everyone does things together and we like to keep it that way,"" says Greenwood, whose engineer husband put in the lights for the runway at Providenciales' airport in 1983 and later wired up Club Med, the first luxury resort on Provo. Colorful characters . At the Thursday fish fry, visitors can meet Provo personalities such as Melbourne Smith, creator of Henry the Conch, a Turks and Caicos mascot whose goal is to raise awareness of the cultural and ecological importance of conch to island. Another regular is the charismatic Alicia Wilson, who goes by the nickname ""Beautiful"" and is the creator of potent cocktails. Judging by the crowds lining up at stands like Blue Hills Native Cuisine, where owner Bertha Mae Forbes busily fries up vast quantities of fresh snapper, the word may be spreading faster than Fenimore expects. ""We're just using lime, some salt and a little bit of pepper,"" says Forbes' daughter, Marjorie Dorsett of her mother's fish as it sizzles in hot oil. ""It's plain, way-back kind of seasoning, but I can tell you that you're not going to find the same taste in the big hotels."" Tourists seem to be loving the local taste. ""It's a fantastic party -- a great occasion for locals, expats and tourists to get together, and I'm definitely coming again,"" says Robyn Matravers, a visitor from Toronto. The Turks and Caicos Fish Fry takes place every Thursday from 5:30-9:30 p.m. at Bight Park, Lower Bight Road, Providenciales. A US$10-per-person taxi ride from any Grace Bay resort, it's a family friendly event.","Tourists rarely interact with locals while visiting Turks and Caicos Island .

"(CNN) -- The woman hired to turn around Rutgers University's troubled athletic program came under renewed fire Tuesday after news emerged she was named in a sex discrimination lawsuit at the University of Louisville, according to court documents obtained Tuesday. The revelation that Julie Hermann was at the center of a discrimination lawsuit while working at the University of Louisville, according to the documents, came just days after a report that a group of University of Tennessee volleyball players accused her of verbal abuse when she coached them in the 1990s. Hermann's appointment as Rutgers athletic director came more than a month after a video of a Rutgers coach hurling basketballs and yelling homophobic slurs prompted the coach's firing, the resignation of the school's athletic director and sharp criticism from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. ""It is a new day,"" Hermann told reporters after being appointed. ""(The problem) is already fixed, and there is no one that doesn't agree about how we treat young people with respect and dignity and build trust."" The allegations against Hermann have raised questions about whether the Newark, New Jersey, university properly vetted Hermann before hiring her. But Christie told New Jersey 101.5 radio that he spoke with the university's president and board chairman about the allegations and that he would not second-guess Rutgers' hiring of Hermann. ""I told them I had questions, and I was going to get answers to those questions,"" he said on the radio station's weekly ""Ask the Governor"" show on Tuesday. ""I have gotten answers to those questions."" Rutgers, meanwhile, went on the defensive Tuesday, releasing a list of names and contacts for supporters of Hermann. It also put out a statement that said she was on the ""original list of candidates"" assembled by a search firm for the position. ""Julie also was among the group of candidates considered at each step of the search process from the beginning,"" the statement said. Hermann was named in a 2008 lawsuit filed by Mary Banker, an assistant track and field coach, who alleged she was the victim of sex discrimination by the head coach and then fired after she complained to Hermann and the university's human resources department, according to documents. Banker alleged in the complaint that when she told Hermann about the discrimination, which included offensive comments, she was praised. ""We're lucky to have you,"" Hermann allegedly said in an e-mail, according to court documents. A jury in Kentucky awarded Banker $300,000 in damages and lost wages, but it was overturned by an appeals court. Banker's attorney is appealing the ruling to the Kentucky Supreme Court, according to court documents. Hermann did not return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment. The University of Louisville, in state Supreme Court court filings, defended the firing, saying the evidence showed Banker was ""an abysmal coach and recruiter."" Word of the Louisville lawsuit followed news first reported Sunday by a New Jersey newspaper, The Star-Ledger, that a group of former volleyball players at Tennessee accused Hermann of ""mental cruelty."" In a letter written in 1997 and obtained by the newspaper, members of the team purportedly claimed that Hermann called players ""whores, alcoholics and learning disabled."" Verbal abuse from Hermann became so intense, they claimed, that the team banded together to write the letter, calling the situation ""irreconcilable."" After the team presented the letter to Hermann, she chose to stop coaching them, according to the newspaper's report. One former Tennessee volleyball player defended Hermann in a statement of support, which was released by Rutgers. ""You were tough no doubt but I knew you cared and I went from being a kid with a bad attitude who thought I was God's gift to athletics to the captain of my team,"" wrote Sonya Thomas, who played for Tennessee from 1992 to 1995. ""Your intensity helped me be mentally tough and it was exactly what I needed. None of it was abusive, mean spirited or demeaning."" In a written statement released Monday, Hermann said her former students' comments are ""heartbreaking."" She denied the allegations of abuse and vowed to push ahead in her new role. ""I was never notified of the reported letter outlining the concerns of some former athletes. However, I am truly sorry that some were disappointed during my tenure as coach,"" she said. ""For sure, I was an intense coach, but there is a vast difference between high intensity and abusive behavior."" Hermann said her commitment to students' success has been firm throughout her career. Rutgers University President Robert L. Barchi said Monday that he stands by the school's choice. ""Rutgers was deliberative at every stage of this process,"" he said in a written statement. ""Over the course of the search, Julie's record established her as a proven leader in athletics administration with a strong commitment to academic success as well as athletic excellence, and a strong commitment to the well-being of student athletes."" A University of Tennessee spokeswoman declined to comment. Louisville women's basketball coach Jeff Walz backed Hermann, his boss over the last six years. While he couldn't speak about what may or may not have happened at Tennessee, Walz said that in their time together at Louisville, he found Hermman to be ""a very good administrator who always put the student athletes' well-being first, no matter what situation it was."" The Cardinals coach said he didn't see the uproar over Hermann coming, given his observations of her with him and his players. He credits her with helping put a solid system in place, so student athletes were in good hands from their first day on campus through to their graduation. ""(In) the six years that I had with her, she was very competent at what she does, how she handles situations, and how she treats the student athletes,"" Walz said. CNN's Greg Botelho, Aaron Cooper, John Berman, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jason Kessler, Laura Dolan and Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","NEW: A Louisville coach says Hermann ""always put the student-athletes' well-being first""

"(CNN) -- More than a week after announcing two vacationers had contracted hantavirus -- one of them fatally -- Yosemite National Park said Monday that authorities have determined another person died after contracting the disease while visiting the park. In addition to this fatality, Yosemite said in a news release that officials had identified ""a probable fourth case of hantavirus."" All four cases involve people who stayed at the park's popular Curry Village in mid-June. The park said its officials are trying to reach those who vacationed in these ""tent cabins"" from June through this month, when the accommodations were thoroughly cleaned, and urge them to get medical help if they show any symptoms of hantavirus. Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is a rare but often fatal lung disease that kills about a third of those who get infected. Don Neubacher, Yosemite's superintendent, noted that people typically don't fall ill with hantavirus until between one and six weeks after they are exposed. ""The health of our visitors is our paramount concern, and we are making every effort to notify and inform our visitors of any potential illness,"" Neubacher said. Two contracted hantavirus while visiting Yosemite . In the United States, the carriers of hantavirus are deer mice, cotton rats, rice rats and white-footed mice, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus can be present in the rodents' urine, droppings and saliva, and is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus, the CDC says. The virus is not communicable from person to person. Earlier this month, the California Department of Public Health said two state residents who came down with the disease may have been exposed to mice droppings or urine that contained hantavirus while staying at the park. An unidentified 37-year-old man from the San Francisco Bay area died in late July, said Dr. Vicki Kramer, chief of the department's vector-borne disease section. A Southern California woman in her 40s survived and is recovering, Kramer told CNN. The two stayed in separate locations at the village, which contains about 400 canvas tent and wooden cabins. Yosemite ranger and spokesman Scott Gediman described the cabins as ""very sparse but comfortable."" Park officials have not given details about the one new confirmed case or the ""probable"" one. Officials have focused on deer mice, common in the high-elevation eastern Sierra Nevada region. The mice are gray or brown on top, with white bellies. Their ears have no fur. ""Rodents can infest a whole range of these structures,"" Kramer said. ""Deer mice can get in a hole one-quarter inch in diameter."" In addition to cleaning the 400 camp structures, park officials have said they've increased routine measures to reduce the hantavirus risk. ""You cannot eliminate all the mice,"" Kramer said. ""There are a lot of people and snacks that people bring into their tents or cabins."" Prior to this year, Yosemite National Park saw one hantavirus case each in 2000 and 2010. There is no specific treatment for a hantavirus infection, according to the CDC, but the earlier a patient is brought to intensive care, the better. Diagnosis is difficult, because early symptoms of fever, muscle aches and fatigue often are confused with the flu. ""However, if the individual is experiencing fever and fatigue, and has a history of potential rural rodent exposure, together with shortness of breath, (that) would be strongly suggestive of HPS,"" the CDC says.","Yosemite says a June visitor to its park died after contracting hantavirus .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration will allow minors to obtain one form of the emergency contraception known as the ""morning-after pill,"" dropping its appeal of a judge's order requiring it to be sold over the counter. U.S. District Judge Edward Korman had ruled in April that the government must allow over-the-counter sales, and a federal appeals court rejected the administration's challenge to that ruling last week. The administration had been criticized by some women's rights groups for trying to stop contraception sales to underage females. In a Monday letter to Korman, Justice Department attorneys said the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services had agreed to make the single-pill version of the drug available ""without age or point-of-sale restrictions."" ""It is the government's understanding that this course of action fully complies with the Court's judgment in this action,"" the letter states. ""Once the Court confirms that the government's understanding is correct, the government intends to file with the Circuit Court notice that it is voluntarily withdrawing its appeal in this matter."" The FDA has asked the maker of the single-pill emergency contraceptive known as Plan B One-Step to submit a new request for over-the-counter approval, the letter states. The agency ""will approve it without delay"" once filed. But the FDA won't allow girls to obtain a two-pill version of the drug, saying there is less safety data available on the use of the product by younger adolescents. An Obama administration official told CNN on Tuesday that the latest court ruling meant that a version of the drug would have to be made available over the counter, and if the administration had appealed, it would have been the two-pill version. Facing that reality, officials decided to move forward with the one-pill version rather than letting the two-pill configuration hit the market, the official said. The key ingredient in Plan B is the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel, which can prevent fertilization or prevent a fertilized egg from embedding in the uterus. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours. The FDA announced two years ago there would be no limits on over-the-counter sales of morning-after pills. But Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius unilaterally ordered the age and prescription restrictions, prompting lawsuits. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, praised the decision. ""After far too long of a delay, science has prevailed,"" said Murray, who called emergency contraception ""an essential part of women's basic health care."" ""Today's move by the administration means the safety and effectiveness of Plan B, not politics, will dictate access,"" she said. And the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America said the decision ""ends a nearly decade-long battle over lowering barriers to this important medication."" ""Health experts like the American Academy of Pediatrics and many others agree that emergency contraception is safe and effective for women of all ages,"" Ilyse Hogue, president of the rights group, said in a statement hailing the move. ""We're happy to see this long overdue victory for science over politics."" The move is likely to draw criticism from opponents of abortion rights, who had condemned Korman's April ruling. Korman had criticized what he called ""nonsensical"" government rules that he said unfairly favored the single-pill version over the cheaper, generic two-pill version. Under current policies, prescriptions are still needed for the generic version for those under age 17. Supporters of Korman's ruling called it a landmark decision, while opponents raised concerns about safeguards being eliminated. The FDA said in May that it was changing its regulations, allowing sales by a private pharmaceutical firm, Teva Women's Health, to those 15 and over without a prescription. Only those 17 or older were previously allowed to buy the contraceptive. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe. Other countries sell the pill without a prescription.","NEW: Decision keeps two-pill version of drug off over-the-counter market, official says .

"Trion, Georgia (CNN) -- Christopher Wolfe has a Tough As Nails, I Love America attitude. His pride swells along with his tattooed biceps. He's a dying breed, a blue-collar American working on a product as American as apple pie. Blue jeans. ""This is our lifeline,"" Wolfe says. Those jeans you squeezed into this morning? It's likely they began right here at Mount Vernon Mills, one of the last functioning cotton mills in America and the nation's No. 1 producer of denim. In a tiny enclave of northwest Georgia, Wolfe and 1,200 of his colleagues churn out enough denim per week for 800,000 pairs of blue jeans. Most U.S. mills shut down years ago, unable to compete with cheap overseas labor. And in another sign of the global economy, the fabric woven here is rarely sent to American plants to be turned into jeans. Instead, the fabric is shipped mostly to factories in Mexico. The jeans then carry labels that read ""Made in Mexico of U.S. fabric."" Blame NAFTA. Blame outsourcing. Blame corporate greed for the selling out of America's manufacturing soul. ""I'd rather see people over here work, instead of struggling -- instead of giving somebody in another country a chance to make money that [Americans] should be making,"" says Wolfe, 31. He's got a scar across his forehead, a shaved head and goatee. Like a pair of well-worn blue jeans, he's rough and tough. Some workers here are second- and third-generation employees, following in the footsteps of their fathers, mothers and grandparents. Wolfe's dad and brother work at the mill. You can see the pride in their faces: Made in U.S.A., baby. ""We contribute a lot to America,"" Wolfe says with a smile. He's a father of four young daughters. He makes about $9 an hour. He toils for them, for his little girls, so they can have a better a life. ""This mill here,"" he says, ""it feeds my family."" It has been in existence since 1845, when slaves handpicked cotton in the South. Back then, mill workers spun the cotton into fabric and shipped it to factories in the North. It's said Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman came through Trion, Georgia, during the Civil War and decided not to burn the factory down. The reason remains town lore. Some speculate the Union general might've been treated to the charms of Southern hospitality at the local hotel (wink, wink). What's a good Southern tale without -- dare we say it? -- some yarnspinning. ""Boss Man"" who fights for workers . Inside, you can't help but marvel at the scene around you. Hundreds of spools of thread churn all at once, with computer-like precision. There's a million-square-feet of manufacturing space, much of it Canadian rock maple hardwood floors. It's clean with a brilliant shine. Thread shoots every which way, as if Spider-Man came through. Go from cotton field to denim . The sweet, distinct smell of cotton permeates the mill -- like that of nature in a hardwood forest, with the faint hint of a wet Labrador retriever. When you walk through with general manager Don Henderson, the workers pause. They glance at ""Boss Man"". Many stroll over to shake his hand. How you doing? Everything, OK? Henderson is one reason this place is still in business, on American soil. He has an aww-shucks attitude. He'll tell you it's those men and women out there on the floor that keep it going. He's got pride in the plant, in his workers and in his family. His father worked for 39 years in the spinning department. His brother retired from the plant after 42 years, having started when he was 16 and eventually making his way into management. ""If I had the ultimate say-so, we would be right here for the next 100 years,"" says Henderson, 64, who has worked in the plant for 40 years. While the nation's manufacturing base has shrunk, Mount Vernon Mills is a rare exception. The tiny town of Trion -- pronounced Try-On, as in ""our residents always 'try on,'"" 78-year-old Mayor Benny Perry says -- has a staggeringly large annual budget for such a small town. Its $12 million, mostly from taxes the mill pays, provides a state-of-the-art public school, park space and athletic fields. If the mill shuttered, ""it would destroy the town,"" Perry says. In its heydey, the mill had 5,000 workers in the 1940s and 1950s. The company owned everything in town back then, from the tiny mill houses that surround the plant to the town hospital where Henderson and many of his co-workers were born. As a result, Trion doesn't have a quaint town square. The mill is the centerpiece. About two years ago, when the nation's recession hit hard, the plant had to layoff about 200 workers. ""It was awful,"" Henderson says. To save as many jobs as possible and to maximize efficiency, the plant switched to two, 12-hour shifts. That's down from three shifts, five days a week. The denim for jeans goes to companies as wide-ranging as Wal-Mart to JCPenney to Dickies to Polo and other high-priced brands. Henderson's most proud of the mill's ties to cowboys. ""We make the Wrangler rodeo cowboy jeans that all the rodeo guys still wear,"" he says. ""We make the fabric right here and have been for -- gosh -- 30 years."" Henderson holds up one roll of distressed fabric that's nearly ready to be shipped. It's denim that once was used for lower-end clothing. But yuppies like the look. Henderson chuckles and shakes his head. Martha Teague is 63 and has worked in the mill for the past 35 years. She says other company towns had bosses that sold them out, that cared more about the dollar than its people. ""It just gives me a good feeling to be a part of that family of Mount Vernon Mills,"" says Teague, who has a son working at the plant. ""It has educated my children and gives us a house and everything we have really."" Wolfe wheels 13,000 yards of yarn into the dimly lit ""ballroom."" It's placed among a heap of others. ""We're lucky to have what we got. Other small towns, they don't have that."" He turns and walks away in the orange glow of the ballroom. You want to know a secret? A $12 pair of jeans often comes from the same roll of denim as a $150 designer pair.","Cotton mill in northwest Georgia is America's No. 1 producer of denim .

"(EW.com) -- No one wants a Liberace biopic to be subtle. You want the director to don a puffy-sleeved man-blouse and spell out the drama in rhinestones. You want the camera to linger on the peacock-feathered pianos, the velveteen ''royal throne'' toilets, and, of course, that white fox-fur coat — the only coat in the world with its own chauffeur. And you'll get all of that in Steven Soderbergh's ""Behind the Candelabra,"" which casts Michael Douglas as the Vegas legend and Matt Damon as his much younger lover Scott Thorson, whose memoir of their tumultuous five-year relationship inspired the film. But there's less razzle-dazzle here than you'd expect from a portrait of a camp icon. Despite the stranger details of their courtship — say, the fact that Liberace had Thorson undergo plastic surgery to look more like him, or that he offered to adopt his young paramour — their love feels as banal as any married couple's, right up until the end, when Thorson sues Liberace for palimony. The man deserved a sensational, Sunset Boulevard-style tribute; what he got plays more like a Lifetime movie. To be clear, there's still just enough camp gold to get the best lines bedazzled on a leotard. (My favorite: ''Honey, in gay years, you're Judy during the Sid Luft obese period.'') Also, casting Rob Lowe as Liberace's drug-pushing, alien-faced plastic surgeon is a genius move that allows the actor to send up his pretty-boy image. But Douglas' performance is surprisingly restrained, especially given that he's playing a man who lived in fear every day that his double life would be exposed. The more secretive parts of Liberace's world, like his obsession with sex clubs and porn, come across as quirky rather than dark. And Damon, who captures Thorson's damaged-child side well, makes him a little too sympathetic. (After all, this is a guy who's now in jail for burglary.) It's interesting that Soderbergh couldn't get ""Candelabra"" made as a feature film; he says it's because studios feared it was ''too gay.'' Liberace's fans were actually mostly straight women, the older, blue-haired types. And for better or worse, that seems like the target audience for this movie, a glossy story of love gone wrong and then (slightly) redeemed at the end, without a whole lot of deep pathos in between. Those ladies might've been comforted by Liberace's final words in the movie: ''Too much of a good thing is wonderful,'' he says. That's true — but just a little bit more of a bad thing might've been better. Grade: B- . ""Behind the Candelabra"" will air Sunday May 26 on HBO. HBO is owned by the parent company of CNN and EW.

"(CNN) -- As former governors, we were honored to serve the people of our respective states. While we represent different political parties, we are united in our belief that government has stopped working for the American people -- and that real reform of the electoral process is needed to get it back on track. As we look at our politics today, we are deeply troubled by the corrosive role that special interest money has come to play in determining who runs for office and who wins, and its influence over what policy decisions that are made in the legislative process. Policymakers in our nation's capital seem incapable of addressing our most pressing challenges, and the hyper-partisanship of recent times is only made worse by the fact Congress is dependent on the funders, not the voters. Indeed, surveys consistently indicate large majorities of Americans agree that wealthy special interests have too much sway over the political system. And if you look at where campaign contributions come from, they're right. In the last national election cycle, less than 1% of the population was responsible for providing the vast majority of campaign funds, with 0.1% of citizens contributing $2,500 or more in the last election and accounting for fully 67% of total itemized donations. Opinion: Why Washington is corrupt . We know of only one way to fundamentally change our broken pay-to-play system: public funding of elections. The concept is straightforward - put ownership of our public elections in the hands of voters, not special-interest donors, and the politicians who are elected will be accountable to them. While the need for campaign reform on the national level may be painfully self-evident, there is little sign of attention or movement from either end of Pennsylvania Avenue. There is a significant opportunity for success in New York State, however, as a many lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo support the enactment of a campaign finance reform package that includes a system of public funding of elections. Legislation based on the very successful small donor matching fund system that has been in operation in New York City for 25 years has passed the State Assembly, and now it is up to the State Senate to follow suit. The New York City system is voluntary, giving a candidate the option of opting in, and it enjoys strong public support, encouraging political competition while greatly increasing the participation of small donors and curtailing the influence of special interests in city government. In addition, three states offer candidates for public office to compete in this way -- Arizona, Connecticut, and Maine. Qualified citizens from all walks of life are able to serve, and the relationship between money and politics is greatly reduced. In New Jersey, public funding of elections is available to candidates for Governor, allowing candidates who qualify with a greater ability to run for office and get their ideas before voters. As a result of federal court decisions that equate political expenditures with the exercise of the first amendment, participation in public funding of elections systems must be voluntary in order to meet constitutional muster. The current campaign finance system will not be wholly replaced, but public funding of elections allows candidates without access to large donors and special-interest backing to compete against those candidates who do, as the practical experience in New York City and the states that have full public funding of elections strongly demonstrate. New York's campaign finance system is built for the big donor -- not the average voter. Individuals can contribute up to $60,800 to a single candidate, more than 10 times the limit to presidential candidates. The end result is that the vast majority of citizens who can't afford to make big donations feel shut out and disconnected from those that represent them. In addition to small donor public financing, lowering contribution limits will enhance the participation of citizens in New York's political system. The public supports this fundamental reform of our political system strongly, both nationally and in New York State. A recent public opinion survey indicated that 80% of Independents, 75% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans support a small donor matching system of public funding of elections. Voters need to hold their elected officials accountable, letting them know that supporting and participating in a reformed campaign finance system is a voting issue. Campaign finance reform in New York State will not only improve how Albany works, it has national implications. New York can lead the way, providing a beacon to the nation. A son of New York, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed a system of public funding of elections in 1905. This is in keeping with the grand tradition of innovation that New Yorkers have led in the past, and enacting campaign finance reform with a small donor match as its centerpiece will continue that tradition. Making our political system work for the American people is a cause that political leaders across the spectrum can and should get behind. We urge the New York Legislature and Governor Cuomo to work enact campaign finance reform now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Dean and Christine Todd Whitman.","Howard Dean, Christine Todd Whitman: Government has stopped working for the people .

"(CNN) -- Nina Allam was nervous. She was about to meet someone she had been chatting with online since February. Nina Allam and Sean Barbary were married in the virtual world of Second Life before meeting for the first time. ""I was terrified on the train. Very, very nervous.

"Remember when vitamin C was hailed as the best, and maybe only, cold remedy? Then it became the Rodney Dangerfield of vitamins: It didn't get any respect. Citrus and other sources of Vitamin C can help fend off cancer, strokes and Alzheimer's disease. The nutrient's glory days of curing scurvy-riddled sailors via juicy citrus fruit seemed to be the only thing keeping its reputation afloat, particularly after a massive research review found C to be virtually useless for fighting colds. But don't believe it. The truth is that scientists have taken a fresh look at C -- and have found lots of new ways it can help you stay healthy and look and feel younger. Here's the latest on what C can really do for you. Prevent wrinkles . You can't pick up a beauty product these days without the label touting its antioxidants. There's a good reason: Antioxidants -- like vitamin C -- help turn back the clock. An October 2007 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that people who ate foods rich in vitamin C had fewer wrinkles and less age-related dry skin than those whose diets contained only small amounts of the vitamin. C helps form collagen, which smooths fine lines and wrinkles, according to Patricia Farris, MD, clinical assistant professor of dermatology at Tulane University in New Orleans. The key seems to be C's ability to fight free radicals, a by-product of cell metabolism in your body. Free radicals are thought to attack proteins, fats, and DNA and break down collagen. C also seems to guard against ultraviolet rays from the sun, which can lead to freckles and a mottled complexion. ""Vitamin C does some repair and firming on the skin,"" Farris says. Health.com: Can you guess her age? What to do now: Use a topical vitamin C treatment daily after you wash your face and before you slather on moisturizer or sunscreen so it penetrates the skin. Farris recommends La Roche-Posay Active C facial moisturizer or SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic topical antioxidant treatment. Protect your heart . Experts continue to argue about whether antioxidants like vitamin C can prevent heart disease. But some of the evidence is highly persuasive. When Finnish researchers looked at studies involving nearly 300,000 people over 10 years, they found that taking more than 700 milligrams of C supplements daily reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease by 25 percent. And a recent study from Harvard University researchers hints that women who take a combo of 500 milligrams of vitamin C daily and 600 IU of vitamin E (another antioxidant) can cut their risk of stroke by 30 percent. It's possible that people who take vitamin supplements simply have healthier lifestyles than those who don't, which could explain this finding. It's also possible, experts say, that C enhances the functioning of endothelial cells (which line the inside of all blood vessels), slowing artery clogging and lowering blood pressure. What to do now: Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, which are full of vitamin C as well as other healthy nutrients, and consider taking C and E supplements. Experts say there are essentially no risks, but first check with your doctor. Health.com: Get your C's here . Keep cancer at bay . A diet full of vitamin C--rich fruits and vegetables isn't just good for your heart, it may also lower your risks of bladder, esophagus, stomach, and lung cancers. Even though more research is needed to find out which compounds in fruits and veggies do the trick, researchers say the association is strong. Someday, C may also be used to treat cancer. High levels of C given intravenously seem to be toxic to cancer cells (studies on vitamin C taken orally showed no effect on cancerous cells). Intravenous C appears to trigger the formation of hydrogen peroxide, which kills some cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed, says lead study author Mark Levine, MD, chief of the molecular and clinical nutrition section and senior staff physician at the National Institutes of Health. Levine says doctors at the University of Kansas Medical School and Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia are trying this therapy on cancer patients. What to do now: ""Strive for five or more fruits and vegetables daily, in a rainbow of colors,"" Levine says. ""It's where the most benefit is. Health.com: CAn C fight off a cold? Boost brain power . Pairing vitamins C and E is smart for another reason: It may lessen your Alzheimer's risks by as much as 64 percent, according to research in the Archives of Neurology. Just 500 milligrams of C and 400 IU of E appear to be enough. The brain's high fat content makes it especially vulnerable to free radicals, but these antioxidants may act as shields, says study author Peter Zandi, PhD, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Some studies suggest that vitamin E does its job reducing free radicals in the body, but then its capacity is depleted,"" Zandi says. ""Vitamin C may recharge E.""  Health.com: The best multivitamin for you . What to do now: Try taking C and E supplements, and talk to your doc about your risks for Alzheimer's and dementia. Save your eyesight . Vitamin C can't prevent the need for reading glasses around age 45. But anti-oxidants, including C, help prevent one of the leading causes of blindness: age-related macular degeneration (AMD). More than 3.5 million Americans are thought to be in the early stages, and the disease strikes more women than men. A major clinical trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute showed that a daily supplement of 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, 15 milligrams of beta-carotene, 80 milligrams of zinc, and 2 milligrams of copper reduced the risk of moderate or severe AMD-related vision loss by up to 25 percent. The antioxidants neutralize damage to the retina caused by, you guessed it, free radicals. What to do now: If you're at high risk for AMD (you're overweight or have a family history), check to see if your multi-vitamin contains the study's amounts of C, E, beta-carotene/vitamin A, zinc, and copper. Chances are, its C and E levels fall short, but additional supplements will do the job. (Caveat: Don't follow this advice if you smoke; this level of beta-carotene may up your lung-cancer risks.) Help you live longer . You've probably heard that green tea boosts the body's defenses against toxins. That's important because toxins are thought to contribute to cancer, heart attack, stroke, and lots of other maladies. In fact, one to two cups a day may reduce a woman's risk of dying by about 20 per-cent, Japanese researchers say. What's the vitamin C connection? Citrus juices (lemon, lime, orange) may supercharge the immunity-boosting power of green tea. A new Purdue University study found that mixing citrus juice with green tea allowed 80 percent of the tea's anti-oxidants to stick around after simulated digestion, making the pairing healthier than thought, says study author Mario G. Ferruzzi, PhD, assistant professor in Purdue's department of food and nutrition. What to do now: Add at least an ounce of citrus juice to your green tea -- or try Tazo Lemon Green iced tea or SoBe Green Tea 3G. Both drinks are stocked with vitamin C. E-mail to a friend .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Three Chechens suspected of Islamist terrorist activity were arrested in France this week in a joint French-Spanish operation, Spain's Interior Ministry said Friday. The arrests Tuesday were a follow-up to raids last August in southern Spain when police broke up a suspected three-man terrorist cell that planned attacks in Spain and elsewhere in Europe, the ministry statement said. The August 2012 raids, in the town of Linea de la Concepcion, on the Spanish border with the British colony Gibraltar, turned up evidence that the suspected terror cell had links in France and other European countries, the ministry said. That eventually led to the arrests Tuesday. The suspects were identified as Ali Dokaev, arrested in Noyon, 100 kilometers (62 miles) northeast of Paris; Elsy Issakov, arrested in Les Lilas on the east side of Paris; and Mourad Idrissov, arrested in Genevieve des Bois, on the south side of Paris, the ministry said. The alleged ringleader of the group charged with terrorist offenses in Spain, Eldar Magomedov, is from the Russian republic of Dagestan. Western intelligence services had located him in France along with a Chechen associate in the first half of 2012, according to Fernando Reinares, a senior terrorism analyst at the Elcano Royal Institute in Madrid. Magomedov, a former Russian special forces commando, had attended training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Reinares said, citing intelligence passed to Spain by other intelligence services. Between 2008 and 2011, he had operated in Dagestan and the Pakistani tribal territories of North and South Waziristan, transiting between them, Reinares said. Western intelligence had established that Magomedov had ties to both al Qaeda and the Islamic Jihad Union, an Uzbek group affiliated to al Qaeda that in 2007 orchestrated a plot to kill U.S. soldiers in Germany, Reinares told CNN. French security services tipped off their Spanish counterparts about the probable arrival of Magomedov and the Chechen associate, Muhammad Adamov, in May, according to Reinares. The French had been tracking the duo and monitoring their phone calls. At one point, they intercepted a phone call in which the two men described Spain as a ""more easy country to get explosives,"" the analyst said. While on French soil, Magomedov established a connection with individuals of North Caucasus origin who were under police surveillance for their involvement in a network of suspected Chechen jihadists, Reinares told CNN. He said the arrests in France this week were likely to be related to the connections Magomedov made while in France. Magomedov and Adamov were arrested by Spanish police in August on a bus traveling toward France. Both deny the charges against them and await trial. Reinares said the arrests in France and Spain show greater attention needs to be focused on Islamist militant networks originating from the North Caucasus. A British counterterrorism official told CNN last year that one the most pronounced new challenges for Western intelligence services is the growing nexus between organized criminal groups from the region and terrorist groups operating on European soil.","Three suspects are arrested in a joint French-Spanish operation, Spanish officials say .

"All antidepressant drugs are not created equal, according to the authors of one of the few studies that have ever systematically analyzed and compared ""new generation"" medicines for treating depression. What qualities are important in an anti-depressant? Efficacy? Tolerance? Side effects? Cost? In the analysis of 12 drugs, two came out on top as the most effective and best tolerated as first-line treatments: sertraline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro). Venlafaxine (Effexor) and mirtazapine (Remeron) rounded out the top four for effectiveness, but venlafaxine was also among the four drugs patients were most likely to quit taking because of side effects. Reboxetine (Edronax) was less effective than the rest. While psychiatrists treating depressed patients every day have had a sense of which medications are best, the current study ""nails it,"" says Sagar V. Parikh, M.D., of the University of Toronto. Parikh, who wrote a comment accompanying the study that is published in the current issue of The Lancet, says the findings have ""enormous implications"" because, for the first time, they offer doctors an evidence-based, unbiased way to recommend treatment. And, he adds, they give patients a ""gold standard of reliable information,"" especially since the study's authors plan to make their findings available free on the Web. Not so fast, says Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., M.P.H., who coauthored a review of the benefits and risks of the same 12 drugs published last November in the Annals of Internal Medicine. He and his colleagues concluded, based on their review done while Gartlehner was at the RTI-UNC Evidence-Based Practice Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.,  that there was no clinically meaningful evidence that any one of the drugs was better than the rest. Instead, they argued, decisions on which drug to use should be based on factors such as cost and side effects. In the current study, Andrea Cipriani, M.D., of the University of Verona in Italy, and colleagues used a new technique called multiple-treatments meta-analysis to make head-to-head comparisons among the 12 drugs, incorporating 117 randomized controlled trials including 25,928 patients in all. There has been little scientific evidence of the relative effectiveness of these drugs, because most studies compare one against a handful of others or a placebo, and are often funded by the maker of a particular drug, which can bias the findings in its favor, the researchers note. Health.com: How to brighten your winter mood . They used two measurements to gauge a drug's effectiveness and tolerability: the percentage of patients who showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms as measured by one of two scales, or who scored ""much improved or very much improved"" after eight weeks of treatment (or from  six to twelve weeks if eight-week data weren't available) and the percentage of patients who dropped out of the study before eight weeks for any reason. The 12 drugs included bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, milnacipran, mirtazapine, paroxetine, reboxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine. The authors did not use any funding from drug manufacturers to conduct their study. ""This is an unbiased approach to combining the maximum possible data and comparing a large number of drugs rather than one versus a select handful, so there's much more confidence in these findings,"" says Parikh. Basically,  Parikh explains, Cipriani and colleagues were able to make comparisons among drugs that hadn't been studied head-to-head by using their effectiveness as compared with Prozac -- the best studied of these drugs -- as a kind of common currency. ""There are limitations to the indirect approach used -- nonetheless, we think its the best available at present. The analysis will need to be updated regularly to include all new upcoming evidence,"" Cipriani and coauthor John Geddes, M.D., director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Mental Health at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, said via e-mail. The findings don't mean that everyone should be put on Zoloft or Lexapro, and they shouldn't be seen as suggesting that people who are on other drugs should go off them, Cipriani and Geddes say. Health.com: 3 signs you should stop, adjust, or switch antidepressants . While it's good to have choices available since not everyone will benefit from a particular drug, there also seem to be a lot of ""me too"" products out there that offer no additional benefit but cost more, the authors add. They suggest that future studies should compare new antidepressants with sertraline, rather than to a placebo or a cherry-picked selection of other drugs. ""Requiring new treatments to show either greater efficacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me-too agents that offer little to patients other than increased costs,"" they write. But according to Gartlehner, who is now with the Danube University in Krems, Austria, the approach Cipriani et. al. used has ""serious downsides"" that they did not acknowledge. Also, he argues, their use of odds ratios rather than relative risks led to overestimations of the differences among the various drugs. Health.com: Head-to-toe solutions for stress . ""Most of these differences are statistically significant, but they're probably not clinically relevant,"" Gartlehner said. ""It's quite a stretch to say that...clinically important differences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants."" He and his colleagues did see differences among the drugs in side-effect profiles that could in fact be relevant to patients, Gartlehner said, and he argues that the finding that venlaxafine caused more nausea and vomiting while sertraline was associated with diarrhea, as well as the fact that some drugs must be taken several times a day while others can be taken less often, are important considerations, along with cost. But for Parikh, the differences in effectiveness and tolerability that Cipriani identified can make a real difference to patients. ""The magnitude of these differences is not huge in terms of effectiveness. It's genuine, but it's modest,"" Parikh said. ""You can say to a patient, 'Do you want the strongest possible drug or do you want the one that's least likely to give you side effects, or do you want some balance?'"" Health.com: Boost your mood naturally . He added, ""It allows a dialogue to say, 'What suits you?' And if you're able to engage a patient in that dialogue, there's a much better chance of a patient sticking to that treatment because they've been able to tailor that treatment to their individual preference.""

"Russian club Zenit St Petersburg joined Europe's biggest spending clubs of the summer transfer window after splashing out a reported $101m to sign Brazilian striker Hulk and Belgian midfielder Axel Witsel from Portuguese clubs Porto and Benfica. The 26-year-old Hulk, who played for Brazil during the 2012 Olympics, joined Zenit on a five-year contract in a transfer deal worth $50.7m, while the 23-year-old Witsel signed for a similar fee and length of contract. Those two signings pushed Zenit's spending to over $132m for the 2012/2013 season just behind English Premier League club Chelsea ($140m) and French side Paris St Germain ($206m). Fair play? Football clubs seek to beat financial offside trap . Hulk, whose full name is Givanildo Vieira de Souza, joined Porto in 2008 from Tokyo Verdy after scoring 54 goals in 103 league matches for the Japanese club. Following his move to Portugal, the Brazilian won three league titles with Porto, the Portuguese Cup and Super Cup as well as the Europa League title. ""This is another important victory, another important step in my life,"" Hulk, who has played 14 times for Brazil, told the Zenit website. ""But I have to say that I`m thankful to Porto for the opportunity to open doors for me in Russia. I was very happy in Portugal. ""I want to be happy in Zenit, and in Russia too. I want to work in that direction: to get victories and win many titles, just like it was in Porto."" Hulk added: ""At first I wanted to play as number 12, but I was told that this number belongs to the club's fans. A friend of mine recommended that I take number 29. He told me that's a special number."" Capped 30 times by Belgium, Witsel joined Benfica from Standard Liege, where he made his professional debut at the age of 17. Both players have been signed in time to play for Zenit in the Champions League, with the Russian club drawn in the same group as Malaga, AC Milan and Anderlecht.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two separate bomb blasts in different parts of Pakistan on Sunday killed a total of at least 47 people and wounded more than 90 others, authorities said. The attacks are the latest in a series of violent acts that have struck Pakistan in recent weeks, underscoring the daunting challenges faced by security forces and the new government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The deadlier of the two explosions Sunday hit Hazara Town, a Shiite Muslim district on the outskirts of the southwestern city of Quetta. A suicide bomber blew himself up, killing at least 30 people and wounding 50 others, police said. Hazara Town gets its name from the Hazaras, a Shiite minority from neighboring Afghanistan many of whom have settled in and around Quetta. Hundreds of Shiites, including many Hazaras, have been killed in bloody attacks over the past year and a half by extremist groups in Pakistan, a predominantly Sunni Muslim country. Roadside bomb kills 17 in northwest Pakistan . Human rights groups have criticized the failure of authorities to clamp down on Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Sunni organization that has admitted carrying out much of the violence against Shiites. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for Sunday's bombing in Hazara Town, the Urdu-language Express newspaper reported. CNN wasn't able to reach the group for comment. The other bomb attack Sunday targeted a paramilitary convoy on patrol near the northwestern city of Peshawar, the gateway to Pakistan's tribal region, a largely ungoverned area where the Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups operate. At least 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of explosives were packed into a parked vehicle and detonated remotely as the Frontier Corps convoy passed through the area of Bedhber, killing 17 people and wounding 42 others, according to police and hospital officials. Pakistani government officials condemned both the attacks that took place Sunday. The weekend violence came as British Prime Minister David Cameron visited Pakistan and met with Sharif, who took office last month. The bombings followed a number of other shocking attacks in the past month and national elections in May that were plagued by killings of participants. Last weekend, gunmen opened fire at a lodge at the base of one of Pakistan's highest peaks, killing 10 foreign tourists and a Pakistani guide. The weekend before that, militants bombed a university bus in Quetta, killing 12 young women on board. They then attacked a hospital where survivors from the blast were taken for treatment, leaving another 14 people dead. Actress in critical condition after acid attack in Pakistan .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Ramadan, that holy month of fasting and dawn-to-dusk abstinence, is a key period in the Muslim calendar apart from its standing as one of the five Pillars of Islam. Men gather to watch TV after breaking their fast in Manama, Bahrain. More typically associated with praying, fasting and religious contemplation, it's also the month that Muslims are more glued to the tube than at any other time during the year, much like Thanksgiving or Christmas in the United States. The dozens of TV drama series known as ""musalsals,"" prepared precisely for Ramadan -- and the loyal following they attract -- is testament to its significance in the Muslim world's TV calendar. Quiz shows, talk shows and biographical series also form part of the annual Ramadan line-up.  On the set of Ramadan's TV dramas » . ""Part of the Ramadan tradition is to gather with friends and family and watch TV,"" Ismail Kutkut told CNN. Kutkut is the producer of a biopic about 1940s Egyptian singer Laila Mourad, one of Ramadan 2009's most anticipated shows. ""There's a lot more advertising than usual because of the high viewership,"" Kutkut said. ""Subsequently, TV channels are able to pay series producers higher than average prices for their productions. ""[That] encourages producers to make high quality shows since they're guaranteed a good return on their investment."" Viewership shoots up during Ramadan, according to IPSOS, a Paris-based ratings agency, as does advertising -- and advertising costs. A 30-second ad on Dubai TV normally costs $1,748, according to the agency. During Ramadan, that jumps to $6,588, a 277 percent increase. Everywhere around the region, it's the same story. On Saudi-owned MBC1, an ad spot goes from $4,450 during the off-season to $12,104 during Ramadan -- almost three times as much, according to IPSOS.  Watch Ramadan TV battles » . The streets and rooftops of Cairo, the Arab world's largest city, are plastered with huge ads for big-budget Ramadan shows, and the producers of programming across the Middle East compete fiercely for viewers. Egypt, with its decades-long cinematic history, has long dominated Ramadan TV. But new program producers in other Arab countries, Syria particularly, have lately been giving the Egyptians a run for their television money. ""Egypt has a long history in movie-making that goes back a hundred years, whereas the Syrians are new to this,"" said Kutkut. ""It's still too early to tell whether they will last in the industry."" The shows air after the ""iftar"" meal -- the often elaborate family supper, eaten after dusk, when the daily fast is broken. ""TV has become something of a main course during Ramadan and it shares the importance of food, and sometimes it overtakes it,"" Syrian director Bassam Al Mallah told CNN. Al Mallah's hit show, ""Bab Al Hara,"" was the most watched musalsal of last year's Ramadan TV viewing extravaganza. ""The Arabic viewer during Ramadan tends to be more of a homebody. Staying home with the family is part of the Ramadan tradition, so most Ramadan TV shows are primarily geared toward a family audience."" ""Bab Al Hara"" is a perfect example. A period Syrian soap now in its fourth Ramadan season, the series is the story of a man and his pregnant wife who are separated during the French occupation of Damascus during the two world wars. It portrays the life of extended Syrian families, all in period costume, living in old Damascus neighborhoods during that time. ""Bab al Hara,"" like most Ramadan series, is on every night for the entire month. Asked what made the show so popular, actor Milad Youssef said it was because it delved into family relationships like ""the relationship between a father and his children, a mother and her children ... between siblings."" ""People were thirsty for such representations, especially since they were presented in a historical context,"" he told CNN. ""When people saw that these values existed at a certain point in history and that it was on TV, they felt a kind of melancholy for that, and no doubt this reflects certain values that exist in today's society."" Sometimes the shows can go too far, though, sparking condemnation from conservative clerics in the region. Last Ramadan, the hugely successful Turkish-made soap ""Noor,"" whose end was timed to coincide with the holiday, was slammed by Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Asheikh as an immoral show produced by ""people who are specialists in crime and error, people who invite men and women to the devil."" The show, which in one episode alone last year reached a whopping 85 million people scattered from Morocco to the Gulf, features the marriage of ""poor but proud"" Noor to ""rich but macho"" Muhannad. Biographical series, like the one featuring singer Mourad, are also extremely popular with Ramadan audiences, according to Kutkut. ""There's a huge demand for this genre,"" he said, adding that if he had shopped his Mourad show around, he probably could have sold it to at least ""18 different channels."" Kutkut said shows that touch on pan-Arab issues, using actors from different countries speaking different Arabic dialects, also have tremendous appeal around the region. ""Shows that bring down barriers really appeal to people's sensibilities,"" he said. Egyptian actor, musician, TV talk show host and president of the Cairo Film Festival, Ezzat Abou Ouf, who plays Mourad's father in this year's biopic of the singer, said out of the some 60-80 TV series he's involved with each year, 50 of them are destined for Ramadan. ""People are just so attached to the television during Ramadan,"" he said. ""We don't work a lot then, maybe that's the reason, I don't know.""","Muslims in the Mideast watch more TV during Ramadan than at any other time .

"(CNN) -- Feeding tubes are designed to nourish patients, not deprive them of calories and hasten weight loss. News reports of a feeding tube diet popped up, followed by a slew of TV reports on the new ""trend."" But for people who survive by feeding tubes -- patients with diseases such as cystic fibrosis, certain autoimmune diseases, problems with malabsorption -- the idea of using a medical tool for vanity is upsetting. ""That people would do this intentionally to themselves to lose weight when thousands of children have no choice -- why would someone willingly make a choice to do this?"" asked Julie Springer, a mother of two children who use feeding tubes. What made it particularly disturbing was how blasÃ© they appeared about this medical procedure, she said. ""It's just absurd. For us, this isn't a choice,"" said Springer, the media coordinator for the American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders . The diet reportedly uses a nasal gastric tube, which doesn't require a surgical procedure like the gastric feeding tubes. These feeding tubes have a piece inside the stomach and a type of clamp to keep them in place. Samantha Pecoraro, 14, has a permanent feeding tube in her stomach because nearly all foods trigger a violent reaction in her digestive tracts. ""They're making it sound like a fun privilege, which it isn't,"" she said about the tube diet. ""That's so disgusting, that makes me so upset. If you'd like to lose weight, exercise and go on a diet. They're making a mockery of it; they make it look so simple. They take it out in 10 days, I can't take [my feeding tube] out in 10 days."" Samantha gets most of her nutrition from a formula fed through the gastric feeding tube. She has a rare autoimmune disease called eosinophilic esophagitis, in which white blood cells build up in the esophagus and react to foods and allergens. For Samantha, it's bizarre logic to use a survival tool for nourishment and twist it into a way to help people lose weight through caloric deprivation. ""Feeding tubes are for survival, not for cosmetics,"" said her mother, Susan McArthur. In an interview with CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, bioethicist, Art Caplan of University of Pennsylvania said using feeding tubes for weight loss was ""stupid"" and ""outrageous."" This is not a customary use and has not even been tested for safety. Related: Feeding tube diet raises eyebrows . Like-minded patients and advocates who are familiar with life on a feeding tube started several Change.org petitions that read: ""Many people in this world are tube fed in order to survive and gain weight."" One decries the use of feeding tubes for weight loss and another protests the way the story was presented on NBC's ""Today"" by hosts Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford. In the segment, the hostesses giggled over the story. ""You're carrying around a bag all the time,"" Kotb said. ""If it gets knocked out, what if you fall down?"" Gifford asked: ""What if you have a nightmare and it just flops out of your nose?"" Ellyn Kodroff, president of the Cured Foundation, an organization that promotes research on eosinophilic diseases, found little humor. ""To think that is something so easy to pick up, the whole portrayal of why people would need a feeding tube, it's a joking matter. It's making fun of people who are on feeding tubes,"" she said. For Samantha, the feeding tube has nothing to do with vanity. It's her own way of survival. Like many kids, it is what helps her grow, gain weight, get her nutrients and energy. Allergic to eggs, wheat, soy, milk, seafood and nuts, Samantha can only tolerate small bits of white potato and turkey. Eating other foods will cause Samantha to have nausea, vomiting, throat constriction, stomachaches, lethargy and bowel upsets. ""It could last for an hour,"" said the high school freshman. ""I've had it last up to a week until it gets out of my system."" Her mother sums it up as, ""She's allergic to the world."" ""It's an invisible, silent disease,"" McArthur said. ""She looks great like she's thriving, but her insides are being destroyed by the very thing she needs to survive."" Samantha also has a nickel allergy. Her jewelry choices are limited. When the snap button on her jeans touches her abdomen, it makes her skin red and inflamed, so she has a piece of cloth sewn over it to protect her. She also has environmental allergies to molds, dust mites, certain fall pollens and certain trees. Their home has been stripped of carpet. The rare disorder was discovered soon after Samantha's birth. She would often violently vomit, despite different formula changes. At preschool and school, she complained of stomach pains and health problems. ""I definitely remember when I was younger, I was vomiting 24-7,"" Samantha said. ""It set in at fourth grade. I realized I'm definitely different because my other friends feel fine and can just eat school lunch."" In January last year, Samantha gave up all foods and became dependent on the feeding tube. ""There are things I miss,"" she said. ""I miss Italian food. I miss normal things like mac and cheese, salad and my mom's chicken soup."" A morsel of food can trigger illness and symptoms. During a typical day, she goes to school for the first period -- usually a culinary class or a computer course. She returns home and takes online computer courses everyday and sees a tutor, who helps her with math. When Samantha leaves home, she carries a feeding bag -- even during short trips to the mall, the movies or a friend's house. The feeding bag is ""a pain in the butt to load up and have it at all times. When I get hungry, I get extremely sick,"" Samantha said. It's with her at all times. When she falls asleep, the feeding tube is connected to her stomach, slowly dripping Neocate, a hypoallergenic formula, into her system. A feeding tube is ""not an easy fix,"" she said. ""This is a long process."" She finds her comfort in food, though. She watches Food Network, especially Rachel Ray and Giada de Laurenta, as well as Cake Boss' Buddy Valastro. She often cooks for her family, including Sicilian dishes like braciole as well as Chinese stir fry. She bakes frosted sugar cookies and chocolate cupcakes for her mom. Samantha has a different perspective than dieters. ""I'd give anything to be an obese person who can eat anything,"" she said. Her medical team and her family are trying to give her little bits of food to see if she can tolerate them. She has had bad medical reactions to about 20 other foods, including beef, chicken, eggs, peas, white rice, broccoli, carrots and fruits. ""We don't know how long this is going to be for,"" Samantha said about her feeding tube. ""We haven't made any progress. I'll have it in my 20s.""","Feeding tubes are designed to nourish patients, instead of depriving them for weight loss .

"Editor's note: Joseph E. Stiglitz, professor at Columbia University, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001 for his work on the economics of information and was on the climate change panel that shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2008. Stiglitz, a supporter of Barack Obama, was a member and later chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Clinton administration before joining the World Bank as chief economist and senior vice president. He is the co-author with Linda Bilmes of the ""Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Costs of the Iraq Conflict."" Economist Joseph Stiglitz says federal regulators and executives helped create the Wall Street crisis. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Many seem taken aback by the depth and severity of the current financial turmoil. I was among several economists who saw it coming and warned about the risks. There is ample blame to be shared; but the purpose of parsing out blame is to figure out how to make a recurrence less likely. President Bush famously said, a little while ago, that the problem is simple: Too many houses were built. Yes, but the answer is too simplistic: Why did that happen? One can say the Fed failed twice, both as a regulator and in the conduct of monetary policy. Its flood of liquidity (money made available to borrow at low interest rates) and lax regulations led to a housing bubble. When the bubble broke, the excessively leveraged loans made on the basis of overvalued assets went sour. For all the new-fangled financial instruments, this was just another one of those financial crises based on excess leverage, or borrowing, and a pyramid scheme. The new ""innovations"" simply hid the extent of systemic leverage and made the risks less transparent; it is these innovations that have made this collapse so much more dramatic than earlier financial crises. But one needs to push further: Why did the Fed fail? First, key regulators like Alan Greenspan didn't really believe in regulation; when the excesses of the financial system were noted, they called for self-regulation -- an oxymoron. Second, the macro-economy was in bad shape with the collapse of the tech bubble. The tax cut of 2001 was not designed to stimulate the economy but to give a largesse to the wealthy -- the group that had been doing so well over the last quarter-century. The coup d'grace was the Iraq War, which contributed to soaring oil prices. Money that used to be spent on American goods now got diverted abroad. The Fed took seriously its responsibility to keep the economy going. It did this by replacing the tech bubble with a new bubble, a housing bubble. Household savings plummeted to zero, to the lowest level since the Great Depression. It managed to sustain the economy, but the way it did it was shortsighted: America was living on borrowed money and borrowed time. Finally, at the center of blame must be the financial institutions themselves. They -- and even more their executives -- had incentives that were not well aligned with the needs of our economy and our society. They were amply rewarded, presumably for managing risk and allocating capital, which was supposed to improve the efficiency of the economy so much that it justified their generous compensation. But they misallocated capital; they mismanaged risk -- they created risk. They did what their incentive structures were designed to do: focusing on short-term profits and encouraging excessive risk-taking. This is not the first crisis in our financial system, not the first time that those who believe in free and unregulated markets have come running to the government for bail-outs. There is a pattern here, one that suggests deep systemic problems -- and a variety of solutions: . 1. We need first to correct incentives for executives, reducing the scope for conflicts of interest and improving shareholder information about dilution in share value as a result of stock options. We should mitigate the incentives for excessive risk-taking and the short-term focus that has so long prevailed, for instance, by requiring bonuses to be paid on the basis of, say, five-year returns, rather than annual returns. 2. Secondly, we need to create a financial product safety commission, to make sure that products bought and sold by banks, pension funds, etc. are safe for ""human consumption."" Consenting adults should be given great freedom to do whatever they want, but that does not mean they should gamble with other people's money. Some may worry that this may stifle innovation. But that may be a good thing considering the kind of innovation we had -- attempting to subvert accounting and regulations. What we need is more innovation addressing the needs of ordinary Americans, so they can stay in their homes when economic conditions change. 3. We need to create a financial systems stability commission to take an overview of the entire financial system, recognizing the interrelations among the various parts, and to prevent the excessive systemic leveraging that we have just experienced. 4. We need to impose other regulations to improve the safety and soundness of our financial system, such as ""speed bumps"" to limit borrowing. Historically, rapid expansion of lending has been responsible for a large fraction of crises and this crisis is no exception. 5. We need better consumer protection laws, including laws that prevent predatory lending. 6. We need better competition laws. The financial institutions have been able to prey on consumers through credit cards partly because of the absence of competition. But even more importantly, we should not be in situations where a firm is ""too big to fail."" If it is that big, it should be broken up. These reforms will not guarantee that we will not have another crisis. The ingenuity of those in the financial markets is impressive. Eventually, they will figure out how to circumvent whatever regulations are imposed. But these reforms will make another crisis of this kind less likely, and, should it occur, make it less severe than it otherwise would be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Joseph Stiglitz: Fed pumped too much money, aiding housing bubble .

"(CNN) -- A convicted murderer was on the loose Friday morning after he was mistakenly released from custody in Chicago.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new generation of deep-sea submarines light enough to launch from a yacht could open up the ocean's depths to amateur explorers. The planned ""Deep Flight II"" -- shown here in an artist's impression -- should be able to dive to 37,000 ft. The ""Deep Flight"" winged submersibles are experimental prototypes designed to dive to depths of up to 37,000 ft -- almost four times as deep as a giant squid dives -- descending at 400 ft/minute. They are the brainchild of submarine designer Graham Hawkes who is in the process of building commercial models that can reach those depths. Hawkes has been designing submarines since the 1960s, working initially with the British Special Forces and then for the oil industry. He now sells his designs to wealthy sailboat owners as the ultimate yacht accessory. ""If you have the money for a mega-yacht and you're just limited to the surface, then what a waste. That's my perspective,"" Hawkes told CNN in a telephone interview. The late billionaire balloonist and adventurer, Steve Fossett, commissioned one of Hawkes' experimental prototypes, ""Deep Flight Challenger,"" which can dive to 37,000 ft. The craft was four weeks away from delivery when he died. Venture capitalist Tom Perkins has ordered one of Hawkes' first commercially-available models, ""Deep Flight Superfalcon"" for his yacht ""Maltese Falcon."" The $1.5 million sub is capable of diving to 1,000 ft and comes complete with air conditioning. While price means these craft are out of reach for most leisure users, Hawkes denies they are simply rich men's toys. ""The thing is a space ship, I don't like the term toy,"" said Hawkes of the subs which his company is also positioning as a cheaper alternative to research craft for science, industry and exploration. ""'Superfalcon' has a capability greater than the U.S. Navy. ""I personally very much like the idea of empowering individuals to explore."" Unlike conventional subs which get heavy and sink, Hawkes' designs are positively buoyant and have to power down into the depths: ""It's like an airplane in reverse."" They have life support good for 24 hours in the depths and a range of 10-20 miles. They are also quick and highly maneuverable. Hawkes, who describes himself as claustrophobic, says diving deep in one of his subs is an ""awe inspiring experience."" ""We just finished flight testing 'Superfalcon. It goes down vertical and you pull one gee when you make a turn,"" he said. Paul Willis contributed to this report.","Deep-sea sub that can dive to 37,000 ft is light enough to launch from a yacht .

"Libreville, Gabon (CNN) -- Deep and heavy beats vibrate large subwoofer speakers, hip hop artists grab the mic with one hand and gesture passionately with the other as thousands of fans rap along and dance in unison. You would be forgiven for thinking this was a typical urban concert in the U.S. -- but it's thousands of miles away in the tiny African nation of Gabon. I've journeyed to this equatorial country for ""Inside Africa"" to find out why the Gabonese are such faithful followers of the American hip hop scene and its culture, I also want to know what makes contemporary music here different from other African nations. My first stop is 104.5 Urban FM, one of the most popular radio stations in the country. Two outspoken women, Jna (pronounced Gina) O'djino and Ingrid Wani are local hip hop critics appearing as special guests on a daily program hosted by station manager Didier DeFreshman. As they list popular rappers I realize Gabonese stage names mimic U.S. stars; Amenem is an up and coming rapper channeling the street credibility of Grammy-winning artist Eminem; Tina is a fierce female rapper comparable to Trina in the U.S.. Meanwhile, muted music videos play on the walls showing off exotic cars and scantily clad women gyrating suggestively. Turn up the volume and lyrics in French and Fang (Gabon's indigenous language) prove this is a local interpretation or better yet, an African remix of American hip hop. Read also: Meeting Senegal's octogenarian star . Between moments of playful banter, the radio team discuss the days most requested artist; Ba'Ponga. He personifies a major difference between U.S. and Gabonese music - no royalties! This lack of additional income from selling music means most artists need a day job. So even though Ba'Ponga has been performing since the 1990's and is well known here, he still has to work weekdays in an office. We go there to meet him. Ba'Ponga is an intimidating figure, six-feet tall or more with a large full frame but dressed casually. Working at Gabon's Ministry of Culture he certainly stands out among men and women in suits. He's helping the government in its effort to reach out to Gabonese youth and convince them that the future of the nation is directly tied to their actions. In fact, that inspirational message is the cornerstone of Ba'Ponga's music. He tells me he's simply emulating what U.S. rappers do; talk about humble beginnings, challenges, downfalls and motivate anyone in a similar situation to rise above it. For its part , the Gabonese government is becoming more sophisticated in how it uses music to communicate that message, partly because its President isn't shy when it comes to singing and rapping. Back in 1977 current President Ali Bongo Ondimba released a soulful and funky album titled ""A brand new man'""under the name ""Alain Bongo."" On the LP he sounds like James Brown, which is understandable considering the Godfather of Soul's former manager helped him record it. Read also: Discovering the real Zambia . In 2009, while Ali was running to replace his late father Omar Bongo Ondimba (Africa's longest serving leader) he updated his musical repertoire. Videos on YouTube reveal a rapping Ali Bongo bouncing on stage with Gabon's hip-hop community. During this campaign, Ali portrayed himself as ""Le candidat des jeunes,'"" the youthful candidate. It worked - he won. On the day of my hip hop tour of Gabon, the government sponsored a free streetside concert with Amenem, Tina and Ba'Ponga warming up the stage for Senegalese-born U.S hip-hop star Akon. This wasn't just for young people, parents brought their toddlers, kids were arm-in-arm and absent was the macho bumping of shoulders and territorial stares common at other hip-hop events. I realise that for Gabon, hip hop music is not only about hope but unity as well. A small nation of only 1.5 million people means relationships are incredibly important, community invaluable. Artists have to work harder and be more creative since there is a smaller market in which to thrive. This is what makes urban Gabonese music unique, responsive and a genuine beat of Africa's true heart.","CNN's Errol Barnett takes a hip hop cultural tour in Gabon.

"Washington (CNN) -- Due to security concerns in Jordan, which borders the Syrian civil war, a combat-equipped detachment of about 700 U.S. troops will remain in the country following training exercises that ended this week, President Barack Obama told Congress on Friday. In a letter to comply with the War Powers Act, Obama notified Congress that the detachment staying behind at the request of the Jordanian government included ""Patriot missile systems, fighter aircraft, and related support, command, control and communications personnel and systems."" ""The detachment will remain in Jordan, in full coordination with the government of Jordan, until the security situation becomes such that it is no longer needed,"" Obama's letter said. A flood of refugees from the Syrian conflict is considered potentially destabilizing for Jordan, a key U.S. ally in the region. In addition, the possibility of cross-border missile fire or other attack raises concerns of an unwanted escalation in the volatile Middle East. ""The deployment of this detachment has been directed in furtherance of U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, including the important national interests in supporting the security of Jordan and promoting regional stability, pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations,"" Obama's letter said. CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr previously reported that U.S. troops would remain in Jordan beyond the training exercises that concluded Thursday. Obama's letter Friday put the figure at around 700. The Patriot missiles would be used to defend Jordan against any missiles launched from Syria, according to Starr's report. A senior U.S. military official told Starr that F-16 fighter jets ""send a message"" to Syria that the United States will defend Jordan if necessary. In addition, another 200 or so troops specializing in military planning from the 1st Armored Division's headquarters were scheduled to arrive later this summer in Jordan, Starr previously reported. The planning troops were to replace existing planners with a more focused ability to help Jordan's commanders prepare for any number of Syrian contingencies, including a chemical weapons crisis or a worsening refugee situation, according to Starr's report. At the same time, U.S. Marines were continuing a longstanding presence in Jordan of about 130 personnel to train Jordanian units slated to go to Afghanistan. Officials acknowledged to Starr that the counter-terrorism training could be used in any crisis. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy also was continuing its longstanding deployment of three anti-ballistic missile ships is the eastern Mediterranean. The ships, with a total crew of about 1,000, carry Tomahawk cruise missiles to defend Israel from any attack by Iran. Several Navy officials said the U.S. ships also could defend Jordan or Israel against any Scud missile launch from Syria. Last week, the Obama administration announced it was increasing aid to Syrian rebels, including military assistance, after determining government forces had used chemical weapons. The administration has yet to provide details of the military assistance it would provide, but sources indicated it would be light arms and ammunition, and perhaps anti-tank weapons. Senior U.S. officials have said there was continuing concern that eventually some type of military units will be needed to go into Syria to take control of chemical weapons stockpiles. For more than a year, the United States has quietly trained Jordanian forces for that mission, Starr previously reported. CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.","President Obama notifies Congress of the detachment of 700 troops .

"(Mental Floss ) -- Negative campaigning in America was sired by two lifelong friends, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Back in 1776, the dynamic duo combined powers to help claim America's independence, and they had nothing but love and respect for one another. But by 1800, party politics had so distanced the pair that, for the first and last time in U.S. history, a president found himself running against his vice president. Despite their bruising campaign, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams became friends again. Things got ugly fast. Jefferson's camp accused President Adams of having a ""hideous hermaphroditical character, which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman."" In return, Adams' men called Vice President Jefferson ""a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father."" As the slurs piled on, Adams was labeled a fool, a hypocrite, a criminal, and a tyrant, while Jefferson was branded a weakling, an atheist, a libertine, and a coward.  See 8 great campaign slogans » . Even Martha Washington succumbed to the propaganda, telling a clergyman that Jefferson was ""one of the most detestable of mankind."" Mental Floss: Jefferson: The sensitive writer type . Jefferson hires a hatchet man . Back then, presidential candidates didn't actively campaign. In fact, Adams and Jefferson spent much of the election season at their respective homes in Massachusetts and Virginia. But the key difference between the two politicians was that Jefferson hired a hatchet man named James Callendar to do his smearing for him. Adams, on the other hand, considered himself above such tactics. To Jefferson's credit, Callendar proved incredibly effective, convincing many Americans that Adams desperately wanted to attack France. Although the claim was completely untrue, voters bought it, and Jefferson stole the election. Jefferson paid a price for his dirty campaign tactics, though. Callendar served jail time for the slander he wrote about Adams, and when he emerged from prison in 1801, he felt Jefferson still owed him. After Jefferson did little to appease him, Callendar broke a story in 1802 that had only been a rumor until then -- that the President was having an affair with one of his slaves, Sally Hemings. In a series of articles, Callendar claimed that Jefferson had lived with Hemings in France and that she had given birth to five of his children. The story plagued Jefferson for the rest of his career. And although generations of historians shrugged off the story as part of Callendar's propaganda, DNA testing in 1998 showed a link between Hemings' descendents and the Jefferson family. Just as truth persists, however, so does friendship. Twelve years after the vicious election of 1800, Adams and Jefferson began writing letters to each other and became friends again. They remained pen pals for the rest of their lives and passed away on the same day, July 4, 1826. It was the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Mental Floss: The post-White House lives of presidents . John Quincy Adams gets slapped with elitism . John Adams lived long enough to see his son become president in 1825, but he died before John Quincy Adams lost the presidency to Andrew Jackson in 1828. Fortunately, that meant he didn't have to witness what many historians consider the nastiest contest in American history. The slurs flew back and forth, with John Quincy Adams being labeled a pimp, and Andrew Jackson's wife getting called a slut. As the election progressed, editorials in the American newspapers read more like bathroom graffiti than political commentary. One paper reported that ""General Jackson's mother was a common prostitute, brought to this country by the British soldiers! She afterward married a mulatto man, with whom she had several children, of which number General Jackson is one!"" What got Americans so fired up? For one thing, many voters felt John Quincy Adams should never have been president in the first place. During the election of 1824, Jackson had won the popular vote but not the electoral vote, so the election was decided by the House of Representatives. Henry Clay, one of the other candidates running for president, threw his support behind Adams. To return the favor, Adams promptly made him secretary of state. Jackson's supporters labeled it ""The Corrupt Bargain"" and spent the next four years calling Adams a usurper. Mental Floss: 5 secrets left off the White House tour . Beyond getting the short end of the electoral stick, Andrew Jackson managed to connect with voters via his background -- which couldn't have been more different than Adams'. By the time John Quincy was 15, he'd traveled extensively in Europe, mastered several languages, and worked as a translator in the court of Catherine the Great. Meanwhile, Andrew Jackson had none of those privileges. By 15, he'd been kidnapped and beaten by British soldiers, orphaned, and left to fend for himself on the streets of South Carolina. Adams was a Harvard-educated diplomat from a prominent New England family. Jackson was a humble war hero from the rural South who'd never learned to spell. He was the first presidential candidate in American history to really sell himself as a man of the people, and the people loved him for it. Having been denied their candidate in 1824, the masses were up in arms for Jackson four years later. And though his lack of education and political experience terrified many Adams supporters, that argument didn't hold water for the throngs who lined up to cast their votes for ""Old Hickory."" Ever since Jackson's decisive victory, no presidential candidate has dared take a step toward the White House without first holding hands with the common man. But losing the 1828 election may have been the best thing to happen to John Quincy Adams. After sulking home to Massachusetts, Adams pulled himself together and ran for Congress, launching an epic phase of his career. During his 17 years in the House of Representatives, Adams became an abolitionist hero, championing legislation to open the debate on slavery. And in 1841, he famously put his money where his mouth was, when he defended the 39 African captives aboard the slave ship Amistad before the U.S. Supreme Court. At a time when all but two of the justices were pro-slavery, Adams won his human rights plea. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A group of experts from around the world will hold a first of its kind conference Thursday on global catastrophic risks. Some experts say humans will merge with machines before the end of this century. They will discuss what should be done to prevent these risks from becoming realities that could lead to the end of human life on Earth as we know it. Speakers at the four-day event at Oxford University in Britain will talk about topics including nuclear terrorism and what to do if a large asteroid were to be on a collision course with our planet. On the final day of the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference, experts will focus on what could be the unintended consequences of new technologies, such as superintelligent machines that, if ill-conceived, might cause the demise of Homo sapiens. ""Any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful,"" said Dr. Nick Bostrom, director of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, host of the symposium. ""If we get something wrong, you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species."" Bostrom is a philosopher and a leading thinker of transhumanism, a movement that advocates not only the study of the potential threats and promises that future technologies could pose to human life but also the ways in which emergent technologies could be used to make the very act of living better. ""We want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that,"" Bostrom said. Transhumanists, according to Bostrom, anticipate an era in which biotechnology, molecular nanotechnologies, artificial intelligence and other new types of cognitive tools will be used to amplify our intellectual capacity, improve our physical capabilities and even enhance our emotional well-being. The end result would be a new form of ""posthuman"" life with beings that possess qualities and skills so exceedingly advanced they no longer can be classified simply as humans. ""We will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well,"" Bostrom said. ""The changes will be faster and more profound than the very, very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution."" Bostrom declined to predict an exact time frame when this revolutionary biotechnological metamorphosis might occur. ""Maybe it will take eight years or 200 years,"" he said. ""It is very hard to predict."" Other experts are already getting ready for what they say could be a radical transformation of the human race in as little as two decades. ""This will happen faster than people realize,"" said Dr. Ray Kurzweil, an inventor and futurist who calculates technology trends using what he calls the law of accelerating returns, a mathematical concept that measures the exponential growth of technological evolution. In the 1980s, Kurzweil predicted that a tiny handheld device would be invented early in the 21st century, allowing blind people to read documents from anywhere at anytime; this year, such a device was publicly unveiled. He also anticipated the explosive growth of the Internet in the 1990s. Now, Kurzweil is predicting the arrival of something called the Singularity, which he defines in his book on the subject as ""the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology, resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots."" ""There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality,"" he writes. Singularity will approach at an accelerating rate as human-created technologies become exponentially smaller and increasingly powerful and as fields such as biology and medicine are understood more and more in terms of information processes that can be simulated with computers. By the 2030s, Kurzweil said, humans will become more non-biological than biological, capable of uploading our minds onto the Internet, living in various virtual worlds and even avoiding aging and evading death. In the 2040s, Kurzweil predicts that non-biological intelligence will be billions of times better than the biological intelligence humans have today, possibly rendering our present brains obsolete. ""Our brains are a million times slower than electronics,"" Kurzweil said. ""We will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades."" This movement towards the merger of man and machine, according to Kurzweil, is already starting to happen and is most visible in the field of biotechnology. As scientists gain deeper insights into the genetic processes that underlie life, they are able to effectively reprogram human biology through the development of new forms of gene therapies and medications capable of turning on or off enzymes and RNA interference, or gene silencing. ""Biology and health and medicine used to be hit or miss,"" Kurzweil sad. ""It wasn't based on any coherent theory about how it works."" The emerging biotechnology revolution will lead to at least a thousand new drugs that could do anything from slow down the process of aging to reverse the onset of diseases, like heart disease and cancer, Kurzweil said. By 2020, Kurzweil predicts a second revolution in the area of nanotechnology. According to his calculations, it is already showing signs of exponential growth as scientists begin to test first generation nanobots that can cure Type 1 diabetes in rats or heal spinal cord injuries in mice. One scientist is developing something called a respirocyte, a robotic red blood cell that, if injected into the bloodstream, would allow humans to do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath or sit at the bottom of a swimming pool for hours at a time. Other researchers are developing nanoparticles that can locate tumors and one day even eradicate them. And some Parkinson's patients now have pea-sized computers implanted in their brains that replace neurons destroyed by the disease; new software can be downloaded to the mini computers from outside the human body. ""Nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non-biological systems,"" Kurzweil said. ""If we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology, we can go beyond its limits."" The final revolution leading to the advent of Singularity will be the creation of artificial intelligence, or superintelligence, which, according to Kurzweil, could be capable of solving many of our biggest threats, like environmental destruction, poverty and disease. ""A more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is less intelligent, making intelligence the most powerful force in the universe,"" Kurzweil writes. Yet the invention of so many high-powered technologies and the possibility of merging these new technologies with humans may pose both peril and promise for the future of mankind. ""I think there are grave dangers,"" Kurzweil said. ""Technology has always been a double-edged sword."" ....................................................................................

"(CNN) -- Redemption is within grasp -- and for Bayern Munich the opportunity to exorcise the demons of yesteryear is in sight. Tuesday's crushing victory over a Barcelona side which has dominated Europe's top competition for much of the past few years was yet another sign of the growing power of this Bavarian giant. Last year's defeat by Chelsea at its home stadium still hurts, as does the memory of losing out to Inter Milan two years ago, but that pain and anguish has driven Bayern to the brink of history. Not since 2001 has Bayern won Europe's elite competition, but surely this is the greatest chance they will ever have to end that drought after brushing aside a Barcelona team which has won this competition three times in the past seven years. The German league title has already been wrapped up, while the domestic cup looks set to follow given the team's astonishing run of form. That form was underlined with a display full of pace, power and vigor which blew Barcelona away with ease. On the day it announced the signing of Borussia Dortmund's star playmaker Mario Goetze in a deal worth an estimated $48 million, Bayern showed they have quality in abundance. Thomas Muller scored twice and further strikes from Mario Gomez and the outstanding Arjen Robben dismantled a Barcelona side currently 13 points clear at the top of La Liga. ""Of course, we're all very happy about the win, especially the size of the margin,"" Bayern manager Jupp Heynckes told reporters. ""We were first class,"" he said. ""But we know we still have 90 minutes ahead of us in Spain. ""We want to enjoy tonight, but nothing more."" Heynckes had bristled at suggestions he should seek advice from his successor in waiting, Pep Guardiola, for ideas of how to defeat the Catalan giant. Guardiola, who will replace Heynckes at the end of the season, enjoyed huge success at Camp Nou, winning two Champions League titles and three league crowns before he departed in April 2012. But it is Guardiola who may be asking for advice after watching Bayern ruthlessly destroy the team which he had built with such love and devotion. Bayern, fresh from hammering Hanover 6-1 in the Bundesliga at the weekend, made a rapid start and should have forged ahead within the first three minutes. Robben exchanged passes with Spain midfielder Javi Martinez before stealing in behind the Barcelona defense, but he could only fire his effort straight at Victor Valdes. The Catalan side, playing in its sixth successive semifinal, appeared rattled by Bayern's approach and was fortunate not concede a penalty when Gerard Pique clearly handled Philipp Lahm's strike inside the penalty area. But any sense of injustice soon disappeared as Bayern took a deserved lead with 25 minutes on the clock. Robben was the architect, picking out Dante at the far post with looping cross to head the ball towards goal and allow Muller to nod the ball home. Not since October 2008 had Barcelona won a Champions League match away from home when trailing at halftime and they never liked look repeating the feat here. Barcelona's talisman Leo Messi, clearly struggling with injury, rarely looked like troubling the Bayern defenders, while Barcelona struggled to deal with the German side's superior ability at set pieces. And it was no surprise that within four minutes of the restart Bayern had extended its lead to assume complete control of the tie. Once again it was the home side's aerial prowess which caused Barcelona problems as Muller headed the ball across goal for Gomez to volley home. Replays showed Gomez to have been in an offside position and while the visiting side may have had every right to feel aggrieved, it was nothing to what was to transpire with 17 minutes remaining. Robben, a constant menace all night, was the man at the heart of the action, racing towards goal as Barcelona began to back off. The Dutch winger looked to have beaten Alba, but his case was quite clearly helped by Muller bundling the defender to the ground. While the visiting team stopped in anticipation of the referee's whistle, Robben continued his run and lashed the ball into the far corner before turning away to celebrate. Quite how the foul was missed by the referee and the extra officials behind the goal is extraordinary, but that scarcely mattered to a rampant Bayern. Muller almost added a fourth when he raced clear only to be denied by a fine block by Valdes as Barcelona began to crumble. Bayern's surpremacy was emphasized further two minutes later when David Alaba rampaged down the left and picked out Muller to flick the ball home. ""I think we knew we were able to give them good competition,"" Robben told ITV following his side's impressive showing. ""I think everybody said before it was a 50-50 game. ""We can be very proud, this team (Barcelona) has dominated Europe over the last five years and if you beat them like this in such terrific way I think you can be proud. ""But on the other hand, let's be quiet, enjoy this evening but not anymore, because there's still the second game to play and we have to be ready."" Barcelona now faces an ""almost impossible"" task to make the final and defender Pique admits his team was completely outplayed. He told television channel TV3: ""There's not much you can say, they've been faster, stronger and played the better football. ""We mustn't talk about the referee; I don't think he had any influence. ""It's almost impossible for us. They've been better than us, we need to congratulate them and show our best in the return leg, while thinking about finishing the league as soon as possible. ""We are Barca. We must go out at the Nou Camp to win the game for our fans.""","Bayern Munich crushed Barcelona 4-0 in the first leg of its Champions League semifinal .

"(CNN) -- On the day Alisher Usmanov was named as Britain's wealthiest man, his soccer club Arsenal overtook that of one of his ""rich list"" rivals in the race for a European Champions League place next season. Usmanov, the English team's joint-biggest shareholder along with American Stan Kroenke, is worth £13.3 billion ($20.2 billion) according to the annual Sunday Times table -- a rise of almost £1 billion ($1.5 billion) since last year. Arsenal moved up into third place in the Premier League with Saturday's 1-0 win at Fulham, putting Arsene Wenger's side two points above Chelsea -- owned by Usmanov's fellow Russian Roman Abramovich. Abramovich is fifth on the Sunday Times list with an estimated wealth of £9.3 billion (£14.16 billion) -- a drop of two places. His team's fortunes have also been sliding since last year's Champions League success, but the Blues can regain third with victory in Sunday's trip to Liverpool. Defeat, however, could allow fifth-placed Tottenham to join Chelsea on 61 points if the London side beat second-placed Manchester City earlier in the day. Despite moving five points clear of Spurs, Arsenal's top-four hopes remain in the balance, having played two more matches than both London rivals. The Gunners next face runaway leaders Manchester United, but the final three games are against teams near the bottom of the table. ""We are on a strong run and we just go into the next game and focus on winning that,"" Wenger told Arsenal's website. ""The next game will be Man United so it's a good challenge for us."" Defender Per Mertesacker scored the only goal against Fulham just before halftime, as the home team had former Arsenal midfielder Steven Sidwell sent off for a rash lunge on Mikel Arteta early on -- his second red card in as many matches. Arsenal also ended the game with 10 men after France striker Olivier Giroud was sent off. ""He said to me that he slipped at the moment he went for the ball, and it's confirmed by the television,"" Wenger said. ""I haven't seen it but he's not a tackler. ""He went over the ball and, knowing that Sidwell had been sent off before, I had no illusion of the color of the card."" Another club with connections to a man on the rich list took another step towards relegation on Saturday as Queens Park Rangers lost 2-0 at home to Stoke. Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal retained a one-third stake in QPR after Malaysian businessman Tony Fernandes became principal shareholder in 2011, but the club's fortunes have mirrored his own. Mittal had been Britain's wealthiest man eight years in a row, but has dropped to fourth on £10 billion ($15 billion) -- with £2.7 billion ($4.1 billion) wiped off his value. His shares in QPR may also be worth considerably less if the club returns to the second division after just two seasons in the EPL, despite having spent large sums on players under Fernandes -- that will happen on Monday if Aston Villa manage an unlikely victory against Manchester United. Saturday's defeat left the London club level on points with bottom side Reading, who lost 2-1 at Norwich, while Stoke climbed six points clear of the relegation zone after ending a run of six defeats and a draw. It put Stoke on 37 points along with Newcastle -- who held eighth-placed West Brom 1-1 -- and Sunderland, whose 1-0 win over Everton was the second successive victory for new manager Paolo Di Canio. Sunderland's victory -- the club's second since January 23 -- dented sixth-placed Everton's hopes of European qualification, leaving David Moyes' team two points behind Tottenham having played two more matches. Wigan stayed in the third and final relegation place after a 2-0 defeat at Wigan, while ninth-placed Swansea drew 0-0 with Southampton, who stayed 12th.","Derby victory gives Arsenal the edge in race for Champions League place .

"(CNN) -- At a time when most birdwatchers are counting the bird species on the way to extinction, to find a new species previously unknown to science might be cause to pop the champagne corks. But to find one in plain view on a construction site in urban Phnom Penh in Cambodia is nothing short of a sensation in ornithological circles. The Cambodian Tailorbird (Orthotomus chaktomuk) is one of only two bird species found exclusively in Cambodia (the other is the Cambodian Laughingthrush) and its discovery has the world's ""twitchers"" -- as birdwatchers are known -- twitching with excitement. ""The modern discovery of an undescribed bird species within the limits of a large populous city -- not to mention 30 minutes from my home -- is extraordinary,"" said Simon Mahood of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), who was part of the team that investigated the new species. ""The discovery indicates that new species of birds may still be found in familiar and unexpected locations,"" he said in a statement. Described by the WCS as a ""wren-sized small gray bird with rufous cap and black throat,"" birdwatchers have since found it in abundant numbers in floodplain scrub on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. While scientists say the birds can still be found in numbers, they say its habitat is declining and have recommended that the species be classified as Near Threatened under the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List. The remnant floodplain scrub that exists within the Cambodian city of 1.5 million people, however, may go some way to explaining how the bird went unnoticed in the city for so long. The bird was discovered by a member of the WCS who took photographs of what was first thought to be a similar, coastal species of Tailorbird at a construction site on the edge of Phnom Penh. The bird in the photographs defied identification and further investigation revealed that it was an entirely unknown species. ""Asia contains a spectacular concentration of bird life, but is also under sharply increasing threats ranging from large scale development projects to illegal hunting,"" Steve Zack, WCS Coordinator of Bird Conservation said in a press release. ""Further work is needed to better understand the distribution and ecology of this exciting newly described species to determine its conservation needs."" According to the Oriental Bird Club publication ""Forktail"", a half century of human conflict in Indochina -- which made the region off-limits to bird watchers -- has made Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam a fertile zone for twitchers, with the past two decades witnessing a flush of new bird discoveries. The publication said that while the modern discovery of an undescribed bird species close to sea-level within the limits of a large city in a populous country was extraordinary, it was not unprecedented, citing the discovery of new species of marsh bird close to Sao Paulo in Brazil in 2005. It said the sheer ordinariness of the Tailorbird's scrubby habitat may have kept it hidden until now. ""This habitat is of little interest to birdwatchers and ornithologists because the other species that it supports are some of the most widespread and abundant birds in tropical South-East Asia,"" the publication said. ""Even if its habitat were to attract more attention, the denseness of the habitat and the species' skulking habits would more often than not render it invisible to the casual would-be observer.""","Birdwatchers discover previously unknown species of bird in Cambodia .

"(CNN) -- Some had been in their homes for 50 years with never a lick of water damage. Now those homes are, essentially, gone. That's the case in parts of upstate New York, where powerful bursts of rain falling in already saturated areas swelled rivers, caused waters to cascade from hills and contributed to sudden floods that ""just destroyed and demolished (homes) in a matter of minutes, just out of the blue,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday. The good news, according to the governor? ""We think the worst is behind us -- for now."" The reasons are that, by Saturday evening, rivers around the area had already crested, meaning the flooding threat from them should not get any worse immediately. And the weather, thankfully, is cooperating for the time being. While showers and thunderstorms are possible Sunday in places like Schenectady, even that would be a far cry from what happened earlier this week. Still, the last few days are a not-so-subtle reminder that things can change quick: The National Weather Service forecasts a chance of heavy rain from Sunday night through Tuesday. One woman is unaccounted for in Fort Plain, a village along the Mohawk River and the New York State Thruway about 55 miles west of Albany, that village's police Chief Robert A. Thomas III told CNN. Officers, then trying to get everyone in the area to safety, saw Ethel Healey before her home was washed away by rapidly rising waters, Thomas said. Helicopters and K9 units were used to look for her through Friday night, after which authorities moved from search and recovery to a recovery mission, according to the police chief. States of emergency were in effect Saturday for 15 counties -- affecting cities from Binghamton near the Pennsylvania border north to Plattsburgh, which is close to Canada. Several hundred people had been evacuated in Herkimer, Mohawk, Ilion and Little Falls, and 56 shelters were operational Saturday around the state. Authorities did not give estimates Saturday as to how many structures had been damaged, or how bad, in the flooding. Cuomo, who has toured some of the hard-hit areas, said that ""dealing with the damage"" will be a chief focus now. What is abundantly clear is that many people are hurting, the governor said before vowing, ""We are here, and we will do everything possible to help."" ""It's traumatic, to say the least, to see your whole life turned upside down literally in a matter of minutes,"" Cuomo said. CNN's John Branch contributed to this report.","States of emergency are in effect in 15 counties throughout New York .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Ahead of a landmark vote in Libya, an international monitor warned that Moammar Gadhafi's successors risk repeating the ousted dictator's mistakes unless electoral winners make rule of law a top priority. Many months after the February 17 uprising that rid Libya of Gadhafi and his autocratic rule, Libyans will choose a new government Saturday. Much is at stake in that vote, said Amnesty International, which issued a scathing report Thursday on widespread Libyan lawlessness, focusing on armed militias operating above the law. In Benghazi, Libyans vow that the vote will go on . The report documented arbitrary arrests, detention, torture and impunity for unlawful killings. It said Amnesty staffers visited Libya in May and June and found many militias refusing to disarm and that the government has only been able to dismantle a handful of the armed groups. ""It is deeply depressing that after so many months, the authorities have failed so comprehensively to break the stranglehold of the militias on Libyan security, with dramatic consequences for the people that bear the brunt of their actions,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. ""Calls for an end to repression and injustice were what led to the '17 February revolution' in the first place,"" she said. ""Without immediate action to stop abuses and lawlessness, there is a very real danger Libya could end up reproducing and entrenching the same patterns of violations we have seen over the past four decades"". Amnesty International said it spoke with two sisters -- 27 and 32 -- who were stopped by militiamen at a checkpoint in February and forced at gunpoint to a nearby farm. ""One was suspended from a door for hours, had boiling water poured over her head, and was beaten and stabbed while being accused of supporting the former government of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi,"" the report said. ""The other was also suspended and beaten. The husband of one of them, who was detained at the same time, has disappeared."" Amnesty International also found instances of revenge beatings and vigilante-style justice carried out against detainees held by people who suffered under Gadhafi. The report said that sometimes detainees were held in cities where Gadhafi's regime allegedly committed human rights violations. It gave the example of neurosurgeon Hisham Anour Ben Khayal. He was abducted in Tripoli in April by a militia from al-Zawiya that blamed him for the death of a relative due to alleged medical neglect. The doctor was beaten with sticks and whips. In court, Khayal testified that he wasn't the treating physician in the case and that other doctors had operated twice to save the man who died. Khayal was charged with murder and will stand trial in al-Zawiya, where there is strong sentiment against him, Amnesty said. Libyans from all walks of life took to the streets to stand up to injustice, Amnesty said, but now their leaders are undermining their aspirations. And public criticism of the revolutionary militias is uncommon after they were hailed as heroes who ousted Gadhafi. Critics of the militias, Amnesty said, are often labeled as Gadhafi loyalists. Amnesty International urged Libyan authorities to do more. CNN was not successful in obtaining immediate comment from Libyan government officials. It said Libya should build a judicial system that will ""hold perpetrators to account in trials that meet international standards and provide redress to the thousands of victims of human rights violations."" That position was supported by policymakers and Libya observers. Ian Martin, the top United Nations envoy in Libya, agreed that Libya's National Transitional Council has not done enough; he said his office has been pushing to accelerate the handover of detainees in custody of revolutionary brigades to proper state authorities. ""We have also repeatedly pressed the government to take responsibility for protecting the physical integrity of those in detention, even if they go on being held outside state authority for a limited period of time,"" Martin told CNN. Martin said the United Nations was trying to assist the Libyans in developing a strong judicial system. ""Certainly we are not satisfied with the rate of progress in that respect and very concerned by continuing torture and abuse of detainees in custody and continuing arrests outside legal process,"" Martin said. Amnesty said 4,000 detainees remain in centers outside government reach. Some have been detained for a year. Analyst Ranj Alaaldin said the interim government appears unable and unwilling to try to assert its control over a complicated network of armed militias. In a commentary for CNN.com, Alaaldin, a senior analyst at the Next Century Foundation, described chaos over the past week in the seizure of Tripoli's airport, attacks on a U.S. diplomatic office in Benghazi followed by one on a British convoy, and violent tribal clashes in the south. ""The current security environment, dominated by militias, does not constitute a proper security framework: It lacks coordination and creates gaps that allow for conflict between rival groups, as well as criminal activities like smuggling -- and terrorism, which appears to be a new factor in the east,"" Alaaldin wrote. Amnesty International said Libyans who emerge as the nation's new leadership after Saturday's election will face a tough task of piecing together a land damaged and divided by years of mistrust and repressive rule. Gadhafi, Amnesty said, cracked down on his opponents in protecting his 1969 revolution. Saturday's victors, the group said, must prevent a similar outcome.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqis headed to the polls Saturday to vote in provincial elections nationwide, the first poll in which the country's forces provided security without the assistance of U.S. troops. Elections were held in most of Iraq's 18 governorates to replace local councils elected in 2009. Some provinces -- such as Anbar, Kirkuk and Nineveh -- did not hold elections because of insecurity. Bombs were detonated in the days preceding and up to the election, sometimes killing and injuring candidates. On Saturday, six people were wounded at election centers, four from bombs in Latafiya south of Baghdad and two from mortars in Tikrit north of the capital. But no major violence occurred, and the United States praised the the exercise as a brave democratic process. Security was so tight in Baghdad that some people couldn't make it to the polls because of curfew. ""In the face of security threats, millions of Iraqi citizens exercised their democratic right to cast their ballots at polls in twelve provinces across the country to choose new provincial councils,"" the U.S. Embassy said. ""This is a clear step forward for Iraqi democracy and a strong rejection of the violent extremists who have sought to derail democratic progress and sow discord among Iraqis. "" Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative for Iraq, praised the ""peaceful conduct"" and commended election officials and security forces. ""Credible elections are critical to the country's stability,"" he said. The elections are the first Iraq has held since parliamentary elections in 2010. Prime Minister Nuri al Maliki was shown casting his ballot on state-run TV channel Iraqiya. He was among at least 15.5 million Iraqis were eligible to vote in Saturday's polls, the United Nations said, citing official estimates. Election officials estimated that around 50% percent of the voters turned out Saturday. More than 8,000 candidates were reportedly vying for 378 seats on provincial councils. CNN spoke to many people streaming to the polls. They said they wanted change, stability and improvement in basic services. People of all ages voted, but in Baghdad at least, there was a clearly strong turnout of the younger generation. ""Inshallah,"" God willing, people said, as they expressed their hope for a better future. Sectarianism a dark cloud over elections . The Sunni-Shiite sectarian strife in the region as well as Iraq was seen to be a major factor in the election and intimidation of voters. Ramzy Mardini, adjunct fellow at the Beirut-based Iraq Institute for Strategic Studies, noted the detrimental attacks in the run-up to the election and said the divide is ""widening, not closing."" ""Today, al-Qaeda in Iraq appears to seek to influence the vote, rather than preventing the electoral process from occurring. The attacks appear targeted to keep Shiites at home and instill fear in Sunnis who are backing candidates that are cooperating with Maliki,"" he said, citing the Sunni militant group. The rise of Sunni Islamists during the Arab Spring and the sectarian civil war in Syria represent ""strategic drivers of instability in Iraq leading to Shiite fear and Sunni hubris. That's a dangerous combination, and it will sectarianize those fault lines even further as Iraqis undergo their first election cycle since the departure of U.S. forces,"" Mardini said. As a result, there isn't ""much political space for Sunnis and Shiites to cooperate. Those that do are likely to get punished at the ballot box."" The elections are a run-up to next year's general elections, shaping how politicians think about ""political alignments going into next year's general election."" ""It's a practice run. Everybody's got several political cards in their hands; how they perform locally can influence which card they choose to play or not play on the national stage,"" Mardini said. But ""national reconciliation"" has been neglected. ""Iraqis will fall back on sectarian preferences when faced with fear and uncertainty, and there's plenty of fear and uncertainty for politicians to exploit to their sectarian advantage this election cycle,"" he said. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta.","NEW: Analyst: National unity taking a background to sectarianism .

"(CNN) -- Searchers have recovered the bodies of three people who were aboard a Yemenia Airways jet that crashed off the coast of Comoros in the Indian Ocean, a spokesman for Yemen's Civil Aviation department said Tuesday. A man hugs a relative of one of the victims at an airport in Marseille in southern France. Capt. Mohammed Abdel Rahman Abdel Qadir also told reporters that a child who was reported found alive was a 5-year-old boy. He did not give further details of the child's condition. ""The French said that (Wednesday) they will send more French units to the accident location in order to retrieve the bodies and possibly that they may be able to locate people who are still alive,"" he said. The Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. Qadir said the jet took off from Sanaa shortly before 10 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni. Searchers have not located the plane's data recorders, Qadir said, and investigators were not speculating on the cause of the crash. ""The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong, reaching 61 kilometers per hour (38 mph),"" he said. ""That's one thing. The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport."" But French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that several years ago France banned the plane, a A310-300, because of safety concerns. ""People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure,"" Bussereau said. ""It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful because none of this information is verified."" Qadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash. ""This plane is just like any other plane,"" he said. ""It can have a malfunction, but we don't know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash."" It was the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation.  Recent plane crashes » . Former pilot and aviation analyst John Cox said there were no similarities between the two incidents. ""These are two dramatically different airplanes flown by two different airlines,"" Cox told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The accidents happened at two different regimes of flight. And Airbus has hundreds of millions of hours flying safely. I don't believe that ... we can draw any conclusions because the manufacturer was the same in these two very different types of accidents."" At first, Comoros officials said there were no signs of survivors among the dead bodies floating in the choppy waters. But then rescuers found the child.  Watch as airline describes child's rescue » . Cox said it reminded him of the 1987 crash of Northwest Flight 255 in Detroit, Michigan, in which only a 4-year-old girl survived while 156 others died. ""This has come up before, and it's where the toddler was seated (during the impact) that allowed them to survive,"" he said. ""It's a miracle and I'm glad ... the toddler is safe. I'm just saddened for the loss of everybody else,"" he added. The Yemeni crash occurred as the plane approached the Hahaya airport in Moroni. The plane tried to land, then U-turned before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said. Officials did not know why the plane could not land, he said. Flight 626 was expected to be a four-and-a-half-hour flight. The airline has three regular flights a week to Moroni, off the east coast of Africa, about 2,900 km (1,800 miles) south of Yemen. The crash occurred about 1:30 a.m., Nadhoim said. There was no indication of foul play behind the crash, the official in Yemen said. Yemenia Air had used the jet since 1999 on about 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said. The company said it would assist in investigating the crash. ""The concerns and sympathy of the Airbus employees go to the families, friends and loved ones affected by the accident,"" the company said in a statement. In the wake of the Air France crash on June 1, United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s.   One flight was between the United States and Brazil in May, and the other between Hong Kong and Japan in June. The planes landed safely and there were no injuries or damage, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

"(CNN) -- Besides its tall skyscrapers, nothing screams ""New York City"" more than bright neon lights. While neon signs are not unique to New York, at one point they proliferated in tens of thousands of storefronts throughout the city. And just like Broadway, which they are often associated with, neon signs became an iconic part of the city's landscape by the middle of the twentieth century. But a changing landscape is unfolding and an increasing number of neon signs are disappearing. Six years ago, architectural conservator Thomas Rinaldi started documenting New York's historic neon signs. ""Old neon signs had caught my attention for many years, but around this time they began to disappear at such a rate that I felt a real sense of urgency to photograph them before they vanished forever,"" Rinaldi said. The result is the book ""New York Neon,"" a visual tour of the remaining exposed-tube neon signs in the five boroughs of New York City. Most of the 200 signs featured in the book are early- and mid-20th century examples, manufactured before 1970. CNN asked Rinaldi to tell us more about the project recently via e-mail. Following is an edited version of that interview: . What is it about the history or medium of neon lights in New York that intrigues you? It's many things. New York's old neon signs stand out for their design, their great midcentury letterforms, and their materials. But even more than this, the signs almost invariably mark the spots of great old businesses -- bars, restaurants, small stores -- that give New York's neighborhoods a ""sense of place"" -- a unique identity of their own. Is there a time that one could consider the height of neon signs in New York? How many neon signs were there? Many neon sign aficionados would tell you that New York's best neon signs went up in the 1930s, and I agree. Sign designers really created some beautiful and unique works in the years before World War II. After the War, storefront signs in New York tended to become less inventive, while signs for Route 66-type motels and drive-ins became more flamboyant. This happened partly because of rising labor costs in New York, and partly because of a general shift in emphasis from old urban centers to roadside and suburban development during this period. Why were neon signs so popular? One of the fascinating things about neon is how it has been popular -- and unpopular -- with different groups for different reasons through the years. From the 1920s through the '50s, neon was intensely popular with business owners for its ability to grab the attention of potential customers. While this is still true, many small business owners have opted for less expensive forms of outdoor advertising since the 1960s. Today, old neon signs are popular with many New Yorkers for their ability to evoke another era and most of all for their association with stalwart old independent neighborhood businesses. Why are they disappearing? Very sadly, old neon signs in New York are disappearing because many of the veteran businesses they advertise have had a hard time keeping up with the way the city has reinvented itself in the past 20 years. Old businesses can't last forever, some close up when their owners pass away or retire. But many cite skyrocketing rents and real estate values for having ushered the demise of old restaurants, bars, hardware stores and other businesses that had been neighborhood institutions for generations. Places like these give neighborhoods an identity and their disappearance has been the cause of much concern for many. When they go, they take their signs with them.","New book offers a visual tour of New York's historic neon signs .

"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Not content with revolutionizing smart phones, mobile apps now appear to be in the driving seat of the auto industry as manufacturers increasingly surrender control of their vehicles to technology. Signs of the increasing dominance of the app came on Monday with Ford's decision to launch its newest B-Max compact at Mobile World Congress -- a phone industry gathering in Barcelona -- rather than a motor show. Read more: Powerful camera phone unveiled . Bill Ford, the U.S. auto giant's executive chairman, told CNN his company chose the event to debut its tech-filled car as a statement of its intention to work with app developers in shaping the vehicles of the future. The B-Max is the first car in Europe to feature SYNC, a voice-recognition system developed by Ford and already available in some U.S. cars. The system links audio, phone and GPS systems and will also call emergency services in the event of a crash. The increasing dependence of vehicles on computers has raised concerns that manufacturers are trading technology for safety, exposing drivers to hazardous distractions and malicious hackers. But Ford, the great grandson of Henry Ford, insisted SYNC would ""allow drivers to keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the steering wheel,"" and said his company was working with app makers to further improve security. ""Today, often, drivers are looking down and we know that they're playing with their cell phone and texting and we want to stop all that,"" he told CNN. ""We want them to be looking at the road with their hands on the wheel, and our tech is allowing them to do that, knowing they also want to be connected."" Ford said his firm's current crop of hi-tech cars were capable of utilizing offboard ""cloud computing"" to expand their abilities, performing tasks like directing drivers to the nearest coffee shops, checking their health and keeping tabs on their daily diary. He acknowledged this raised the prospect of potential breaches that could put valuable personal data in the hands of criminals but said the technology was currently being rolled out on an ""opt-in, opt-out"" basis. The carmaker said the B-Max would eventually run its AppLink system, which will add control of smartphone apps to voice-operated commands. Among currently available apps are programs that read out Twitter updates and pick and choose radio stations. More functions will follow as it partners with app developers, the company said in a statement. ""Ford aims to deliver voice-control compatibility with apps for a wide range of services, and is now actively seeking to partner with app developers on future opportunities,"" it said in a statement. Ford hopes the B-Max, which goes on sale in Europe later this year, will help expand its current 4 million U.S. SYNC users to 13 million worldwide by 2015. It says the car should appeal to drivers previously priced out of the hi-tech market. ""The all-new B-MAX is going to be a game-changer in the European compact family vehicle segment. No other vehicle in its class offers such an attractive combination of style, versatility and technology,"" Ford Europe's chairman and CEO Stephen Odell said in a statement.

"Paris (CNN) -- The missile that brought down the plane carrying the president of Rwanda more than 17 years ago was fired from a camp controlled by his own ethnic group and not by Tutsi rebels, attorneys for the rebels said Wednesday. The April 1994 crash of the plane near the capital, Kigali, and the death of then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a member of the Hutu majority, was followed hours later by the start of mass killings. By the time they ended 100 days later, 800,000 people had died. Most of the dead were members of the country's Tutsi minority, who were killed by Hutus. The killing of Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu militants ended when the Rwandan Patriotic Front -- composed of Tutsis under the leadership of current President Paul Kagame -- halted the Hutu militants. Also on board the plane was then-Burundi President Cyprian Ntayamira. Ntayamira was also a Hutu. A report on the plane attack -- written as part of a French judicial investigation -- has not been released publicly. However, officials said experts appointed by French Judges Marc Trevidic and Nathalie Poux had identified Kanombe Military Barracks as the site from which the rocket was launched. The Kanombe camp at the time was controlled by ""Hutu extremists in the former Rwandan army and their European advisers,"" said Bernard Maignain and Leon-Lef Forster, attorneys for the Rwandan Patriotic Front, in a statement. ""The responsibility of the RPF in the attack is therefore dismissed."" The experts and judges traveled to Rwanda in September 2010 to view the scene of the attack, the attorneys said. Once there, they had the opportunity to conduct field surveys and simulations, and ""they could also hear eyewitnesses who saw or heard the firing of missiles. ""It is clear from their analysis that the probable location of firing was strictly inaccessible at the time to the men of the RPF,"" Maignain and Forster said. In 2006, French Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere, who was previously in charge of the investigation, requested arrest warrants against nine Rwandan nationals belonging to the RPF, according to Maignain and Forster. Seven people are still ""under investigation,"" they said, but they also accused the former judge of dismissing all evidence suggesting the RPF might not have been the perpetrators of the attack. The latest report, the attorneys noted, is a ""turning point."" The French Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the report, saying it was part of a judicial investigation started because the crew members of the downed plane were French. Asked about the Rwandan opposition's request for an international inquiry into the report, the ministry said France supports the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda as a means to shed light on the Rwandan killings. Rwanda's government welcomed the report. ""The crash served as an excuse for key perpetrators to execute a meticulously planned genocide against the Tutsi,"" the government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation said in a statement. The plane, which was struck as it prepared to land at Kigali International Airport, was bringing Habyarimana home from negotiations over the Arusha peace accords, which had created a power-sharing government between rebels and the Rwandan government. ""Today's findings constitute vindication for Rwanda's long-held position on the circumstances surrounding events of April 1994,"" said Louise Mushikiwabo, foreign minister and government spokeswoman, in the statement. ""With this scientific truth, Judges Trevidic and Poux have slammed shut the door on the 17-year campaign to deny the genocide or blame its victims. It is now clear to all that the downing of the plane was a coup d'etat carried out by extremist Hutu elements and their advisers who controlled Kanombe Barracks.""

"(CNN) -- A colleague of mine cringes every time he's introduced as a sports journalist. ""Please, just call me a journalist,"" he said the other day. ""I don't want anyone to think I'm a sloppy sports reporter. I check my facts."" You see, he wants no association with the fantastical Manti Te'o soap opera. And after working as a sports journalist myself for nearly 15 years, I feel his pain. It hasn't been the best year for sportswriters, who've been caught unaware and downright out-hustled on some of the biggest sports stories: The sex abuse case of former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky sat untouched for years by sportswriters until it was uncovered by a dogged, young crime reporter, Sara Ganim (who works for CNN now). Lance Armstrong, one of the biggest names in sports, was able to silence writers around him who whispered throughout his seven consecutive Tour de France wins that he was racing dirty. When he was finally caught by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after the evidence and witnesses grew too loud to deny, he gave his widely watched confession to Oprah Winfrey, who is not exactly a sports insider. And now, it's Katie Couric to the rescue, delivering the first on-camera interview with Te'o since his fake love story was exposed by the sports blog Deadspin. Maybe Couric can explain how media giants as savvy as Sports Illustrated and ESPN were conned about the Notre Dame star linebacker's tragic tale of a beautiful girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, who slipped into a coma after a terrible car crash and later died of leukemia on the eve of one of the biggest games of the season. Despite his grief, Te'o helped lead the Fighting Irish to a 20-3 victory over Michigan State. Sounds like a perfect script for a Hallmark movie, and just as make-believe. It was not true. The girl didn't exist. According to Te'o, he'd been catfished -- tricked by friends who played an online prank against him and made up the girl he met online and fell in love with, though they'd never met in person. Sports journalists failed here. Failed to do their job, which is not simply to entertain fans and promote the games we love, but to inform, illuminate and deliver factual information. Call me old-school, but I think journalists owe it to readers and viewers to make certain, to the best of our ability, that the news we deliver is accurate. Doesn't the public trust still matter, or, is our work just all for entertainment these days? ""We got, got,"" said Garry D. Howard, award-winning editor and chief of The Sporting News. ""This is a wake-up call for us to remember not to take shortcuts. We always have to ask tough questions and confirm all the facts ourselves, even if they've already been reported by other media."" Howard is no lightweight. He's mentored hundreds of sports journalists, some of the best in the business. When he was my editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, he was constantly on my case. ""Jones, get in here,"" he'd bark at me from his office door if he found even one comma out of place in a story I'd edited, or a fact that didn't quite add up. People lie to reporters all the time. We're a nosy bunch, often asking questions others think are none of our business. Sometimes the questions are personal, oftentimes they are painful. I'm sure it can get annoying. But our job is to probe. We know that politicians sometimes lie. Nice people lie. Criminals rarely admit they've done the crime. And, yes, even star athletes have been known to exaggerate the facts. So in these multitasking times that require reporters and editors to blog, tweet, write and rush to break stories on-air, it's also necessary to be a skeptic and remember the basics. Check everything. Working in sports is a dream job most days. We meet fascinating people, mingle with superstars, travel the world and go to games for free. And most of us actually like the people we write about, but there's a danger in getting so close to our sources that we shy away from pushing them on the facts for fear we'll lose a story. Asking a tough question or verifying the information through independent sources is not insulting, or insensitive, it's our job. Just a few simple questions in the Te'o story could have sniffed out the falsehoods. There was no obituary or death certificate for Lennay. No record of any car crash. No reporter had ever met her or spoken with anyone in her family. And Stanford University had no record of her ever attending school and playing on the volleyball team, as Te'o had told reporters. Following up on these alleged facts would not have been investigative journalism, just routine fact-checking on a story that seemed innocent on the surface. I just hope Couric can help to put an end to Te'o-gate for us all. It's time to move on to more important news. I've got Super Bowl picks to make: I'll take the Baltimore Ravens by 13. Forget the facts, who cares that San Francisco 49ers are favored by 3.5 points? That's my fantasy and I'm going with it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roxanne Jones.","Roxanne Jones: Sports reporters missed the big stories: Te'o, Sandusky, Armstrong .

"(CNN) -- Somalia has the world's highest mortality rate for children under age 5, according to data released by the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation. ""Somalia's child mortality rate in 2010 stood at 180 deaths per 1,000 live births, which now ranks worst in the world,"" the United Nations Children's Fund said in a media statement Friday. Somalia has been plagued by constant violent conflicts and has recently been hit by a devastating famine. The United Nations has declared famine in six areas of southern Somalia, including Mogadishu. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit. ""Even before this current crisis, one in six children was dying before their fifth birthday. Now we anticipate this number of deaths will be even greater,"" said Rozanne Chorlton, UNICEF representative in Somalia.

"(CNN) -- Coffee, juice or tea? Starting July 1 on Frontier Airlines, that drink will cost you $1.99 for certain fares, the company announced Wednesday. So will a can of soda. But at least you'll get the entire can. (Coffee drinkers will get free refills.) Certain members of the airline's frequent flier program will continue to receive beverages for free, as will customers who buy more expensive fares. The drink fee is part of the airline's move to become an ""ultra low cost carrier,"" according to a Frontier press release. The airline also will start charging many customers who book their tickets through third-party sites a $25 to $100 fee for carry-on bags, excluding certain members of its frequent flier program. Unprepared travelers hit with airline fees . The goal of the carry-on fee is to get more people to check their bags, said airline spokeswoman Kate O'Malley. The company will announce a start date for that fee sometime this spring, she said, and tickets purchased via third-party sites such as Travelocity or Orbitz before the start date will not be assessed the carry-on fee. ""I suspect we will see other airlines study this move and perhaps copy it in the future,"" Airfarewatchdog founder George Hobica said in a statement. ""Airlines hate paying booking fees to third-party sites such as Expedia and Orbitz, and this is an effective way to force consumers to book directly with the airline."" The $25 price will apply to customers who check into their flights at the airline website before departing for the airport and will increase if they check in at an airport kiosk, with an airline ticket agent or at the gate. Customers who book at the airline website will still qualify for free carry-on bags on all tickets. Checked bag fees will remain $20 for a first checked bag when purchased at online check-in for certain discount and third-party website fares. Staring June 1, those fees will increase to $25 for economy and third-party website tickets when purchased at airport check-in for travel on or after July 11.","Frontier is instituting new fees for beverages and carry-on luggage .

"(CNN) -- Willkommen. Bienvenue. Welcome. Set in the seedy underbelly of early 1930s Berlin, the movie ""Cabaret"" largely takes place in the fictional Kit Kat Klub, a gaudy, raunchy cabaret full of drunks, dancers, glitz and -- apparently -- odors. The film's director, Bob Fosse, preferred that his actors rehearse in costume, and while Liza Minnelli (as Sally Bowles) had been fitted for her dress, Joel Grey (as Master of Ceremonies) learned his tailcoat was not ready yet. So the costumer provided him with an old coat from backstage. ""I want to tell you about this coat,"" Grey told CNN before the January 31 screening of the film at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York. ""It was the coat of a thousand men. It had come from stock, and it had been worn by many, many actors for many, many years."" ""And never washed,"" Minnelli interjected. ""That was way before anybody knew anything about, ya know, keepin' it nice,"" Grey said. In other words, the coat was a relic from the pre-antiperspirant era, and when Grey ""got warm, all the lives of these other actors, dancers or whoever came back."" ""I kept looking at him and going, 'What? What?' "" Minnelli recalled. The screening was a homecoming of sorts for the cast, because the film made its world premiere at the same theater on February 13, 1972. Although billed as the ""40th anniversary,"" the festivities came just shy of the 41st anniversary because a vertical scratch ran along an entire reel of the film. Computer technology couldn't remedy it so more than 1 million frames were restored by hand. ""Cabaret"" made its Blu-ray debut last week. The film is only loosely based on the 1966 Broadway musical of the same name. The Broadway show was based on the 1951 nonmusical play ""I Am a Camera"" and Christopher Isherwood's 1945 book ""The Berlin Stories,"" which included his earlier 1939 short novel ""Goodbye to Berlin."" Many details -- including characters, story lines and songs -- were added, removed or interchanged for the film adaptation. For example, the Sally Bowles character was originally British, and Brian Roberts' name in ""I Am a Camera"" and the novels was Christopher Isherwood (the writer had used his own name as the fictional narrator). Also, there was no romance between Brian/Chris and Sally, and Brian was only bisexual in the movie. ""I was the first one hired,"" Minnelli said, ""and I remember one of the first things our producer said was, 'Tell me what you think of the story.' And I said 'Really?' And he said 'Yes.' And I said, 'I think that the man should be gay so that leaves that wonderful relationship and it just opens up all sorts of emotions that couldn't have been there in the play."" In ""Goodbye to Berlin,"" Sally was supposed to be untalented, so there was some criticism upon the film's release that Minnelli was too polished a dancer. In fact, director Fosse worked tirelessly to make the Kit Kat dancers look unpolished and unkempt. Louise Quick, who portrayed one of the dancers, said Fosse ""wanted it to seem more real, shaggy."" He asked the dancers to pluck their eyebrows and then draw them in, not shave their legs and put on weight. ""It was the first time in history that he allowed dancers to eat during rehearsal,"" she laughed. Grey added, ""When 'Cabaret' came out, it was so unlike the usual Hollywood musical."" Fosse was not a fan of people ""erupting into song,"" Grey said, explaining the director's realistic approach to movie musicals. ""Movie musicals were in ill-repute. They weren't doing well at the box office. As a matter of fact, Bob had had a big failure right before, (1969's 'Sweet Charity,' his screen debut) so he was intent on making it more adult -- more relevant."" Fosse's ""Cabaret"" was replete with political satire and heavy issues such as abortion, death, Nazis and the Holocaust. All the musical numbers in which characters sang to each other were cut for the movie. ""There was no change for me from stage to film,"" said Grey, who had originated the emcee role onstage and won the 1966 Tony Award for best featured actor in a musical. ""It was the same dark character, and I somehow felt empowered to make him even darker in the film. You couldn't miss his intention in a close-up. Whereas if you're sitting in a balcony watching it on the stage, you're saying, 'So, is this funny or not?' ""There was no denying or question of what the intention was of this movie,"" Grey said. ""There are so many people who have said over the years: 'Oh, 'Cabaret' is so much fun! Such a great movie! I had the best time!' And I think to myself: Did they get it?' "" The film's most controversial line was a lyric to the song ""If You Could See Her."" As Grey slow-danced with Quick dressed in a gorilla suit, the last line of the song went: ""If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn't look Jewish at all."" The lyric and gorilla costume were meant to show how anti-Semitism was beginning to run rampant in Berlin, but Grey said it caused problems in the New York stage production. ""There were a number of Jewish groups who missed the point of that song,"" he said. ""They just thought that we were saying Jews were ugly."" The line was replaced with ""She isn't a meeskite at all,"" but the response was tepid. (Meeskite was an old Yiddish term to describe an unattractive woman.) Grey, who is Jewish, said the lyrics didn't offend him and he was hesitant about changing them. ""I conveniently forgot about the change a few times,"" he said with a nod. Fosse passed away in 1987. Daughter Nicole Fosse told CNN that when the famed director and choreographer worked, he ""asked people to do something they had never done before."" Actress Marisa Berenson was still new to show business at the time she was cast as Natalia Landauer. ""Cabaret"" was her second film, and she remembered Fosse as a great director who brought out the best in her and found unique ways to challenge her. ""He played tricks on me and used to whisper erotic things in my ear before scenes so that I would kind of blush and feel strange,"" she said, ""which I did. And, you know, all that to get a good performance, and so I learned a lot and it was really wonderful."" As the song goes, ""Life is a cabaret, old chum,"" and that appears to have been the case for this cast as well. ""We were so close,"" Minnelli said. ""We were in a world of our own, and I think that shows."" The actress/singer called the filming ""one of the best beginning to end experiences I ever had. And every Friday night, (Fosse) gave a party on the set. In fact, there's a scene in the movie where you see somebody playing the saw. That was a stagehand who played the saw."" She added, ""Making the movie was so much fun, and so weird and bizarre and very sensual."" ""Cabaret"" won eight Academy Awards, including best director (Fosse), best actress (Minnelli) and best supporting actor (Grey). It lost the best picture Oscar to ""The Godfather."" ""They said my name and my father (director Vincente Minnelli) screamed so loudly,"" Minnelli said, ""screamed in my ear -- that I still have tinnitus. I do!""","The cast of the 1972 film ""Cabaret"" reunites for ""40th anniversary"" screening .

"(CNN) -- For the second time in five months, a U.S. soldier from a Washington military base is accused of committing atrocities against civilians in Afghanistan. The unidentified soldier, an Army staff sergeant, is accused of firing on civilians, killing 16, in a house-to-house shooting rampage in two villages on Sunday, according to officials from NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Shooting could affect U.S. military mission . He had been stationed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, a sprawling military installation between Tacoma and Olympia, Washington. A handful of soldiers from the base have been involved in violent incidents in the past few years, including four soldiers convicted of killing Afghan civilians in 2010 as part of a ""kill squad."" Also in 2010, three other soldiers ""suffered dangerous public mental breakdowns"" after returning from Afghanistan, with two of them shot to death by police, according to the Stars and Stripes military newspaper. This year, a former soldier from the base is believed to have shot a Washington park ranger to death on New Year's Day. Twelve soldiers on the base committed suicide in 2010, according to the base's Northwest Guardian newspaper. Last month, Army officials said the forensic psychiatric review process at the base's Madigan Army Medical Center was itself being reviewed. ""This was not just a rogue soldier,"" said Jorge Gonzalez, executive director of G.I. Voice, a veteran-run nonprofit organization that operates a soldiers' resource center near the base called Coffee Strong. The base is ""a rogue base, with a severe leadership problem,"" he said. ""If Fort Lewis was a college campus, it would have been closed down years ago,"" Gonzalez said. In the wake of Sunday's shootings, he called for a congressional investigation and hearings ""into the multiple crises"" at the base. Taliban vow revenge for shooting rampage . Others have expressed alarm as well. In December 2010, the Stars and Stripes military newspaper said the facility had gained a reputation as ""the most troubled base in the military."" It also reported that year that multiple investigations were under way into the conduct of troops at the base and the adequacy of the mental health and medical care soldiers were receiving upon their return home. Attempts to contact the base's public affairs office were not immediately successful Monday. In January, the body of Benjamin Colton Barnes, 24, was found face-down in a creek in Washington's Mount Rainier National Park after a manhunt. Barnes, who was assigned to Joint Base Lewis-McChord before his 2009 discharge, is believed to have fatally shot park ranger Margaret Anderson on New Year's Day. Police said Barnes was also wanted in connection with a shooting during a fight at a party in a Seattle suburb. That shooting took place before Anderson's death. While investigators said they had little insight into Barnes' mindset or motive, the woman with whom he was in a custody dispute said in court documents filed last year she was frightened to be in the same state with him. She wrote in other documents, reported by CNN affiliate KIRO, that Barnes might have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a deployment to Iraq. In November, Army Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs, also assigned to the base, was sentenced to life in military prison after a court-martial convicted him of murdering three Afghan civilians, cutting off pieces of their corpses to keep as ""souvenirs"" and planting weapons on the bodies to make the men appear to be Taliban fighters killed in battle. Gibbs, who will be eligible for parole in 10 years, was the highest-ranking of five soldiers charged with being part of a rogue ""kill squad"" targeting civilians in 2010. Another seven were charged with lesser crimes, including abusing drugs, keeping ""off the books"" weapons and intimidating a fellow soldier against speaking out against the killings. Murder and assault charges against one of those five soldiers were dropped last month, according to the Tacoma News-Tribune newspaper. Gibbs led the 3rd Platoon of the Army's 5th Stryker Brigade in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. The platoon was tasked with patrolling small villages in the area to build relationships with Afghans, who were wary of the U.S. presence in their country. Instead, prosecutors said, Gibbs and a small group of rogue soldiers plotted to murder civilians. ""The plan was to kill people,"" Army Spc. Jeremy Morlock, who was among those charged in the deaths, said in court in March 2011 after his guilty plea. ""There was a group of soldiers in the 5th Brigade numbering in the single digits who did not behave with honor,"" Col. Barry Huggins of the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, who supervised the courts-martial, said last month in his first public remarks about the case, according to the News-Tribune. ""Justice was served in a timely manner. We should not make the mistake of assuming those soldiers represent all soldiers."" The 5th Brigade has been renamed the 2nd Brigade, according to the News-Tribune. Last month, two doctors at Madigan Army Medical Center were removed from clinical duties and assigned to administrative work, the Seattle Times newspaper reported, citing Army Medical Command officials. U.S. Sen. Patty Murray told the Times that the two included Dr. William Keppler, a retired Army officer who leads a forensic psychiatric team responsible for assessing the post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses of soldiers under consideration for medical retirement. Army Medical Command told the Times it has ""initiated a top-to-bottom review of the process associated with the forensic psychiatric reviews conducted at Madigan Army Medical Center."" A diagnosis of PTSD qualifies a soldier for medical retirement and benefits. The investigation was triggered in part by concerns that Madigan doctors involved in the screening process were ""unduly influenced by worries about the escalating costs of paying benefits,"" the Seattle Times reported last week. Complaints from soldiers previously diagnosed with PTSD but later accused of exaggerating their symptoms also prompted the probe, according to the newspaper. Some 285 soldiers who were evaluated at Madigan since 2007 will be asked to undergo a second evaluation, Western Regional Medical Command, which oversees the medical center, said in a statement last week. Joint Base Lewis-McChord was formed in 2010 by the merger of Fort Lewis, an Army post, and McChord Air Force Base. At 415,000 acres, it is the largest on the U.S. West Coast, according to its website, with tens of thousands of military and civilian personnel and their families. The primary unit on Fort Lewis is the Army's I Corps, according to the website, and the primary unit on McChord Air Force Base is the U.S. Air Force's 62nd Airlift Wing. In addition, the joint base houses ""more than 30 different units from the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Reserve and National Guard and Department of Defense agencies,"" the site says. The suspect in Sunday's shootings acted alone and turned himself in after the incident, according to ISAF officials. A U.S. military official, who asked not to be named because of the pending investigation, said the suspect is in his mid-30s and has served several tours in Iraq, although this was his first deployment to Afghanistan. The incident shocked U.S. officials and prompted outrage in Afghanistan and has fueled fears of intensified anger against U.S. troops in Afghanistan that erupted in deadly riots last month over the inadvertent burning of Qurans by American troops. The soldier accused in Sunday's deaths remained in U.S. custody on Monday as investigators try to determine his motive, including examining his mental stability and medical history.","Joint Base Lewis-McChord soldiers have been involved in several violent incidents .

"(CNN) -- Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o said Wednesday he was the victim of a ""sick joke"" that had him and legions of fans believing in a ""girlfriend"" who may never have existed. Te'o was the subject of an inspirational story in which he overcame the deaths of his real-life grandmother and his girlfriend as his team marched toward the BCS National Championship Game. Te'o, the Heisman Trophy runner-up, released a statement and Notre Dame held a news conference Wednesday night after the sports website Deadspin published an article that called the girlfriend story a hoax. Last September and October, Te'o told interviewers the losses of the women, who reportedly died within hours of each other, inspired him to honor them with sterling play on the field. ""I miss 'em, but I know that I'll see them again one day,"" he told ESPN. That and other media reports led to a gripping human interest story of determination. The girlfriend was identified as Lennay Kekua, who had supposedly died of leukemia. Jack Swarbrick, director of athletics at Notre Dame, told reporters that Te'o was the victim of an elaborate hoax. ""And he will carry that with him for a while,"" Swarbrick said. Investigators don't know how many people may have participated in the hoax, he said. Notre Dame said the relationship between Te'o and the supposed girlfriend involved online and lengthy telephone communication. As part of the hoax, several meetings were set up, including in Hawaii, but Kekua never showed, Swarbrick said. The linebacker grew up in Hawaii. Te'o's father, Brian, told the South Bend (Indiana) Tribune last fall that his son did have the opportunity to meet Kekua. ""They started out as just friends,"" Brian Te'o said, according to the newspaper. ""Every once in a while, she would travel to Hawaii, and that happened to be the time Manti was home, so he would meet with her there. But within the last year, they became a couple."" Media reports indicate the parents never met Kekua. According to Swarbrick, Te'o in early December received a call from a woman claiming to be his girlfriend and telling him she was not dead. Those calls continued but Te'o did not answer, Swarbrick said. Te'o's grandmother did in fact die in September, according to Deadspin, but there is no Social Security Administration record of the death of the athlete's supposed girlfriend, described as a Stanford University student. Stanford University's registrar's office told CNN that it has never had a student registered by Kekua's name or an alternative spelling. ""Outside of a few Twitter and Instagram accounts, there's no online evidence that Lennay Kekua ever existed,"" Deadspin contends. ""There was no Lennay Kekua."" According to the website, Kekua, 22, had reportedly been in a serious auto accident in California and was later diagnosed with leukemia. Photographs showing a young woman identified as Kekua in online tributes and news reports actually are photos from social media accounts of a 22-year-old California woman who is not named Lennay Kekua and does not have leukemia, according to Deadspin. The woman never met Te'o, it said. Your opinion: What do you think? After Notre Dame upset No. 10 Michigan State on September 15, Te'o told ABC about his late grandmother and girlfriend. ""They were with me. I couldn't do it without them,"" Te'o said. ""I couldn't do it without the support of my family and my girlfriend's family."" ""I'm so happy that I had a chance to honor my grandma and my family and my girlfriend,"" Te'o said. ""That's what it's all about, family."" Timothy Burke, co-author of the Deadspin article, told Miami sports radio host Dan Le Batard, ""We got an e-mail last week saying something isn't right"" with the girlfriend story. Te'o said Wednesday he ""developed an emotional relationship with a woman I met online. We maintained what I thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone, and I grew to care deeply about her."" In his statement reported by ESPN, the star said, ""To realize that I was the victim of what was apparently someone's sick joke and constant lies was, and is, painful and humiliating. ""It further pains me that the grief I felt and the sympathies expressed to me at the time of my grandmother's death in September were in any way deepened by what I believed to be another significant loss in my life."" Manti Te'o previously told reporters he and his girlfriend would spend hours speaking on the phone. Notre Dame said it hired an independent investigative firm to look into the situation. Swarbrick said the independent investigation found that the perpetrators were involved in ""online chatter"" indicating that it was a hoax, and Te'o was a victim. ""I will refer you to the documentary 'Catfish,'"" the athletic director said. ""Catfish"" is no longer simply a river dweller, but rather a verb defined as ""to pretend to be someone you're not online by posting false information, such as someone else's pictures, on social media sites usually with the intention of getting someone to fall in love with you,"" according to an MTV show of the same name. Swarbrick said he met with Te'o's family two days before Notre Dame played in the January 7 championship game and lost to Alabama. The linebacker is expected to be a first-round pick in the NFL draft this spring. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","Te'o's father had said his son, girlfriend met in Hawaii .

"Boston (CNN) -- In the hours after two explosions ripped through Boylston Street just feet from the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon, people across the city rallied around each other, showing, as one runner said, ""the human spirit is still alive."" At a Starbucks across from the Westin Copley Place, a hotel filled with out-of-town marathoners, manager Sol Elta and his staff set up an impromptu feeding table offering free coffee and pastries to anyone walking by. The idea was sparked by a woman in Philadelphia who called the store and offered to donate $100 worth of coffee and pastries to people affected by the bombing. ""I was shocked,"" Elta said. ""I thought it was an organization. I thought it was Starbucks corporate. It turned out to be just some citizen who wanted to find somewhere close and be a helping hand."" 'Boston will overcome,' mayor vows . Technically, the store was closed. Train station closures made it difficult for staff to get to work and police barricades made it virtually impossible for customers to enter. But Elta and his management team opened the store on their own time to feed and caffeinate passersby. ""Instead of doing a little bit of what we had, we're doing everything that we had in the store based on what Starbucks wants to contribute and based on her contribution as well,"" Elta said. Those enjoying the shop's offerings included many of the thousands of runners who were stopped short of finishing the race. Wearing running gear or branded Boston Marathon jackets, many wandered up to police barricades where early in the day volunteers checked bib numbers and handed out finishing medals. Luis Cuan and Jaime Herrera flew from Guadalajara, Mexico, to run the marathon, but were stopped just short of the finish line when the bombs went off. When the police diverted the two men away from the buses that carried their personal belongings, they were wearing only running clothes. ""It was freezing,"" Cuan said. ""But many people came out of their houses, some of them were filming us, but many of them were offering water, many of them were offering jackets. We both had pants and a jacket that were given to us just 'cause those people felt that we were in the need of some support."" What we know about the bombings so far . After walking for hours they eventually made it back to their hotel, but they didn't receive their marathon medals. When the pair left their hotel on Tuesday to explore the city, they met a man who told them they could collect their medals at a police checkpoint on Clarendon Street. One of the women at the checkpoint hanging medals around runners' necks was volunteer Kathy LeClair from Chester, New Hampshire. LeClair hadn't planned on being a part of the marathon. An employee of TD Bank, LeClair had come to Boston on Monday afternoon to attend a corporate training class on Tuesday. ""My hotel room looked out over everything that happened,"" said LeClair, who was checking into her room just as the bombs exploded. ""I just couldn't go to class today. I just couldn't focus and so I decided to walk around until I found a place that needed a volunteer."" A police detective eventually directed LeClair to the offices of the Boston Athletic Association, where she was handed a marathon jacket and led to a police barricade. There, LeClair spent the morning greeting and hugging runners who had been affected by the bombing. ""I've seen every emotion,"" LeClair said. ""I've seen men cry. I saw a man who didn't want to take a medal because he didn't feel he deserved it."" One runner told LeClair he was a military veteran who had served time in Iraq as a medic. ""He didn't have his (bib) number because it was covered in blood and he threw it away,"" LeClair said. ""He went to help people and he was totally covered in blood,"" LeClair said, recounting his story. ""He had his bag but he didn't have a medal, and he didn't think he was going to get one and when I gave it to him he cried. That was so touching."" How you can help . By noon on Tuesday, the city's response efforts had become more organized, and the BAA began directing all runners in search of closure in the form of finishing medals to the Park Plaza Castle on Columbus Avenue. Hundreds of runners streamed in and out of the Castle, where the city had set up a makeshift resource center for those scattered by the blasts. Belinda Osborne wiped tears from her eyes as she emerged with a medal around her neck. ""I was crossing the finish line and about to receive my medal right when the bomb went off,"" said Osborne, who flew in from Salt Lake City to run her first Boston Marathon. ""I heard the explosion and right when the guy was about to hand me my medal he said, 'That's not supposed to happen.'"" She rushed away from the finish line with no cell phone and no money in search of the two friends she had coaxed into running alongside her. After a fall ended their race, Osborne's friends jumped ahead to cheer her on at a restaurant near the finish line. ""They were one table left of the blast. Where they were sitting, if I would've passed 10 seconds later, they would've been in the blast, because they got up to leave and the blast went off,"" Osborne said. ""And that's where ground zero was, and the dead bodies and the blood."" After waiting for more than an hour at the family waiting area, she made her way back to her room at the Copley Marriott just in time to grab her purse and cell phone before the building was evacuated. During the evacuation a man stranded outside his hotel with nothing came up to her to ask for help. Doctors remove ball bearings from victims . ""I gave him $20,"" Osborne said. ""He e-mailed me last night and he said, 'I'm going to repay you. Give me your address.' I said, don't even worry about it. It's just the human spirit. I know anybody would've done the same thing for me. I've never felt so helpless just not having any money, I don't even know the city. It's just amazing how everybody came together."" Until the finish, Osborne said the race was the best she marathon had ever run. ""I was coming through the finish line and hitting people's hands,"" Osborne said. ""I stopped and had a beer on mile 22. It was so great and so electric."" Despite being visibly shaken by her experience on Monday, she vowed she'll be back. ""I'm not going to let them scare me away,"" Osborne said. ""That's what they want. I'm going to come back."" We've been hit before on home soil . Boston heroes: Running to help .

"Kabul (CNN) -- When 18-year-old Mumtaz walks into a room, the first thing you notice about her is the patchwork of painful puffy red scars that stretch across her face. ""I feel so bad, I do not look at myself in the mirror anymore,"" Mumtaz said. She is the victim of a scorned man who decided that if he couldn't marry her, he'd make sure no one else would want to. The man had asked for her hand in marriage, but Mumtaz's family declined the offer. One night, she says, several men showed up at their home. They beat up her family, and finally two armed men held her, pulled her head back and let the man who had wanted to marry her pour acid all over her face. Manhunt under way for Taliban who shot woman in public execution . ""I was in the hospital for 10 days in Kunduz, and later they brought me to Kabul,"" Mumtaz said. ""Most of my body was burned. When the doctor gave me medicine, I felt like I was being thrown into a fire."" A few of the men involved have been arrested but not the one responsible for changing Mumtaz's face forever. This was the first time she had agreed to show her face and tell her story on television, partly because she fears for her life. Mumtaz has been through hell, which makes the second thing you notice about her all the more remarkable. She smiles every chance she gets. ""I guess it is just my nature,"" she said. The shelter where Mumtaz now lives is a haven for women who have been abused. Right now, there are 16 women there, some with young children. Many have been there for years because they simply have nowhere else to go. ""This shelter has helped us a lot. If they were not here to help me, I would have been dead by now. My life was in a great danger, "" Mumtaz said. Mumtaz is learning to read and write and is hoping to receive treatment for her scars in India. Just across the hall, there is another girl with a soul-destroying story of abuse. Sahar Gul had been beaten, burned, scalded with water and had her fingernails ripped out after being married off to a man more than twice her age when she was just 13 years old. Tortured girl: The same should be done to them . ""Sahar Gul's brother married her to this person in return of 200,000 Afghanis (about $4,000 dollars). Sahar had about 15 to 20 'good days' with her husband, but then problems started to arise; (the family started telling her) you are a child and cannot give birth and that you do not understand how to be a wife,"" said Gul's attorney, Shukria Khaliqi. In Afghanistan, it is an accepted tradition that the husband-to-be's family pay a dowry, also known as the bride price, to get a bride. But her new family had expectations that Gul could not meet. Gul said that when she didn't conceive a child, her husband and his family started complaining she was eating too much. They called her useless, stopped feeding her, locked her in a basement and began torturing her. She said they also told her to sell herself to other men, which she refused. ""They used to bring boys into the house. They used to say that they want to make money and wanted to buy a car,"" Gul said. Gul's mother-in-law, sister-in-law and father-in-law were convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail for the torture but are appealing the ruling. Gul's husband is still on the run. Mumtaz's and Gul's stories illustrate the fragile state of women in Afghanistan. Human rights groups say overall conditions for women in the country have improved since the U.S.-led war, but there are still too many cases where women are treated as subhuman. ""Since 2001, there has been some really important progress. Literacy has improved. There are about 2 million more girls in school than there were at the time when the Taliban fell. Infant mortality has fallen, and life expectancy has increased. But I still think the overall picture is less than people really hoped for,"" Heather Barr of Human Right's Watch in Afghanistan said. A 2008 study by Global Rights revealed that 87% of Afghan women reported suffering from domestic abuse. ""(Domestic violence) is a silent tsunami because nobody sees it, but it's taking the life of women. And many women turn to self-immolation or commit suicide or throw themselves in the rivers to escape the situation. It's something we do not see, because it's happening within the families,"" Afghanistan Member of Parliament Fawzia Kofi said. Kofi has been fighting to get the government to pay more attention to issues facing women. Recognizing the problem, President Hamid Karzai signed legislation aimed at eliminating violence against women in Afghanistan. Women's rights advocates say the law is good, but enforcement of the law is lax. Kofi, along with human rights advocates, worries about what will happen to women if international aid for services halts along with the pullout of NATO troops and the threat of the Taliban in government. ""I think the biggest fear and concern all of us have is that we go back to the dark period from where we had to look at the whole world from a small window,"" Kofi said.

"(CNN) -- The severity of the numerous injuries I sustained could have been fatal. The most severe: getting the back of my skull crushed by the impact of the truck. I needed emergency brain surgery. My neurosurgeon had to remove part of my cerebellum because fragments of my skull had pierced it. After the surgery, he said to my parents, ""I operated on him as if he had a chance."" But my parents never doubted I had a chance. After a two-month coma, I slowly came out of it, putting many doctors and the general medical profession in disbelief. My next step: a seven-month stay in a rehabilitation hospital. When a neurologist saw me for the first time, all I could do was move one finger on my right hand. He told my parents: ""I am optimistic that Ryan will gain enough strength in his right hand to type."" This statement stuck with me throughout the years. When I took my first steps after the accident, it was so sweet and gave me a sense of accomplishment. It was possibly the biggest event that made me realize just how wrong that doctor's diagnosis of me had been. It's been nine years since the accident and I still remember that statement every day. It helps me remember how wrong that neurologist was; how I've proved him wrong and how it motivates me to never let someone tell me what I can or cannot do. Healing wounds -- and souls -- a tattoo at a time . When people ask me about my story, I never get to fully say what I want to because there is just so much to it. I often leave out the incredible impact of family, faith and friends. Every day I was in a coma, my parents prayed for me and for it not to be my time, and to come back to them. They were so supportive throughout all of my recovery, as was the power of prayer and help from loving friends and the community. When the accident first happened, my local church held a prayer service for me. The church normally holds 500 people. But that night, there was standing room only -- all for a 9-year-old boy. My mom lived with me in the rehabilitation hospital, making huge sacrifices every day to be there with me. My brother and my dad would frequently make the drive up to the hospital to see me and we would spend the day together; it meant so much to me and made the rehab part a lot easier. When I was discharged from the hospital, friends and family from all over came together to help me by making giant get-well cards from various schools or having friends make dinner for us on a weekly basis. People that I did not even know expressed their concern for my well being from all around the country. Now I'm on my own bike team, the first paracycle team in the country. I'm training six days a week for two hours or more, so I'm doing all I can (to get to the 2016 Paralympics) and my heart's there. Just like in my recovery and how my parents knew all along my heart was so strong, I would overcome (my accident), I have high hopes for 2016.

"(CNN) -- Now, this is a weird one. On Wednesday, Manti Te'o was a well-liked college football star. A day later, he was the butt of the latest Internet fad -- posting pictures of yourself with your arm around an imaginary girlfriend. They call it ""Te'oing."" The nation was abuzz Thursday with talk of Te'o after the sports website Deadspin reported Wednesday that the girlfriend Te'o said died as his team marched toward the BCS National Championship Game not only didn't die -- she never existed. Te'o, 21, said Wednesday that he'd been tricked into an online relationship that ended with him being told the woman had died from leukemia. He said he'd been taken in by a ""sick joke."" Notre Dame said Te'o was the victim of an ""elaborate hoax."" The Manti Te'o hoax, in 30 posts . But many fans, sports experts and media critics took to the airwaves and the Internet, questioning that someone could pull the wool over Te'o's eyes for so long, and saying he had to be in on it. ""The level of hoax would have to be so elaborate that it really would strain credulity,"" said Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" and Newsweek's Washington bureau chief. The media also took its share of lumps, with Kurtz and others questioning why reporters covering Te'o's emotional tale didn't do more to check the young linebacker's story. Meanwhile, the story became overnight social media sensation, spawning a seemingly endless discussion of the whys and hows of the baffling case. And while none of those commenters claimed to have any inside knowledge, the Heisman Trophy was front and center in many of those theories. Te'o was among the top candidates for the trophy, which goes to the best college football player in the United States. He did not win. ""Manti Teo faked having a girlfriend for Heisman Votes!!!!!"" tweeted Cliff Harris, one of many outraged fans to voice the sentiment. Opinion: Te'o tale a mirror to our gullibility? Others said such a plan would need years of impractical planning. ""He most likely didn't make it up. To make it up, he'd have to have been scheming enough to make it just elaborate enough and just the right story to get people to pay attention,"" said a commenter using the handle Choo on a CNN.com story. ""He'd also have to have known that he would have played really well the exact game that she ""died."" He'd also have to be (unfazed) by it all. He'd also have to have the ability to lie straight-faced. I just don't think he is that smart or sneaky."" Eddie George is a Heisman Trophy-winning former Ohio State running back and NFL star. He met Te'o at the Heisman ceremony and said he thought he was a good kid. Asked to comment on the echo chamber online, George said, ""I can't believe that it could be."" He added, ""If it turns out that this was done for recognition and to get publicity for the Heisman, that would be despicable, deplorable."" The Heisman is a carefully choreographed mating dance. Even before a season starts, universities erect billboards and create media strategies to announce to the world that they have an athlete worthy of the game's most prestigious trophy. Timeline: How the story unfolded . While touchdowns and tackles are still the determining factors, a good storyline helps. And Te'o's heart-wrenching tale of determination in the face of two tragedies -- the death of his grandmother and his girlfriend within hours -- had all the elements. It reached its apex on September 15 when he led the Fighting Irish to a 20-3 thrashing of Michigan State. He credited the deaths in propelling him in the game in which he had 12 tackles, the most he had all season. ""I will be honest, throughout the game you are still thinking about it, but football allows me to be in a little realm, a little world that I know,"" he said afterward. ""I can honor them by the way I played. It was for them, for my girl and my grandma, and for all my loved ones who have passed on."" Sports fans lapped it up. He was a hero with a halo. Until, that is, the article appeared on Deadspin, the same site that in 2010 published explicit pictures allegedly sent by NFL quarterback Brett Favre to a New York Jets sideline host. Now, he's the butt of jokes and the center of swirling questions about whether he or someone else is behind the hoax. Opinion: Does Te'o story make you laugh or cry? Deadspin said it had traced the hoax to a former classmate of the woman whose face appears in the Twitter profile of Te'o's alleged girlfriend. The woman, according to Deadspin, had no knowledge of the hoax but said she recalled the classmate asking her to send him photos of herself similar to those used in the profile. Te'o did not answer a call to his room at a Florida training facility, where he is preparing for the NFL combine. CNN has not been able to locate the man Deadspin named in its article as being behind the hoax. However, Te'o tried to clear up some of the speculation with a statement Wednesday. ""This is incredibly embarrassing to talk about, but over several months I developed an emotional relationship with a woman I met online,"" he said. ""We maintained what I thought to be an authentic relationship by communicating frequently online and on the phone, and I grew to care deeply about her. ""To realize that I was the victim of what was apparently someone's sick joke and constant lies was, and is, painful and humiliating."" But David Haugh, a Chicago Tribune sports columnist, said Te'o has more explaining to do. ""It doesn't add up. Obviously the explanation, it bears further explanation,"" Haugh said. ""I think you want to hear from Manti Te'o himself beyond the statement. Because if he is truly a victim of a cruel hoax, as Notre Dame put it, then he has nothing to hide.""

"(CNN) -- To the rest of the world, Sweden seems to represent all that is enviably European. Scandinavia's largest country has a reputation for being stylish, progressive and glacially cool -- in short, everything the Eurovision Song Contest is not. So it may come as a surprise to some to learn that the Swedes take the annual song competition -- occasionally viewed by some of their neighbors as a bit of a joke -- very seriously indeed. Unlike in many other western European countries, the privilege of representing Sweden at the annual contest is hotly contested, through a grueling series of televised heats which have grown to become more popular than Eurovision itself. Melodifestivalen, a six-week, ""American Idol""-style TV series in which established acts compete against unknowns for the honor of representing Sweden, has broken every local ratings record. Nearly half of the country's 9.4 million people tuned in to this year's final. ""Melodifestivalens is the Swedish equivalent to the Superbowl,"" said Per Blankens who produced the TV show in 2006 and 2007. ""No other TV show gets the Swedes so rallied up. People put on dinner parties just so they can watch it together. They even get dressed up for the occasion."" Forgettable song, memorable outfit: The crazy clothes of Eurovision . The show has proven an invigorating force for the Swedish music industry, reviving old pop careers, launching new ones and selling thousands of records and concert tickets in the process. But why do the Swedes, often viewed as cool, collected tastemakers, get so worked up about a contest widely seen as having little musical credibility? Proud tradition . ""A lot of people don't know this, but Swedes are obsessed with music,"" said Blankens, who followed his stint on Melodifestivalen (Melody Festival) by producing the Swedish version of American Idol. ""Not only are all the most popular TV shows in Sweden music-related, but choral singing is the second most popular pastime after sports. It's only natural for us to get worked up about a music competition."" That love of music has translated to a long history of Eurovision success, with the most wins in the competition after Ireland (seven), France, Luxembourg and the UK (five each). The Netherlands has also won four times. The love affair began when ABBA won the 1974 contest with their hit ""Waterloo,"" launching them on their way to becoming Eurovision's greatest success story and one of the biggest-selling pop bands of all time. The Swedish entry this year, ""Euphoria"" by Loreen, was the bookies' favorite to follow in their footsteps and duly delivered success at the 57th Eurovision, in Baku, Azerbaijan. The tradition of success has seen many Swedes grow up with ""Melodifestivalen"" and Eurovision as annual fixtures in their households. ""Watching Eurovision is a national tradition in Sweden,"" said Maria Akesson, 28, a motion graphics student from Stockholm. ""When I was a kid it was the only night, apart from New Year's Eve, that my parents would allow me to stay up past midnight and let me eat as much crisps and candy as I liked."" Even as an adult, Eurovision remains a big occasion. ""I watch it with my friends and there's always someone who will organize a house party where we'll cook strange dishes from all the different countries and bet money on what song will win. People usually take the betting really seriously but we add silly categories like the worst outfit or the worst song."" ""Melodifestivalen""'s timing -- screening on Saturday nights for six weeks in the middle of the country's famously gloomy winters -- is seen as another reason for its enduring appeal. ""Sweden in the winter is very dark and can be quite depressing. When 'Melodifestivalen' starts airing in February we're in the middle of this season, but every week leading up to the final is a week closer to spring,"" said Sebastian Hjalmarsson Downey-Clark, a self-confessed Eurovision addict who works in London as a primary school teacher. ""It's almost as if 'Melodifestivalen' is the vessel that carries Sweden from the dark of winter to the light of summer, and soundtracks that journey with some awfully catchy music too."" Reviving the contest . ""Melodifestivalen"" is nearly as old as Eurovision itself, having run almost every year since 1959. But it wasn't always such a polished affair. ""In the 1990s the competition was struggling. There weren't enough good artists wanting to take part so it was decided that something radical needed to happen,"" said Christer Bjorkman, a former hairdresser who won ""Melodifestivalen"" in 1992. So in 2002, he oversaw the transformation of the contest from one-off contest between ten songs into a six-week pop marathon featuring 32. The ultimate winner is decided by a combination of public vote and a jury that consists of Swedish industry experts, and Eurovision judges from 11 other countries. The new format, featuring knock-out semi-finals held in cities across Sweden, was a smash hit, and Bjorkman has been involved in the production of every contest since. Today he is known as ""Mr Melodifestivalen."" ""Taking the show on the road was incredibly important to its success as it galvanized local support,"" he said. ""Equally as important was the fact that the audience now have weeks to familiarize themselves with all the songs. They form emotional attachments to the songs and, ultimately, also the winner -- which is one of the reasons why so many Swedes still care about how we do in Eurovision."" The resulting surge of interest in ""Melodifestivalen"" sees thousands of songs submitted to the contest each year, and has been a boon to the Swedish music industry. ""It's a goldmine for artists and songwriters that do well in the competition, as they go on to sell thousands of records and sell out tours across Scandinavia,"" said Blankens. Bjorkman agrees. ""The competition is enormously important for the Swedish music industry because not only does it launch new careers and revives old ones, it sells a lot of albums too,"" he said. ""From winter until spring, our songs occupy the charts. The final was in March, but four of our songs are still in the top ten."" 'Why not try?' The Swedes are very aware that not every country shares their infatuation with Eurovision. ""Big countries who take themselves quite seriously -- like Britain and France -- don't really want to compete against all these tiny nations on the European periphery in some silly music competition,"" said Blankens. ""They think it's beneath them, so they keep sending bad songs that never win."" But given the benefits to Sweden's music industry from the country's Eurovision obsession, perhaps the question shouldn't be why does Sweden care, but why don't others? ""Ultimately you get what you give,"" said Bjorkman. ""In countries like the UK they don't give much -- in fact they keep changing the format of the national try-outs each year. It's no wonder the public has lost interest in ... Eurovision."" ""Melodifestivalen""'s success owes much to the Swedish tendency not to ""do things by half measures,"" he said. ""When we decided to revive 'Melodifestivalen,' our aim was to create an amazing and engaging TV program that would benefit not only us as broadcasters, but the music industry and the viewers as well. I'm very proud to say that we have succeeded in doing just that.""","Sweden has a tradition of Eurovision success, having won the contest four times .

"Washington (CNN) -- The number of ""dropout factory"" high schools in the United States is decreasing, according to a report from the Building a Grad Nation Summit being held this week in Washington. Between 2009 and 2010, the number of ""dropout factories"" -- the term used in the report for those high schools that graduate 60% or less of the number of freshmen who reported for class four years earlier -- dropped from 1,634 to 1,550, continuing a trend that has accellerated in recent years, the report says. It is estimated that around one-quarter of students in the United States do not complete high school. The Grad Nation campaign has a goal of attaining a 90% graduation rate by the year 2020. Only the state of Wisconsin currently reaches that benchmark, although Vermont is less than half a percentage point away, the report says. ""The good news is that some states have made improvements in their graduation rates, showing it can be done,"" said Robert Balfanz, one of the report's authors. ""But the data also indicate that if we are to meet our national goals by 2020, we will have to accelerate our rate of progress, particularly in the states that have shown little progress."" Over the past decade, the report says, the number of high schools considered ""dropout factories"" has declined by 457, with the largest decrease coming since 2008. The Obama administration has targeted such schools with School Improvement Grants, which provide money to school districts that agree to follow certain criteria, such as closing down underperforming schools or changing a certain percentage of staff at those schools. The grants have been criticized by those who say they don't take into account the realities of rural school districts where it is hard to replace those staff members let go. According to the report, the battle to meet the goal of a 90% national high school graduation rate by the year 2020 will be won or lost in 13 states that have the largest number of students to get back on track to graduate. Those states are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Virginia and Washington. Tennessee and New York are the states that have shown the largest jump in graduation rates since the annual study began in 2002. To increase high school graduation rates, the report recommends a focus on the middle schools that feed ""dropout factory"" high schools so that students begin their high school years with the reading skills needed to complete high school. The Building a Grad Nation report is produced annually by Civic Enterprises, the Everyone Graduates Center at Johns Hopkins University, the America's Promise Alliance and the Alliance for Excellent Education.","""Dropout factory"" high schools fail to graduate 60% of students who enter as freshmen .

"(CNN) -- Every country competing at the London 2012 Olympics will have at least one female athlete after Saudi Arabia included two women in its team for the first time. Wodjan Ali Seraj Abdulrahim Shahrkhani, a judo competitor, and 800 meters runner Sarah Attar will compete in London after the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee named the duo in their team inside the official deadline of July 9. They had been invited to take part by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). ""This is very positive news and we will be delighted to welcome these two athletes in London in a few weeks' time,"" IOC president Jacques Rogge said in a statement on Thursday. ""The IOC has been working very closely with the Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee and I am pleased to see that our continued dialogue has come to fruition."" Historic breakthrough or false dawn?

Saudi runner Attar has been training in the United States. ""A big inspiration for participating in the Olympic Games is being one of the first women for Saudi Arabia to be going,"" the 17-year-old said at her San Diego base. ""It's such a huge honor and I hope that it can really make some big strides for women over there to get more involved in sport."" Saudi Arabia's decision is a rare concession for a kingdom where women are banned from driving. They cannot vote or hold public office, though that will change in 2015.

Women in Saudi Arabia also cannot marry, leave the country, go to school or open bank accounts without permission from a male guardian, who usually is the father or husband. Much of public life is segregated by gender. When it came to sports, female athletes were barred from the Olympic Games because they would be participating in front of a mixed-gender crowd. Human Rights Watch, which has criticized the Saudi government's restrictions on women, hailed the decision as ""an important precedent"" but warned that it needed to be backed up by allowing more females to participate in sport. ""Without policy changes to allow women and girls to play sports and compete within the kingdom, little can change for millions of women and girls deprived of sporting opportunities,"" said its senior Middle East researcher Christoph Wilcke. ""Female participation in the London Games will only have impact if it begins to level the playing field for women in the Kingdom. Now is the time for the International Olympic Committee to use its leverage and lay down concrete plans for female sports to girls schools, women's sports clubs and competitive tournaments."" The IOC said female participation at the first London Games in 1908 was 1.8% of all competitors, increasing to 9.5% when the UK capital was next host in 1948. At Beijing four years ago, the ratio was more than 42% -- and the IOC expects that to increase again. The United States will field more women than men for the first time in its history, with 269 of the 530 athletes taking part being female. ""It is a true testament to the impact of 'Title IX,' which in its 40-year history has increased sport opportunities for millions of females across the United States,"" said U.S. Olympic chief Scott Blackmun, referring to the legislation that bans sexual discrimination. Seven of the U.S. team will be taking part in their fifth Olympics. Five of them are women: high jumper Amy Acuff, archer Khatuna Lorig, equestrian Karen O'Connor, shooter Kim Rhode and volleyball player Danielle Scott-Arruda.","Saudi Arabia includes two female athletes in its team for the London Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Lauren Parsekian and Molly Thompson are two young filmmakers who met at Pepperdine University in California in 2005. A bystander could easily look at their naturally pretty faces and fit bodies and assume: ""These are the popular girls. Surely they've never been insulted or ignored, certainly never had to deal with being bullied."" They'd be wrong. ""The two of us have really personal experiences with what we call girl-against-girl crime,"" says Parsekian, who co-founded the nonprofit organization Kind Campaign with Thompson in 2009 to try to stop this pattern of harassment. As she elaborates on a past where middle school became torture, filled with flying rumors and drama that led to an eating disorder and a seventh-grade suicide attempt, the cliche ""never judge a book by its cover"" comes to mind. For Thompson, her experience with the brutality of ""girl world"" came in her junior year of high school when a former friend started spreading rumors about her. ""I feel so lucky to be able to travel all over the country and talk to girls and boys about some of these really dark times that we find ourselves in,"" says Thompson. ""Letting them know that there is hope and that together we can change."" That spirit of transformation through kindness is the driving force behind their nonprofit and the documentary ""Finding Kind,"" which the two produced in 2009. In the film, the two friends drive across the country interviewing hundreds of women and discuss how females treat one another. ""The message that we're trying to get across is to not only have a really honest dialogue about the really damaging effects of broken relationships between females, but really figuring out why it is that girls are so competitive and hard on one another rather than seeing each other as allies,"" says Parsekian. As representatives of Kind Campaign, both have dedicated the past four years of their lives to addressing this aspect of bullying. Through their movie, they begin to facilitate honest conversation between girls and women of all ages. They follow that presentation with two interactive features: the kind pledge and kind apologies. A pledge requires students to declare an action step they can take toward being kinder to their peers. Both women say, though, it's the kind apology where progress lies. In this exercise, girls ask for forgiveness from those they've hurt for the things they've said or done. Thompson saw firsthand how much a sincere apology can mend relationships. ""The very last day of school the girl who started the rumors and turned all my friends against me had the courage to apologize to me for what she had done. And I think her apology really helped me to be able to take that in and forgive her and move on,"" she says. As October is Bullying Awareness Month, the women recently left for their fourth nationwide tour of schools. They say it will be their last journey. They are currently in production on a ""Kind Kit"" which will include a recorded version of their school assembly program, the film ""Finding Kind,"" and a yearlong curriculum they say is endorsed by self-esteem expert and author Jessica Weiner (who also appears in the documentary). Parsekian says this packaged material will reach hundreds more schools than the pair could by traveling to one school at a time. Reflecting on her personal journey through this issue of girl-on-girl bullying, the filmmaker highlights the message of ""Kind Campaign"": . ""We're not standing here pointing the finger and saying, 'You're a mean girl and this is what you're doing wrong,' because at the end of the day, every person has been on both sides of this, and we've all thought things or done things that we shouldn't have that have hurt other people in our lives. It's really about pointing the finger at ourselves and realizing that we're all a part of this issue, and it's us who can really create the change.""","October is Bullying Awareness Month .

"(CNN) -- On the afternoon last week when the Rod Blagojevich jury rendered its verdict, you just know that someone, in some entertainment-industry high-rise office suite somewhere, was seeing the invisible lightbulb click on: . Eureka! The next big reality-show idea. No, not a show about Blagojevich. That's not thinking big enough. But as the anxiety built up during the 14 days of deliberations, as panels of journalists, attorneys and retired judges filled airtime guessing what the outcome would be, the concept was dangling out there like a fresh, ripe, red apple, just begging to be picked: . A jury, deliberating. On television. Impossible, you say? It could never happen? Never say never. The jury room is America's last secret place. Once the testimony in a trial has ended, and the door to the jury room closes, all is mystery. High-powered lawyers, distinguished judges, hard-charging prosecutors, wealthy defendants . . . all of them may be prominent during the public part of a trial, but once the jury begins its deliberations those courtroom players are as in the dark as anyone else. In a society that seems to be willingly throwing away all vestiges of privacy, the jury room is still sacrosanct. When trials end, some jurors decide to talk to reporters, but by then the outcome is public. And a juror's retelling of the deliberations, regardless of how precise, can't match the moment-to-moment tension of the real thing while it is unfolding. A handful of times in the decades since television was introduced to the U.S., judges have allowed documentary crews to record jury deliberations for future airing. Such instances have been exceedingly rare. With good reason. Justice is not entertainment; the determination of someone's guilt or innocence is not amusement. But, of course, just about everything else in American life has been turned into entertainment and amusement. So we shouldn't rule out the possibility that at some point, in some state, rationalizations will be made and cameras will be placed in jury rooms for a continuing television series. And how great a leap is it, really, from cameras in the courtrooms to cameras in the jury rooms? Reasons not to do it are myriad: Jurors might be reluctant to speak candidly knowing they are being watched by people at home; some jurors, on the other hand, might seek stardom by playing to the cameras; men and women who might make excellent jurors would be made uncomfortable by the whole process and ask not to serve. The argument presented in favor of it will be that the jury system is such a fundamental part of the nation's identity that the public would be well served to be able to see exactly what goes on as a case is decided. There will be promises: no juror will be televised if he or she doesn't want to; no case will be sent to a jury room with cameras unless the judge, the prosecutors, the defense lawyers and the defendants agree on it. Still think it won't happen? Here's why it might: . In some state somewhere in the U.S., when dwindling budgets for the courts have reached crisis proportions, a proposal will be made by a television production company: We will pay [fill in the monetary blanks] dollars for the right to televise your juries. With that money you can hire more judges, you can modernize your courtrooms, you can increase the number of prosecutors and public defenders. This will be good for you, and will be good for society. And someone, somewhere, will swallow hard and say yes. Will the result be a nonfiction version of the cinematic classic ""12 Angry Men""? Or will it be ""Jersey Shore"" with bailiffs? The dramatic possibilities are unarguable. If television viewers get breathless waiting to see who is voted off an island, think of the anticipation as the decision is made whether to set someone free or send him to prison. ""Survivor,"" all right. You can almost hear the promotional tagline now: ""Twelve strangers are sent into a small room. By the time they come out. . . ."" Most judges would undoubtedly reject all this out of hand, but there are some who like publicity more than others. With a big enough jury pool, it would hardly be difficult to find 12 men and women who would welcome the opportunity to deliberate on national television. For every defense attorney who would find the concept abhorrent, there might be another who would silently think: My client doesn't have much of a chance in this case anyway; I might as well say yes to the jury being televised, because then I'll have a video and audio record to search for errors that will help us win an appeal. And the TV shows themselves? The jury deliberations would have to be heavily edited to get rid of the tedious parts. Trials would be shown on a delayed basis, because most of the country wouldn't be familiar with the cases anyway, and would be unaware of the verdicts. But when the ratings needed a boost, you can imagine the producers' pitches to the presiding local judge: . ""We want to do this one in real time, to be shown after court ends each night You know how sometimes you instruct jurors not to read the papers or watch TV? Well, the hook this time will be to turn that around. The whole country will be watching the jury on TV-- but you'll forbid the defendant, the prosecutors and the defense attorneys from watching. They'll be the only people in America who won't know what the jurors are saying. . . ."" This all sounds like a bad dream, right? In other words: television gold. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says Blagojevich jury verdict likely led to some exec's Eureka moment .
Why not a reality show about a deliberating jury?, he speculates .
He says in a tell-all culture, with cash-strapped courts, someone, somewhere is bound to allow it .
Greene: Dramatic possibilities endless, as are potential abuses.  But it would sell big ."
"Johannesburg (CNN) -- When Nelson Mandela was admitted to hospital, South Africans took a deep breath and prepared themselves for the worst. Despite the government issuing statements telling concerned citizens not to panic, they did. Mandela holds such a special place in South African's hearts that they fortify themselves with the inevitable day when he takes his last breath. At 93, many here are grateful the former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner is still with them. He has long left the public and political stage but the knowledge that he is still around -- enjoying retirement on a farm in the Eastern Cape -- gives them a sense of comfort. Nelson Mandela is held in deep affection because he reminds South Africans of how far they have come. Mandela rekindles South Africans nostalgia for a time when this country was a miracle of democracy. Mandela is the embodiment of the South Africa that was promised in the election of 1994. The reality is that many South Africans worry that their ""rainbow nation"" no longer embodies Mandela's vision. With Mandela old and silent, there have been many worrying signs that his country has deviated off Mandela's path of reconciliation and democracy, say observers. The government, under President Jacob Zuma, finds it challenging to embrace Mandela's dedication to a critical and probing free press. A new law, called the Protection of Information Bill, could jail journalists and whistleblowers for up to 25 years if they are caught in possession of classified state information. The government has refused to add a ""public interest"" clause, which would limit the scope of this legislation. The government says this law aims to protect the country from foreign enemies. However, civil society groups say it is an attempt to muzzle the press, which has been vigorous in reporting corruption within government. Corruption has for many, become the cancer at the heart of modern-day South Africa. It seems not a day goes by without a civil servant being outed for dodgy dealings. The former police chief is in prison for accepting bribes from a crime boss, the wife of the minister of state security has been found guilty of drug trafficking and Schabir Schaik, President Zuma's former financial adviser, who was jailed for fraud and corruption, barely served his sentence and is on ""medical parole"" despite being seen playing golf by journalists. The province of Limpopo was recently declared ""technically bankrupt"" by the national treasury after discovering there was ""unauthorized and irregular"" spending by the provincial leadership. Observers say the looting of state coffers is not just limited to the Limpopo province. Additionally, the cornerstone of Mandela's legacy -- the constitution -- has always been a soothing balm to even the most pessimistic about South Africa's prospects. No matter the challenges that convulse society, there was always the sense that the work of the judiciary and the Constitutional Court would protect the democratic edifice. When President Zuma recently said in a newspaper interview that he was looking to ""review"" the work of the Constitutional Court there was a deep sense of dismay. Many people have been left wondering why ANC-led government would tinker with the foundations of Mandela's South Africa. Mandela is said by those close to him to be suffering from a form of senile dementia, which doctors say is common in the very old. He gets confused and is easily upset and agitated. Importantly, for a man who was obsessed with the news, his family and the military now largely protect him from the details of everyday life. If he really understood what was going on around him, what would Nelson Mandela say about an apartheid-era law that was being used to threaten journalists trying to report on his health? Ironically, the government is using the National Key Points and Strategic Installations Bill -- previously known as the feared National Key Points Act -- to increase the powers of the security structures to declare, in secret, buildings that are of ""national importance."" This law was created in 1980 at the height of the state of emergency and policed by apartheid forces. When reporters stood on the perimeter of the military hospital believed to be where Mandela was being treated, they were threatened with arrest if they filmed the hospital building. One photographer was detained briefly and has since been released. The same law has been evoked in a case against two news agencies, which apparently set up cameras outside Mandela's Eastern Cape home. Legal experts hope that case goes to court because they say this ""key points"" legislation would never pass a constitutional test. Despite many contradictions, South Africa remains a beautiful and extraordinary nation. Present day South Africa is so much better than those dark, ugly days when Nelson Mandela was in jail and the racist laws subjugated most citizens. However, the reason South Africans panic when they hear Mandela is unwell is because they think to their future. They worry that when the day finally comes that Mandela goes, the country loses its democratic anchor.","Ailing Nelson Mandela holds special place in South Africans' hearts .

"(CNN) -- Milagros Martinez endured losing one of her sons to cystic fibrosis before he could get a lung transplant. Now she's hoping her younger boy, Javier Acosta, 11, will get such an operation in time. ""This is like watching movie that you've seen before and you want a different ending,"" Martinez told CNN on Saturday. ""It's hard for me to tell my son 'you have to have faith and be hopeful, you know this is going to happen for you,' and inside knowing that chances are slim."" A judge on Thursday made Javier, from Bronx, New York, more quickly eligible for adult lungs. The boy is hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Judge Michael Baylson granted a temporary injunction and ordered U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive in Javier's case a policy that keeps children younger than 12 from being prioritized for available adult lung transplants. Martinez' son, Jovan, died in 2009 at 11. Javier also has cystic fibrosis. The ruling came the same day the judge granted an injunction for 10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan, whose parents' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight. Sarah also needs a lung transplant. Martinez said she was ""excited"" after hearing the news of the the ruling in Javier's case. ""I felt it was a triumph on our side because it allows these children to have an opportunity to be considered for adult lungs, which they need badly, instead of just waiting it out,"" she said. ""We don't know what tomorrow brings."" According to Murnaghan and Martinez's attorney, Stephen Harvey, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network is expected to consider Monday evening the families' requests that the ""Under 12"" rule -- which places children under age 12 at the bottom of the organ allocation list -- be struck down. Currently, it is estimated that 16 or fewer children nationwide are in the same position as Sarah and Javier, Harvey said. If the rule is not struck down, a formal court hearing on the matter is scheduled for June 14. ""If Javi does not receive this transplant, he will die,"" Martinez said. ""Like any parent, I'm inclined to do whatever it takes, to help Javier have a normal life, whatever that may be.""","FIRST ON CNN: Mother of sick boy speaks out .

"Savar, Bangladesh (CNN) -- As rescue efforts in Bangladesh have moved to a recovery phase, anger has boiled over. Anger at the building owner who ordered workers to return to the building after cracks had appeared in the structure. Anger at reports that the government had turned down offers of international aid. Anger that so many died in what is now the deadliest industrial accident in the nation's history. After building collapse, Shahina's death breaks rescuers' hearts . On the highway leading from Dhaka to Savar -- the suburb where the building collapsed Wednesday, killing at least 398 people -- hundreds of garment workers clashed with police as they demanded the hanging of Sohel Rana, the building owner. The demonstrators damaged more than a dozen cars as police fired rubber bullets to clear the highway. At least 10 were hurt. In another part of the city, garment workers formed a human chain to call attention to the dismal conditions in which they work. They are hoping the disaster will be a wake-up call to their plight. 'Hang him!' Bangladesh's High Court has ruled that all of Rana's assets be seized, along with those of the owners of the five garment factories the building housed. As Rana entered the court, demonstrators and some lawyers chanted, ""Hang him! Hang him!"" Meanwhile, the United Nations and Britain said the Bangladeshi government in Dhaka had rejected their offers of assistance. Opinion: Who really pays for our cheap clothes? The British Department for International Development said Dhaka declined an offer of ""specialist technical advice"" to help the search and rescue operation at the building. Gerson Brandao, an official at the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Dhaka, said the Bangladeshi government had rejected an offer to send a team of international experts. Authorities not clear about aid offer . Bangladeshi authorities appeared confused. C.Q.K. Mustaq Ahmed, a senior secretary in Bangladesh's Ministry of Home Affairs, said late Sunday that he had heard that his minister had rejected an offer but that he did not know about it directly. ""Maybe the offer has been decided by the minister (that we do) not need that,"" he said. ""I don't know, but I hear that he said there is no need. If there were immediate machines, of course, it might have helped. I don't know if they could line it up in two or three days."" Read more: At building collapse site, horror mixes with humanity . Babul Miah, deputy secretary at the Foreign Ministry, said he did not believe that such an offer would have been dismissed but was not aware of an offer or rejection. ""I don't believe that if the international organizations offered technical support that the government would reject it,"" he said. ""It shouldn't happen."" 'Utter disgust' ""It's totally outrageous and unfortunate that we turned down help, which could have only helped,"" said Naushad Hussain, a Bangladeshi citizen living in Kuala Lumpur. Shammi Huda, a businessman in Dhaka, said his reaction to the news was one of ""complete and utter disgust."" ""Dhaka is always rife with conspiracy theories at best of times, but common sentiment is that government wanted to avoid any possibility of disputes arising over death tolls or competence in handling the situation,"" he said. ""And that would have arisen with independent international observers and experts at hand."" At the site of the collapse, the recovery effort continued Tuesday, as yellow cranes sifted through concrete slabs. For six days, rescuers had done all they could, many of them clawing with their bare hands through metal and rubble to reach survivors. They pulled out more than 2,400 alive. CNN's Aliza Kassim and Saeed Ahmed in Atlanta, and journalist David Bergman in Dhaka, Bangladesh, contributed to this report.","Police fire rubber bullets at protesters calling for death of building owner .

"Rancho Mirage, California (CNN) -- Following the furor over revelations the U.S. government is collecting telephone records and data mining popular online services, National Intelligence Director James Clapper took the unusual step Saturday of declassifying some details about the programs. In doing so, Clapper reiterated President Barack Obama's position that the programs are necessary to fight terrorism, while one of his deputies said the administration was looking into possible repercussions caused by leaks to the media about programs. ""We are doing an assessment of the damage that has been done to U.S. national security by the revelation of this information,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters during a news briefing in Rancho Mirage, California, where President Barack Obama was meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. ""...Currently, there's a review underway to understand what potential damage may be done."" How does it affect me? Clapper's declassification of some details is the most comprehensive explanation by the government to date of how the programs work and what information they collect. Among the details made public: The National Security Agency's PRISM program -- the program that reportedly allows the government to access online services -- is an internal government computer system that is used to manage foreign intelligence collected from online providers and services. ""Over the last week we have seen reckless disclosures of intelligence community measures used to keep Americans safe,"" Clapper said in a statement distributed along with a two-and-a-half pages of details about the programs. Privacy's already dead . ""In a rush to publish, media outlets have not given the full context -- including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all three branches of government."" The release of the declassified material comes as the government is under fire following revelations about the surveillance and intelligence programs that have seen privacy advocates call for reforms and elected officials question the expansive nature of the intelligence-gathering activities. Internet laughs about being spied on . The revelations began Wednesday, when a British newspaper, the Guardian, published a top secret order from an intelligence court that required Verizon Business Network Services to give telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19. Revelation opens political Pandora's box . That was followed a day later by a report from The Washington Post that the government was using a program called PRISM that reportedly allows NSA analysts access to computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other companies to extract details of customer activities, including ""audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents"" and other materials. Clapper said the surveillance activities published in the Guardian and The Washington Post are ""lawful and conducted under authorities widely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress"" since its inception in 2008.

"On tour with Prince Harry (CNN) -- Last time Prince Harry visited these shores, he departed under a cloud. By contrast, his current visit is going swimmingly. The royal really started enjoying his U.S. tour over the weekend. He was at the Warrior Games which combines two of his great passions: sport and the support of war veterans. Harry threw himself in to the event, having a go at sitting volleyball, cheering on the British cycling team and trying out American football -- and he announced an ambitious plan to create an international version of the games in the UK. He will have other chances to show off his sporting prowess this week: In New York, the prince is going to try his hand at baseball and has been getting advice on how to pitch in preparation for doing so in front of the world's media. On Thursday, he captains a polo team in one of the richest neighborhoods on the planet: Greenwich, Connecticut. There's been a scramble for access from young women desperate to meet the man who has the power to grant them something money just can't buy -- a title. But there is also serious work to be done. He's linking up with UK Prime Minister David Cameron at an event promoting British trade and is visiting New Jersey to see an area devastated by Hurricane Sandy. The Prince wanted to go to the worst hit neighborhood possible so he could get the best sense of the damage. On Tuesday, Prince Harry will view a roller coaster, boardwalk and pier at Seaside Heights that were swept into the ocean during the storm. After Harry's visit, the debris will be dismantled, according to Maria Mastoris, marketing manager for Casino Pier, the owner of the amusement park where the coaster was located. He'll be accompanied by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who is grateful to Prince Harry for putting Sandy back on the news agenda, according to a person close to the Prince on this tour. I spoke to Prince Harry and it's clear he's focused on promoting issues on this tour, not himself. He's aware that getting involved in events and showing his character makes for good coverage. But this is a prince who has a deep-seated suspicion of the media. On Sunday he told the gathered press pack: ""It's not always great having you around,"" but then thanked us for raising the profile of the event. There may have been a wry smile when he accidentally threw a football into the middle of the press pen during his practice. Harry is trying to strike the right balance between capitalizing on the interest in him, without giving too much of himself away. He managed it in spectacular fashion during his tour of the Caribbean last year but then let himself down (his own words) in Las Vegas when naked pictures of him emerged. But the Prince is managing to put Vegas behind him. People on the tour are talking about it less. He's rebuilding his image as a professional royal and serving soldier. CNN's Ronni Burke contributed to this report.","Britain's Prince Harry is on an official tour of the United States .

"London (CNN) -- A man has been arrested after a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II was defaced with paint Thursday at Westminster Abbey in London, police said. The 41-year-old man is being held at a central London police station on suspicion of causing criminal damage, London's Metropolitan Police said. The suspect has not been named by police. The portrait, by the Australian-born artist Ralph Heimans, is being taken down until the damage can be remedied, the abbey said in a statement. It went on public display last month as part of the abbey's celebrations for the 60th anniversary of the queen's coronation. The 9-foot by 11-foot oil painting depicts the queen in state dress, including the crimson velvet robe she wore for her coronation in 1953, in an imagined scene at night in the abbey. According to the abbey website, it captures the queen ""in a moment of solitary reflection."" Last week, the queen and other royals attended a service at the abbey to mark 60 years since her coronation there. There have been 38 coronations at Westminster Abbey since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066. Westminster Abbey is also where Prince William married Catherine Middleton in 2011.

"(CNN) -- One congressman says it's ""shocking"" how the Obama administration is now using the Patriot Act. But a senator says the secret court order for American phone records is ""lawful."" The Patriot Act, the landmark law born out of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, is at the center of an emerging controversy Thursday over how the Obama administration obtained a secret court order for phone records from the Verizon Business Network Service from April to July this year. The administration is accused of making a secret interpretation and going too far in that interpretation of the anti-terrorism law, specifically a portion called Section 215. Experts wonder whether the revelation of the secret order will prompt a public outcry and Congressional hearings. And a digital civil liberties lawyer argues the government can no longer claim state secrecy privileges in federal lawsuits seeking to shut down domestic surveillance programs. Even before this week's Verizon controversy, privacy advocates had long criticized Section 215 as vastly expanding the FBI's power to spy on Americans. The USA Patriot Act (pdf) The Verizon case apparently marks a difference between Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush in obtaining phone records, according to Tyler Newby, a former federal computer crime prosecutor under both administrations. The Bush administration also collected phone logs -- the same sort of ""metadata"" that the Obama administration is gathering from Verizon -- and even conducted wiretaps, but it did so without getting a court order. Now the Obama administration is invoking the Patriot Act's Section 215 -- as well as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- as the basis for a secret court order demanding Verizon records that show originating and terminating phone numbers, their location, time and duration. The FISA court's proceedings, held in Washington, are secret. ""It's pretty broad authority that Section 215 gives the FBI,"" said Newby, who worked in the U.S. Justice Department between 2007 and early 2011. ""It's important to note that this order does not permit the collection of the content of communications, so it's not a wiretap,"" said Newby, who now works for a Silicon Valley-based law firm that represents Facebook, Google and other companies. ""That's important because if you're collecting content, then there is a privacy interest of individuals,"" Newby said Thursday. ""With these business records -- what the government is calling telephony metadata -- there is not the same expectation of privacy. ""Presumably this is going into a large and sophisticated data-mining database, looking for patterns and call activities"" relating to terrorism, Newby added. One legal scholar wonders if the Verizon case will provoke a groundswell of outrage. ""Now they have taken the calls of every single citizen from Verizon,"" said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University. ""At what point do citizens stand up and say this is the tipping point? We're getting toward authoritarian power. ""The problem is, every administration, every politician will say we're getting something from this,"" Turley said. ""You can make that argument to remove all civil liberties."" The revelation of the court order could help plaintiffs and their attorneys such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation in their federal lawsuits seeking to shut down government domestic surveillance programs. With the revelation of the surveillance of Verizon, the government can no longer argue state secrecy privileges in those lawsuits, said Mark Rumold, staff attorney at the foundation, a digital civil liberties organization. ""The cat is out of the bag now, or they will have a difficult time convincing a judge that this information is still secret,"" Rumold said. About the secret court order against Verizon, Rumold said: ""I don't know of any single other publicly disclosed order in the history of the United States that could have had the far-reaching effect that this one has. We're probably talking about millions of people. ""There's no question in my mind that this type of order is illegal,"" Rumold said, adding that Congress ought to hold hearings on the Verizon case. The secret court order also is drawing strong criticism from within Obama's Democratic Party. Former Vice President Al Gore wrote on Twitter: ""Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?"" Added Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colorado, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee: ""While I cannot corroborate the details of this particular report, this sort of wide-scale surveillance should concern all of us and is the kind of government overreach I've said Americans would find shocking."" Udall and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, who also serves on the Intelligence Committee, accused Attorney General Eric Holder in a letter last year of making ""secret interpretations of public laws."" ""We believe most Americans would be stunned to learn the details of how these secret court opinions have interpreted section 215 of the Patriot Act,"" which deals with ""business records,"" they wrote. But Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, described the FISA court order as ""the exact three-month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years."" ""This renewal is carried out by the FISA court under the business records section of the Patriot Act. Therefore it is lawful. It has been briefed to Congress,"" Feinstein said. ""Terrorists will come after us if they can, and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us."" Many analysts cited how federal surveillance of phone records could prove useful. ""Think of the Boston Marathon bombings,"" said Fran Townsend, a CNN contributor and former Homeland Security adviser to President George W. Bush. Phone records could have proved valuable in tracking the suspects in that terror attack, Townsend said. ""What numbers were they calling? Who were their associates? You may find witnesses,"" Townsend said. Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, said the surveillance is nothing new. The gathering of phone records ""has proved meritorious because we have gathered significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years,"" he said.","NEW: ""At what point do citizens stand up and say this is the tipping point?"" professor asks .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams is looking forward to the ""ultimate challenge"" of trying to win the French Open after again proving her dominance over biggest rival Maria Sharapova and defending her Madrid title on Sunday. The American triumphed 6-1 6-4 to retain her No. 1 ranking and claim the 50th WTA Tour crown of her career, becoming only the 10th player to do so. The 31-year-old is the only player to have won on three different colors of clay -- and she is confident that the Madrid surface's reversion to red after the blue of 2012 will help her bid to end an 11-year wait for her second grand slam success at Roland Garros. ""This court is definitely different from last year,"" Williams said. ""It definitely plays more like Roland Garros, so I think that's a plus. It's a little slower than it was last year and plays more like a true clay court. So I think it's great preparation. It's a good start in the right direction."" Last year Williams fell at the first hurdle in Paris -- a tournament she won back in 2002 -- before going on to triumph at Wimbledon, the Olympics, the U.S. Open and the season-ending WTA Championships. ""It is the ultimate challenge,"" Williams said. ""Whether I reach it, I don't know. I'm not going to put that pressure on myself. ""I wanted to do it last year and I didn't get it. So this year I'm just looking forward to Rome, and then after that Roland Garros."" Williams has now beaten second-ranked Sharapova in their past 12 meetings, and was in control for most of the match despite trailing 3-1 in the second set. ""I don't know if her start was shaky, but I felt I played well in the first few games -- playing such a great athlete and great tennis player like Maria, you have to come out and play well. I had no choice,"" she said. ""She definitely started playing better in that second set -- I think she came out with a different game plan. I missed a very crucial point in that first game, but after that I just had to refocus."" Williams is now three wins behind Monica Seles on the WTA list, but a long way behind Martina Navratilova's record 167. ""I don't know how many more I can win. Like I say every day, 'Who knows if I'll ever win another title?' I just want to live in the moment,"" said Williams, who returned to action in 2011 after a long injury break that caused life-threatening blood clots on her lungs. ""I feel like every moment I play -- I don't know if it's because of what I went through -- I feel like I'm so fortunate to be out there and healthy and to have an opportunity to play a sport and be really good at it. ""Hopefully I can just keep it going."" Sharapova arrived in Rome having retained her Stuttgart title, but the Russian was once again unable to stand up to Williams' power. ""Obviously it's tough losing in the final today, but I think my preparation so far has been decent, winning a title in Stuttgart and getting to the final in this tournament for the first time,"" the 26-year-old said. ""One more tune-up to go before Roland Garros, and everything seems to be going well."" Rafael Nadal is in fine shape to defend his French Open title after winning a record-extending 23rd Masters level tournament in Madrid on Sunday. The Spaniard crushed Swiss 15th seed Stanislas Wawrinka 6-2 6-4 in the final to claim his fifth crown since returning from longterm knee problems in February. The 26-year-old joined Thomas Muster in equal second on the Open Era clay titles list with his 40th success on the surface. They are six behind Guillermo Vilas. Wawrinka can take some consolation in that he will return to the top-10 rankings for the first time since 2008. It was Nadal's third title in Madrid, where he has been runner-up twice.","World No. 1 Serena Williams beats Maria Sharapova in final to retain Madrid title .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A picture of an overweight woman lying naked on a couch, painted by British artist Lucian Freud, set a record Tuesday night for the most money paid for a painting by a living artist. ""Benefits Supervisor Sleeping"" depicts Sue Tilley lying on a worn-out couch. The 1995 life-size work, ""Benefits Supervisor Sleeping,"" fetched $33.6 million during bidding at Christie's auction house in New York. The previous record was for ""Hanging Heart,"" a painting by Jeff Koonz that sold for $23.5 million, said Rik Pike, a spokesman for Christie's. ""Benefits Supervisor Sleeping"" depicts Sue Tilley, a manager of a government-run job center in London, lying on her side on a worn-out couch with nothing to hide her folds of flesh. Christie's calls it a ""bold and imposing example of the stark power of Lucian Freud's realism,"" depicting ""the forceful and undeniable physical presence of people and things."" Tilley, 51, said she was initially embarrassed to pose naked for the artist, but they soon grew comfortable in the studio -- so comfortable, in fact, that she confessed to falling asleep while posing. ""I didn't mind if he noticed,"" she said. The painting challenges modern notions of beauty and elicits a reaction from everyone who sees it. That may have been precisely the aim of Freud, who told London's Tate Gallery in 2002 that he wanted his paintings to ""astonish, disturb, seduce, convince."" Though some regard the painting as shocking -- ugly, even -- that is also the appeal for collectors, said Michael Hall, editor of Apollo Magazine in London. ""There's a reaction against art that's regarded as too pretty,"" he said. Hall said he thinks a more conventionally beautiful painting would not be able to fetch such a large amount. ""It's the sort of thing that everyone immediately wants to voice an opinion about,"" he said of the painting. ""It challenges conventional taste ... and people do find that rather exciting and interesting to talk about."" Collectors may also view this as a rare chance to buy something by a prolific artist painted at the peak of his work, he said. Freud, 85, has been described as Britain's greatest living realist painter. He is the grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud and came to London from Germany when he was a child. With Tilley, Freud said he was ""very aware of all kinds of spectacular things to do with her size, like amazing craters and things one's never seen before,"" according to the 2002 interview with the Tate. He added, ""I have perhaps a predilection towards people of unusual or strange proportions, which I don't want to over-indulge."" Freud painted the portrait of Tilley over nine months in 1995. Tilley said she posed for eight hours a day, two or three days a week. She had been introduced to the artist through a mutual friend, Australian performance artist Leigh Bowery, who also posed for Freud. It was Bowery's idea for Tilley to pose for Freud, so he arranged a meeting. Tilley knew the meeting was more of an interview for the job of Freud's muse, and she didn't find out until later -- through Bowery -- that she'd gotten the job, she said. ""Lucian just said to Leigh, 'Oh, tell Sue she can start next week,' "" Tilley said. Tilley still works full-time at the job center in London's West End and calls her newfound fame ""a bit bizarre."" She laughs as she describes how she now has to arrange her schedule to accommodate media interviews. She said she's excited to find out how much the painting will sell for, but knowing that it could set a record is ""a bit scary."" ""It's hard to put your head around it, really,"" she said. ""But it's all good.""","NEW: Life-size 1995 portrait is auctioned for $33.6 million .

"(CNN) -- There is a hidden revolution at work that can transform the lives of a billion of the poorest people on the planet. The dream of health for all, even the poorest of the poor, can become a reality because of recent breakthroughs in technology and health systems. Scientific results that our Millennium Villages Project team published this week in The Lancet, coupled with broader trends around the world, should be a wake-up call: We can end the deaths of millions of young children and mothers each year by building on recent innovations. In 2006, the Millennium Villages Project and impoverished communities around Africa jointly embarked upon the fight against extreme poverty, hunger and disease. The idea was to use low-cost, cutting-edge technologies to overcome ancient scourges like malaria and mothers dying in childbirth. Today, there is no deep mystery about what to do to stop these deaths, since the diagnostic tests, medicines and procedures are known. The challenge is to scale up these life-saving approaches. In four years, starting from conditions of massive death tolls and a lack of health services, the Millennium Villages were able to reduce the deaths of children under 5-years-old by around 22%. The progress is continuing as low-cost health services expand. The lessons extend far beyond this specific project. Poor children die of three main categories of disease: infections, nutritional deficiencies and conditions around childbirth. The technologies and procedures to fight all these causes of death are improving dramatically. Therein lies a great hope. Consider malaria, one of the biggest killers of children in Africa. A dozen years ago, all seemed lost: The standard medicine had lost its efficacy as the parasite became resistant; insecticide-treated bed nets were little used because they had to be regularly retreated with the insecticide, a practical burden that poor villages could not manage; and diagnosis required that the mother and sick child trek to a distant clinic in the desperate hope the clinic had a functioning laboratory. Now all this has changed. A new generation of low-cost and highly effective medicines has been deployed. The nets now last five years without the need for retreatment. A trained village-based worker, as part of an expanded health system, can make the diagnosis at the household using a simple rapid test, without the need for a life-and-death journey to a distant clinic. The Millennium Villages have slashed malaria deaths, but much more to the point, malaria deaths are falling sharply across Africa, down by around one-third from their peak roughly a decade ago. The advances are widespread. New vaccines can fight diarrheal and respiratory diseases that have traditionally killed vast numbers of children. Thanks to vaccines, deaths from measles have plummeted, and polio is on the verge of eradication. New medical procedures can end the transmission of the HIV virus from mother to newborn. Technologies to support higher farm production and low-cost nutritional supplements can bolster inadequate diets. Perhaps most important, information can flow through even the remotest of villages, thanks to the massive increase in mobile telephones across regions that just a few years ago had no phones at all. The spread of mobile phones may mark the fastest global uptake of a technology in history. From a few million mobile phone subscribers worldwide in 1990, the number has climbed to more than 6 billion today, with more than 250 million subscribers in Africa. Mobile connectivity and the spread of wireless broadband are greatly strengthening rural health systems. In all of the Millennium Villages, and in more and more villages around the continent, lay community workers are bringing health services from the clinics right to the community. Mobile phones are critical in supporting these outreach workers, enabling them to call the doctors and nurses for advice, summon an ambulance or connect to a computerized expert system via text messaging. The big picture is thrilling. Globally, deaths of young children are falling. In 1990, the worldwide deaths of children under 5 totaled around 12.5 million. By 2010, the deaths were down to around 7.6 million. Yet this technology-based revolution in human well-being is at the risk of stalling. The improvements required international help to support the expansion of services in the poorest regions. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and Malaria and the U.S. PEPFAR initiative to fight AIDS exemplify the new kinds of support introduced during the past decade. Total funding for primary health care in the poorest countries has risen by roughly $15 billion per year from the low levels of aid a dozen years back. That's a good sum, but modest in the scheme of things, amounting to around $15 per person per year from the high-income countries, with a combined population of 1 billion. It's about half the support needed to complete the job. Alarmingly, the funding has come to a standstill and has even started to decline. The United States and Europe claim they can't afford to do more because of budget crises, but the needed sums could be filled many times over just by ending the loopholes that allow the richest companies to park their profits in Caribbean tax havens. If children continue to die by the millions, it will be the result of misguided priorities, not true budget limits. Instead of making excuses for lives lost, let us celebrate the remarkable progress we are making and commit ourselves to finishing this historic and worthy task. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Sachs.","Jeffrey Sachs: Health innovations can save millions of poor children each year .
Sachs: Cell phones, fast diagnostic tests, better medicines changing global health .
But this revolution in poor countries is threatened by funding cuts, he says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rusty the runaway red panda is home and ""doing great,"" according to Washington's National Zoo, but the question remains -- how did he escape? Rusty, who is not even a year old, still has everyone stumped. The zoo exhibit has housed red pandas for several years without any problems, and Rusty's companion, 5-year-old Shama,remained in the zoo habitat when Rusty disappeared. The habitat is designed, as a zoo official explained, to keep the red pandas in and humans out. So how did Rusty find himself more than half a mile from the zoo in a residential area this past Monday? Experts have evaluated the habitat and still have yet to determine a plausible route for Rusty's escape. Pamela Baker-Masson, director of communications at National Zoo, said that zoo officials have ""started the assessment of the enclosure, and it is likely we will have some short-term immediate actions and some long-terms actions."" The problem is, they aren't sure yet what those actions should be. Since red pandas are naturally arboreal animals, and spend much of their time in trees, the first step has been to assess the trees near the exhibit. Since Monday, many of the trees around the red panda habitat have been trimmed but zoo staff still haven't located any branches that appear long enough for Rusty to have climbed out of his exhibit. Since being captured and returned to the zoo, Rusty has been in the veterinary hospital undergoing health evaluations. Zoo veterinarians plan to keep him there through the end of the week but say he is eating and drinking normally and will be ready to return to his exhibit soon. And he'll stay there -- as long as they can find a way to keep this escape artist from making another run for it.","Rusty the red panda got out of National Zoo's panda exhibit this week .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's been in the bull's eye of Republicans and conservatives since 2008, but after Wednesday's hearing on last September's terror attack in Benghazi, Libya, many on the right are shifting their aim at former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Soon after the hearing by the GOP-led House Oversight Committee looking into the events surrounding the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, a recently formed pro-Republican opposition research group blasted out an e-mail with the headline ""Benghazi Hearing Raises Serious Questions About Clinton."" America Rising PAC then followed up Thursday with a Web video which it says outlines ""the serious questions raised about Hillary Clinton's leadership yesterday in a House Oversight Committee hearing."" The Republican National Committee and American Crossroads, the Karl Rove-backed pro-GOP super PAC, also issued e-mails critical of Clinton, America's top diplomat at the time of the attack last September 11. The group put out a web video Friday morning that asks if Clinton ""was part of a coverup."" And Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a possible 2016 GOP White House contender, criticized Clinton in an interview on Thursday on Fox News Channel. Mother of Benghazi victim: I blame Hillary . Many Republicans see the deadly attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi and the initial reaction by the State Department and the White House as a huge scandal, one that they feel Democrats tried to cover up with the president's re-election, at the time, less than two months away. The GOP accuses the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack, of botching the response to it, and of misleading the public in its slow-to-evolve explanation of events. They point to five TV appearances the Sunday following the attack by Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who called the armed assault a ""spontaneous protest"" rather than an act of terrorism. Many Democrats disagree and call the GOP drumbeat a ""witch hunt."" While the president is definitely still in conservative's line of fire over Benghazi, 2016 politics are also at play in this story. Obama can't run for a third term and Clinton, who's weighing a White House run, would be the instant front-runner for the Democratic nomination if she launches a bid for president. Clinton stepped down as secretary of state with sky-high poll numbers, but the incident in Benghazi is a stain on her record at the State Department. The question is whether it could come back to haunt her if she does seek the presidency. Boehner calls for White House to release Benghazi emails . An independent review of the Benghazi incident, led by Adm. Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, discovered no wrongdoing by Clinton. But critics noted at the time that neither Mullen nor Pickering interviewed Clinton. Before she stepped down as planned in late January, Clinton testified for hours on Capitol Hill on the Benghazi attack. She was forceful in her defense and the conventional wisdom at the time was that she was not politically wounded. But the story was given new legs thanks to the House hearing, which showcased the testimony of State Department whistleblowers who had not previously testified, including the riveting details from an official who was on the ground in Tripoli at the time of the attack in Benghazi. Even before Wednesday's hearing, there was plenty of hype. Doomed Libya ambassador: 'We're under attack' ""I think the dam is about to break on Benghazi,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham wrote on his Facebook page. ""We're going to find a system failure before, during, and after the attacks. We're going to find political manipulation seven weeks before an election. We're going to find people asleep at the switch when it comes to the State Department, including Hillary Clinton,"" added the South Carolina Republican, who's been a longtime critic of the administration's role in Benghazi. But Clinton's specific role did not dominate the hearing, with only one GOP congressman on the panel trying to drill down for specifics. The question now is whether any smoking gun emerged from Wednesday's hearing regarding what Clinton knew and when she knew it. Republicans and Democrats obviously disagree on this question . ""I rather doubt the current right-wing demagoguery is going to hurt Hillary if she chooses to run,"" said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala, who was a top political adviser in Bill Clinton's White House. What the Obama administration has said about the Libya attack . Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos disagreed. ""It is increasingly looking like the only president named Clinton may be Bill,"" said Castellanos, who is spearheading a new super PAC called NewRepublican.org to refocus the party's messaging and policy goals.. One thing's for sure: Wednesday's hearing won't be the end of this story. Thursday morning House Speaker John Boehner called on the president to release emails that he says show how the White House wanted to change the Benghazi attack ""talking points."" Stay tuned.","After Wednesday's Benghazi hearing, many on the right are shifting their aim at Hillary Clinton .

"(CNN) -- In a spacious, sunlit apartment on the outskirts of Potsdam, Germany, eight roommates between the ages of 80 and 100 share a kitchen, a living room -- and 24-hour nursing care. Though all tenants suffer from dementia, these seniors aren't whiling away in a nursing home. In the open living area, complete with a flat-screen TV and photos of grandchildren on the wall, an elderly tenant draws, another arranges a flower bouquet, and a third runs a vacuum cleaner repeatedly over the same spot. ""It will never get clean,"" says Birgitta Neumann, 56, the founder and coordinator of the shared living arrangement, stepping over the vacuum cleaner cord snaking across the hallway. ""But it doesn't matter."" As part of a growing trend in Germany, what really matters is that elderly citizens stay out of institutionalized care. While graying populations affect Europe as a whole, Germany has one of the highest percentages of residents aged 65 or older in the world. A projected 4.5 million citizens—most of them seniors—will require costly long-term care by 2050, according to Federal Statistical Office data. In a recent public health insurance survey, however, about 82% of Germans say they do not want to grow old in a nursing home. In response, as of January 2013, a new law provides seniors with a maximum grant of €10,000 ($13,300) to establish a community apartment as well as a monthly subsidy of €200 ($266) per tenant. ""Since 2005, the number of people requiring long-term care has been rising, but the percentage of those living in nursing homes is decreasing,"" says Heinz Rothgang, a professor at the University of Bremen's Centre for Social Policy Research. ""Nursing homes are total institutions where patients lose their rights, but in alternative settings you can live in a familiar environment and your life is more meaningful."" While the first shared apartment for seniors appeared as a novelty in the mid-1990s, a recent boom means that almost 2,000 senior residents live in shared housing arrangements in Berlin alone, according to a Journal of Clinical Nursing study. And as the generation that witnessed the social revolutions of the 1960s grows older, the trend is gaining momentum. ""The image of aging is changing,"" says Henning Scherf, a sprightly septuagenarian and former mayor of the northern German city of Bremen. ""In the past it had to do with frailty and black clothes. Now there is everything, from traditional people to those who want to do things differently."" For more than two decades, Scherf, 74, and his wife have been sharing a large townhouse in the center of Bremen with seven other roommates between the ages of 17 and 79. While some of the tenants have changed over the years, the household now includes a couple of teachers, a retired priest, an engineer, a doctor and a student. ""The beauty of our home is that it's so colorful and different,"" says Scherf, author of ""Gray is Colorful,"" an autobiographical account of aging. ""We are a family through choice."" When it comes to choosing alternative housing arrangements in Germany, shared apartments aren't the only option. Across the country, multi-generational homes combine assisted living apartments for seniors with nursery schools and allow elderly tenants to remain in the neighborhoods they grew up in. ""We haven't built a nursing home in 10 years and we don't plan on building any,"" says Alexander Künzel, chief executive of the Bremer Heimstiftung, a foundation providing long-term care services. Instead, the foundation offers multigenerational residential buildings such as the Haus im Viertel, or House in the Neighborhood, where seniors can rent one of 85 apartments with round-the-clock assistance and a nursery school next door. ""There is an African saying that goes 'You need a whole village to raise a child,'"" Künzel says as children from the nursery school at the Haus im Viertel pour into the yard for recess. ""But I say that you need a whole neighborhood for an elderly person to live."" For Edith Teeg, 88, who moved into one of the apartments at the multigenerational home over a year ago, maintaining her freedom is crucial. She has since joined a theater group, takes a language class, and goes to the gym. ""I am completely independent,"" Teeg says. ""Here I am my own master."" Back at the shared apartment in Potsdam, the rigors of life in a nursing home are also nowhere to be seen. The elderly tenants are free to go to bed and get up when they choose. Relatives and grandchildren often spend the night in the apartment's guest room. Most of all, the residents keep busy and feel useful helping out with household chores or working on art projects. As lunchtime approaches, the day-time nurse prepares a dish of sweet-and-sour eggs, a reminder of childhood cuisine many of her patients are familiar with. The tenants shuffle over to the dining room table. ""It's all very normal here,"" says Neumann, who oversees the daily running of the apartment. ""Just like at home.""","Eight German citizens aged between 80 and 100 share an apartment together .

"(CNN) -- When Pakistanis go to the polls on Saturday they will be electing key players battling to govern one of the world's most complicated countries. From corruption, claims of international interference, terrorism and religious extremism to overpopulation, inflation, poverty and unemployment, Pakistan has been famously dubbed by some as the world's most unstable nuclear power. For much of its 66-year existence, the nation of 193 million people has been ruled by a military government. But this year's election is being hailed as one of the most democratic to date. According to the Election Commission of Pakistan, there will be 36 million new voters among the 86 million registered to vote and more than double the number of candidates (161 up from 64 that contested the 2008 poll) will be women, according to U.N. Women. ""There's a new hope for the country and I hope that this will change the situation in Pakistan; voting this time will make a difference,"" one Pakistani woman told CNN's Saima Mohsin. First full term . While the governing Pakistan People's Party (PPP) became the first civilian government to complete a full five-year term -- the three governments following the death in 1988 of military strongman Zia ul-Haq were all brought down by the army -- its legacy is a deeply fractured country with a faltering economy. Violence in Pakistan's tribal regions remains a key challenge for the country. Since April, the Taliban in Pakistan has killed dozens of people in attacks on the three main political parties. Many urban voters and parties regard resurgent fundamentalism as one of the biggest threats to Pakistan. The PPP, however, is hoping to gain a second term led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated former Prime Minister, and party leader, Benazir Bhutto. While, at 24, he is too young to become prime minister in a country where the minimum age to hold the office is 25, Bhutto Zardari -- as part of the Bhutto political dynasty -- is regarded as a key PPP asset. Top challenger . The PPP's main opposition comes from the Pakistan Muslim League-N, led by one of the country's leading industrialists and richest men, Nawaz Sharif. He has been prime minister twice before and was overthrown in a coup and exiled when General Pervez Musharraf seized power in 1999. Viewed as a religious conservative, his party, Pakistan's second largest, believes it would have won elections in 2008 had the assassination of Bhutto not given a massive boost to the ruling PPP. Following closely behind is Pakistan's third force Imran Khan, the former star cricketer and heartthrob who leads the Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) party. While he has struggled to turn his celebrity status into votes, analysts say he remains popular with Pakistan's urban middle class who support his call to end drone strikes in the country's restive tribal regions and his pledge to sweep away rampant corruption by ending foreign aid. His party boycotted the 2008 elections, calling Musharraf a dictator. Musharraf's party admitted defeat in those elections and he was succeeded by the PPP's Asif Zardari, Bhutto's widower. Now in 2013, with the PPP fighting to win a second term, this is likely to be the first real electoral test for Khan's movement, which is seen by many analysts as having wide appeal for Pakistan's millions of new voters. Khan on Tuesday was rushed to hospital with spinal fractures and a head injury after falling off an improvised platform attached to a forklift truck during one of the final rallies of his campaign. Analysts say that while his party is unlikely to form a government, the accident is likely to boost his standing in the polls. Return of Musharraf . Conspicuous by his absence in the 2013 poll is Musharraf, who returned from four years of self-imposed exile in March to take part in the elections, but has been banned by a court from taking part in politics. His party, the All Pakistan Muslim League (APML), has announced a boycott. Secular and liberal parties such as the Awami National Party (ANP) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), meanwhile, have borne the brunt of Pakistan Taliban attacks in the run-up to the elections. Offices of the major secular parties have been bombed by the Taliban and its leaders assassinated, making open campaigning all but impossible for those parties. As a measure of the danger of Pakistani politics, Bhutto Zardari will not be present for the May 11 poll due to security threats, according to Pakistan's Dawn newspaper. Attacks by the Pakistani Taliban have been particularly virulent in the election campaign -- the first time Pakistan will experience a civilian-to-civilian transfer of power -- not only targeting secular and independent parties but even attacking a rally held by a right-wing religious party that's normally sympathetic to the militant movement. At least 18 people were killed in the blast on Monday at the rally organized by the Jamiat Ulema-E-Islam (JUI) party. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that one of the party's candidates had handed over members of the mujahedeen to the U.S. Like many Pakistanis that have endured years of bloodshed and unrest, the party has vowed to continue campaigning despite the violence.","Pakistanis go to polls Saturday to elect key players in world's most complex region .

"(CNN) -- Affirmative action. Voting rights. Same-sex marriage. The Supreme Court is about to rule on some of the most contentious issues in American society -- issues that have divided Americans for years. ""These are critical decisions,"" said Ron Brownstein, a CNN political analyst. They affect ""the future of our social relations, our workplace, our educational opportunity."" The rulings could come as early as Monday. At the latest, they're expected by the end of the month. Learn about the big cases . The big cases include: . Affirmative action . The case: Student Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas, saying she was rejected partly because she is white. The school defended its policy of considering race as one of many factors. See selected quotes from the arguments here . The Defense of Marriage Act . The case: The key plaintiff, Edith Windsor, sued the federal government after the death of her longtime female partner, saying she faced an estate bill much larger than those heterosexual married partners have to pay. Windsor married Thea Clara Spyer in 2007 in Toronto. By the time Spyer died in 2009, New York, where they lived, recognized that marriage. Under DOMA, the federal government does not. California's Proposition 8 . The case: California, through Proposition 8 on a statewide ballot, banned same-sex marriage. A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that unconstitutional. Now, the Supreme Court's nine justices could fundamentally alter how American law treats marriage. The Voting Rights Act . The case: The 1965 law gives federal authorities open-ended oversight of states and localities that have a history of voter discrimination. After the provision was reauthorized by Congress in 2006 for another 25 years, counties in Alabama and North Carolina filed suit, saying the monitoring was burdensome and unwarranted.","The Supreme Court will rule on several critical cases .

"(CNN) -- In the film ""Groundhog Day,"" Bill Murray has to live through the exact same day thousands of times. In this administration, most Americans can be forgiven for feeling as though they've lived through the same economic speech from President Obama nearly as many times. Given the extraordinary setting of a joint session of Congress, one has to question the notion of scheduling a rerun against the first-run debates taking place among Republican challengers to this president. The speech itself was almost literally a retread of the 2009 stimulus plan Obama pushed through a friendly Congress with almost no Republican support, with one important difference: The president never mentioned the cost of his proposal. He demanded that Congress pass his bill immediately more than a dozen times during the speech, but not once did he inform Congress of its price tag. Even worse, Obama ended up reneging on a claim made by the White House earlier this week that the bill would be entirely funded from current dollars. In the speech itself, Obama insisted that ""everything in this bill will be paid for. Everything."" But then Obama told Congress that while their so-called super committee meets to hash out an agreement on cutting $1.5 trillion from future spending as part of the deficit-ceiling agreement last month, they could make more cuts to cover the cost of his new bill -- again, without telling them exactly what those costs would be. That's akin to taking a friend out for a big birthday dinner and informing him at the end that he'll have to find the money to pay the bill. The White House insisted that it would pull those numbers together in a week to ten days. But the jobs crisis has gone on for years. While Obama was on vacation, he was telling the media that it was his single highest priority. The White House actually wanted to make this speech yesterday. And they did so without having scored their own proposal? It isn't as if Obama had promised anything new. The ""plan"" -- which still has not been released -- consists of getting money to states to supposedly save the jobs of teachers and first responders, accelerating public-works projects, extending the payroll tax cut put into place in the December tax deal, and extending jobless benefits for at least another year. In case readers have forgotten, that's what Obama called for in the 2009 jobs plan in the stimulus package. At the time, Obama promised that by spending over $800 billion in borrowed money, we would keep unemployment below 8%. Had that approach worked, Obama wouldn't have had to make a speech at all yesterday. His need to offer a Groundhog Day moment asking for a rerun of the stimulus blank check reveals just how badly his economic policies have failed -- and just how bereft this administration is of any new ideas to replace them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Morrissey.","Edward Morrissey says Obama jobs speech reminded him of film ""Groundhog Day""

"Mariposa, California (CNN) -- More than 2,000 firefighters rushed Tuesday to save hundreds of homes near Yosemite National Park, which are threatened by a blaze alarming for its size, speed and the fact it's striking so early in California's wildfire season. The Carstens Fire ""is exhibiting extreme behavior to include fire whirls and strong adverse winds,"" reported California's Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, which is known as CalFire. That has left many in the affected area on edge, including some told to grab whatever they can from their home and get to safety. Orlando Vigil is one of them, telling CNN affiliate KGPE that it's been stressful for animals he took from his property to the Mariposa County Fairgrounds. They're safe now, but he's not so sure about his home. ""We'll see if there's anything when when we get back,"" Vigil said. Summer wildfires are nothing new in California. But this one is happening weeks earlier than normal, and comes as parts of the state experience ""exceptional"" dryness that could fuel flames. ""We usually see this sort of fire behavior in August. This is June,"" said Gary Wuchner, fire spokesman for Yosemite National Park. ""It's making us nervous."" The Carstens Wildfire was first spotted Sunday afternoon, after embers from a campfire that hadn't been totally put out spread into surrounding forest. By Tuesday night, it had burned nearly 1,900 acres, of which 40% was considered contained, according to CalFire. Some 2,200 fire personnel were working the scene, using 53 engines, 11 water tenders. eight bulldozers and other equipment. At least 800 structures are imperiled by the blaze, with some residents taking up shelter at Mariposa Elementary School. Red Cross officials are there with food, medical help and other basics. ""We also have a mental health worker to help those that are overstressed emotionally from the ordeal of being uprooted from their home,"" Cindy Thomas of the Red Cross told KGPE. Not everyone is heeding the calls to evacuate, however. Among them is Paul ""Bear"" Vasquez. More than 37 million people have viewed his YouTube video showing him becoming overjoyed and then breaking down at the site of a vibrant double rainbow over a mountain in 2010. Today, that mountain is singed by the Carstens Fire. But Vasquez says he's staying on the property he bought in 1998, hacking out of the wilderness a spot for the home where he's raised his children. ""I am the protector of this land,"" he said. ""I am part of this place. It has magical powers and I can't leave.""

"London (CNN) -- The families of three British soldiers killed in Iraq can sue the Ministry of Defence for negligence over their deaths, the UK's highest court ruled Wednesday. The Supreme Court ruling represents a defeat for the Ministry of Defence, which had filed a challenge to an earlier Appeal Court judgment. The legal firm representing some of the claimants, Leigh Day, said the ruling would force the ministry to recognize ""that it owes a duty of care to provide adequate equipment to service personnel engaged in military operations."" The claimants it represents include the widow of Cpl. Stephen Allbutt, who was killed when the Challenger II tank he was in came under fire from another British Challenger II tank on the fourth day of the Iraq war in 2003. Leigh Day also represents Cpl. Dan Twiddy and Trooper Andy Julien, who suffered severe injuries in the incident. They are known as the ""Challenger claimants"" for the tank in which they were traveling. A separate group of claimants are the relatives of Pvt. Phillip Hewett and Pvt. Lee Ellis, who were killed in separate incidents in 2005 and 2006 when lightly armored Snatch Land Rovers hit roadside bombs. The vehicles were not fully equipped to detect roadside bombs or protect soldiers from a blast, the court heard. The claimants' negligence claim is based on the argument that the soldiers were not properly trained or equipped by the Ministry of Defence for their deployment in Iraq. In the case of the Challenger group, the claimants argue that the ministry failed to equip the Challenger tanks with technology that would have confirmed their identity as friend or foe, and failed to provide the soldiers with ""adequate recognition training"" before they were deployed or in the combat theater. In the claim involving the Snatch Land Rovers, the claimants say the ministry breached European human rights law because it failed to take measures that it ""might have been expected to take in the light of the real and immediate risk to life of soldiers who were required to patrol in Snatch Land Rovers,"" according to the court ruling. The Ministry of Defence argued that no duty of care was owed to the claimants by virtue of ""combat immunity,"" because their deaths and injuries were suffered on the battlefield. But the Supreme Court dismissed that argument, on the grounds that decisions about the provision of equipment and training are made far from the battlefield. Lord Hope, delivering the majority judgment, said: ""The Challenger claims are about alleged failures in training, including pre-deployment and in-theater training, and the provision of technology and equipment. They are directed to things that the claimants say should have been done long before the soldiers crossed the start line at the commencement of hostilities."" Lawyer Shubhaa Srinivasan, of Leigh Day, said they were ""extremely pleased"" with the decision. ""The highest court in the land has now ruled the MoD, as employer, must accept that it owes a duty of care to properly equip service personnel who go to war,"" she said. The ministry's position is ""morally and legally indefensible,"" she said, adding that some soldiers had felt compelled to buy their own GPS devices and other tracking equipment to try to ensure their safety and that of fellow servicemen. UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was concerned about the wider implications of the judgment, ""which could ultimately make it more difficult for our troops to carry out operations and potentially throws open a wide range of military decisions to the uncertainty of litigation."" But, he said, his thoughts remained with those who were injured and the families of those who died. ""The most important priority is the protection of our troops, and since this litigation started, a wide range of protected vehicles, including Mastiff, Ridgeback, Husky, Wolfhound, Jackal and Foxhound, have been available to commanders to match the most appropriate available vehicle to specific tasks,"" he added. According to the Ministry of Defence, the court acknowledged that the uncertainties of war have to be recognized and that the work of the armed forces should not be impeded by the threat of legal action. One of the judges, in a dissenting judgment, warned that the ruling would make extensive litigation against the British armed forces almost inevitable.

"(CNN) -- Big cities are rarely home to thriving farmlands, but a group of Dutch architects hope to change that with the ""Park Supermarket"" -- an urban farming project that will attempt to grow and sell all the food of a modern supermarket in one place. The firm behind the proposal, Rotterdam-based Van Bergen Kolpa Architects, intends to produce everything from risotto rice, to kiwis to Tilapia fish all on one 4,000-acre plot of disused land in Randstad, Holland's largest metropolitan area. In defiance of the country's moderate climate, the architects say they have devised a system to control the park's outdoor environment, using old and new farming technologies to simulate Mediterranean and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way. The land, which had been earmarked for a large block of business developments before the global recession, cuts across the city fringes of Rotterdam and The Hague, serving a potential customer-base of over one million people, according to Van Bergen Kolpa Architects. ""The cities surrounding the proposed site are home to 170 different eating cultures -- from Moroccan to Indonesian, from Turkish to Chinese -- and we're aiming to grow food to satisfy all their tastes,"" said Jago van Bergen, an award-winning architect and one of the brains behind the ""Park Supermarket"" -- which has been shortlisted for the upcoming World Architecture Awards in November. ""The plan is to divide the park into three climate zones -- moderate, Mediterranean and tropical. Because this will also be a recreational space, our goal is to make it as open as possible, without using greenhouses,"" he said. But how exactly do you create a warm outdoor microclimate on the urban fringes of a north European city? According to van Bergen, it's not as far-fetched or futuristic as it sounds. ""The main differences between a Mediterranean and moderate climate are longer periods of light and warmth in the evening, "" he explained. ""To make up this difference we'll use a combination of traditional and modern farming methods that all work by trapping and storing heat and releasing it when temperatures drop,"" So, in an effort to grow typically Mediterranean foods like olives and peppers, for instance, van Bergen says he'll need little more than rows of ""snake walls"" and ""climate pylons."" According to van Bergen, ""snake walls"", made from clay, curve over crops helping to shield them from cold winds, while simultaneously emitting heat absorbed during the day. ""They used this method in the 18th century gardens of eastern Germany's Potsdam, so the king could grow grapes to make wine that tasted as good as the French stuff,"" he said. ""Climate pylons"" are a more modern method of trapping heat. Van Bergen says they simply rain down a fine mist of water from high up, creating clouds that act like vapor roofs, stopping warm air from disappearing into the sky. However, for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice, van Bergen says the park will need another layer of warmth. ""In this case, we'll pump geothermal energy -- heat stored deep in the lower soils -- up to the top using underground pipes filled with water,"" he explained. ""This technology is used in football stadiums to stop the pitches freezing over and more recently it's being used to heat homes."" Van Bergen concedes that the pumps and electric-powered lights that artificially extend daylight hours will require an additional input of energy, but claims that it will all be met by local renewable sources. Read related: 'Living' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions . The Park Supermarket was commissioned by planning officials from the South Holland Province, and plans are afoot for a small test site to be up and running by the end of this year. If successful, the firm believes this type of system could form part of a new approach to sustainable farming, making use of urban greenbelts while helping to reduce the carbon footprint associated with food production -- which accounts for up to 30% of total emissions worldwide, according to a 2008 Greenpeace report. ""The dominant food-production system is based on fossil fuel at every level,"" said Dr Martin Caraher, professor of food and health policy at London's City University. ""It needs oil to make the fertilizer, oil for the farm, oil for the food processing, oil for the packaging and oil to transport it to the shops,"" he added. Van Bergen says the park will reduce carbon emissions by cutting down on food processing and transport costs, while stimulating local industry and social bonds. ""Because all the food in our supermarket will be grown on site we won't need a big processing factory to make packaging and we won't have to burn lots of fossil fuel to transport it across the globe,"" he said. However, the Park Supermarket concept does not appeal to everyone. ""Anything that reduces food miles and other carbon emissions linked to food production is normally a positive thing,"" said Dr Nicola Canon, lecturer in crop sciences at the UK's Royal Agricultural College. ""However, I have reservations about any system that creates open artificial climates. ""We know that we are suffering from climate change, with one area enduring long wet spells while another goes through a prolonged drought. I wonder if we really ought to be exploring technologies that seek to control our already unpredictable weather cycles."" Canon is also concerned that the introduction of alien climates may also precipitate the introduction of alien pests. ""Every time you raise humidity, you raise disease affectability -- because where you have good conditions for growth you also have good conditions for disease to grow. I think creating tropical climates next to moderate ones could introduce a host of new diseases and pests to the region in quite an unpredictable way,"" she warned. Finally, while Canon says she appreciates what van Bergen and his team are trying to do, she doubts that the system could be replicated on a wider scale. ""In my experience, it takes a lot of resources to create a relatively small microclimate. This means land that could otherwise be used for growing native crops is taken up with technology -- whether it be rows and rows of snake walls or climate pylons or whatever,"" she said. For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production. ""I'm not a preacher of any one form of agriculture,"" he said. ""Just like our energy, I think our future food supplies will have to come from a variety of sources, using a variety of methods -- of which we are sure this will be one. ""But this is about more than sustainable, non-intensive farming, it's about cultivating community ties and giving new meaning to a space on the edge of the city that is currently being used for very little else.""","Concept designed to produce all food of a modern supermarket on one plot of land .

"(CNN) -- Suburban New York mom Andrea Sanderlin, accused of running a massive marijuana operation from a warehouse in Queens, was released on $500,000 bail Monday after four acquaintances came to her aid. Four people -- two of them claiming to be friends of the father of Sanderlin's 3-year-old daughter and two claiming they last saw Sanderlin at a social gathering -- contributed to the hefty bail. Because of the unusual relationship between these people and Sanderlin, Judge Steven Gold said he was going to require signatures from Sanderlin's mother and stepfather in Virginia, as well as her daughter's grandmother, saying they approved of the posting before she was released. Video from CNN affiliate WABC showed Sanderlin leaving court late Monday afternoon. Sanderlin had been arraigned last week and pleaded not guilty to charges of manufacturing and possessing a controlled substance with intent to distribute, and maintaining a place for manufacturing a controlled substance. Eariler this year, police said they followed Sanderlin, 45, to a warehouse in Queens that was registered in her name. They found two rooms packed with more than 1,000 marijuana plants and large amounts of dried marijuana, along with state-of-the-art lighting, irrigation and ventilation systems to facilitate hydroponic growing, according to court documents. Sanderlin's next court appearance is scheduled for July 15. ""She's entitled to the presumption of innocence and of all other constitutional protections that should be afforded to her,"" Sanderlin's attorney, Corey Winograd, said. He said after Sanderlin's arraignment last week that the mother of three was looking forward to getting back to her 3-year-old daughter and other children. Brian Crowell, special agent in charge at the Drug Enforcement Administration, described the case against Sanderlin in a June statement. ""The warehouse was filled with over $3 million worth of hydroponic marijuana, and the organization covertly produced 3,000 marijuana plants,"" he said. When agents raided Sanderlin's home on May 20, they found books on how to grow marijuana and how to launder money, according to the DEA. Details of the case were first reported by The Smoking Gun website. Originally from Virginia, Sanderlin was living in the upscale neighborhood of Scarsdale and driving regularly to Queens, according to court documents. Authorities said a confidential witness tipped them off. The witness, who has been charged with participating in a conspiracy to possess and distribute marijuana, told investigators in April that a person named ""Andi"" operated at least one marijuana-growing house in Brooklyn or Queens, according to court documents. The witness later identified Sanderlin as ""Andi."" Luisa Navarro and Brittany Brady contributed to this report.","Andrea Sanderlin is accused of running a pot-growing warehouse .

"(CNN) -- The pastor of a Maryville, Illinois, church was shot to death during a service Sunday in front of horrified church members who then tackled the gunman, state police said. The Web site for the First Baptist Church of Maryville, Illinois, includes a photo of the Rev. Fred Winters. Fred Winters, the pastor of the First Baptist Church, was shot and killed during the 8 a.m. service, and the attacker and two church members suffered knife wounds in the attack, authorities said. The gunman entered during the service and walked up to the pulpit. Winters and the gunman apparently exchanged words before the 27-year-old man fired four shots, hitting the pastor's Bible and then the pastor, said Illinois State Police Director Larry Trent. ""The only thing we know is that the suspect said something to the pastor, and the pastor said something back to him -- we don't know what that was,"" Trent told reporters Sunday afternoon. ""It was almost as if the pastor may have recognized him, but we're not sure about that at all."" The gunman's .45-caliber pistol jammed after he shot Winters, Trent said. The man then pulled out a knife before being tackled by some of about 150 worshippers attending the service in southern Illinois, near St. Louis, Missouri.  Watch the aftermath of the church shooting » . Earlier reports from authorities said the man may have turned the knife on himself, but Trent said that was not confirmed. ""When he was tackled by two of the members, we don't know whether he fell on the knife, injuring himself at the time, or whether [his injury] was self-inflicted during the struggle,"" Trent said. Two of those who went after the attacker suffered injuries that aren't life-threatening, while the suspect's injuries are ""very serious,"" Illinois state police spokesman Ralph Timmins said. Witness Claudia Bohley told CNN affiliate KSDK-TV in St. Louis that she was in the church's foyer waiting for the service to begin when she heard ""pop, pop, pop. ... We just couldn't imagine what had happened."" She said she ran into the sanctuary and saw what looked like paper scattered on the pulpit. She said she was later told that a bullet hit Winters' Bible. ""It was like confetti. It went everywhere,"" she said. ""People were down on their knees and on the floor, screaming and praying."" She described Winters -- who is pictured on the church's Web site along with his wife and two children -- as ""such a pleasant pastor."" Trent said police are still trying to determine a motive in the shooting and that church members did not recognize the gunman. St. Louis University Hospital spokeswoman Laura Keller told CNN three males, including the suspect, were brought to the hospital. One was dead on arrival, she said, but the hospital was not releasing names and ages. She said the second was in an operating room and the third was the suspect, whose condition was not immediately available. Trent said one of two wounded church members was treated and released. Trent called the actions of the two wounded church members ""heroic,"" saying they took quick action when others ""were understandably stuck to their seats."" Phone calls to the church office went unanswered Sunday. A posting on the church's Web site said a prayer vigil would be held at 6 p.m. at Metro Community Church in Edwardsville, Illinois, about six miles north of Maryville. First Baptist Church is fairly large, with about 1,000 members, KSDK reported. The church holds four Sunday services. Timmins said many of the people attending the service remained for hours afterward, as police were conducting interviews. The Illinois shooting is believed to be the nation's first in a church since July, when a 58-year-old man opened fire in a Knoxville, Tennessee, church during a children's play. Two people were killed and six wounded in that shooting at Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church. In the Tennessee case, Jim Adkisson told police he targeted the church because of its ""liberal teachings,"" according to court papers. Adkisson pleaded guilty last month in a deal that allowed him to avoid the death penalty and will face life in prison without parole, court officials said. Police said the Maryville congregation had a plan in place, including a protocol for lockdown, in the event of an incident such as Sunday's attack.","Church members tackle gunman after shooting, police say .

"(CNN) -- The infamous ""Onion Field"" cop killer whose 1963 crime was chronicled in a best-selling book and a movie has died, officials said Monday. He was 79. Gregory Powell died Sunday at the California Medical Facility, a prison in Vacaville, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. In October, Powell was denied compassionate release, all but guaranteeing he would die behind bars. He had cancer, according to the Los Angeles Police Protective League. Prison officials, however, never confirmed that account and Monday's statement said simply that Powell died of ""natural causes."" He was serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole for killing Los Angeles Police Officer Ian Campbell nearly 50 years ago. The crime was chronicled in Joseph Wambaugh's best-selling book, ""The Onion Field"" and a movie by the same name. On the night of March 9, 1963, Powell and accomplice Jimmy Lee Smith were driving around Los Angeles, looking for a liquor store to rob. Campbell and his partner, Officer Karl Hettinger, pulled the two over in a routine stop. Powell, who was ordered out of the car, pointed a gun at Campbell's head. He and Smith disarmed both officers, took them hostage and drove to a remote onion field in Bakersfield, a town about 110 miles of north of downtown Los Angeles. The officers were forced out of the car and ordered to stand with their hands above their heads. Powell said to them, ""We told you we were going to let you guys go, but have you ever heard of the Little Lindbergh Law?"" ""Yes,"" Campbell, 31, replied. Powell then shot him to death. Hettinger escaped, but the murder of his partner haunted him for the rest of his life. Powell and Smith were sentenced to death in November 1963. Their sentences were commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole in the early 1970s when the death penalty was declared unconstitutional. Smith was paroled in 1982, but was in and out of prison in subsequent years for drug-related parole violations. He died at a California detention center in 2007. The Little Lindbergh Law makes a kidnapping within the state a capital offense if the victim suffers death or other injury. Powell, however, erroneously believed the law made it a capital offense to kidnap a police officer. The Little Lindbergh Law followed a federal law, nicknamed the Lindbergh Law, that made taking a kidnapped person across state lines a federal crime. That law was passed after the kidnapping and murder of the young son of aviator Charles Lindbergh in 1932. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Gregory Powell was 79 .

"(CNN) -- Roberto Mancini's sacking as Manchester City manager came as no surprise to Mario Balotelli. A year to the day after winning City's first championship in nearly half a century, Mancini was sacked by the club's Abu Dhabi owners on Monday. The 48-year-old Mancini's dismissal followed City's shock FA Cup defeat by Wigan on Saturday and their inability to defend their English Premier League title as rivals Manchester United ran away with the league this season. AC Milan striker Balotelli -- who played a part in City's Premier League title success as City finished top for the first time in 44 years last season -- endured a love-hate relationship with his former manager before his move to Italy. ""I am not really surprised,"" Balotelli, who joined Milan in a $30 million transfer in January, told CNN. ""When I was with him he was a great manager and we had the best, I think, one of the best teams I have played with."" After Mancini's sacking, City's former kit man Stephen Aziz, described the Italian as ""arrogant, vain and self-centred"" in one of a series of tweets that were later deleted from his Twitter account on Tuesday. And Balotelli hinted at difficulties within the City squad. ""I don't know why they didn't win. But obviously there were some problems inside - I don't know. I am here so I don't know."" The striker left City in January as he returned to Serie A following a training ground bust-up with Mancini -- an incident that was caught by photographers and received prominent media coverage. It was the final episode in a tempestuous partnership with Mancini first having given Balotelli his big break as a raw, but talented 16-year-old at Inter Milan. Jose Mourinho described Balotelli as ""unmanageable"" during his time as Inter coach, but Mancini was more willing to forgive the talented striker's misdemeanors. At times Balotelli endured a troubled time at City, crashing his car on the way to training just days after signing in August 2010, while he was also reprimanded for throwing a dart at a youth team player the following March. In October 2011, Balotelli was forced to call the emergency services to his home after a firework was set off in his bathroom, leading to a fire. The next day he helped City defeat Manchester United win 6-1 at their rival's Old Trafford stadium before revealing a t-shirt emblazoned with the words, ""Why always me?"" Just weeks before their infamous coming together on January 3, Mancini had spoken of his love and admiration for a man who he considered to be a son. ""I love Mario because for many years we have worked and lived together,"" he told the British media in January. ""I've seen him grow. But the professional relationship is another thing and I've told Mario what I need from him.""","Mario Balotelli not surprised by Roberto Mancini's sacking by Manchester City owners .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Interpol is chasing more than 200 leads on the potential identity of a pedophile suspected of molesting young boys, just one day after launching a global manhunt. Interpol has launched a global appeal to find this man, accused of abusing young boys. The organization, which facilitates global cooperation among police agencies, said its Web site logged 30 times more visitors than in an average day after it made its plea for the public's help Tuesday. Interpol is trying to locate a man who is pictured sexually abusing young boys in hundreds of images on the Internet. ""'The public's response has been very positive,"" said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpol's Trafficking in Human Beings unit, in a news release. ""The smallest piece of information from anywhere in the world could be crucial in identifying this man."" The man is featured in 100 photographs sexually abusing at least three boys between the ages of six and 10, Interpol said. The organization posted six pictures of the suspect on its Web site. The pictures came to light in 2006, when Norwegian authorities discovered them in the possession of a man they arrested.  Watch a report on Interpol's man-hunt » . ""While these images were only discovered two years ago, we believe the photographs were taken between April 2000 and May 2001, so clearly this man will be older than he appears in the pictures,"" said Kvigne. Last October, Interpol disseminated pictures of another man whose face appeared in more than 200 images of sex acts with children. It dubbed its operation Vico, because the images were thought to have been taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. Ten days later, Christopher Paul Neil -- a 32-year-old Canadian man who had been working as an English-language teacher in South Korea -- was arrested in Thailand and charged with child abuse. Following the success of that operation, the organization's general assembly approved a resolution allowing Interpol to seek public help in child sex abuse investigations.","NEW: Interpol chasing 200 new leads in global manhunt for serial pedophile .

"Washington (CNN) -- If you commute using one of the 10 most clogged highways in the United States, you could ride a bicycle to work faster than you could drive, according to a new study that evaluates the countless hours drivers waste in gridlock on roadways each year. By using GPS-equipped vehicles to record commuting experiences on the nation's roads, analysts studied traffic from a database containing approximately 100 million vehicles including taxis, airport shuttles, service delivery vans, long haul trucks and passenger cars in 2011. A 13-mile stretch of the San Diego Freeway outside Los Angeles ranked as the most traffic-choked freeway in the nation. But drivers in Honolulu spent the most time in traffic, averaging 58 hours a year stuck in stop-and-go traffic. Researchers found urban areas are actually seeing traffic congestion decrease at a significant rate nationwide for the first time since 2008. Seventy of the country's Top 100 most populated cities showed a drop in traffic congestion last year. The study was commissioned by INRIX, a software company based in Kirkland, Washington, that provides traffic- and driver-related mobile apps and online services. Among the study's findings: . -- Overall, there was a 30% drop in traffic congestion nationwide, but it came with a cost. Due in part to weak employment conditions and higher fuel prices, there are fewer drivers heading to the office, and those who do drive are driving less, the study found. -- Last year, only 890,000 of the 2.6 million new jobs were in urban areas, according to the research. -- In cities such as Tampa, Houston and Austin, Texas, research showed improved jobless numbers led to busier roadways. -- Eight of the 10 worst stretches of road for average travel time and delays were in New York or Los Angeles. -- On average, Americans spend around 40 hours per year behind the wheel in commuter bottlenecks. -- Both the best and worst weekday times to be on the road occur on Fridays. Between 6 and 7 in the morning is the best commute time; 5-6 p.m. is the pits. -- The worst morning commute is on Tuesday. So when's the best time to be on the road? The research says Monday. ""People tend to take a little more time getting to the office"" on Mondays, said INRIX communications chief Jim Bak. ""Also, when people take a long three-day weekend, it's often on Monday,"" The 10 cities with the worst commutes, including hours spent in gridlocked traffic and worst 15-minute traffic intervals, were: . -- Honolulu: 58 hours; 5:15-5:30 p.m. Tuesday. -- Los Angeles: 56 hours; 5:45-6 p.m. Thursday. -- San Francisco: 48 hours; 5:45-6 p.m. Thursday. -- New York: 57 hours; 5:30-5:45 p.m. Friday. -- Bridgeport, Connecticut: 42 hours; 5:30-5:45 p.m. Friday. -- Washington: 45 hours; 5:45-6 p.m. Thursday. -- Seattle: 33 hours; 5:30-5:45 p.m. Thursday. -- Austin, Texas: 30 hours; 5:30-5:45 p.m. Thursday. -- Boston: 35 hours; 5:30-5:45 p.m. Thursday. -- Chicago: 36 hours; 5:30-5:45 p.m. Thursday. Top 10 worst stretches of highway in the nation in 2011 for daily commutes were: . 1. Los Angeles: A 13-mile stretch of San Diego Freeway/I-405 North from I-105/Imperial Highway Interchange through the Getty Center Drive Exit, which takes 33 minutes on average with 20 minutes of delay. 2.

"(CNN) -- It was an emotional night for Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed as Mikael Barzalona rode Monterosso to victory in the Dubai World Cup, the world's richest race, beating his stablemate Capponi by an impressive margin. But the result was somewhat overshadowed by the death of another Godolphin horse, Fox Hunt, in the inaugural Dubai Gold Cup, held earlier in the evening. The Mahmood Al Zarooni-trained stayer appeared to break his leg approximately 300 meters into the race, pitching his jockey, Silvestre de Sousa, to the ground in front of a packed Meydan grandstand. It was immediately clear the injury was serious as veterinarians rushed on to the track to attend the stricken Fox Hunt. However, when it became clear they would not be able to move him out of the way in time for the second lap of the race, the race was stopped and the remaining jockeys gradually pulled their horses up. Fox Hunt was euthanized, while De Sousa fortunately escaped uninjured after his high speed fall. The Gold Cup was eventually re-run at the end of the day's card, when it was won by Frankie Dettori on Opinion Poll, but two horses failed to finish. Barzalona pulled up his mount Grand Vent and Bronze Cannon suffered a similar fate on the hard ground. There had been more to celebrate in the World Cup itself, Barzalona cementing his reputation for exuberance by rising in his stirrups in celebration well before the finish line, echoing his win in last year's English Derby. Godolphin's Al Zarooni had saddled both Monterosso and Capponi, and told CNN he felt ""incredible"" about the result in only his second full season with Godolphin, Sheikh Mohammed's vast racing operation. Sheikh Mohammed himself, speaking exclusively to CNN after the race, said he felt ""doubly happy"" with the result, which saw the World Cup return to Godolphin hands after a six-year absence. ""We haven't won this race for a few years so to win it really it's great, great feeling,"" he said .

"(CNN) -- It would be easy to dismiss Friday's election of Hassan Rouhani as president of Iran as little more than a sham -- a rigged election that changes nothing. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei still calls the shots in Tehran. The election won't stop Iran's nuclear program or end Iran's years of enmity with Israel or the United States. Nor will it reverse Iran's support for Syria's brutal regime. It would be easy to shrug off the election, like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has effectively done. But it would be wrong. While the election did not change Iran's real power structure and was not an exercise in democracy -- the theocratic backroom bosses blocked more than 700 aspiring candidates from the ballots -- it has already changed the calculus of the Middle East in a number of important, if subtle, ways. It was not a political sea-change as much as a shift in tone and optics. But such a shift may have very significant consequences. Perhaps most importantly, the election has enabled Iran to shrug off President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ahmadinejad, who combined the hateful ignorance of being a Holocaust denier with the governing incompetence that has left his country in an economic shambles, will not be missed. Indeed, this week began with reports that the outgoing president is now facing criminal charges in his own country where his popularity, thanks largely to rampant inflation and high unemployment, is at rock bottom. Instead of Mahmoud the Mockable, Iran has in an instant bought itself greater credibility and a moment to demonstrate whether real change there is possible. While the election denied the people the real choice they deserved, voters sent an unmistakable message with the strong first-ballot victory they gave Dr. Rouhani, a former Iranian nuclear negotiator known for his pragmatic streak. They rejected six other more hard-line candidates, including those who were seen to be favored by Khamenei. The election has reminded the world that the Iranian people are not easily reduced to a simplistic identity as members of ""the axis of evil."" The country has a diverse populous with a rich history of intense national debate, despite decades of autocratic rule. When the West propped up a corrupt and abusive Shah, an Islamic revolution was the result. More recently, as the Islamic leadership has caused great hardship in Iran, we have seen the stirrings of opposition that arose most dramatically in the Green Revolution that followed Ahmadinejad's re-election in 2009. The government is oppressively heavy-handed, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and actively trying to spread its influence throughout the Middle East, but, the election reminded us the people of Iran contain many views, some of which, despite the best efforts of the regime, remain very close to the surface. In his first press conference, Rouhani espoused views that suggested that he would seek to moderate Iran's international stance. While strongly defending the country's right to its nuclear program, he underscored a desire to ""enhance mutual trust"" with the rest of the world. He spoke of enhancing the ""transparency"" of the nuclear program and specifically of seeking better relations with neighbors in the Persian Gulf region. And, not surprisingly, he focused on doing what he could to fix the spluttering Iranian economy -- the issue that more than any other will determine how he fares when he assumes his role in August. Rouhani's press conference offered other shreds of hope. He offered the possibility of improved relations with both the U.S. and the UK, saying of the former ""the issue of relations between Iran and America is a complicated and difficult issue. It is an old wound that needs to be healed."" It would be naÃ¯ve to assume that this election or a more moderate tilt by a new president who will not actually be running the country signals a sea-change. But simply by virtue of his stance, he has effectively hit the pause button on the U.S.-Iran stand-off on nukes. A confrontation or attack in the near-term seems much less likely. At the same time, the international community will inevitably test his willingness to seek better relations. The U.S. should participate in that effort, identifying achievable near-term goals that might show progress toward stopping the Iranian nuclear program, or assistance in finding a solution in Syria, while underscoring to Rouhani that his actions will be the only meaningful metric by which he will be judged. Perhaps this election signifies only a superficial or temporary change. But given the stakes, it must also be seen as a cautiously encouraging one. One of the world's most dangerous situations is not, at this moment, hurtling irreversibly toward conflict. There is, for all but the most cynical, a glimmer of hope for a slight opening. That not only resets the clock, it actually creates the opportunity for something like progress. More importantly, it reminds us that however repressive or dangerous Iran's autocratic clerics may be, the people of the country should not reflexively be seen as the enemies of the West or of peace. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Some say election of Iran's Rouhani won't change anything -- they're wrong .

"(CNN) -- The grizzly bear that attacked and killed a man in Yellowstone National Park acted in defense, park officials said on Thursday, adding that they have no plans to kill the bear. The female grizzly attacked a hiker and his wife around 11 a.m. Wednesday after the couple surprised the mother with her cubs, they said. The victim, Brian Matayoshi, 57, died at the scene. His wife, Marylyn, escaped the attack without injuries. Park officials were adamant that the bear's reaction was defensive and that the park does not have plans to track down and kill the bear. ""This bear is not marked in any way and has never been involved in another conflict in the area,"" said wildlife biologist Kerry Gunther. ""We average only one injury per year and they are usually not repeat occurrences by the same bear. ... it was not predatory and we see no reason to take action against the bear."" Park Superintendent Dan Wenk said all signs indicated the Matayoshis did everything right. ""Upon seeing the bear, they began to back down the trail and when they turned to check, the bear was in full charge towards them,"" Wenk said. Wenk said the bear ""impacted"" Matayoshi while his wife took cover behind a fallen tree. The bear approached Matayoshi's wife, lifted her off the ground, and then dropped her. She played dead and the bear left, Wenk said. Marylyn Matayoshi's cries for help alerted other hikers in the area, who called 911. Park rangers arrived at the scene about 15 minutes later. Brian Matayoshi had claw and bite marks from the attack. Rangers confirmed that he was dead when they arrived on the scene, Wenk said. Wednesday's attack occurred along the Wapiti Lake Trail in the back country of the park, in northwestern Wyoming. All trails that feed into South Rim Drive, where the incident occurred, will remain closed until park officials determine it is safe to reopen them. Gunther said hair and DNA samples were collected from the scene so that if another incident occurs they will know if the same bear was involved. There are more than 600 bears in Yellowstone ecosystem, according to park officials. Wenk said bears have been very visible to park visitors this year but that park officials rely on reports from hikers to determine how many bears are in the back country of the park. Bear attacks are extremely rare -- Wednesday's attack is the first time a human has been killed by a bear in the park since 1986, according to a park press release. This was the Matayoshis' fourth visit to Yellowstone, Wenk said. They had previously hiked the trails and never encountered a bear. A warning sign was posted at the head of the trail because of known bear activity along access points. Wenk advised visitors to familiarize themselves with bear safety and protocol before they begin hiking. ""I advise visitors to make themselves aware of the inherent danger if they go into the back country of Yellowstone and to avail themselves of the safety information available to them,"" he said.","NEW: Park officials have no plans to kill the bear, saying it was ""not predatory""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has agreed to hold formal talks with its southeast Asian neighbors about establishing a ""code of conduct"" to ease maritime tensions in the South China Sea, a major step forward in the long-running dispute. A statement issued after a weekend meeting of foreign ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China in Brunei, said the countries ""aim to reach a conclusion of a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, which will service to enhance peace, stability and prosperity in the region."" The South China Sea is home to messy mix of rival territorial claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of island chains and nearby waters. The areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources. Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? However, analysts said the move was unlikely to yield a quick fix for one of the region's biggest flash points. Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, Northeast Asia Director at the International Crisis Group in Beijing, said that it was a ""positive development"" and a code of conduct was urgently needed as China steps up its law enforcement patrols and military exercises in the South China Sea. ""It also provides substance to Beijing's rhetoric that its relations with Southeast Asian countries remain a foreign policy priority,"" she said. ""But this is only a first step, and there is a long way before an effective code can be developed and implemented. Beijing has a record of suspending talks as soon as tensions with rival claimant countries flare -- precisely when talks are most needed."" China has previously stated that it wishes to deal bilaterally with disputes in the South China Sea but a multitude of domestic problems, and the headway the U.S. is making in the region as part of its ""pivot"" to Asia, means China's new leaders have decided that now is not the time to press issue, Kleine-Ahlbrandt added. Speaking to ASEAN foreign ministers on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he supported a ""substantive"" code of conduct to deal with the overlapping territorial claims. His predecessor, Hilary Clinton, repeatedly emphasized the need for a multi-lateral solution to the problem. ""As a pacific nation, and a resident power, the United States has a national interest in the maintenance of peace and stability, respect for international law, unimpeded lawful commerce and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea,"" Kerry said, according to the Straits Times. ""As we have said many times before, while we do not take a position on competing territorial claims over land features, we have a strong interest in the manners in which the disputes of the South China Sea are addressed, and in the conduct of the parties."" Friction between China and the Philippines has intensified this year following several naval standoffs, with Manila challenging Beijing's claims to waters off the Philippines at an international arbitration tribunal. Ian Storey, senior follow at the Institute for Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, says a code of conduct is a way to manage, not solve, the dispute and China is likely to drag out talks. It has already asked for the formation of an ""experts committee"" to advise on the drafting on the code of conduct that could slow negotiations, he added. ""Even at the end of the process, the final agreement is unlikely to be this formal, binding, effective and robust agreement that people are hoping to see. ""","China agrees formal talks with ASEAN countries over code of conduct .

"CLARKSDALE, Mississippi (CNN) -- Pat Davis was just 10 years old when two black men came into his father's barbecue joint in the heart of the Mississippi Delta in 1947. A huge fuss ensued, with four racists shouting every name in the book. Pat Davis operates Abe's BBQ. His father was a Lebanese immigrant in Mississippi and defied segregation. ""My daddy went over to their table and said, 'These are people who want to eat just like you want to eat. You don't bother them. You leave them alone,' "" Davis says, the incident seared in his mind six decades later. ""They told Daddy he could lose his business by letting black people come in."" It's not unusual to find a barbecue restaurant in the South where the ribs are so good you want to run home and kiss your mom. But it's a rare find to discover the South's main delicacy cooked up by Lebanese immigrants in Mississippi, who defied segregation and who've been doing it since 1924. Welcome to Abe's BBQ, a living testament to good eats and to good people, where civil rights were put to the test and won. In the end, racism took a back seat to slow-cooked pit barbecue. Today, Abe's remains one of the oldest restaurants in Mississippi.  Step inside, view photos of Abe's » . It's named after founder Abraham Davis, who arrived in Mississippi from Lebanon in 1913 when he was 13 years old. Abe's sits at The Crossroads, the landmark spot at Highways 49 and 61 in Clarksdale where legend has it that blues king Robert Johnson sold his soul to the devil. Two giant guitars jut into the sky marking the spot where the deal went down. You might be pausing here. Lebanese in Mississippi? Defying segregation? Sounds like something out of William Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. As you sit down with a platter of ribs this Labor Day weekend, this is one barbecue story you might enjoy over cole slaw, baked beans and beer. The town of Clarksdale is located about 70 miles southwest of Memphis, Tennessee, with a population of about 20,000 people. It was once known as the ""Golden Buckle in the Cotton Belt,"" complete with Lebanese, Italian, Chinese and Jewish immigrants along with local blacks and white plantation owners. Much of the immigrant population has moved on. The town these days is perhaps best known for the Delta Blues Museum and for the nearby Ground Zero Blues Club, co-owned by actor Morgan Freeman. Blues purists may point you around the corner to Red's juke joint, a ramshackle place where raw Delta blues oozes from the walls. On this night, Eli Paperboy Reed and the True Loves brought the house down. But it's Abe's that has stood the test of time. Abraham Davis started his pit barbecue as the Bungalow Inn in 1924. It moved to its current location around 1936, and Pat Davis renamed it after his father in 1960. Davis says being an immigrant -- or in his case, the son of immigrants -- gives one a better respect for all people. ""It was a humbling feeling, and we knew how the blacks must've felt,"" he says. ""Being Lebanese, my parents weren't truly accepted as first-class citizens when they first got here."" Andrew Clark, a 58-year-old African-American, worked at Abe's from 1962 to 1990, beginning when he was 16. He says Abe's is a symbol of great barbecue and a shrine to the civil rights struggle. ""They didn't see us as colored. They saw us customers,"" Clark says. ""It didn't matter whether you were white or black ... I never seen them turn down anyone."" Sometimes he'd hear racist comments from white customers. When that happened, Pat Davis always stepped in. ""The whole family is really, really great people,"" Clark says. ""This place really has good roots to it."" Pat Davis refers to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as a prophet, ""because any time you change things for the better, you've got to come from God."" He says change didn't come easy. Many of the local blacks, he says, didn't want his family to be harmed, so they often followed segregation laws. It was when blacks from out of town came that things began to change. ""They would come through the front and inside,"" he says. ""My daddy never refused anyone no matter what color, race or religion. That's my philosophy as well."" He says his father, who always carried a Bible written in Arabic, was ""just doing the right thing."" A hand-painted mural on the wall of Abe's depicts a pig with a fiddle in his hand, a pork sandwich and beer at his side. The hog is grinning from ear to ear, much like Abe's faithful customers over the years. ""He's satisfied even though he's eating one of his kinfolks,"" Davis says with a chuckle. If you're in Clarksdale but not in the mood for barbecue (something's wrong with you, if so), then you'll want to head just up the road to an even more authentic Lebanese restaurant. Rest Haven dishes out kibbe, grape leaves and a host of other Lebanese delicacies, along with traditional American cuisine. Chafik Chamoun, a first generation Lebanese-American, established Rest Haven in 1954. Like Abe's, Chamoun says he has always welcomed people of all races. He peddled wares to black workers on plantations when he arrived in the United States, and learned to see past skin color at an early age. ""I made a living with the black people all my life,"" he says. ""I never refused one of them."" ""Most people tell me how glad they are that I serve them, that my business is here,"" says Chamoun, 75. I pause and tell Davis and Chamoun that stories like theirs aren't celebrated enough in Mississippi, that ""all we hear about is bad sh--"" coming from these parts. The men burst into laughter. They nod with approval. They say their message is one of love, honor and respect. And, oh yeah, one more thing: Great food.","One of the oldest restaurants in Mississippi defied segregation .

"(CNN) -- U.S. gasoline prices have declined for four weeks straight and now average more than 20 cents a gallon cheaper than a year ago, according to a new nationwide survey. The average cost of a gallon across the continental United States of regular stands at $3.71, down 3 cents from two weeks earlier, said Trilby Lundberg, publisher of the Lundberg Survey. Prices have fallen nearly 9 cents a gallon in the past four weeks and are 22 cents cheaper than at this point in 2012, Lundberg said. Lower prices in the Europe's benchmark Brent crude oil are largely behind the most recent fall. More U.S. refining capacity coming back on line after seasonal maintenance also contributed, Lundberg said. ""From there, short-term, we may see more price-cutting soon, perhaps on the order of this approximate 3-cent decline,"" she said. ""But the current picture suggests it won't be large."" Gas prices broke a three-month upward spiral in early March, which had climbed nearly 54 cents since late December. The Lundberg Survey canvasses about 2,500 filling stations across the Lower 48 states every two weeks. The most expensive fuel in the latest survey, conducted Friday, was in Chicago, where pump prices averaged $4.10 a gallon; the cheapest could be found in Billings, Montana, at $3.33, Lundberg said. Average per-gallon prices in other cities: . Atlanta: $3.57 . Baton Rouge, Louisiana: $3.45 . Boston: $3.75 . Denver: $3.53 . Las Vegas: $3.72 . Memphis, Tennessee: $3.43 . Miami: $3.74 .

"(CNN) -- Police have caught a group of alleged thieves accused of stealing more than $46,000 since mid-January from commuters stuck in traffic in Peru's capital city, Lima. After weeks of undercover surveillance, agents with the Peruvian National Police surrounded the suspects Monday as they were allegedly trying to again rob people stuck in traffic in the Barrios Altos neighborhood of Lima. The group of thieves, who call themselves ""Coyotes,"" had been taking advantage of commuters stuck in traffic to rob them in broad daylight, police said. They seemed to primarily target taxis, but passengers in other vehicles were also robbed, they said. ""They would break the cars' windows and try to get in like that or they would unlock the doors and attack their victims,"" a police official told CNN affiliate America TV. Some of the victims would fight back and the suspects had to walk away empty-handed and in one instance, somebody started shooting a weapon straight into the air and the suspects ran away, police said. An elderly woman, who was attacked by the gang, said she tried to fight back. ""I tried to hold on to my purse, but then I noticed that they were armed and let go,"" the woman told America TV. Police video handed out to media outlets shows the suspects trying to outrun police officers who were chasing them, but they were all eventually caught. One of the suspects is 23 years old and the other three are only 18, police said. They're all being charged with armed robbery, illegal possession of a firearm and conspiracy to commit a crime. Police also said they are looking for four more suspects.","Police caught group of alleged thieves accused of robbing people caught in traffic in Lima, Peru .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods probably wishes every tournament could be played on Doral's Blue Monster course and after a second round 65 Friday he is headed for his fourth win at the iconic venue. Taking advantage of benign scoring conditions and just the lightest of breezes, the World No.2 carded eight birdies, including a run of six in eight holes around the turn. The 17 birdies he has carded over the first two rounds is also a personal best for the 14-time major winner. It left him on 13-under 131 at halfway in the WGC-Cadillac Championship, an event he has won six times, and two shots clear of Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell, who shot a fine 67. Woods was briefly joined at the top of the leader board by his arch U.S. rival Phil Mickelson, who also shot a five-under 67 for 10-under and tied with Steve Stricker in third. Woods and Miclkelson fought out a classic duel at Doral in 2005 when Tiger set the tournament record of 24-under-par. With stiffer winds set for the weekend, that score is unlikely to be broken as Woods homes in on his second win on the PGA Tour this season, the other coming at Torrey Pines, another of his favorite layouts. Masters champion Bubba Watson and Swede Freddie Jacobsen, who shared the first round lead, were a further shot back. Struggling World No.1 Rory McIlroy has had to watch as his playing partner and fellow Nike stablemate Woods has made light work of the course over the first two days. The 23-year-old McIlroy will at least be around for the weekend in Florida, unlike at last week's Honda Classic where he trudged off midway through a dismal second round -- and later apologized. McIlroy showed signs of improvement in a second round three-under-par 69 for two-under 142, but finished with a dispiriting bogey five after three putting. It being a World Golf Championship event everyone in the select field gets to play all four rounds and the chance for the Northern Irishman to get his game into the groove as he builds up to the Masters. Defending champion Justin Rose of England saw his hopes of retaining the trophy all but disappear with a triple bogey seven on the short ninth, his 18th, to finish with a level par 72 for four-under 138.","Tiger Woods leads at halfway stage of WGC tournament at Doral .

"(CNN) -- Old and new diplomacy clashed in the flare-up between Egypt and the United States over the arrest and interrogation of Bassem Youssef -- considered the ""Jon Stewart of Egypt"" -- who skewers politicians of all stripes on his popular TV show, El Bernameg. In the world of traditional diplomacy, governments had more control over what was said about them and by whom. As the Egyptian and U.S. governments discovered the hard way, that control is long gone in the world of 21st century diplomacy with its 24/7 social media and powerful nongovernmental voices. When Youssef, accused of insulting President Mohamed Morsy and Islam, was summoned for questioning by the Morsy-appointed prosecutor general, this latest repressive action by the Muslim Brotherhood government sparked an international outcry. The response from the United States came in two forms. First, the State Department expressed ""concern"" about Youssef's detention, citing it as ""evidence of a disturbing trend of growing restrictions on the freedom of expression"" in Egypt. Then, Jon Stewart mounted an eloquent -- and humorous -- defense of Bassem Youssef and freedom of expression through that well-known diplomatic channel, ""The Daily Show."" In a commendable act of public diplomacy, i.e., engaging with the people and not just governments, someone from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo tweeted a link to ""The Daily show."" After all, the program addressed a current issue in Egyptian politics, with a humorous message about shared values between Egypt and America, such as freedom of expression. Failing to see the humor in the situation, the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood struck back. The presidential office tweeted a stern reprimand to the U.S. Embassy: ""It's inappropriate for a diplomatic mission to engage in such negative political propaganda."" Faced with the choice of appeasing the Egyptian government or defending freedom of speech and dissent -- as practiced by Bassem Youssef and Jon Stewart -- the U.S. Embassy in Cairo chose the former, and shut down its Twitter feed. This decision, reportedly made by Ambassador Anne Patterson, not only violated what the United States allegedly stands for -- the rights of citizens to criticize and hold their governments accountable -- but also displayed a stunning ignorance of how Twitter and, well, the Internet work. Once something is out on Twitter, it's out. Shutting it down will not expunge it, and will only blow up into a negative story. That is exactly what happened. Within minutes of the shutdown, Twitter was flooded with condemnation of the U.S. government for caving to Muslim Brotherhood pressure and failing to defend basic freedoms. Although the embassy feed was reactivated within an hour, reportedly at Washington's request, the stories and tweets about the shutdown lingered. That the reinstated embassy feed deleted all tweets about the Youssef case reinforced the sentiment already prevalent in Egypt that the United States sides with Morsy over the Egyptian people. In one act of traditional diplomacy, trying to appease the host government, the U.S. Embassy undermined the good will earned by the nontraditional diplomacy of Jon Stewart. As a television host, Youssef exemplifies ""soft power,"" or the power to influence others through attraction. Other spinoffs of ""The Daily Show"" in Afghanistan and Iran, among other places, are adopting not only Stewart's smart and biting humor, but also core American values such as free speech. In our brave new world, where governments and citizens alike are held up to scrutiny of 24/7 media and social media, and where private-sector television shows can wield more influence than governments, walking the walk as well as talking the talk has never been more important. The United States cannot present itself as the defender of free speech when it suppresses free speech. In removing the tweets about Bassem Youssef and Jon Stewart, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo undercut its own soft power. Who in Egypt will listen the next time an embassy official talks about the importance of free speech or free media? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Schneider.","Bassem Youssef, the ""Jon Stewart of Egypt,"" was arrested for mocking Egypt's president .

"(CNN) -- For nearly a decade, a Danish bank has been recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as one of the best small to medium sized companies to work for in Europe. Situated near the quiet coastline on the island of Fyn, Middelfart Sparekasse has an unusual approach to people management that experts say is worth noting. Coaching, self-directed leadership and personal growth are not usually words associated with financial institutions, but to this bank's 200 or so employees they are key, and the business operates under the assumption that everyone comes to work wanting to do their best, virtually eliminating the need for any oversight. Sound utopian? Perhaps, but managing director of human resources, Knud Herbert Soerensen says it works. ""You'd be amazed what happens once people are empowered to make decisions."" Under the concept of self-directed leadership, every employee is coached to resolve 100% of their work on their own, sometimes by making substantial monetary decisions without asking for help. ""It forces people to step into character,"" says Soerensen, ""And they do. Our employee satisfaction is very high, and for customers it means a highly individual treatment. There's no one solution and we believe the only way to treat people the same is by treating them differently. As a result, 80% of new customers come to us through referrals."" The bank was a leader in the use of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) as a coaching tool. It began with a simple chat between Soerensen and managing director, Hans Erik Broenserud in 1999. ""We were wondering why we ended up in top positions at the bank,"" says Soerensen. ""None of us were particularly clever in school, so we agreed that something else must have played a part. Then we questioned why two employees with the same qualifications and training were not getting the same results, and we realized that those who succeeded had something extra: A will to succeed, a type of robustness if you will, and a belief in themselves that they were capable. And we thought we could train people to do this."" They did and they do. Today, all new employees at the bank go through an NLP seminar and a self-directed leadership seminar. They train employees in empathy, stress management, and personal self-development, and they keep a coach on staff. Randi Rude, the bank's NLP master coach and HR director says it makes a tremendous positive difference. ""It helps keep our employees really engaged and motivated. It keeps our sickness rates well below industry average, and it helps our leaders clarify their strategies, among many other things,"" he says. ""I think the biggest bang from coaching produces more of what I call ""Professional Human Beings,"" says Ginger Jenks, owner of Magellan Enterprises in the U.S. and coach to several CEOs and clients in Fortune 500 companies. ""These are people who are continuously upgrading and learning, pushing their potential and that of the organization."" The Great Place to Work Institute publishes lists of best places to work. It has been comparing thousand of global workplaces for years, and its research reveals more and more coaching in companies. ""Fundamentally though, it's about respect and about helping people find work-life balance and deal with stress, says managing director for Denmark, Ditte Vigsoe, ""It has to be a serious commitment."" Flemming Poulfeldt, Professor of management at the Copenhagen Business School agrees. ""Self-directed leadership doesn't mean less leadership. On the contrary, it demands strong leaders to create a framework of support for employees to reach their full potential. Whether you call that coaching or something else, I think we'll see more of it."" Jenks says she is seeing much more of it. ""Sixteen years ago when I said 'I'm a coach', people would ask, 'what sport?' It's part of the corporate lexicon now. Coaching is about the development of human potential - savvy companies get that that's a true competitive advantage."" Middelfart Sparekassen executives now speak to companies big and small about the bank's approach. But can this really work in larger companies? Soerensen says absolutely. A few years ago when he discovered that the Banco Real Sao Paulo in Brazil was using nearly the same approach as his bank, he arranged a visit to interview the leadership and employees. ""It was a company of 29,000 employees at the time,"" he says, ""and I had goosebumps at how similar their positive results and employee and customer feedback was to ours. So yes, it can most definitely work.""","A Danish bank has repeatedly been recognised as one of Europe's best places to work .

"(CNN) -- The feat has not been achieved since 1936 but with every victory, the pressure on Andy Murray to deliver a first British winner of the men's singles at Wimbledon since Fred Perry grows. The expectation is always there for any leading British player but with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer having unexpectedly dropped out of his section of the draw, Murray is fancied like never before to finally rewrite history. The beaten finalist in 2012, the 26-year-old survived a second set scare to beat Russian 20th seed Mikhail Youzhny 6-4 7-5 (7-5) 6-1 and reach the quarterfinals for the sixth straight year. The second seed will meet the unseeded Fernando Verdasco for a place in the semifinals, with the Scot boasting an 8-1 winning record against the Spaniard, who beat Kenny de Schepper in straight sets. ""It was a tough match,"" U.S. Open and Olympic champion Murray said later. ""The first couple of sets especially -- and he also had a chance at the start of the third. ""But once I got ahead in the third set, I concentrated really hard not to let him back into the match like I did in the second set."" The turning point of a contest that lasted two hours and 37 minutes came in the second set when Murray managed to turn around a 2-5 deficit to win on a tie break. Youzhny needed treatment on a shoulder injury early in the third set and faded soon after, so allowing the British number one to reach the last eight without dropping a set. ""I just have to concentrate on the next match,"" he said when asked about the pressure of being the home favorite. ""Serena Williams lost today and she doesn't lose particularly often,"" he explained. ""Roger lost, Rafa lost -- all these guys and girls are better than me and if they can lose, so can I."" Should Murray come through his quarterfinal, he will meet either Jerzy Janowicz or Lukasz Kubot in the last four -- with one of the Polish duo set to create history. Whoever wins their clash will become the first Pole to reach the semifinals of a men's grand slam. The Radwanska sisters may have put Polish tennis on the map in recent years but they have long been hoping that they will be joined by their male compatriots. Without a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon since 1980, two came along on the same day as 24th seed Janowicz, 22, beat Austria's Jurgen Melzer in five sets while the unseeded Kubot was also taken all the way when beating Adrian Mannarino. Despite the significance of their forthcoming encounter, Janowicz and Kubot, 31, hugged one another as soon as they met in the locker room after their respective wins. ""It's unbelievable what is going on right now,"" the big-serving Janowicz told reporters. ""We have two players in the quarterfinals in the men's draw. ""Right now, tennis is a really famous sport in our country. I hope we'll get more fans."" Kubot's passage to the quarterfinals was first eased by the shock defeat of Rafael Nadal in the opening round and then further helped as the Spaniard's conqueror Steve Darcis was forced to pull out of his second round meeting with the Pole through injury. In the top half of the draw, David Ferrer -- who lost his first grand slam final against compatriot Nadal at the French Open last month -- reached his second straight Wimbledon quarterfinal when beating Croatia's Ivan Dodig 6-7 7-6 6-1 6-1. ""I'm trying to play more aggressive,"" said Ferrer, who has never progressed to the last four at Wimbledon. ""I need to serve better than other courts, obviously when I am playing the second shot. Every match I am playing better with my game. I am confident."" Next up for the consistent Spaniard, who will rise to a career-high world No. 3 in next week's rankings, is Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro, who beat 23rd seed Andreas Seppi in straight sets. ""He's a very great player,"" said Ferrer. ""It's going to be difficult. I need to play my best tennis to beat Del Potro. And on a grass court I think it is more difficult. He plays better than me on grass. Last year I beat him, but I think I played my best match on a grass court."" Whoever wins through will meet either Novak Djokovic, who beat Tommy Haas in straight sets late on Monday, or Tomas Berdych, who sunk Bernard Tomic 7-6 6-7 6-4 6-4, in the last four.","Second seed Andy Murray beats Russia's Mikhail Youzhny in straight set to reach last 16 .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins will portray Iggy Pop in the forthcoming film ""CBGB,"" the Hollywood Reporter confirms. This will be Hawkins' first significant acting role, though he has had comedic roles in a handful of Foo Fighters videos. It's unclear how substantial the role will be -- there's a good chance that it's a small part and Hawkins was cast in part because he somewhat resembles the Stooges rocker in his prime. Other parts in the film have been cast as well, including ""The Borgias"" actress Mickey Sumner as Patti Smith, ""The Big Bang Theory"" star Johnny Galecki as Television manager Terry Ork, Malin Akerman as Blondie singer Debbie Harry and Rupert Grint as Dead Boys guitarist Cheetah Chrome.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- When Yashodo Gurung left her mother's side at a West Philadelphia abortion clinic, she thought the 41-year-old woman was napping while she awaited her medical procedure. But now, as testimony Tuesday in the trial of the clinic's doctor indicated, Gurung wonders if maybe her mother was in fact dead when Gurung was asked by a staffer at the Women's Medical Society to return to the waiting room at the front of the clinic. ""I thought she was peaceful and sleeping,"" the a 26-year-old Bhutanese refugee said through a translator, wiping her eyes with a tissue. Dr. Kermit Gosnell faces eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven babies and that of Gurung's mother, Karnamaya Mongar, of Virginia, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. Authorities accuse Gosnell, 72, of using scissors to sever the spinal cords of fetuses who emerged from their mothers still alive. Medical examiner had to thaw fetal remains in Philly abortion case . He has pleaded not guilty. His defense attorney, Jack McMahon, has maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, they were already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering an abortion drug. Mongar died November 19, 2009, after overdosing on anesthetics prescribed by the doctor, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said following the arrest of Gosnell and before a gag order was put in place preventing attorneys and now jurors from speaking to the media. Williams called the facility ""a house of horrors"" that performed ""botched and illegal abortions"" and that was full of containers of fetuses' body parts. Born in Bhutan, Mongar spent 18 years living in a bamboo hut in a Nepalese refugee camp before coming to the United States in July 2009 as part of a humanitarian resettlement program, the family's attorney, Bernard Smalley, told CNN in 2011 following the release of the grand jury report. The mother of three and grandmother of one was 19 weeks into her pregnancy when she went to Gosnell's practice. Gurung testified that while she waited with her mother for several hours, she saw her mother given multiple doses of medicine in pill form. Gurung also saw her mother receive additional medication intravenously through an IV line inserted in Mongar's hand. Mongar's brother, Damber Ghalley, who speaks English, also testified Tuesday. Ghalley told jurors he took Mongar to Gosnell's practice two days in a row. After hours inside the clinic during the second visit, Ghalley was waiting outside in his car when things turned chaotic as an ambulance and firefighters arrived on the scene, he said. ""I knew something was wrong when I saw the ambulance,"" Ghalley testified, adding that firefighters had to use bolt cutters to open a padlocked emergency exit just to get Mongar out of the clinic on a stretcher. Ghalley said he saw Gosnell standing inside the doorway asked him what was happening. ""He (Gosnell) said the procedure was done but 'Your sister's heart stopped,'"" Ghalley said. Jurors also heard from Gosnell's former maintenance man, Jimmy Johnson, who testified that his duties included removing the biohazard waste from the exam rooms. Johnson said that the toilets inside the clinic would be ""stopped up"" at least twice a week. ""When I plunged it once, particles came up,"" Johnson said. ""What kind of particles,"" assistant district attorney Edward Cameron asked. ""An arm came up,"" Johnson replied. Also on trial is Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at Gosnell's clinic. O'Neill, who did not have a medical license, is charged with participating in the operation of a ""corrupt organization."" If found guilty, Gosnell could be sentenced to death.

"Miami (CNN) -- The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement for South Florida has been arrested on child pornography charges, the Department of Justice said Wednesday. Anthony Mangione, 50, of Parkland, Florida, was charged in a three-count indictment unsealed Wednesday with transportation of child pornography, receipt of child pornography and possession of child pornography, authorities said in a statement. ""According to the indictment, between March 2010 and September 2010, Mangione allegedly transported and received visual depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct,"" the statement said. ""The indictment also alleges that Mangione possessed electronically stored messages that contained additional images of child pornography during the same time period."" Mangione was arrested Tuesday by FBI agents and made an initial appearance Wednesday in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida. During the appearance, Mangione pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to CNN affiliate WPTV. Both the prosecution and the defense requested that he undergo a psychological evaluation, and the judge approved that request. ""The government has concerns that given the magnitude of the charges, that he might melt down,"" defense attorney David Howard told WPTV. ""So there is ... real concern, and it's going to be addressed."" Attempts to contact Howard on Wednesday were not immediately successful. Mangione, a 27-year law enforcement veteran, wore a gray jumpsuit with ""federal prisoner"" on the back in court Wednesday, and his hands and feet were shackled, WPTV said. He made no statement during the hearing. He was being held in the Broward County jail, according to jail records. A law enforcement official who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media said Mangione has been on leave from his job at ICE. WPTV reported that he was placed on paid administrative leave in April amid a federal investigation into four images on his home computer he allegedly received via e-mail. According to its website, ICE targets and investigates child pornographers, child sex tourists and facilitators and human smugglers and traffickers of minors, among others. The agency developed Operation Predator, which it describes as ""an initiative to identify, investigate and arrest child predators and sexual offenders."" If convicted, Mangione faces up to 20 years in prison, the Department of Justice said. He also faces a term of supervised release from five years to life following his prison sentence and he will be required to register as a sex offender. ""On the arrest of our former (special agent in charge) in Miami, we have cooperated fully in that investigation,"" ICE Director John Morton said Wednesday morning when asked about the case during a news conference on another matter. ""We'll see how things unfold today, and beyond that, we don't have any comment."" The case is being investigated by the Broward County Sheriff's Office and the FBI, the Department of Justice said. Broward County referred questions to federal authorities, and the FBI referred them to the Department of Justice. CNN's Ashley Hayes and Athena Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: Report: Anthony Mangione will undergo a psychological evaluation .

"(CNN) -- A glance at some of the Wimbledon semifinalists in 1989 -- such as Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl -- evokes distant memories of yesteryear but one player from those championships is, remarkably, still playing today: Kimiko Date-Krumm. To illustrate her longevity another way, the Berlin Wall was still standing when the diminutive Japanese made her Wimbledon debut in June 1989. Her opponent on the day was another player reminiscent of another era -- Zina Garrison -- with the American beating the then 19-year-old in straight sets in an inauspicious start for the youngster. Over two decades on, the 42-year-old has become the oldest player to reach the third round at Wimbledon in the Open Era -- beating the mark held by Briton Virginia Wade (39 years, 362 days) when knocking out Romania's Alexandra Cadantu 6-4 7-5 on Thursday. The last time Date-Krumm contested the third round at Wimbledon was when she reached her one and only semifinal, where she was beaten by Steffi Graf -- some 17 years ago. Her reward is a showdown with world No. 1 Serena Williams, who cruised past French teenager Caroline Garcia in straight sets in round two (6-3 6-2) and who was a seven-year-old growing up with dreams of tennis stardom when the Japanese made her debut. ""I'm very happy to be in the third round, especially since I love Wimbledon and have many good memories here,"" Date-Krumm told reporters after her match. ""I think it's amazing. At the age of 42, I cannot believe it. ""This year I skipped a lot of the clay court season so I could focus on the grass. And luckily this year I didn't play a seeded player in the first round, because most of the time I did. It's working. I'm very happy."" Known simply as Date prior to her marriage to German motor racing driver Michael Krumm in 2001, the veteran of the women's tour knows her continuation at Wimbledon won't be easy against the five-time champion -- one who has won her last 33 matches. ""She's so strong. It's very, very difficult to beat her,"" she said. ""I played with Venus here two years ago, but of course there's a big difference between Venus and Serena. ""Serena has more power and more speed. She has more confidence. She has more everything. I just need to try my best on the court and we'll see. I hope I can stay on the court more than an hour, an hour and a half."" Williams herself is full of admiration for a player who quit the sport in 1996 -- only to make her comeback in 2008 at the age of 37, a time when most professionals have hung up their rackets. ""I've never played her but I have so much respect for her,"" the defending champion told reporters after her match. ""I think she's so inspiring to be playing such high level tennis at her age. And she's a real danger on grass courts - I know that - I will have to be ready."" ""Kimiko has great hand-eye coordination. Doesn't matter how hard you hit it, she sees the ball and gets it back. ""She has great hands, a wonderful great volley, comes to the net a lot, and she plays really flat too, so the ball stays really low."" Should Williams beat the second oldest woman to reach the third round of any grand slam in the Open Era since 45-year-old Renee Richards at the 1979 US Open, she will be just one victory away from equalling the longest winning streak in women's singles history -- the 35 straight wins achieved by her sister Venus in 2000. Venus beat Date-Krumm in a three-set epic at Wimbledon in 2011, prompting Serena to suggest she will talk to her elder sibling for some tips. ""I think I lost four years of my life watching that match,"" Serena added. ""So I will definitely be talking to Venus and figuring out what I can do to do the best that I can.""

"(CNN) -- To the casual observer, Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't look like a man that feels pressure. He is the driving force behind one of the world's biggest football clubs, Real Madrid, and reached 100 goals for Los Blancos faster than any other player in the Spanish champion's 111-year history. But the Portugal star admits that, behind the bravado and on-field posturing, he and his teammates are feeling the strain of the expectation that surrounds the Madrid club. Real's stuttering start to the season leaves them 18 points adrift of Spanish First Division leaders and archrivals Barcelona, with the club's fans now demanding coach Jose Mourinho lead Los Blancos to a record 10th triumph in Europe's premier club competition by way of compensation. Real must overcome Manchester United in their last 16 clash if they are to win the European Champions League for the first time in 11 years -- a tie which will see Ronaldo return to the club where he announced himself as a world-class talent before leaving for Madrid in 2009 in a deal worth $129 million. ""I've been here for three-and-a-half years now,"" the 27-year-old told FIFA's official website. ""Everyone involved is totally focused on winning the club's 10th European Cup. That creates a certain amount of anxiety, which can be felt at all times. ""The pressure is too great and that sometimes can affect us. But we have to try and rise above it and not let what people say get to us, particularly the media, as Real Madrid get spoken about every day. ""Every Madridista wants that 1oth European Cup -- we're more than aware of that. Last season we fell just short, which was very frustrating. ""Fortunately we've got the opportunity to set the record straight this year, though the fact we face Manchester United next makes it more difficult. It's not going to be easy and I reckon the odds are about 50-50, but I'm still very confident."" However, the worry for Spanish champions Real is that their team has been relatively inconsistent this season. While Barca have notched up a record 18 wins from the same amount of games during the current campaign, Mourinho's team have lost four and drawn four of their first 19 matches. The crowd at the 85,000-seater Santiago Bernabeu stadium have targeted their frustrations at Mourinho -- a Champions League winner with both Porto and Inter Milan -- and Ronaldo. ""We haven't started the championship very well for sure,"" Ronaldo continued. ""We know that La Liga's an uphill struggle for us now, but nothing's impossible in football. We're going to work hard, win games and see what happens. He added: ""I'm able to respect those who criticize me, because I know they've got the wrong idea about me. People who know me and those who've played alongside me know what kind of a guy I am. Those who don't know me can say and think whatever they want."" Ronaldo's return to United, who are currently leading the English Premier League table, has led many to reflect on the six successful years he spent in Manchester, winning the Champions League and being named World Player of the Year in 2008. United manager Alex Ferguson admitted recently he would like to see Ronaldo return to Old Trafford, but the Madeira-born striker has moved to quell talk of an imminent move by saying he wishes to see out the remainder of his contract at Real, which expires in 2015. ""I want to see out my contract at Real Madrid; I'm very clear about that,"" he said. ""After that, well, I don't know what'll happen in the future."" And head of February's contest between Real and United, Ronaldo is confidence his current club can overcome his former employers. ""No team's unbeatable, but when we're at our best we're a really good side. Manchester United have started the English championship race very well and are a long way ahead of the rest. ""But still, if we play the way we're capable of, we can beat them. To do that we need to pull together and play as a team, like we've done in so many matches before.""","Cristiano Ronaldo says Real Madrid are under pressure to win the Champions League .

"WEST, Texas (CNN) -- One by one, the beleaguered townspeople of West, Texas, filed into local churches Sunday to begin the healing process, following last week's deadly blast at the nearby West Fertilizer Co. plant. As parishioners streamed out of St. Mary's Catholic Church after Sunday's service, Father Boniface Onjefu hugged and consoled his congregants, and gave reassuring smiles and high fives to the church's youngest members. ""West is a strong city. We shall definitely overcome this tragedy,"" Onjefu told those assembled at his church, about a mile from the explosion site. Several members of St. Mary's were killed or injured battling the blaze, Onjefu told CNN. The church's parking lot has become a staging area, of sorts, for police and first responders who have flooded the north central Texas community since Wednesday's explosion that killed 14 people. Search and rescue efforts have evolved into search and recovery efforts, because officials don't expect to find any more victims in the wreckage -- alive or dead. The explosion at West Fertilizer's plant ruined much of the north side of town, and left hundreds of people injured, homeless and in need of help. On television nationally, the scope of the tragedy was overshadowed by the dramatic events in New England, as investigators there pursued leads in the Boston Marathon bombing investigation, then pursued their suspects. But many Texans kept their focus on the great need close to home. Long lines of cars streamed by the community center, dropping off food, water and other rations throughout the weekend. Numerous church groups and restaurants handed out hot meals. ""These are our neighbors. They are coming to help,"" Waco Police Department Sgt. William Patrick Swanton told reporters. ""You will find that in Texas. You will find that across the United States. We put everything aside when it comes to these types of situations."" The nine first responders from West who died battling the blaze represented nearly one-third of the town's volunteer firefighting and EMT force. The fire destroyed two fire trucks and an ambulance. Firefighters and trucks from neighboring communities now fill the void at the West firehouse. At Sunday's emotional church service in this farming town of fewer than 3,000 residents, the priest told congregants his personal recollection of Wednesday's horror. He had just returned to the rectory when he heard the blast. ""I thought it was an earthquake,"" Onjefu said. The lights flickered on and off as his small two-story brick residence shook from the explosion, he added. Onjefu said that when he headed outside, he immediately noticed a large, dark plume of smoke rising in the sky on the north side of town. He got into his car and drove toward the smoke. The priest was one of the first to arrive in the destroyed part of town. He immediately began helping remove victims from a severely damaged nursing home. The town's high school and middle school, also close to the fertilizer plant, sustained heavy damage as well. Onjefu said that since the blast, he has witnessed ""fear in the eyes"" of people walking the streets of West. Many churchgoers trying to fathom the destruction have asked Onjefu for answers about why the plant exploded. ""I guess it could have been worse,"" an elderly church member told him as he left the Sunday service. Onjefu smiled and agreed, reminding the man of his sermon, which noted that rains and winds in the area had helped tame the blaze, and kept the poisonous cloud of fumes away from the center of town. Evacuated townspeople began returning home late Saturday to begin what promises to be a massive cleanup effort. Authorities allowed a second wave to revisit their homes Sunday. The process ""is going well and orderly,"" with ""very few hiccups,"" said Steve Vanek, West's mayor pro tem. Adult residents are being allowed in until 7 p.m., under the supervision of Texas state police, he said. A strict curfew and heavy state police presence control the areas cordoned off near the site -- almost the entire north side of town. The cause of the fire and explosion has not been determined yet, but investigators have isolated the center of the blast, Assistant State Fire Marshal Kelly Kistner said Sunday. The explosion left a large crater in the middle of the plant, Kistner said. Funeral arrangements are pending for those killed. But Vanek said Sunday that Baylor University, 20 miles away in Waco, will host a memorial service for first responders at 2 p.m. Thursday. So far, 10 of the 14 casualties have been identified as first responders, including a Dallas firefighter. In Hillsboro, Texas, about 15 miles from West, hotels and storefront windows displayed fliers celebrating the life of firefighter Jerry Chapman, who was killed fighting the blaze, an indication that the mourning and sense of grief go far beyond the close-knit community of West.

CNN's Todd Sperry reported from West, Texas; CNN's Martin Savidge, John Murgatroyd and Eric Fiegel contributed to this report from West, Texas; CNN's Matt Smith and Mark Morgenstein contributed from Atlanta.","A fertilizer plant exploded in West, Texas, on Wednesday, killing 14 people .

"(CNN) -- Jeff Weiss had spent 20 years teaching negotiation skills to top executives when he realized those techniques might be just as valuable to soldiers on the battlefield. So a decade ago, he approached the U.S. Military to teach officers negotiation tools and strategies they could use in a theater of war. The West Point Negotiation Project was founded, and before long, Weiss made another realization: the lessons could go the other way, too. ""There's a ton to take from the military back to the corporations,"" says Weiss, a partner at Vantage Partners, a Boston-based negotiation training and consulting firm that works with Fortune 500 companies. ""Business leaders have a lot to learn from military leaders who, in extreme situations, are able to take a deep breath, get perspective and negotiate through a set of strategies."" Read more: Why we pick bad leaders . Perhaps counter-intuitively, the best military negotiators adopt a creative, problem-solving approach. A more macho, ""Rambo style"" of negotiation -- in which the negotiator digs in inflexibly to a position they believe to be right -- is ""just not effective,"" Weiss says, and could lead to fatal errors. ""When we're under pressure to act fast in a high-stakes situation, it often leads us to a set of traps,"" he adds. ""We often act on perception and assumptions, we tend to use a strong position and dig in, we tend to use threats and we play a concessions game far too frequently."" Below are five key points into which Weiss has distilled the essence of successful deal-making, which he says are equally applicable whether you're dealing with potentially hostile stakeholders on the battlefield, or a fellow boardroom warrior. Know your enemy . Step back and solicit the perspective of the other side. Understanding their point of view, whether you agree with it or not, is crucial to ensuring you have an accurate handle on the situation. This way you avoid becoming locked into a false set of assumptions, or confusing it with a situation you have seen before. Creativity, not compromise . Be disciplined about uncovering underlying motivations -- then use those motivations to put forward a set of possible creative solutions. Says Weiss: ""The most effective negotiators dig for interests or motivations underneath the stated demand, and present possibilities in response."" Be creative and look for the other side to build those possible solutions with you. ""With a little creativity you can do all kinds of great stuff, without needing to compromise."" Read more: Want to be a leader? Act like one . Arm yourself ... and the other side . Be principled and fair. ""You need to take responsibility for arming yourself and the other side with something objective to defend the solution with,"" says Weiss. ""If you leave the other side telling their people, 'Well, I agreed to this because the other side pushed really hard, made a threat and coerced me,' chances are they're not going to persuade their stakeholders and critics."" Win hearts and minds . Tackle issues of mistrust head on, and don't mix them with the substance of the negotiations. ""Often we find people try to buy a damaged relationship: 'You don't think I'm a good partner, I'll throw some money at this.' That never works,"" says Weiss. ""You might make someone temporarily happy, but you don't build trust that way, and without trust it's very difficult to do complex deals."" He advocates negotiating on ""two tracks"": trust and relationship issues on one side, the substance of the negotiations on the other. Take control . Be active and deliberate about shaping the negotiation process in the way you want it to evolve, proposing new ways forward when talks stall. Systematically change the game if you don't like the way the other side is playing it. Don't simply fall back to a position of reacting to their demands. This creative approach requires a major shift in perspective for macho corporates, many of whom tend to take the attitude that their ""strength comes from being right,"" says Weiss. He says many tend to negotiate ""the same way they handled their first negotiation -- they wanted food, they cried, they didn't get it, they cried harder. Unfortunately that's many people's first and last lesson in negotiation."" But while the military's finest negotiating talent may have generated these solutions, it doesn't necessarily follow that they are used more prevalently in the military than in the corporate world. ""We're getting there in the military. But,"" he concedes, ""in large part, it still has a fairly macho approach."" Perhaps not unlike the boardroom.","Jeff Weiss says the strategies of top military negotiators work well in the corporate world .

"(WIRED) -- Apple's latest OS X update, Mountain Lion, adds a slate of new features, nearly all derived from iOS 5. There's one big omission, however: Siri, Apple's voice-controlled virtual assistant, does not make the migration from mobile to desktop. Now, technically, Siri isn't a part of iOS 5. It's marketed as the most game-changing feature of the iPhone 4S (which runs iOS 5), and Apple has remained mum on whether Siri will ever be ported to other devices — this to the pique of independent developers who've hacked the feature to run on everything from the iPod touch to thermostats. Clearly, Siri is Apple's most celebrated user feature. And, clearly, there's interest to see it appear on other Apple devices. Indeed, companies throughout the consumer tech industry are exploring novel new user interface models, including voice-control and gesture-control. But porting Siri to Mountain Lion desktops would pose several challenges. Apple was smart to leave it out of the latest desktop update, and here's why. Microphone logistics . Microphone positioning on MacBooks and iMacs would present technical challenges for any Siri desktop port. The iPhone is designed to be held up to your face, and has a built-in mic that includes advanced noise reduction technology to ensure your voice is heard loud and clear, while street noise and the nearby guy shouting into his phone aren't picked up. In part, this is accomplished by using two microphones: one near your mouth to pick up your voice, and another near the headphone jack to identify and cancel out background noise. Yes, your MacBook Pro has an omnidirectional microphone built-in. It's very convenient for using FaceTime in conjunction with the notebook's camera, or for the speech recognition function built into Macs for OS control. The omnidirectional mic, however, doesn't offer the same voice-processing sensitivity of the iPhone 4′s dual-mic arrangement. All told, Siri voice analysis would be far more challenging on a Mac computer, particularly when other voices or noises are in the room. Granted, using an external mic, or even the mic on your throwaway iDevice earbuds, could provide a solution. But even though Siri is still considered a beta product, Apple wouldn't resort to such an inelegant hack just to put Siri on Macs. ""Apple has been reluctant to put in features that require something like that,"" Forrester analyst Frank Gillett told Wired. ""It's too fussy for what they like to do. Current speech-recognition products work pretty well if you wear a special high-quality microphone. What's very clear is they need the mic on your face, right by your lips."" Location detection . Siri is all about location-awareness. She wants to give you directions, provide local weather reports, and locate the closest sources of exotic cuisine. But desktop computers don't include native GPS. ""I think the main challenge [in bringing Siri to Mountain Lion] would be the lack of an accurate location being available,"" said William Tunstall-Pedoe, CEO of True Knowledge, which has developed a Siri clone called Evi. What's more, as Tunstall-Pedoe points out, desktop computers are relatively stationary devices, so a Mac version of Siri may not even need location-awareness, as a large portion of Siri's talents would never be engaged. All of which begs the question, If a good portion of Siri's functionality isn't even germane to the desktop experience, why even deliver a port? While MacBooks don't currently include GPS services, various web services (like Google Maps) can figure out your location by using either IP geolocation, or by triangulating your position based on WiFi networks around you. These strategies, however, deliver location accuracy limited to about 150 feet, whereas GPS can peg you within 10 feet of your precise position on the Earth. Future MacBooks could easily include GPS chip built-in for more exact positioning, but for now, laptop and desktop geolocation capabilities aren't accurate — or even that necessary. Hands-free voice control isn't needed . People tend to use Siri because their hands are tied, like when driving. Thus, ""Siri, where's the nearest gas station?"" With Siri, you can find the answer quickly, and relatively safely, while keeping your eyes on the road. But these basic use cases just don't transfer to the desktop. ""I think it is fair to say that the advantages that a voice-powered assistant give are stronger on a small mobile device,"" Tunstall-Pedoe said. ""PCs typically have a much larger screen and a keyboard and mouse."" Or, in Apple's case, a trackpad or Magic Trackpad instead of a mouse, depending if you're on a laptop or desktop. Either way, hand-driven data entry is a familiar — and generally effective — method for using today's computers. What's more, as Tunstall-Pedoe points out, ""PCs are also often used in environments where the use of voice would be awkward,"" such as inside an open floor plan office. Granted, if you're disabled or injured, you could certainly make use of a hands-free feature. But in these cases, you would probably want a tool more robust than Siri. Which brings us to our next point: . Limited use cases . With Siri, you can do things like schedule reminders, look up restaurant and business information on Yelp, get information from Wolfram|Alpha, and ask general search engine-style queries. That's not a large number of functions, and they're not specifically suited to the desktop environment. Indeed, why would you have Siri look up something when you can more quickly run your own Google search? ""On the iPhone, people want to do short things, like quick dictation and sending a quick text message,"" Gillette says. The use cases would be different on a Mac, and not necessarily centered around short phrases. Siri's capabilities would need to expand in order to handle these different functions. Always-on data . Lastly, Siri needs a constant data connection in order to interface with Apple's servers. Until MacBooks include a built-in 3G, or more likely, 4G data connection, WiFi alone won't cut it for consistent, high-quality network availability, Gillett says. Gillett also believes Siri ties into unique hardware features that make chatter between one's device and Apple's data center more streamlined. ""There seems to be special silicon within a special chip that has capabilities for voice recognition that a Mac wouldn't have,"" he said. Gillett notes that Siri is sometimes able to analyze a query and provide a response extremely quickly, while other times, it takes 10 to 15 seconds of processing. ""I think the chip does some pre-analysis, shrinks stuff it has to send, Apple's data center gets a crunched answer, and Siri displays it on screen,"" Gillett said. ""Apple may be working on Siri-enabling features [for Macs] in the future, but there will be some hardware enhancements to go with it,"" Gillett said. ""And they'll think long and hard about the use case before they implement a voice feature in the Mac."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"London (CNN) -- In a room which once served as the residence of the painter Monet at London's Savoy Hotel, one of rock's most engaging and enduring entertainers is having a little trouble recovering his hearing. Visibly though, Iggy Pop shows no after-effects from last night's gig at the city's Festival Hall. At 66 he looks in great shape -- yet a glance at his hell-raising musical resume tells you it's a wonder he's here at all. The early reviews of the show at London's Meltdown Festival (curated this year by Yoko Ono) speak of his boundless, youthful energy as he bounds on to the stage like a jack-in-the box who's just escaped the confines of the toy cupboard, cajoling, teasing and captivating his audience with the skills of the consummate showman. ""There's a lot of craft,"" he says. ""Everything from learning the different parts of the room to reading the reactions to ultimately. You're like a funnel or a vacuum cleaner. You're a transformer between all the energy of the group and its music and the different energies of all the people in the different parts of the room. What's really happening when it's good is that everybody's flowing into each other's presence, maybe through the medium of a particular riff or a particular chorus but also a monkey -- a well-rehearsed monkey,"" he laughs. Read more: Foo Fighters drummer will play Iggy Pop . Pop's monkey business has revealed itself in various forms of bad behavior on stage over the years. Among the less notorious antics, are his trademark topless performance and an affinity to stage-dive into his audience. ""The first time I did it I was 21 years-old and I was opening for Frank Zappa who was great and we were just a local band in a psychedelic bar room,"" he recalls. In those days, he tells me, they would be lucky to get a sympathy fee of $50. ""But we were cute kids and we got to play with everybody and I thought it was my job to make sure that when we played no-one forgot about us. I did that thing that little kids do when they're not getting enough attention from their parents, they just fall forward and wait for maybe somebody to catch 'em. And I would just step off the stage and inspect the audience."" Forty-five years later and he's still at it. ""Last year I did a couple of big dives and I got a couple of stitches because I always overdo it. And at this stage I just fall in once in a while and say ""Hi"" and it's fine -- just a gentle collapse is okay!"" But some things have changed since those early days: the after-show party today is an altogether calmer affair, in the company of his third wife Nina Alu, a nice bottle of Bordeaux and ""lots of desserts."" ""And someone will draw my bath and sleep will come hard. There's some element I do with The Stooges... the hardcore stuff. It's a bit like being a prize fighter, there's a lot of nervous energy and you wake up sore."" Pop is currently touring Europe with The Stooges, having recorded ""Ready to Die"" -- only their fifth album in 45 years. His parents named him James Osterberg Junior but playing in a band called The Iguanas led to the nickname ""Iggy"" and an apparent similarity to a local character named ""Pop"" provided the rest. In the early days, he says, he became known as ""The Man You Love To Hate"" and today he's most commonly billed as the ""Godfather of Punk"" -- a term with which he's uncomfortable. ""At first it was just a really embarrassing tag and then it got to be funny and then I just gave up. I've been called lots of things and it's nice to have lots of titles. I'm waiting for Nobel laureate -- no-one's nominating me so I'm putting it out there."" Pop's musical career has been supplemented by a long association with movies both as an actor and musician. Tracks such as ""The Passenger,"" ""Lust for Life,"" ""Search and Destroy"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" have appeared on the soundtracks to almost 150 movies and TV series. This summer he'll be played by Foo Fighters' drummer Taylor Hawkins in the film ""CBGB,"" about the legendary New York music club frequented by the likes of The Ramones, Blondie and Patti Smith. But an unexpected acting connection revealed itself during Pop's visit to London. ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe has confessed to being a huge fan of Iggy and was reported as saying that playing his idol on screen was his ultimate dream. Pop tells me Radcliffe attended last night's gig and the singer seems delighted to be reaching a new generations of fans. ""I think it would be great if everybody played me,"" he says. ""Yeah, come on kid play me! I think it's wonderful it's a gift that anyone would think of me."" However there's one actor in particular with whom Iggy Pop has developed a strong musical bond and friendship -- although it didn't start out that way. ""Johnny Depp was in a couple of bands in the Florida area -- I think Rocky City Angels and The Kids -- and apparently once when I was in my wildest phase I played in Gainesville. He came to the club, he tells me he tried to meet me and tell me about his band and I said: 'Shut up you little turd'."" Happily, the relationship survived this first awkward encounter. ""Since then we've played and we've jammed on and off. He's a very sensitive guitarist, he has a really nice intonation, attack and a really nice sense of music. And we recorded one thing together years ago called 'Hollywood Affair' and we played once on French telly."" Fans of both Depp and Pop have a chance to hear their latest collaboration on the soundtrack of Depp's new film ""The Lone Ranger"" (Depp plays the masked lawman's native American character Tonto) with a rendition of the traditional Gold Rush-era song ""Sweet Betsy from Pike."" ""He called up about this and I think it was late in the game and he didn't have a great cut and with about two weeks to go he said: 'Come on, we gotta get this together so choose a song.' So I tried writing something but it's not my style and 'Sweet Betsy' is just a great great great song and he plays beautifully on it. I just had a great time doing that."" With close friends David Bowie and Lou Reed continuing to stir up the music business and contemporaries The Rolling Stones reaching new musical milestones, Pop remains one of rock's great survivors. ""What's interesting is that for people of our generation that matured in the 1960s, people still seem to be interested. I got to think there was some sorta bump in the quality in that period '65 -- '75. It's pretty much a given that a decent, or better than decent, musician or songwriter is gonna keep doing it in some way throughout their life.""","Iggy Pop is touring Europe with his band The Stooges .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York unveiled their bill Monday to regulate the online and mail-order sale of ammunition, they did so in a state most friendly to Democrats -- New York. But across the country, voters might not be as receptive. Gun control can be seen as political quicksand for Democratic lawmakers. Lautenberg and McCarthy, whose husband was killed and son was injured in a 1993 mass shooting on the Long Island Rail Road, said their bill will help crack down on people anonymously stockpiling ammunition bought through the Internet. Colorado police said the alleged shooter in Aurora this month purchased thousands of rounds of ammunition online. Still, when it comes to gun policy, many congressional Democrats have ""decided to keep quiet and not go there,"" said Alan Lizotte, dean and professor at the State University of New York at Albany's School of Criminal Justice. They remember the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton was able to push through Congress an assault weapons ban and a required waiting period before purchasing handguns. But that move led to a fractious debate over gun policy that, following the Columbine shootings in 1999, ultimately helped sink Vice President Al Gore's chances of winning the 2000 election, in part because of problems persuading white, rural and blue collar voters to pick him, Lizotte said. ""You can push (gun control) through, then bam, Gore loses,"" Lizotte said. ""Politically, I think that was a big mistake for (Clinton). He got it through, and his constituency was happy with him. But it had consequences ... it kills you down the line."" Chastened congressional Democrats, especially those in competitive districts and their leaders, have since given the issue of gun policy wide berth. Even President Barack Obama steered clear of gun rights in his speech in the aftermath of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting and last year after six people were killed during an assassination attempt on Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, in Tucson. Obama mentioned gun safety only in passing after the Tucson shootings to describe the polarizing nature of the issue. Top House and Senate leaders are judiciously sidestepping the issue, even after Obama brought it up during his recent remarks on the movie theater shootings. ""With the schedule we have, we're not going to get into the debate on gun control,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told CNN. ""But I'm very happy, I'm glad the president made the statement because it's something that needs to be done. But we're not going to address gun control."" It would be politically unwise to do so, political experts say, especially during a fierce battle for control of the Senate. With 51 seats, Senate Democrats hold a narrow majority. Senate Republicans have 47 seats and independents -- Bernie Sanders and Joe Lieberman -- tend to vote with Democrats. Party leaders on both sides are watching close Senate races in Virginia and Massachusetts. Democrats are facing tough re-election contests in Missouri and Montana, and there are two open Senate races Nebraska and North Dakota. Three of those states -- Missouri, Montana and North Dakota -- also rank among the highest for the number of background checks for guns, according to a 2010 analysis by the Daily Beast. The report compared 18 months worth of data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System and compared that with state's population data from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2009 estimates to gain a glimpse at the states that are ""the most armed."" According to the analysis, the 10 states with the highest number of background checks for guns voted for Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. The 10 states with the least number of checks voted for Barack Obama. ""You can have a guy who plays well in North Dakota, but if the Republicans paint him as somebody that ... allows liberals on East Coast to take away your gun rights ... (he could run into problems),"" Lizotte said. ""So the leadership has to say 'we're not playing that kind of game'."" Talking about gun policy in those states could alienate the types of voters who are motivated to cast ballots based on a single issue. Those who fight hardest for gun ownership tend to be very vocal, single-issue voters, said Jon Vernick, an associate professor and co-director at Johns Hopkins' Center for Gun Policy and Research, while those who favor stricter control tend to have a range of issues they're pushing. ""The questions for Democrats is whether support for gun violence prevention would truly harm their support among people who might not have voted for them anyway,"" Vernick said. There's also little political incentive for those in tough congressional races to talk about gun policy since several national polls suggest voters are against stricter gun laws, and there's actually been a downturn both in the number of people owning guns overall and gun violence, said Kristin A. Goss, an associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University and author of ""Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America."" For example, a Pew Research Center poll conducted in April, found that 55% of independent voters feel it is ""more important to protect gun ownership than to control guns,"" with 40% saying controlling gun ownership is more important. The poll also found that 72% of Republicans feel protecting gun ownership is important, while 27% of Democrats feel that way. Those who advocate stricter gun control lost the messaging battle long ago, Goss said. ""Historically the pro-control side has struggled to come up with a compelling narrative that will help people come over to the case of stricter gun control laws,"" Goss said. ""For a long time, these gun violence rates and massacres spoke for themselves. They relied on that to make the case but were up against a very powerful and very well-disciplined and skillful army that was good at taking those arguments apart."" They are also skilled at how they target their campaign contributions. For example, during the 2010 midterm elections, fiscally moderate Blue Dog Democrats in tough re-election fights represented roughly half of the top 20 recipients of contributions from the National Rifle Association, according to data collected by the campaign-finance website OpenSecrets.org. The candidates -- many of whom hail from rural regions in Southern and Western states where gun ownership is deeply cherished -- each received nearly $10,000 from the NRA that year. In 2008, only one Democrat made the top 20 list, Florida Democrat Tim Mahoney, who netted an NRA endorsement and contested the constitutionality of the District of Columbia's gun ban in a Supreme Court brief. He received $12,400. This year so far, only three Democrats made the top 20 list and received donations of roughly $5,000. All three either lost primaries or retired, out of the running for the fall election. Still, in New York, Lautenberg and McCarthy know the political reality, but they see their fight as bigger than politics. ""It's one thing to buy a pair of shoes online,"" Lautenberg told reporters Monday. ""But it should take more than a click of the mouse to amass thousands of rounds of ammunition."" CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report .","Bill aims to curb online ammo sales, though election losses make Democrats hesitant .

"(CNN) -- Mother Nature showed her extremes across the United States on Tuesday, with another day of dangerously hot temperatures broiling the Southwest while parts of the Northeast grapple with flooding from torrential storms. Temperatures across much of the West will soar 10 to 20 degrees above average on Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. Forecasters issued excessive heat warnings for large swaths of California, Nevada and Arizona through the Fourth of July. By noon, the mercury had hit 98 degrees at Reno, Nevada; 109 at Las Vegas; 104 at Yuma, Arizona; and 118 in Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley -- where the heat was so intense over the weekend that it melted shoes. Triple-digit forecasts were posted as far north as Spokane, Washington, and the Idaho panhandle. ""Many of the same locations that broke records recently could shatter records again on Tuesday,"" the weather service said. That's dreadful news for much of California, Nevada and Arizona, states that have all seen temperatures top 120 degrees in the past few days. Forecasters in Las Vegas noted that a similar heat wave in 2005 killed 17 people. They urged neighbors and relatives to check on those most susceptible to heat-related illness -- children, the elderly and the chronically ill. ""This is a life-threatening heat event for those at risk,"" the advisory warned. Heat hurts your insides, too . Because heat stroke or heat exhaustion can strike within minutes, hundreds of Las Vegas residents have sought relief in a Salvation Army cooling shelter. ""Not only do they get (from) the cooling station the benefit of the water that we put out, but they can also take showers, if they need to, in here for free,"" Andre Ingram of the Salvation Army said. He said anyone who comes in can get as much ice-cold water as they need, when ""normally they walk around just looking for it."" The extreme heat is hindering efforts to stop Arizona's Yarnell Hill wildfire, which has scorched more than 8,400 acres -- about 13 square miles of land. The fire killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad on Sunday when fierce, erratic winds whipped the fire in different directions. Parched land from Arizona's drought is also fueling the fire. East Coast deluged by rain . Much of Arizona would love to get more rain. But residents on the East Coast are seeing too much of a good thing. Showers and storms will stretch from Florida to New England through Thursday, dampening the Independence Day holiday, the National Weather Service said. That's on top of the rainfall that quickly flooded parts of New Jersey on Monday and stranded motorists in Paramus. ""I didn't think that was going to happen, but it was up to my knee when I got out of my car,"" Caroline McCourt told CNN affiliate WABC. Thunderstorms also produced three small tornadoes in Connecticut and New Jersey on Monday, but there were no reported injuries, the weather service and local authorities said. An EF-1 twister with a top estimated wind speed of 86 mph skipped across 2.5 miles of Windsor and East Windsor, Connecticut, knocking down trees and blowing out electrical transformers there, Windsor Locks Police Capt. Chester Degray said. An EF-0 -- which packs winds between 65 mph and 85 mph -- touched down in Greenwich, Connecticut, about 35 miles north of New York, inflicting similar damage, the weather service said. Another EF-0 went through Berkeley Heights, New Providence and Summit, New Jersey, about 15 miles west of Newark. Drivers in Durham, North Carolina, also had to push their cars out of floodwaters on Monday. And the flooding could get worse -- cities from Georgia to New England could see 2 to 3 more inches of rain in the next few days. CNN's Matt Smith, Lawrence Crook, Morgan Winsor, Dan Simon and Ivan Cabrera contributed to this report.","NEW: Triple-digit temperatures forecast as far north as Spokane .

"Washington (CNN) -- As the nation sent up a collective wail of grief over the 27 people slaughtered in Newtown, Connecticut, last week, the nation's leading gun rights lobby remained silent. Until now. The National Rifle Association, with roughly 4.3 million members, deactivated its Facebook page, had stopped tweeting on its Twitter account and had been issuing a ""no comment"" to any media outlet, including CNN, seeking a response. But late Tuesday, the group broke that silence with a statement: . ""The National Rifle Association of America is made up of four million moms and dads, sons and daughters -- and we were shocked, saddened and heartbroken by the news of the horrific and senseless murders in Newtown. Out of respect for the families, and as a matter of common decency, we have given time for mourning, prayer and a full investigation of the facts before commenting. The NRA is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again,"" the group said. It plans to hold ""a major news conference"" on Friday and both their Facebook and Twitter presences are active again. But despite the relative radio silence early on from the powerful lobbying group's offices in Fairfax, Virginia, the organization is regrouping in anticipation of a massive legislative push to introduce or, in some cases, reintroduce gun control legislation, say former NRA officers and gun policy experts. They hadn't really spoken, some say, because they didn't have to do so. At least, not yet. NRA laid groundwork against new gun laws . Kristin Goss, an associate professor of public policy and political science at Duke University and author of ""Disarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in America,"" said that strategy is part of the organization's playbook after an incident such as this one. ""The typical pattern is something horrific happens. There is a national outcry, mourning. People call for a national conversation on gun control. Gun rights proponents lay low,"" Goss said. ""They're used to seeing this cycle express condolences and hope the attention will shift to a new issue."" When the NRA does speak in detail, it will do so forcefully and with the type of political sway and heft the pro-gun lobby has carefully amassed over dozens of election cycles, experts say. ""When the emotions come down, I'm sure you'll hear the NRA address this issue. It'll be in January when legislation is introduced. They'll testify at hearings. You'll hear the same kind of arguments that I'd come up with,"" said Richard Feldman, who served as regional political director for the NRA during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group, the Independent Firearm Owners Association. When that happens, the group will wield the full power of its millions of members and leverage the $17 million it spent in federal races this year helping elect candidates who it considers supporters of the NRA's mission, said policy experts. Polls suggest public opinion may be changing . ""What we're likely to see is the NRA being a part of the behind-the-scenes conversation,"" said Scott Melzer, an associate sociology professor at Albion College in Michigan and author of the book ""Gun Crusaders: The NRA's Culture War."" That's because in Washington's halls of power, what takes place behind closed doors often has more impact that what happens in the public eye. And money speaks volumes. During the 2012 election cycle, the NRA donated $719,596 to candidates. Republicans received $634,146 of that, according to the Center for Responsive Politics' analysis of federal campaign data. For example, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, ranked among the top five recipients, having received $7,450 in this cycle. For the NRA, as with any good lobbying group, ""democracy"" is about ""putting your money where your mouth is,"" Feldman said. Newtown shooter's guns: What we know . According to the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group, the NRA spends 66 times more on lobbying than what the Brady Campaign to End Gun violence, the country's top gun control advocacy organization, spends. And the NRA spends 4,143 times what the Brady Campaign spends on campaign contributions, the Sunlight Foundation found. But the group's political power isn't just about money. ""If you took money out of politics, that wouldn't weaken the NRA. It would make it stronger. What NRA can do that (Mayor Michael) Bloomberg can't do is communicate with millions of people who care about this issue,"" Feldman said. Even Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who has had a mixed history on the issue of gun control, paid homage to the group during the general election. His first speech to a conservative audience after the contentious GOP primary season was at the NRA's annual meeting this spring, a speech in front of more than 60,000 gun enthusiasts in St. Louis. Lawmakers on gun control: 'This one feels different' In 2012, the group marshaled forces to lobby on more than 60 measures, including ""a bill to prohibit the Department of Justice from tracking and cataloging the purchases of multiple rifles and shotguns,"" according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. The legislation was sponsored by Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester and co-sponsored by 34 Republican and moderate Democrats, including West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin. Manchin is among a small group of conservative Democrats with high rankings from the NRA for pro-gun rights legislative stances who has suggested revisiting gun control policies. However, on the Sunday after the Newtown shooting, not one of the 31 pro-gun rights senators with high NRA rankings agreed to go on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" or CBS' ""Face the Nation."" The risk of daring to disagree with the NRA . House members are similarly concerned. ""There are many single-issue gun rights voters and Republicans -- who now control the House of Representatives -- know it's a bad move to vote (against the NRA),"" said Melzer said. ""That's a sure way to ensure there will be a primary opponent."" In the meantime, gun control advocates are hoping to capitalize on the bizarre rhythm that has become all too familiar in the wake of the nation's mass shootings. However, when the NRA goes quiet, the normally outgunned opposition moves into high gear. Guns and Congress . That's because they know that after they mourn for the dead, there's not much time, money or a broader platform to make their case for change before most people move on in their lives, said Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns. His group has spent 20-hour days on staff calls, legislative strategy sessions and fielding calls from gun violence survivors and celebrities and mayors who want to sign on. ""Look,"" Glaze said, ""when this kind of thing happens, we have to make the case in that very short window -- what went wrong, why it went wrong, how you can fix it -- in a way that motivates Congress to do what it should."" The Brady Campaign to prevent Gun Violence was on Capitol Hill on Tuesday with members of a new community group, Newtown United. Newtown United tries to tackle the rough world of gun control policy . Josh Horwitz with the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence said his group just hired temporary staff to deal with hundreds of new volunteers who want to help after Newtown. There's usually a narrow window to make an impact, gun control advocates say. But this time, things may be different. ""With something as terrible as this is, involving children, the window is open a little wider than it has been before,"" Glaze said. ""I think my back of the envelope is usually about a month. But after the series of mass shootings and the gravity of this one, I think we may have a little more time."" CNNMoney: Gun industry faces uncertain future .

"(CNN) -- In December, the U.S. Department of Justice intervened under the Voting Rights Act to stay a South Carolina voter ID law. Controversy rages over similar laws in Georgia and Texas. Many expect Justice Department action against the Texas law. (The Georgia law was approved in 2005 by the Bush administration Justice Department.) The argument against voter ID goes as follows: . The most common form of ID in the United States is a driver's license. Nonwhite registered voters are somewhat less likely than whites to have driver's licenses. In South Carolina, for example, the gap is nearly 20%. Therefore, voter ID will have a discriminatory effect. But then we're left with a question: What happens when those minority South Carolinians need social services? How do they identify themselves then? Then, of course, they rely on a Social Security number. But Social Security numbers are notoriously prone to theft, fraud and tampering. The IRS counted more than 400,000 cases of theft of Social Security numbers in the 18 months from mid-2009 to the end of 2011. Surely that is only the tip of the iceberg. You don't sustain a population of 10 million to 12 million illegal aliens without lots and lots of fake Social Security numbers. In other words, the U.S. has created two forms of de facto ID: one (Social Security) that is universal, but not reliable; another (state-issued driver's licenses) that is reliable, but not universal. Obvious question: Why can't we have a system of personal identification that is universal and reliable? Modern technology enables the design of just such a card while also protecting and even enhancing personal privacy. Imagine you are a 22 year old who wants to buy a case of beer. (Or a 66 year old who wants to buy a discount movie ticket.) You present your driver's license that shows on its face your date of birth, and the cashier computes whether you qualify. But that card actually discloses more information than the cashier requires. The cashier is asking a ""yes"" or ""no"" question: 21 or older? 65 or older? Or imagine that you are an employer who wants to check a job applicant's eligibility for work. Again, the card the employer will see presents more information than required. The employer doesn't care whether you are a citizen or a permanent resident or where you were born or when you became a resident alien. He just wants a ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question: Eligible to work? Same thing at the polls. The poll watchers don't need to know whether today is your birthday. They don't need to know your height or weight. They just need to know: Are you who you say you are? And are you eligible to cast a ballot? On its face, it would carry only your name and image. That's all most people need most of the time to confirm your identity; for example, when checking the name on your airline ticket against the person bearing the ticket. But none of the other information that now appears on your driver's license needs to appear there. Not the address. Not the date of birth. No the height or weight. Information beyond face and name would be encrypted inside the card and would be divulged only to specific scanners. Liquor store owners would have machines that could read only the answer to the ""21 or older?"" question. Employers would have machines that could read only the ""eligible to work?"" question. Voting places would read only ""eligible to vote?"" Departments of Motor Vehicles in each of the states could encrypt motorist information onto the card. If you moved to another state, you would not need a new card. A visit to the DMV in the new state would wipe out the obsolete motorist information and substitute the new. Police might have more sophisticated scanners that could read more exactly your address or date of birth or citizenship status. The card would have encrypted information useful to prevent social service fraud; for example, the number of children you have so you can't enroll for more benefits than for which you qualify. The card might also carry encrypted medical information useful in case of emergency such as blood type and allergies to medicines. None of this information would be visible to the casual observer. None would be available except to those with a right and need to access it. The card need not be compulsory. Even in France, supposedly the homeland of Big Government statism, the national ID card is noncompulsory. But the card would add so much convenience to life that most people would want it: one ultrasecure document that smoothed your way through the modern world -- and guaranteed no-questions asked about your rights to vote, work, drive and purchase alcohol. Such a card, available for free to all, should obviate all objections to the seemingly commonsense requirement that we not just ""take your word for it"" when you vote or apply for social benefits. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","The Justice Department is seeking to stop a South Carolina voter ID law .
David Frum says that minorities are much less likely to have most common ID, a driver's license .
He says a new national identity card would enable voting, other government services .
Frum: The card would be free and would be a convenience that people would value ."
"London (CNN) -- After generations of conflict, the clamor of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute has the tendency to drown out other voices and stories from the region. The work of multimedia artist Dor Guez -- whose identity as a Palestinian Christian living in Israel makes him ""a minority within a minority"" -- aims to rectify this. Through the use of video, historical photographs and documents, the Jaffa-based Guez tells the narrative of a marginalized community. ""It's not about supporting one cause or another,"" he says. ""It's about having this voice heard among other voices."" Guez, whose first solo show in the U.K., ""40 Days,"" opens in London's Mosaic Rooms gallery on April 12, focuses on depicting the experiences of the Middle East's Palestinian Christian minorities, including his own family. While his father is of Jewish-Tunisian descent, Guez's mother is a Christian Palestinian, her family hailing from Lod, known in Arabic as al-Lyddan, ancient city 15 kilometers (9 miles) southeast of Tel Aviv. The city is home to the Church of St. George, a major shrine to the 4th-century Christian martyr. ""The cemetery is where my grandfather is buried, my great-grandfather, for many generations back,"" Guez says. ""It can be under Israeli, Turkish, British regime; we have zero control over it, being a weak and small minority -- weak in numbers, not in education. But we have a connection to the place itself."" Read more: A great year for Middle East cinema . When the territory was claimed by the newly declared state of Israel in 1948, the Arabs were expelled, with only about 1,050 remaining. Some of Guez's family resettled in London, Oman and Cairo, but others remained, finding themselves in an ""extremely complicated and difficult"" situation, he says. ""We have pressure from both groups -- the Muslim Palestinians and the Israelis -- to identify with their goals,"" he says. ""I think that in the case of the Christian Palestinians, we really got stuck in between sometimes."" Guez says the community had to negotiate their identity against two majority groups -- Israeli Jews and Muslim Arabs -- displaying a dual attitude towards both groups to protect their identity. On the one hand, he says, they demonstrated their will to integrate, but they also had a clear desire to maintain a distinct cultural identity. ""Both Jewish society and Muslim society fail to understand the versatility of the Christian minority, as well as its religious, social and cultural needs,"" he says. Today, the majority of Palestinian Christians live outside Israel and the Palestinian territories. According to Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there are about 120,000 Christian Arabs in Israel. Guez's art draws heavily on the Christian Palestinian Archive, an electronic database he started that catalogs photographs, passports, birth certificates and other documents from the community's history. It started out as a family archive but quickly snowballed to include members of the Palestinian Christian diaspora throughout the world, he says. ""I started thinking, 'Why don't we as a community have our own archive, when almost every culture around the world has one?' "" he says. ""Obviously, it's because of political reasons. A lot of Christians around the Middle East don't want to build an archive because it will be interpreted as a political act of separation."" Read more: Oman's love for the arts . Omar Al-Qattan, secretary of the board of trustees behind the Mosaic Rooms, said Guez's personal background informed his work. ""He is the product of two conflicting realities -- the creation of the state of Israel which made it possible for his father's Jewish Tunisian family to immigrate to Israel and the dispossession of his mother's family,"" he says. Guez's focus on the fate of the region's minorities was particularly poignant ""in a time of great sectarian tension -- in Egypt, Syria, Iraq and quite possibly elsewhere,"" Al-Qattan says. Guez says his work had provoked strong reactions in Israel. ""Some of them are very supportive, but a lot of them are like, 'You're a traitor -- why should a museum in Israel show the narrative of Palestinians?' "" he says. ""I think that's a part of the dialogue with audience. I would have been surprised if it was received quietly -- not that I think of what I do as something provocative. I don't."" Rather, he says, his work is about asking ""what is nationality"" and ""creating a community through individual voices."" ""I think that what unifies people is a will,"" he says, adding that there are ""many different voices within what we call Palestine. I think that's something that's very important to remember.""","Dor Guez is an artist who has dedicated himself to telling the story of Palestinian Christian communities .

"(CNN) -- Longtime fliers know that look: It's coming from the flight attendant who has already labeled you a Difficult Passenger. Maybe you're taking up too much space in the overhead bins or want to visit the bathroom while people are still boarding. Or you won't shut off your cell phone the first time he or she asks. Or maybe you're not doing anything at all. As 109 high school seniors and chaperones learned Monday morning, flight attendants have the power to remove passengers from a flight if they're not following directions -- or if they think you're not. Many commenters on CNN.com's Facebook page blamed the students. ""The flight crew should not have to tell you to turn your phone off and sit down,"" wrote one commenter. ""I support the crew and making a safe flight for the rest of the passengers."" Wrote another: ""Sounds like a lot of bratty kids would not do as asked. You need to do as instructed the first time. End of story."" Boarding is not the time to stand out on an airplane. How safe is your carry-on bag? What's a flier to do? CNN.com asked some consumer air travel experts for their advice for avoiding any conflict with the flight attendants who are (mostly) trying to get you to your destination. Before trouble starts, here are their suggestions for making your journey smoother. Show some kindness. Try starting your boarding process by saying ""Good morning"" or ""Hello"" as you would your co-worker or your child's teacher -- and you might stand out as a courteous traveler. Flight attendants deal with every personality under the sun, and not everyone is polite to them. They are human beings who could save your life in a dangerous situation. Aviation blogger Johnny ""Jet"" DiScala always greets his flight attendants when boarding and sometimes even gives them a box of chocolates. ""Right away, they say 'Thank you so much,' "" he said. ""Most of them are very appreciative because no one is nice to these guys."" Follow directions. ""It's easy,"" says consumer blogger Chris Elliott. ""You keep your head down and do exactly what the flight attendants say without questioning them."" That means putting your carry-on bags away, sitting down, buckling up and turning off your electronic devices, maybe even before anyone says so. If they don't have to worry about you, they will pay attention to others. Boarding is not the time to argue your hypothesis about cell phone interference with an airplane's navigation equipment. Wait till your WiFi-enabled plane reaches 10,000 feet to write e-mails to the Federal Aviation Administration or the Federal Communications Commission, which make the rules about electronics on flights. Creative takes on in-flight entertainment . Don't smell. There are other ways to get kicked off a plane. You might not be able to control your children. You might not be able to handle your own luggage. Your food might be stinking up the aircraft. You -- yes, you -- might smell. ""Shower before you board, try not to have any special needs, like luggage that needs to be lifted into the overhead compartments, and don't fly with a screaming baby or fidgety toddler. All of those things can be grounds for getting removed from a flight before takeoff,"" says Elliott. ""But mostly, don't give your flight attendants any lip."" Educate your children in advance. Whether your child is 5 or 15, parents need to prepare them for the rules they have to follow while at an airport or on an airplane. It's good for younger children to practice clearing security, buckling their seat belts, turning off their electronics and tucking their things under the seat in front of them. If they do it as soon as they board the aircraft, no flight attendant will see them as potential rule violators. How do you stay out of trouble and ensure a good ride on an airplane?

"Guatemala City (CNN) -- Software pioneer John McAfee ended the day Thursday as he started it: imprisoned in a Guatemalan immigration detention center. Earlier, a neon green ambulance had whisked the 67-year-old to a police hospital just hours after officials rejected his bid for asylum. McAfee's legal team said doctors were treating him for cardiovascular problems. Later, attorney Telesforo Guerra offered a different diagnosis: McAfee had suffered a nervous breakdown, but tests showed he did not have heart problems. The series of events were the latest dramatic twists in a saga that reads like a best-selling mystery, with poisoned dogs, a dead neighbor and international intrigue fueled by weeks on the run. The next chapter could unfold in Belize, where Guatemalan officials said they were preparing to deport McAfee after rejecting his asylum bid. Police in Belize are ready to meet McAfee at the airport if he's deported, spokesman Raphael Martinez said. Authorities there have said they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 shooting of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. Under Belize law, McAfee can be held for 48 hours without charges, Martinez said. But McAfee's fight to stay in Guatemala isn't over. His attorneys said they filed a request for an injunction with Guatemala's Supreme Court. Standing outside the police hospital as ambulance lights flashed nearby, attorney Karla Paz said officials had unjustly rejected McAfee's petition without weighing the evidence. ""Due process has been violated. The right to defense has not been respected,"" she said. Read more: McAfee's exit from Belize ends in detention . Guatemalan authorities took McAfee into custody Wednesday on accusations of entering the country illegally. After weeks in hiding, anti-virus software company founder emerged publicly Tuesday in Guatemala's capital, hundreds of miles from the Caribbean island in Belize where his next-door neighbor was found dead. McAfee requested asylum in Guatemala, arguing that he left Belize to escape police persecution. But Guatemalan authorities found there was no basis for his asylum request, presidential spokesman Francisco Cuevas said Thursday. McAfee founded his namesake computer security software in 1987, initially running it out of his home in California. He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994 and moved to Belize in 2008. On November 9, he told police someone poisoned his four dogs there. To put them out of their misery, he shot each in the head and buried them on his property, according to a former girlfriend. The dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between the two neighbors. Two days after the dogs were poisoned, Faull was found fatally shot in the head. McAfee has said he had nothing to do with Faull's death, and Belize authorities are out to get him because he refused to pay a bribe to a politician months earlier. Belize police say they only want to talk with McAfee. ""He's really gone out of his way to make the country look bad,"" Martinez, the police spokesman, said earlier this week, ""and we just believe he should, if he's innocent as he's saying he is, he should bring in his lawyer, and let's get to the bottom of this and say what he needs to say and let's move on.""

"London (CNN) -- There are few people in the world lucky enough to form a close relationship with a Leonardo da Vinci painting. New York-based conservator Dianne Dwyer Modestini is one: She spent hundreds of hours lovingly restoring ""Salvator Mundi,"" da Vinci's newly rediscovered painting of Christ. And, says Modestini, when she finally had to say goodbye to the painting it was like enduring a painful break-up. ""I'm quite serious,"" she said. ""It was a very intense picture and I felt a whole slipstream of artistry and genius and some sort of otherworldliness that I'll never experience again,"" she said. She describes suffering separation anxiety and depression over losing the painting, and with it her connection to the enigmatic painter who was its author. For art historians, the lengthy and emotional process of conserving a great masterwork is both a privilege and an overwhelming responsibility. ""People say, 'How can you touch it, it's so scary,'"" said Modestini, who is Senior Research Fellow and Paintings Conservator for the Samuel H. Kress Program at the Conservation Center of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. ""I wasn't frightened of it in those ways -- that it's one of 16 paintings, it's worth x amount of dollars -- because I would have been paralyzed, I wouldn't be able to work like that,"" she continued. Of course, when Modestini started work in 2005, she didn't know she was dealing with the first da Vinci painting to be discovered in over 100 years, worth, according to some estimates, around $200 million. The painting, now authenticated, revealed its identity little-by-little during the conservation treatment. Modestini started the process using solvents to clean off some of the murky varnish and over-paint that was concealing the painting's true identity. Within just a few hours during her first session with it, she was able to see the work much more clearly. ""It's very mysterious, the things that happen to paintings,"" she said of the over-paint job. ""People forget or they begin to doubt the original opinion of the person who originally said it was by Leonardo and particularly if it's been badly repaired. They might not understand what's underneath -- it happens to pictures all the time,"" she continued. The next step was to take the cracked painting apart and piece it back together again, a procedure that took about a year. ""It is quite a delicate process,"" said Modestini. ""It has to be very precise."" Then, she had to make re-touches to the badly damaged areas, refining Christ's eyes and lips. It was a particularly difficult and lengthy part of the process because, she said, she had ""to make the decision of what to touch and what to leave alone."" ""I wanted (to be sure) that none of my restorations had impinged on the original, that I had not done too much, because old pictures have to look old -- if you take out every crack, every spot, every anomaly, they can easily look like a reproduction,"" she said. Larry Keith is the Director of Conservation at the National Gallery in London and responsible for the conservation of da Vinci's ""The Virgin of the Rocks,"" which is in the gallery's collection. This treatment involved cleaning off the layers of yellow, foggy varnish, applied in a previous restoration process, ""to allow the picture to saturate properly so you can see the full total range of thematic relationships that are there in the painting,"" said Keith. The process of cleaning this particular painting took 18 months, he said. It is is now on view at the National Gallery as part of the exhibition ""Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan"" along with ""Salvator Mundi."" He agrees that the job of conserving such a masterpiece is an honor few are lucky to have. ""It's wonderful to see the picture in a different light and conditions and over the course of a treatment, you do get very close to a picture,"" he said. As to whether he felt close to Leonardo da Vinci while working on the painting, he said: ""I suppose you do, in as far as anyone can get close to Leonardo."" ""There's a certain mystery at the core of him I think, but it's true, you're in very close contact for a long time and it's a very privileged role,"" he concluded.","Two recently restored paintings by Leonardo da Vinci on view at London's National Gallery .

"(Oprah.com) -- My childhood home-four-bedroom colonial in a Washington, D.C., suburb-had an exquisite exterior. But inside there was too much furniture crowding every room; too many Sears receipts spilling from end tables with too many drawers; too many televisions, with their confusing array of remotes, making too much noise; too many boxes of yellow cake mix aging in the overstuffed pantry; too many shoes and coats crammed into the hall closet, making it impossible to find the ones I needed in a hurry. Don't get me wrong: Ours was never one of those unsanitary houses you see on hoarding shows. It was just uncomfortably full, like a belly straining against a belt while its owner made room for one more pie and seven more mini-muffins. The problem was my mother, who had trouble parting with anything she thought someone she loved might someday need from her (in other words, anything). My father vacillated between resister and accomplice. In my more enlightened moments, I imagine that if I had grown up as they did, in a poor village in Pakistan, I, too, might have held on a little too tightly once fortune finally favored me. But as a child, I felt as though I were drowning. I remember coming home from school to find things in my closet-wrapping paper, extra blankets-that didn't belong there. In protest, I'd toss these intruders into the hall. Then as now, clutter had a physical effect on me. The sight of knickknacks caused my left shoulder to rise and fall, tic-like, as if trying to shake something off. Oprah.com: Break your bad habits for good . Since leaving home for college, I've been making up for lost space. The home I currently share with my two sons looks from the outside like the one I grew up in-gorgeous redbrick, huge yard-but inside, there are no walk-in closets. No kitchen pantry. And gloriously, no garage. There are no coffee tables, because with them comes coffee-table clutter. No televisions, because their sidekicks are remote controls and piles of DVDs. If a decorator walked through my home, she'd recommend an ottoman here and there, a decorative accessory for the hallway, or end tables to cradle the telephones that sit on the hardwood floor in front of the jacks. She'd suggest art for my untouched walls. She might wonder why there's no dining table in the dining room. It's not that I dislike decorations; I truly admire beautifully appointed homes. My laundry room holds tightly taped boxes full of mementos from my travels. I just can't figure out how to put them up without turning into a woman who has animal statues flanking her front door. I fear that if I start, my DNA strands-with their broken C gene-might eventually strangle me, leaving me writhing in a pile of throw pillows. Surely children of alcoholics are just as careful about taking that first drink. Oprah.com: What Oprah knows for sure about finding the fullest expression of yourself . Though my home is empty of the extraneous, it never feels empty enough. I frequently walk around with a cardboard box hunting for donation targets. For me, de-cluttering is an itch that pleads, then demands, to be scratched. If something's not being used this very moment, or on the cusp of being used, it's out. There's no ill-fitting clothing in my home, save the two onesies I held on to from my sons' baby days-and one small box of prepregnancy pants that keep me jogging. I purge my closet seasonally, tossing anything that isn't earning its keep. What have you done for me lately, red sweater? When they've sat unused too long, mocking me, I've evicted my hair dryer, curling iron, patio furniture, any coffee mug with words on it, and my broiler pan. I understand that most ovens come with a broiler pan. What I don't understand is, why? Why don't we get a choice in the matter? I have no baking pans, either. In an emergency, tinfoil is quite foldable and durable. I adore items with multiple uses, especially paper towels. In my house, these magic little squares moonlight as dinner napkins, place mats, sponges, dishrags, sometimes toilet paper, and, occasionally, ambitiously, maxipads. But even paper towels I cannot stand to stock up on. Since I discovered Amazon's Subscribe & Save service, they arrive on my doorstep monthly, in a perfectly synchronized dance of use and replacement. One thing I've been unable to get rid of is the outdoor garbage can that my home's previous residents left behind. Do you know how hard it is to throw away a trash can? I've tried cute notes with smiley faces; I've stuck the can inside my own, but the garbage collectors refuse to take the thing. It grates on me daily to see that green monstrosity leaning against my house. Sometimes I force myself to use it, to justify its existence. To me, making do with less-almost to the point of deprivation-feels like a slightly demented badge of honor, a silent scream that says, Look, Mom, no extras! But more often than I'd like to admit, it turns out that I actually do need an item that I've given away, and I'm forced to repurchase it. Two years ago, I donated my treadmill because I joined a gym. A year later, I quit the gym because I wasn't spending enough time there-and paid $1,400 for a new treadmill. Two springs ago, I donated my space heaters to my children's school, because... well, it wasn't cold anymore. As it turned out, the frost returned the following winter, and I had to shell out $70 a piece for four new heaters. I once donated a Pakistani cookbook to Goodwill because I had the distressing feeling there might be another one somewhere in my house. I realized later that I'd written some family recipes on the back, so I had to repurchase my own book. Oprah.com: Organizing solutions for every room . My greatest de-cluttering challenges are Zain, 11, and Zach, 8, who adore useless stuff just as much as I abhor it. On some days, I fantasize about tossing all their toys and books and papers, the daily avalanche that flows from their backpacks. It's a pipe dream I know I will regret entertaining once they are grown. And grow they will, into men who will tell their balanced, bewildered wives that their mom never let them bring home stuffed animals or pogo sticks or water guns from their grandparents' house. They'll recount that they owned one pair of sneakers at a time, plus dress shoes for holidays, because I didn't want the hall closet cluttered. That their desire to display Lego creations and chess trophies buttressed against my obsessive resistance to blemished surfaces. ""I can't stand so much stuff everywhere,"" I recently blurted, surveying the four books and magic wand strewn atop Zach's nightstand. ""Stand it, Mom,""he replied, not unkindly. Zain, meanwhile, defiantly displays a framed photo of his fourth-grade Wizard of Oz cast party on his desk. I once hid it in the laundry room, hoping he would forget about it. A year later, I felt guilty enough to return it to him. Now he is lobbying to put up a Harry Potter poster. I have engineered a compromise: He can put up whatever he wants, but on the inside of his closet doors. Oprah.com: 3 smart new ways to kick pessimism to the curb . Occasionally, I worry that I'm depriving my sons of the same sense of control over their environment that I longed for as a child. I cringe at the thought that they might not want to come home for spring break to a house with no television to watch the hockey game on, and no coffee table to prop their feet on while they watch it. My former husband, who recycled himself two years ago, never shared my fear of clutter but kindly kept his collection of African masks at the office. The first thing I noticed about his new digs was the decorative table that existed solely to display photos of our boys: dozens of pictures of their fully frame-worthy faces. He also had flat-screen TVs. For a moment, I admired his ability to balance his own aesthetics with the needs of others. I doubted that, with his full larders and healthy attitude, he'd ever have trouble drawing anyone into his home to lean against a throw pillow and watch the game. Then I retreated to my own gloriously uncluttered home, whose clarity rises up to embrace me as I enter the front door. I picked up a stray sneaker and admired a drawing poking out from a backpack. Eventually I sat, with a mug of coffee that had no words on it, on a couch with just enough pillows to make a decent nest. I thought about how lucky I am to live in this perfect, unencumbered space with my two perfect, if cluttery, children. I thought about how everything in this house is here because of a carefully considered decision. Myself included. Ironically, I've lived for the past two years in my parents' real estate clutter, an extra home in a great school district they purchased when I was 3 and held on to for the absurd reason that someday, someone they loved might need it.

"(CNN) -- Last week world No. 1 Novak Djokovic wanted to win this year's French Open to complete his collection of grand slam titles, now he wants the trophy for a more pressing reason -- to honor the death of his ""second mother"". Jelena Gencic, who coached Djokovic for five years from when he was just six, died on Saturday. The potential impact of the 77-year-old's death on her Serbian compatriot was deemed to be so great that Djokovic's management team kept the news from him until after he had beaten Grigor Dimitrov in Saturday's third round. Djokovic's reaction backed up their assessment as the 26-year-old canceled his post-match news conference, issuing an apology to the media as he did so. On Monday, he paid tribute to his mentor shortly after seeing off Philipp Kohlschreiber 4-6 6-3 6-4 6-4 to reach this year's quarterfinals at Roland Garros. ""She's one of the most incredible people I ever knew,"" he told reporters. ""Jelena was my first coach and was like my second mother. ""We were very close throughout my whole life and she taught me a lot of things that are part of me, part of my character today. I have the nicest memories of her and these will stay with me forever. ""I think it was the right thing to give me the news after the match (against Dimitrov),"" he added. ""Regardless of the timing, it was still a shock."" A beaten finalist in Paris last year -- when he lost out to Roland Garros record breaker Rafael Nadal -- Djokovic last saw Gencic in February, shortly before the start of the Dubai Open. Yet his last conversation with a woman who also helped develop the talents of grand slam champions Goran Ivanisevic and Monica Seles came far more recently. ""I remember the last conversation we had two weeks ago about Roland Garros, and she told me, 'Listen, you have to focus, you have to give your attention to this tournament. This is a tournament you need to win.' ""She was giving me this kind of inspiration and motivation even more. So now I feel in her honor that I need to go all the way. ""But it's not about me only. There are so many great players still around in the tournament. It gives me that inner strength to push even harder."" In a recent interview, Gencic said she spotted Djokovic's potential almost from the moment she first met him in Belgrade. ""When I met him I knew immediately that he was different. I told his father that he was an exceptional talent and that one day he will be a big champion,"" said a woman who represented the former state of Yugoslavia at both tennis and handball. After he won Wimbledon for the first -- and to date -- only time in 2011, Djokovic visited Gencic as part of his celebrations. And the world number one says Gencic, who was recently battling breast cancer, has inspired him to work with young tennis players in the future. ""She was 77 years old, and before she passed away two days ago, last week she was giving lessons to kids,"" he said. ""I hope to follow on from where she stopped. She gave so much knowledge and I feel I have a responsibility to carry on that work. ""She never married, never had children. She was dedicated to tennis, the kids and coaching."" ""I know that her spirit will be always with me and always on the tennis court, because this is what she always loved to do. It's her favorite place in the world and I'll make sure that her legacy continues."" If the Serb is to provide his perfect send-off for Gencic by winning Roland Garros for the first time - and thus become only the eighth man to achieve the career grand slam - he must first beat Tommy Haas, who is also chasing history. When the number 12 seed beat Russia's Mikhail Youzhny, the German became the oldest man to reach the quarterfinals of a grand slam since Andre Agassi in 2005 and the oldest to do so in Paris since 1971. Once ranked number two in the world, Haas, 35, missed the entirety of the 2013 season after twice undergoing should surgery -- but is now one of four players over 30 in the quarterfinals along with Roger Federer, David Ferrer and Tommy Robredo. ""I think we all just are smarter about how we train, about how we eat, about how we do recovery,"" he said. ""The physical and fitness areas have improved a lot in sports in general. I think that's why you see maybe more people also in the early, mid-30s doing well."" At least one man over the age of 30 will reach the semifinals, since Ferrer and Robredo meet in the quarters, while Federer will take on local hope Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, a relative strapling at the age of 28. Age was also on the minds of those watching Rafael Nadal on Monday, with the Parisian crowd singing 'Happy Birthday' to a man who celebrated his 27th birthday in style. Bidding to become the first man in tennis history to win eight titles at the same major championship, Nadal won 6-4 6-1 6-3 against 13th seed Kei Nishikori, the first Japanese man in the fourth round since Fumiteru Nakano in 1938. ""It's a very special moment,"" said Nadal of the crowd's decision to break into song. ""Kei is a great player and he is getting better every season. But today I think I played my best match of the tournament."" Nadal will play Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarterfinals after the Swiss beat Frenchman Richard Gasquet in a thrilling match, with the ninth seed rallying from two sets down to win 6-7 4-6 6-4 7-5 8-6.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic pays tribute to first coach Jelena Gencic after reaching quarters .

"(CNN) -- A second suspect in the killing of British soldier Lee Rigby was charged Saturday with murder, London's Metropolitan Police said. Michael Adebolajo, 28, also was charged with attempted murder of two police officers and possession of a firearm, police said. Police said Rigby was killed in a daylight attack a couple of hundred yards away from the Royal Artillery Barracks in the southeast London district of Woolwich on May 22. Rigby was run over by a car and then knifed in the daylight attack, authorities said. Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, 22, were hospitalized after the attack. Adebolajo was released from the hospital into police custody on Friday. Adebowale was charged with murder after he was released from the hospital Tuesday. Adebolajo is scheduled to appear in Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday, police said. The killing has sparked an intense investigation by police. They announced two other arrests in the case Friday, of men seized on suspicion of supplying illegal firearms. Authorities also moved a man arrested on the suspicion of killing Rigby from a hospital to a police station. The charges against Adebolajo follow news of an inquest into Rigby's death. The inquest opened Friday at Southwark Coroner's Court and was quickly adjourned. Detective Chief Inspector Grant Mallon, the senior investigating officer into the death, said two men were incapacitated and detained at the scene of Rigby's death. Slain soldier was a machine gunner, royal palaces drummer, father . In all, 12 people have been arrested, including Adebolajo and Adebowale, in connection with the killing. • Two men, ages 42 and 46, have been taken to a south London police station. One was arrested Friday in north London and the other in east London on suspicion of supplying illegal firearms. • Six others have been freed on bail, the most recent a 50-year-old man arrested Monday night on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. • Two were released without charges. Separately, a man who was arrested after he spoke in an interview about Adebolajo on BBC's ""Newsnight"" has been charged with two counts of dissemination of terrorist publications and one count of encouragement of terrorism. He is Ibrahim Abdullah-Hassan, also known as Abu Nusaybah. The charges are not connected to the Rigby murder investigation, police said. CNN's Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- In the age of short attention spans and mass media hopping from one story to the next, it is fairly remarkable that the shooting death of Trayvon Martin one year ago Tuesday continues to resonate among the consciousness of many Americans. Most of this is because a dedicated group of activists, bloggers, social media afficionadios and members of the media -- mostly the black press -- have been diligent in ensuring that what took place on a cool, rainy night in Sanford, Florida, deserves to be brought out into the open and not to become a drive-by media story. And no doubt the vigilance of Trayvon's parents -- Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin -- has made it hard for people to forget. Since Trayvon was shot and killed after an altercation with George Zimmerman, a one-man neighborhood watch guy, Fulton and Martin have attended many high-profile events like the Congressional Black Caucus Legislative Weekend and the NAACP Image Awards, walking red carpets and telling anyone who would listen that their son should not have died and there was no justice. News: Parents ready to let jury decide fate of son's killer . They have been shepherded through this process by their attorney, Ben Crump, who has transformed his law practice into a 2013 version of what Johnnie Cochran -- famed criminal defense attorney -- was when he was the go-to guy for national social justice legal cases. Crump has become the guy that black parents call when their children, mostly young men, have been shot and killed. Even though the trial of Zimmerman won't take place until June -- almost 16 months after the fatal shooting of Trayvon -- a lot of things have changed and are in the process of being debated. First, while everyone continues to focus on Zimmerman and whether he will invoke a Stand Your Ground law defense, efforts are under way in the Florida Legislature and other states to get rid of such laws, or change them. Florida Democratic State Rep. Alan Williams has introduced a bill in the legislature that would do away with the Stand Your Ground defense, which law enforcement personnel and district attorneys have said makes their job harder in prosecuting shootings. Many believe the Florida legislature won't overturn the law, but changes have been bandied about by the Republican majority, which is a good thing. The death of Trayvon exposed the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a shadowy, corporate-funded group that has been one of the leading forces behind stand-your-ground laws. Once the light hit them, their involvement in other issues, such as voter ID laws, was made public. The ALEC is one of those nondescript groups that were formed to assist corporations to fight tax policies and to advance an economic agenda. But then they use their war chest to expand into other controversial areas, like stand your ground laws. It wasn't until Change.org led petition drives for major corporations to pull out of ALEC that the group disbanded some of their other efforts. Had the consciousness not been raised after Trayvon's death, ALEC would probably still be going about their business writing and pushing for laws that are unjust to many Americans. Trayvon's death also awakened the inner fighting spirit of many young people, as well as African-Americans in sports and entertainment. When the Miami Heat donned black hoodies to show their solidarity with those who protested Trayvon's death, that represented one of the biggest examples of today's sports stars standing up for a social cause. Black history is replete with individuals who made it clear that life wasn't all about sports. Jim Brown, Bill Russell, Kareem Abul-Jabbar, Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson were athletes who refused to hide away in the locker room. They used their platforms to speak about societal ills, and bridged the gap between activism and entertainment. Opinion: What we can learn from Trayvon Martin shooting . The likes of Jamie Foxx, Cedric the Entertainer and so many others in Hollywood have answered the call of activist-entertainer Harry Belafonte to use their celebrity for more than just the next project. They have gone down to Florida to stand in solidarity with Trayvon's parents and bring attention to the issues surrounding his death. But what is most needed -- more than just keeping the focus on Trayvon -- is for his death to spark an uprising of awareness and consciousness, maybe similar to what Emmett Till's death did in 1955. Till's lynching death in Mississippi helped spark the Civil Rights Movement, which radically altered the course of this nation. It's time for America to move beyond the mind-set of me, myself and I, and understand that this is about we, us and our. For every Trayvon Martin, there are thousands of others who don't get the media attention, but they deserve justice, too. This isn't about black or white; it's about what's right and wrong; fair and unfair. No matter what happens in the trial of George Zimmerman, those who marched, protested, tweeted, Facebooked, lit candles and wore hoodies know that without all of that collective action, Zimmerman would be walking around free and would have never seen the inside of a courtroom. Stand-your-ground laws would exist with nary a peep of opposition; and we would all be living our lives as if all is good. One young man ended up dead in Sanford, Florida, on the night of the NBA All-Star Game, but a heckuva whole lot has changed for the better as a result. Trayvon Martin did not die in vain. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Roland Martin: Trayvon Martin's death still resonates among many a year after his death .

"DALAT, Vietnam (CNN) -- Dalat Nuclear Research Institute stands on a mountaintop in Vietnam's southern highlands. The nuclear reactor is not what most Vietnamese think of when they think of Dalat. The town, nestled in pine woods, is Vietnam's favorite honeymoon spot. Highly enriched uranium rods are laid out on a table at the research institute in Dalat, Vietnam. The institute is not a romantic place. Located in a cylindrical, concrete building, it contains a 500-kilowatt, pool-type reactor that had only recently been loaded with Soviet WWR-M2 fuel assemblies. Built in 1963 with U.S. help, it originally contained highly enriched uranium from the United States. In 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, the reactor was closed, then reconstructed by the Soviet Union. In 1983, it reopened, this time using Soviet highly enriched uranium -- a Cold War marriage made in heaven. The institute created medical isotopes and carried out research, but few people if any, in those days thought about the possibility that terrorists might take an interest in the uranium.  Watch experts remove nuclear fuel and show how easily terrorists could hide it » . As I was soon to see for myself, fresh, highly enriched uranium is easy to smuggle. When clad with aluminum, its radiation is detectable only by specialized sensors. Approximately 25 kilograms are all that is needed to make a crude nuclear device. I had never heard of Dalat when, sitting at my desk in Washington last July, I got a call from a contact at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration. A dream I had had several years ago, when I was working in Moscow as CNN's bureau chief was about to come true: CNN was given the green light to be the only television network invited to shoot a secret joint U.S./Russian mission to remove the HEU fuel from the Dalat reactor. The Vietnamese government, once a U.S. enemy, had agreed to give up its HEU in exchange for converting the reactor to low-enriched uranium that cannot be used for a bomb. My contact gave few details over the phone. I went to the Department of Energy for a closed-door briefing. CNN cameraman Charlie Miller and I would travel to Ho Chi Minh City, where we would meet the Department of Energy staff, then fly to Dalat and drive to the reactor. According to DOE ground rules, we would be able to share only a few details of the operation with our senior editors. The timing of the actual transfer of the HEU was classified. We would learn it only after we had arrived in Vietnam. We would not be able to broadcast our report until the nuclear material was back in Russia. After our arrival in Ho Chi Minh City September 11, we, along with a U.S. and a Japanese newspaper reporter, met the other members of the team: two Russian nuclear experts and a representative from the International Atomic Energy Agency -- the nuclear watchdog of the United Nations -- who were to certify completion of the transfer. After a short flight to Dalat, we loaded into a van and set out on the serpentine road toward the research institute, passing ribbons of Vietnamese on motor scooters, the primary mode of transportation here. At the gate, a color poster of Ho Chi Minh greets us. Inside, we don yellow lab coats, cover our shoes with blue throw-away slippers and enter the cavernous room where the reactor stands, towering over us like something out of ""Dr. Strangelove."" The HEU fuel rods have been removed from the reactor and are stored in a large metal case. A Vietnamese scientist fumbles with the keys, then opens the top and begins handing the rods to the Russian experts, who lay them out on a table. The experts are wearing dosimeters to measure the radiation, but only one person wears gloves -- simple, rough cotton ones. They hand me a fuel rod and I hold it in my bare hands. Now I understand just how easy it would be for a terrorist to disguise the fact that he or she was carrying highly enriched uranium. The fuel rod looks for all the world like an aluminum leg to a small table. The experts lead us up steep metal stairs to the top of the reactor. I peer down into the pool of water into which a technician is lowering new fuel rods made of low-enriched uranium. Unlike highly enriched uranium, this fuel cannot be used to make a bomb. The Vietnamese are willing to cooperate, but they also want to verify that this new fuel will work as well as the HEU did. In the control room, they huddle in front of a wall of electronic gauges, waiting until the reactor reaches ""criticality."" As a blue gauge hits the mark, the room fills with applause. Professor Vuong Huu Tan, chairman of the Vietnam Atomic Energy Commission, tells me ""the most important part of the reactor is training our people in nuclear energy."" This is the other part of the equation: By complying with the U.S./Russian effort to remove vulnerable nuclear materials, Vietnam assures it will get international support for its quest to build nuclear power plants to generate energy. Both U.S. and Russian companies are eyeing Vietnam as a potential market. The Russians wrap the fuel rods in plastic, then insert them into two large, steel cylinders. The IAEA expert seals them. If they're tampered with, it will be obvious. The next day, a flatbed military truck backs into the reactor room. A crane lifts the cylinders and gently lays them on the truck's wooden bed as a Vietnamese military officer, in olive drab, looks on. The final and most vulnerable phase of the operation begins. The truck drives through the reactor gates and joins a convoy guarded by armed soldiers. Sirens blaring, we set out in a slow procession, weaving down the mountain road, traffic police on motorcycles waving riders on motor scooters out of the way. At Dalat's airport, the truck wheels onto the tarmac and stops near a Vietnamese military helicopter. A forklift lowers the cylinders to the ground and six soldiers heave them in slings to the helicopter. From there, they are flown to the military base at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where they are put onto a Russian transport plane. Until the last moment, it is unclear whether the Vietnamese military will allow journalists onto the base. As one soldier tells a member of the nuclear team, ""the last time Americans were here was when you bombed us."" But they do let us in. ""No pictures outside. Just inside the plane."" We climb the stairs into the belly of the Ilyushin 76 and see the two baby-blue cylinders filled with highly enriched uranium, nestled side by side, like two children of the Cold War, ready for a trip back to where they came from: Russia. At 2 p.m., right on schedule, the engines roar and the plane lumbers down the runway, off to its ultimate destination in the Ural Mountains. There, the HEU will be blended into a form that cannot be used for bomb-making. My instincts tell me to grab a phone and call CNN headquarters in Atlanta to report that the plane has taken off, but the embargo is strict: no broadcast until the HEU is safely back on Russian soil. On the sweltering tarmac at a military base in Ho Chi Minh City, as the plane rises in the sky, the team of nuclear experts, the Vietnamese soldiers and even we reporters break into applause. Three countries: Russia, the United States and Vietnam, intertwined in a complex page of history, brought together in a mission to make the world more secure. This is the 13th such mission carried out by the United States and Russia. Altogether, a total of 442 kilograms of fresh HEU from 11 countries, enough to build more than 17 crude nuclear devices, have been removed. But there is more to be done. The two countries still are only halfway there in securing vulnerable nuclear materials around the world.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In a show of force after unrest last week that left 35 people dead, Chinese authorities have ramped up security in the far-western region of Xinjiang. Armed police held rallies in several cities in Xinjiang over the weekend, the local government news website Tianshannet reported. The site carried images showing convoys of armored vehicles and trucks full of police officers in riot gear. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs defended the action Monday, saying the government will ""make every effort to ensure the long-term stability and development in Xinjiang."" The measures follow an outbreak of violence Wednesday in which a group attacked police stations and other government buildings in a remote Xinjiang township, Chinese state-run media said. Authorities have described it as a ""terrorist attack,"" but overseas Uyghur groups have questioned the official version of events. In the violence, 24 people, including two police officers, were killed, state media say, and police shot and killed 11 of the attackers and captured four others who were wounded. State media reported further unrest in a different area of Xinjiang on Friday in which there were an unspecified number of arrests but no casualties. Periodic bursts of violence have hit Xinjiang, a resource-rich region where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. The violence ""poses a great threat to the country,"" Hua Chunying of the Foreign Ministry said Monday. ""People in Xinjiang aspire to stability, development and harmony,"" Hua said. ""The attempts by some groups to harm stability in Xinjiang will never succeed."" Previous unrest . But Wednesday's events appeared to be the deadliest clashes since July 2009, when rioting between Uyghurs and Han Chinese left around 200 people dead and 1,700 injured in Urumqi, the regional capital. As the anniversary of the Urumqi unrest approaches, Chinese authorities are taking a tough line. A senior official from the ruling Communist Party called for armed police squads to carry out patrols around the clock in Xinjiang, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported at the weekend. Meng Jianzhu, secretary of the Party's Commission for Political and Legal Affairs, asked armed police ""to take precautionary and preemptive measures to strike hard on violent terrorist crimes so as to ensure a peaceful and happy life for people of all ethnic groups in the region,"" the agency said. Chinese authorities haven't mentioned the ethnicity of those involved in the unrest Wednesday. State media accounts have described them as ""rioters,"" ""gangsters"" and ""religious extremists."" A Xinhua report Sunday said police had arrested one of them who had been on the run after the clashes. It gave his name as Yiblayan Eli, an apparently Uyghur name. The Xinhua article reported that the group had been planning the attack since mid-June and carried it out after one of its members was arrested Tuesday. Complaints of discrimination . Uyghurs have complained of discrimination by the Han Chinese and harsh treatment by security forces in Xinjiang, despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony. In China as a whole, Han Chinese account for 92% of the population. They now make up about 40% of the population of Xinjiang, where Uyghurs used to be predominant. In April of this year, clashes killed 21 people in Xinjiang's Kashgar prefecture. Regional government officials called those events ""a terrorist act"" carried out by ""mobsters,"" an account that overseas Uyghur groups disputed. ""The increasing frequency with which these incidents occur illustrates the PRC's reticence to address the root causes of the tensions that are escalating,"" said the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), a Germany-based Uyghur advocacy group. It used an abbreviation of People's Republic of China to describe China. ""There is an ever pressing need for the PRC to afford linguistic, cultural and religious freedoms, as well as ceasing politically motivated arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killing, in order to alleviate the recurrence of these needless and avoidable events,"" the WUC said. The U.S. State Department has also commented on the situation, which has irritated Beijing. ""We're deeply concerned about ongoing reports of discrimination against and restrictions on Uighurs and Muslims in China,"" State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said last week. ""And we've urged China to address those counterproductive policies, and we've urged a thorough and transparent investigation into some of this violence."" Hua, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, responded by saying that Chinese authorities protect the rights of ethnic groups in accordance with the law and with respect for their freedom of religion, Xinhua reported. Hua said that the United States has been a victim of terrorism and that Beijing hopes that Washington would avoid using double standards when discussing terrorism.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Hollywood and India's Bollywood have signed a historic cooperation pact that will have the world's two leading film industries working together in areas from production to distribution to content protection. Leaders from the two industries met in Hollywood this week for a two-day session to discuss economic development and collaboration. Signing an official pact at Paramount Pictures Studios in Hollywood, representatives from the two entertainment powerhouses declared to develop and strengthen motion picture production, distribution, technology, content protection and commercial cooperation, according to a release issued by the Motion Picture Association of America. The event was attended by Los Angeles Mayor Anotonio Villaraigosa as well as many of Hollywood's and Bollywood's industry elite. ""This declaration reinforces our city's commitment to attracting international production,"" Villaraigosa said. ""In the past year, we have already seen Hindi movies such as 'My Name is Khan' and 'Kites' filmed in Los Angeles, and we enthusiastically welcome further Indian production in Los Angeles."" Jonathan Kuntz, visiting associate professor at the University of California at Los Angeles' school of theater, film and television, told CNN the agreement appeared to be more an effort by each film industry to hunt for financing in the other country. The pact also seemed a promotional effort by Los Angeles officials to drum up film productions for Hollywood, he said. ""I think the connection will be more at the financial level,"" Kuntz said. Los Angeles officials appeared to be seeking film productions to replace those that have moved to other states or countries where costs are cheaper, he said. ""The fact that it's being presented by the city and the mayor indicates their desire to have more films shot in the Los Angeles area to compensate for all the runaway productions that have gone to other places,"" Kuntz said. Announcing the pact, Bob Pisano, president and interim chief financial officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, called the move an important step in growing both industries. ""The numerous co-productions with Indian studios over the past several years are evidence of a growing bond between our two industries. Today's action is an important step toward furthering that growth,"" Pisano said. Tamil producer and Film Federation of India President L. Suresh compared the collaboration between Hollywood and Bollywood to the close ties developed between the United States and India during the technology boom. ""In addition to the Hindi film industry, the southern and regional Indian film industries also welcome the opportunity to work hand and hand with Hollywood. Already we have seen significant collaboration in technology between Hollywood and South India, and we will soon see collaborations in production,"" Suresh said. Both Hollywood and Bollywood have worked together in numerous co-production and joint investments in the past. According to the Motion Picture Association of America, in March of this year the two joined forces in Mumbai, India, to launch the Alliance against Copyright Theft, a Bollywood-Hollywood content protection coalition in India, .","Leaders from the two huge film industries met in Los Angeles .

"(CNN) -- Women undergoing in-vitro fertilization should have only one or two embryos transferred during the process, depending on their age, says a study published Wednesday in the British medical journal The Lancet. Transferring three or more embryos during any IVF cycle should be avoided when possible, researchers say. The prospective study analyzed more than 124,000 IVF cycles that ultimately led to the birth of more than 33,000 babies from January 2003 to December 2007. The data were obtained via the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, a database of all fertility treatments conducted in the United Kingdom. The study excluded treatment cycles that transferred frozen embryos. The researchers divided the women in to two groups: Women younger than 40 and those 40 and older. The study found that in women 40 and older, transferring more than one embryo resulted in a higher rate of live births. However, transferring three or more embryos in a single cycle also led to a higher rate of health complications for both the mother and the baby, in part because the chance of giving birth to twins or triplets was higher. These two findings led authors to conclude that women who are 40 and older should have two embryos transferred per IVF cycle, while younger women should have only one embryo transferred, and no patients should have more than three embryos transferred at one time. ""We show that even in older women, we should never have more than three embryos transferred,"" says Scott Nelson, one of the study authors who is a professor of reproductive and maternal medicine at the University of Glasgow. ""It doesn't improve the chances of a woman having a healthy baby."" Dr. Glenn Schattman is a reproductive endocrinologist and the president of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART). He agrees that maximizing the chance of a healthy pregnancy while at the same time limiting the chance for multiple births should be the ultimate goal of reproductive clinicians. However he disagrees with the study's interpretation. ""There are limitations of the study that concern me significantly in terms of the conclusions that were drawn,"" says Schattman. In the United States, unlike the United Kingdom, transferring three embryos is more of an acceptable practice if certain prognostic indicators are present. According to Schattman, a woman's age is the most important factor in terms of pregnancy outcome but needs to be looked as a continuous variable. He says one major limitation of Nelson's study is that the women were lumped in to only two groups: those younger than 40 and then the rest, when in reality the chances of a woman getting pregnant can depend on other variables as well. ""We look at women under the age of 35, 35 to 37, 38 to 39,"" and so on, says Schattman. He says transferring three embryos is a valid practice if certain factors are in play, including a woman's age, the number of failed IVF cycles she has already experienced and the quality of her embryo. ""If you limit the number of embryos you put back inside of a 42-year-old woman, you reduce her chance of having a child,"" because implantation rates are so low for a woman that age, says Schattman. Conversely, according to the 2009 embryo transfer guidelines published by SART, a 37-year-old woman could receive three embryos if she had already experienced failed IVF attempts or had poor quality embryos. So what's the bottom line for women considering IVF? Because IVF is an involved, often draining, process, Schattman says doctors need to determine how many embryos will be transferred on a case by case basis. ""We can't set an absolute limit that applies to every person,"" says Schattman. ""Twins are not an ideal outcome and not a desired outcome. You really want to adjust the number of embryos ... to not only maximize the chance of achieving a pregnancy but to counter that with a desire to reduce multiple births.""","Study published in Lancet analyzed more than 124,000 in-vitro fertilization cycles .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Marine believed responsible for the stabbing death of his wife in North Carolina along with a deadly shooting spree some 1,300 miles away in Texas had no known ties to the Lone Star State, authorities there said Wednesday. Lance Cpl. Esteban J. Smith, 23, died Sunday in a shootout with Texas authorities after going on a two-hour rampage that left one person dead and five wounded, according to investigators. Police in Jacksonville, North Carolina, also believe he stabbed his wife to death. Authorities don't know why Smith, an active duty Marine from Bakersfield, California, was 1,300 miles away from his duty station at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, said Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Tuesday, survivors of Smith's Texas shooting spree said they were thankful to be alive. ""I don't know how we survived it,"" Casimiro Solis told CNN affiliate KTAB. He said he and his wife, Charlotte Feldman, were on their way to work in Brady, Texas, when a man police identified as Smith came up to them with a ""dead blank"" look on his face and started firing. Authorities counted 16 bullet holes in their truck. Solis said hardware that attaches the shoulder belt to the truck caused one bullet that would have gone through Feldman to instead ricochet into the truck's top. ""I really thought the side of my face was shot off,"" Feldman told the station. Feldman and Solis suffered only minor wounds in the attack. In addition to Feldman and Solis, police say Smith killed Alicia Torres, 41, in Eola, Texas, shot at two people in Eden, Texas, and wounded Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane just north of Eden in central Texas. Smith died in a firefight with state troopers and a game warden who arrived shortly after that incident. Authorities found an assault rifle, a handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in Smith's pickup. Smith's wife, Rubi Estenania Smith, 21, was discovered dead Sunday afternoon at a motel near Camp Lejeune, according to police in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Police located Rubi Smith's body after agents with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service working on the Texas incident found some sort of evidence on Smith and contacted them for help. Police didn't describe the evidence. It appeared she had been stabbed, police said. Esteban Smith was a Marine rifleman who had served two tours in Afghanistan with the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, according to the Marine Corps. He first deployed to Afghanistan from August 2010 to May 2011, then again from April 2012 until November.

"New York (CNN) -- A film student suspected of stabbing a New York cab driver after learning the driver was Muslim was described Thursday as someone who worked to build bridges across religious and ethnic boundaries. Those who know Michael Enright, 21, a film student at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan, were ""shocked and dumbfounded"" by his arrest, said Robert Chase, the executive director of Intersections International. Enright volunteered with the nonprofit group, and it partially funded his trip in the spring to Afghanistan. As part of his thesis, Enright shot a film on American soldiers serving there, Chase said. Authorities are reviewing multiple journals Enright had on him at the time of his arrest to see if they contain evidence that he had recently undergone some kind of mental or emotional change, a source at New York's City Hall told CNN Thursday. The notebooks are filled with writing, some if it illegible, the source said. Authorities are reviewing Enright's journals for signs that had post-traumatic stress disorder or other emotional stress, the City Hall source said. The goal of Intersections International, based in New York, is to promote peace across faith and racial boundaries, according to its website. ""Everyone was shocked and dumbfounded because of the nature of the crime and because of our experience with him here,"" Chase said. ""It is sadly ironic."" He said Enright volunteered on Intersections International's Veteran-Civilian Dialogue program, which addresses trauma faced by returning veterans and encourages them to share their stories with civilians and each other. ""He was intrigued by the concept and started participating and then volunteering. Enright became involved in the work we do -- building bridges across race, culture and religion and forging common ground for reconciliation and peace,"" Chase said. ""The whole thing is unfathomable,"" he said. ""He's a good guy. His work has been responsible. He's been diligent and hardworking."" Meanwhile, the cab driver, Ahmed Sharif, called for New Yorkers to ""love and respect"" one another. ""This is a city of all colors, races, religions,"" he told a group of supporters outside City Hall. But Sharif said he was targeted because of his faith. ""Of course, it was because of my religion,"" he said, noting that the passenger ""made some jokes about Ramadan,"" the Muslim holy month of fasting, and attacked him after asking him if he was Muslim. ""Sometime I feel very lonely and unsafe,"" said Sharif, who has lived in New York for more than 25 years and has been driving a taxi for 15 of them. After the news conference, Sharif, his wife and four children met with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who gave them gifts that included NYPD hats and ""I Love New York"" T-shirts. ""No matter how wonderful this country and city is, some people act disgracefully,"" Bloomberg told reporters as Sharif stood by his side. ""Fortunately, this is rare, but one time is one time too many. This is America, this is New York; what a disgrace. His wife told me they came to America to make a better life for their wonderful kids."" Enright is facing charges of second-degree attempted murder as a hate crime, second-degree assault as a hate crime, second-degree aggravated harassment as a hate crime, and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon, said New York police Detective Mark Nell. Authorities said Enright was intoxicated at the time of the incident; they found an empty bottle of scotch in a backpack he had with him. When Enright first got into Sharif's cab Tuesday night, the conversation was cordial, said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the Taxi Workers Alliance. The suspect ""started out friendly, asking Mr. Sharif about where he was from, how long he had been in America, if he was Muslim and if he was observing fast during Ramadan,"" Desai said. Then, after a few minutes of silence, Desai said Enright started cursing at Sharif and shouted ""Assalamu Alaikum, consider this a checkpoint,"" before slashing him. ""Assalamu Alaikum"" is an Arabic greeting that means ""peace be upon you."" The taxi workers alliance said Sharif, 43, a practicing Muslim originally from Bangladesh, was slashed across the neck, face, shoulder and hand. Bleeding profusely, Sharif escaped and flagged down a police officer, who arrested Enright, Desai said. New York Gov. David Paterson condemned the attack. ""We cannot and will not allow bias and ignorance to infect our communities and deny our hardworking, innocent residents the respect they deserve,"" he said in a statement. The attack occurs amid public debate over plans to build an Islamic cultural center and mosque to be called Park51 two blocks from the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. ""Right now, the public sentiment is very serious because of the ground zero mosque debate,"" Sharif said in a statement. Paterson said the potential for such violence is one of the reasons ""I have called publicly for a respectful and unifying conversation about the Park51 project,"" he said. ""I continue to offer my assistance for an open dialogue that I believe will help to bring New Yorkers together.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The city of Los Angeles put up $1 million in reward money Sunday for help catching Christopher Dorner, the renegade ex-cop accused of killing three people in a vendetta against his old department. ""We will not tolerate anyone undermining the security, the tranquility of our neighborhoods and our communities,"" Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told reporters. ""We will not tolerate this reign of terror that has robbed us of the peace of mind that residents of Southern California deserve. We will not tolerate this murderer remaining at large."" The offer -- raised in conjunction with businesses, private donors and community groups -- is ""the largest ever offered to our knowledge,"" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said. The hope is it will shake loose a tip that leads to Dorner's eventual conviction. The Los Angeles Police Department says Dorner, a 270-pound, 6-foot former Navy officer, was fired in 2009 for filing a false complaint of excessive force against his training officer. In an interview aired Sunday on CNN affiliate KCBS, Beck called Dorner a ""trained assassin"" but said he wouldn't be harmed if he gave himself up. ""If you turn yourself in, then you will be safe and nobody else has to die,"" he said. ""If you don't, if you decide to try to take the life of another Los Angeles police officer or their family member, then you'll have to suffer the consequences."" Amid the manhunt, the LAPD beefed up security at Sunday night's Grammy Awards show ""out of an abundance of caution,"" police Cmdr. Andy Smith said. And Villaraigosa said authorities are confident they'll catch Dorner. ""This search is not a matter of if. It's a matter of when,"" Villaraigosa said. ""And I want Christopher Dorner to know that."" Chief calls it 'domestic terrorism' Dorner accused his training officer of kicking a mentally ill man during an arrest in 2007. The LAPD ruled the complaint unfounded and kicked Dorner off the force for filing a false complaint. He challenged his firing in court and lost. In a manifesto released last week, he blamed racism and corruption in the department for his removal and vowed to wage ""unconventional and asymmetrical warfare"" against LAPD officers and their families. He called it a ""last resort"" to clear his name and strike back at a department he says mistreated him. Beck had a different term for it Sunday. ""This is an act -- and make no mistake about it -- of domestic terrorism,"" he said. ""This is a man who has targeted those that we entrust to protect the public. His actions cannot go unanswered."" But the chief announced Saturday that the LAPD would re-examine its proceedings against Dorner. The review is ""not to appease a murderer,"" but ""to reassure the public that their police department is transparent and fair in all things we do,"" he said. ""I am aware of the ghosts of the LAPD's past, and one of my biggest concerns is that they will be resurrected by Dorner's allegations of racism within the department,"" Beck said. Mountain dragnet scaled back . Meanwhile, about 90 miles east of the city, the dragnet was back in action around the Big Bear Lake resort in the San Bernardino Mountains. After working through a weekend of heavy snow and overnight temperatures in the single digits, investigators were trying to pick up Dorner's trail anew after his burned-out truck was found there Thursday afternoon near the property of someone a federal arrest affidavit described as a known associate. But there has been speculation, based in part on the affidavit, that the suspect could have crossed state lines into Nevada or made his way into Mexico. The day's effort began with about 60 officers, San Bernardino County sheriff's spokeswoman Lehua Pahia said. But by early afternoon, it had been scaled back to about 25 investigators, aided by a helicopter equipped with body-heat sensors and other specialized equipment, Pahia said. None of the tips the department had received so far has panned out, she said. According to authorities, Dorner began making good on his threats a week ago when he killed Monica Quan and her fiance, Keith Lawrence, in a parking lot in Irvine, south of Los Angeles. Quan was the daughter of a now-retired Los Angeles police officer who represented Dorner in a disciplinary hearing that led to his termination. Time line in hunt for Dorner . Days later, early Thursday morning, Dorner allegedly opened fire on two LAPD police officers, wounding one, in the suburban city of Corona. Roughly 20 minutes later, Dorner allegedly fired on two police officers in the nearby city of Riverside, killing one and wounding another. On Sunday, authorities identified the slain officer as Michael Crain, an 11-year veteran officer. LAPD guarding 50 police families . Authorities say Dorner spent at least two days in the San Diego area after the shooting of Quan and her fiance. Dorner's ID and some of his personal belongings were found Thursday at the San Ysidro Point of Entry at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the affidavit. Border patrol agents have been searching cars crossing into Mexico for signs of Dorner, while authorities have searched a home Dorner owned in Las Vegas and one owned by his mother in La Palma, California. Two sailors reported that Dorner, a former Navy lieutenant, approached them at the San Diego-area Point Loma Naval Base, and local police allege he attempted to steal a boat. And Monica Quan's father told investigators that someone identifying himself as Dorner called him Thursday and told him he ""should have done a better job of protecting his daughter,"" the federal affidavit states. Investigators traced the call to Vancouver, Washington, but based on the timing of other sightings, they don't believe Dorner was in Vancouver at the time, the affidavit states. Beck said the LAPD is now guarding the families of more than 50 police officers. Officers guarding one house early Thursday shot and wounded two women who were driving a pickup similar to Dorner's, something Beck called a ""tragic, horrific incident."" Beck said that the shootings of Margie Carranza, 47, and her mother, Emma Hernandez, 71, occurred a day after the manhunt for Dorner began and that the officers were under enormous pressure.

"Cairo (CNN) -- The Muslim Brotherhood declared that its candidate won Egypt's historic presidential election this weekend, making the claim hours after openly challenging the nation's military rulers over its dissolution of parliament. With several million votes still to be counted, the state-run Al-Ahram news website around 4:15 a.m. Monday (10:15 p.m. Sunday ET ) showed the Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsi leading with about 5,648,000 votes compared with about 4,705,000 for opponent Ahmed Shafik, who served as Egypt's last prime minister in the waning days of Hosni Mubarak's regime. Yet the Islamist group, citing what it said were all-but-complete official numbers released to its representatives at polling stations nationwide, asserted that Morsi had won by capturing 52.5% of the overall vote. The official vote count was scheduled to be finished at some point Monday, with final results to be announced Thursday. Whoever they declare the winner will become the North African nation's first president since Mubarak, who was ousted in a wave of popular unrest last year after three decades in power. The next president will wade into a country with a political system mired in controversy, confusion and confrontation, much of it due to events over the past week. Egypt has no constitution in place, though military rulers have vowed to appoint a 100-person panel to craft such a document. And a court ruling just days before the runoff appeared to invalidate an Islamist-dominated legislative body and then saw the military swiftly move to dissolve that parliament ahead of the election. But the Muslim Brotherhood, whose Freedom and Justice Party had won a majority of legislative seats, is bucking this act to dissolve parliament. Mahmoud Ghozlan, a spokesman for the Islamist group, called the move ""unconstitutional"" and said parliamentary speaker Mohamed al-Katatni will convene legislators on Tuesday. ""This parliament was chosen by 30 million voters over a period of three months, and the legislative power was handed to (lawmakers) chosen by the people,"" Ghozlan said. ""It is unconstitutional to dissolve it."" And Hussein Ibrahim, a Brotherhood member and majority leader in the legislature, insisted Sunday that parliament ""has not been dissolved,"" according to a report from the state-run Al-Ahram news agency. Vowing the Brotherhood won't ""give it to a coup d'etat,"" Ibrahim said while casting his vote in Alexandria that military rulers must respect a March 30 constitutional declaration that gives only ""the people"" the authority to dissolve parliament. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, meanwhile, issued a new constitutional declaration Sunday night detailing some powers that the new president will hold, but gave little indication it was budging on the state of parliament. After being sworn in, the new president will set the date for parliamentary elections and can pardon and appoint government officials and ambassadors to foreign countries. But the military leadership stated that legislative power, as well as control of the national budget, will remain in its hands until a new parliament is elected. The Brotherhood ""strongly rejected"" the military declaration about parliament on its official Twitter feed. The group also said that the constitutional panel picked by parliament will hold its first meeting Monday to begin drafting a constitution, in defiance of the military council. There's also plenty of dispute over the validity of this weekend's presidential runoff vote, which Shafik and Morsi's campaigns accusing each other of election fraud. A wild election weekend for Egypt, France and Greece . Turnout appeared sluggish Sunday at some polling stations in Cairo, where streets were mostly quiet despite what many Egyptians viewed as moves last week by military leaders, who have ruled the country since Mubarak was forced out in February 2011, to hold on to power. Some voters may have stayed home because of sweltering heat, officials told the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper. As of 4 p.m. Sunday in Egypt, 40% of the nation's 50 million eligible voters had cast ballots, according to Farouk Sultan, the head of Egypt's Supreme Presidential Election Commission. In the first round of voting last month, 46% of voters participated. Officials have reported few voting irregularities in the second round of elections, Sultan said. To protect the balloting process, authorities went so far as to camp outside polling stations overnight during the runoff. At one station designated for women in Cairo, guards slept on the doorstep. The Supreme Presidential Electoral Committee approved licenses for 53 organizations to observe the elections, including at least three international groups -- the U.S.-based Carter Center, the South Africa-based Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa and the Arab Network for Monitoring of Elections. Yet Shafik's campaign filed ""several complaints"" with Sultan's commission, alleging the Muslim Brotherhood committed ""systemic violations."" Specifically, they accused the Islamist group's supporters of bribing voters with ""large sums of money and food"" to back Morsi, as well as using ""intimidation, threats and violence against supporters of candidate Ahmed Shafik."" The former prime minister's camp also said it ""filed more than 100 official complaints accusing the Brotherhood of ballot rigging and stuffing."" ""The Muslim Brotherhood's systematic election violations prove how the (group) does not believe in freedom of choice and democracy unless this democracy brings them to power,"" Shafik's campaign said in a statement. ""The organized and persistent election fraud by the Muslim Brotherhood proves they ... only talk the talk and never walk the walk of liberal democracy."" In a statement on its website, the Brotherhood flatly denied what it called ""false reports being circulated"" and urged election officials to promptly investigate what it called ""games and plots."" It also accused ""the rival candidate's supporters (of) paying cash bribes to some voters,"" among other allegations. Outside the city, in Giza, Mohammed Gamea cast his ballot for Morsi even as he questioned whether the election was fairly handled. ""I don't believe the Egyptian presidential elections are fair to begin with,"" he said Sunday morning. ""The military council, assisted by the elections committee, tried everything to stall and influence the process, from disqualifying previous candidates before the first round -- not to mention the negative campaigns against Morsi -- while keeping quiet about Shafik."" ""But despite all (this), I don't believe that there has been any electoral fraud. The ballots will determine what is next for Egypt."" The real obstacle to democracy in Egypt . Some disgruntled voters launched a campaign to invalidate ballots, said Mohamed Ghoneim, the founder of a group that marked ""X"" on the names of both Morsi and Shafik, thereby nullifying their vote. Among the boycotters was Mohamed Khamees, who said he lost sight in his left eye from a police beating in Tahrir Square during the early 2011 protests. ""If I give this country for the Brotherhood hands, there is not going to be any more Egypt, it will be destroyed,"" he told CNN. ""And if I give it to someone from the old system, it looks like we did nothing."" What is the Muslim Brotherhood?

"(CNN) -- Don't want the police or your local government to know where you are? Then put your cell phone in airplane mode or turn it off. Location tracking is inherent in how cell networks function; otherwise nobody's cell phone would ring. But new evidence from the American Civil Liberties Union shows that phone location tracking has also become a surprisingly common tool of law-enforcement investigations -- with, but often without, a warrant. The ACLU recently obtained records from over 200 police departments and other law enforcement agencies around the U.S. They found that ""virtually all"" of these agencies track the location of cell phones with data supplied by wireless carriers. (For information on police in your state, check the ACLU's interactive map, which shows details from responding agencies. Not all states or agencies responded to ACLU's public-records requests.) But don't the police need a warrant for that? It varies by state, but carriers generally say they require a court order to release this data. Regardless of these requirements, however, ""Only a tiny minority reported consistently obtaining a warrant and demonstrating probable cause to do so,"" said the ACLU. Not surprisingly, the ACLU disapproves of this practice. ""The government should have to obtain a warrant based upon probable cause before tracking cell phones. That is what is necessary to protect Americans' privacy, and it is also what is required under the Constitution,"" states the ACLU on its site. Why would police want to track the current location of a cell phone or the history of where it's been? According to the ACLU's records, investigating crimes was a common and obvious reason cited. Some agencies reported that they track a cell phone's location only in emergencies, such as to find a missing person -- but others have done this for nonemergency cases. Sometimes police requested data about all phones accessing a certain cell tower, rather than from a specific phone. Fewer than 5% of agencies reported never tracking a cell phone's location at all. Depending on where you live, this kind of surveillance may happen a lot. According to the ACLU, ""Many law enforcement agencies track cell phones quite frequently. For example, based on invoices from cell phone companies, it appears that Raleigh, N.C., tracks hundreds of cell phones a year. The practice is so common that cell phone companies have manuals for police explaining what data the companies store, how much they charge police to access that data, and what officers need to do to get it."" According to these manuals, most carriers require a court order to implement cell phone surveillance -- which can range from data about inbound and outbound calls and text messages, to a detailed report of location history based on cell phone tower data. Costs can range up to several hundred dollars for each request. Of course, that data might point back to the dead end of a ""disposable"" prepaid cell phone which can be bought and activated with cash and without identification -- a common strategy for activists, criminals, people in hiding and others with concerns about surveillance. So tracing cell phone data isn't a guarantee that police will find the person or information they're seeking. As with searching data stored on cell phones taken from people under arrest (something which requires a warrant in some states but not others, like California), law enforcement officials often contend that obtaining a warrant to track a phone's location can delay solving a crime or finding a person in danger. But the ACLU found that some police departments -- notably in the county of Hawaii; Wichita, Kansas; and Lexington, Kentucky -- appear to have no problem regularly obtaining a warrant when needed to track a phone's location. This indicates that ""a warrant requirement is a completely reasonable and workable policy,"" the ACLU said. ""The government's location tracking policies should be clear, uniform, and protective of privacy, but instead are in a state of chaos, with agencies in different towns following different rules -- or in some cases, having no rules at all,"" the ACLU said. ""It is time for Americans to take back their privacy."" The ACLU's records request only applied to police requests for user and tower data from carriers. However, there are other ways to track a cell phone's location which almost anyone can use if you're willing to pay for it -- and if you can get access to the phone you want to track for long enough to install a bit of software. Several commercially available mobile ""spyware"" apps can be surreptitiously installed on a smartphone to track not only its location, but all messages sent and received by any app on the phone (e-mail, instant messaging, etc.). They record every character you type, and more. These apps disguise their presence and remotely report back to a website where the person who's doing the spying can log in to see everywhere the phone has been, and everything it's done. Typically, spyware apps are marketed in a fairly creepy way -- to snoop on spouses or children. But spyware can also help stalkers and other criminals close in on their victims. Spyware is generally legal to sell, but it may not be legal to use. That doesn't stop people from using it, of course. It's unknown whether U.S. state and local law enforcement agencies ever use mobile spyware, but clearly they're not the only ones who might want to know where you are and what you're doing. Your best line of defense from mobile spyware is to always protect your phone with a passcode or swipe pattern, even at your office or home. If people can't easily access your phone, they can't easily install spyware. Requiring warrants for all instances of cell phone tracking and surveillance based on carrier data is one step that the ACLU advocates. This would at least increase transparency and accountability for the practice. But if the police decide they want to know where you've been, it's likely that your carrier will tell them, for the right price. And right now, there's no way to prevent that. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of Amy Gahran.","ACLU: Phone location tracking is a common tool of police, often without a warrant .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- When Anna Elisa Fattori arrives at work the first thing she does is to take off her clothes. All of them. For Fattori is a professional nude model working at Rome's art academy. Anna Elisa Fattori: ""You are trying to give inspiration to the students."" ""It is a tough job!"" she tells me just before beginning to pose for a group of students, eager to paint her gracious figure. There is something striking about her bright green eyes and wavy red hair. ""It doesn't seem to be hard, but you know, try it! Put yourself in front of the mirror and then stay for a long time in a pose. You start: 'Oh my back, oh something is strange here...'"" she says, mimicking pain on her lower back. Fattori is one of about 300 people in Italy who do this job, but only about 50 of them have full-time contracts. She makes the equivalent of about $1,500 each month, but only works three months per year. And that is why she and others recently went on strike, demanding a full-time wage for work they say not everyone can do. ""It is not easy because you are naked, so you have to be very comfortable with your body and have a nice relationship with everybody,"" she says as the students look on, ""but not too open and not too close. You are trying to give inspiration to the students. If we lose these artistic roots that are very important to Italy then we lose a big part of our identity."" Italian Renaissance art is filled with naked men and women: Think of Michelangelo's David or Botticelli's Venus. But back then artists mostly used prostitutes and lovers as models and muses, often with the complicity of priests who wanted the walls of their churches painted by famous names. ""Priests allowed prostitutes to use churches,"" explains Enrico Bruschini, one of Rome's best known art historians. ""Officially it was to convert them, but the practical reason was to have the artist at the church."" Bruschini says that the Saint Augustine church, a stone's throw from Piazza Navona, was a famous gathering point in Rome for Renaissance artists looking for ""inspiration."" Back then though professional modeling did not exist, and most would agree that the art didn't really suffer from its absence. So if Botticelli and Raphael could do without professional models, what is the big deal now? ""It all started with the rise of art schools in the 19th and 20th centuries"" says Fattori. ""During the Renaissance you just thought that a prostitute can be a model or even a lover. But now we are here, so we need to move ahead."" Art students hoping to become the next Michelangelo agree. ""I think a person should have talent,"" argues Anastasia Kurakina, a first year student from Russia. ""Because you, for example, you couldn't [model]... I don't know you, but Anna Elisa has talent."" Anastasia is right, I certainly couldn't do it -- but unbeknownst to me she used me as a model while I was interviewing Fattori. Thankfully I was fully dressed, so all she drew was my head. And she didn't to a bad job at that. E-mail to a friend .","Italy's art models have gone on strike, demanding they get a full-time wage .
