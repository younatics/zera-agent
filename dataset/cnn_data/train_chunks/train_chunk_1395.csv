"The Queen’s favourite dog, the Pembrokeshire corgi, is at risk of extinction. The breed – a favourite of the Royal Family since 1933 – is considered at risk having been placed on the Kennel Club’s most vulnerable breed list. Breeds make the list if the number of puppies registered with the club dips below 300 a year, as experts consider this an insufficient numbers to ensure its long-term survival. The Queen pictured walking with three of her corgis in 1980 - the breed is now at risk of dying out . Last year only 274 Pembrokeshire corgi puppies were registered. At present the Queen has two corgis, Willow and Holly, and two ‘dorgis’ (a corgi-dachshund cross), named Candy and Vulcan. She has deliberately scaled down the number as she has got older. Debbie Richardson, whose Pembrokeshire corgi, Bailey, won Best Dog at Crufts last year, was upset to hear of the breed’s decline. Mrs Richardson of Winsford, Cheshire, said: ‘The problem we have is that they are seen as an old person’s dog. Two cheeky looking corgis pictured outside Clarence House - last year only 274 puppies were registered . 'It would be incredibly sad not to see this quintessentially British breed in our streets and parks in a few generations’ time.’ Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko added: ‘It is worrying to see the breed dip to a historic low and become one of the most vulnerable breeds for the first time ever.’ The Pembrokeshire corgi has been on a ‘watch list’ for some time. In 2005 there were 491 puppies registered but by 2010 this had dropped to just 363. It joins 28 other breeds on the vulnerable list, including the bloodhound, miniature bull terrier and King Charles spaniel.","The Queen's favourite dog the Pembrokeshire corgi is at risk of extinction .

"Did you hear the one about the princess and the playroom? It may seem like something out of a fairytale, but posh parents who are prepared to do anything for their little girls are splashing out to recreate something out of their wildest dreams. It doesn't matter that the children are barely out of diapers, obsessed by all-things Frozen and perhaps even the Royal Wedding, youngsters simply love the opportunity to play princess - every day. The price tag alone seems more akin to that of a royal palace. One princess-themed playroom created by Dahlia Mahmood of Dahlia Design costs a cool $70,000. Scroll down for video . The magic kingdom: This room was created for a little girl who was fascinated with fairies and wanted a room to be designed based on her love for them. An enchanting room was created with a custom-made castle bed with hidden storage for her dolls. She was two at the time . Two years later: The designer created a room that was timeless and elegant for the girl to grow into. When the girl was four it was re-designed once again. Portions of the castle were removed and she was given a full size bed and two large, molded, fiberglass trees outfitted with twinkle lights were installed . Pink is the color: The room itself has all custom-made furniture and hand-painted murals with shimmery details and Swarovski crystals. Other parts and areas of the room were custom-made as well, such as the door to the room, her bathroom, and her closet . Who needs Disney World? Specialized interior designers are catering to would-be royalty with increasingly elaborate fantasy rooms for kids . Princesses only! The entrance to a princess bedroom in Virginia designed by Dahlia Mahmood of Dahlia Designs. The budget for the 2-year-old’s room was $200,000 . Designed and constructed for Stella who is four and Presley who is two, the room comes with a faux gem-encrusted performance stage, a treehouse loft, and a mini-French cafe, all lined with a $20,000 carpet. The girls will sleep in bedrooms fit for royalty including a $6,000 custom-made castle bed. 'It's going to be a pink explosion, with hearts and bows and crowns and tassels,' says their mother, Lindsay Dickhout who is the CEO of a tanning product company. 'They have their whole lives to think practically and be efficient in the real world. This is about being creative,' said Ms. Dickhout to the Wall Street Journal at her Newport Beach, California home. 'I'm not at all worried about them becoming princesses.' With the launch of Disney's hotly-anticipated Cinderella remake just six weeks away and the company's Frozen still continuing to generate massive profits thanks to the story of two princess sisters more than a year after its release, there has never been a better time to live like queen - or at least aspire to live like one. Cinderella is predicted to be one of the year's most successful movies and like Frozen it's believed that its merchandise could be equally as successful, raking in hundreds of millions of dollars for Disney in the process. Such royal tastes have also boosted demand for increasingly elaborate fantasy rooms. Fit for a four-year-old! This little girl loved ballerinas, everything in her room was custom made, from her tufted door with swarovski crystal buttons, custom bedding, light fixtures, and custom made couture drapery. 'Simple, elegant and glamorous', said the designer . Disney dream: The inspirations for the design of our children's rooms stem from Dahlia Mahmood's childhood. Being born and raised in California, she regularly visited Disneyland and was awed by how magical the amusement park was. She wanted to do something similar . Under the sea: Inside this playroom  rubber flooring was used to mimic the ocean floor. The TV comes out of the treasure box. All toys can be stored inside cabinet with Coral facade. Sea shell influences were used to design the seating which is made out of fiberglass . Treasure: The concept was to design an under water world, in the entrance to the playroom, there is a bench where kids can read their books, made to look like a submarine . Designer Dahlia Mahmood says that costs is simply not a barrier for many of her clients. 'If Walt Disney could create something that is so unique and is appreciated by both adults and children from around the world, then I can do it too. The reaction of most of our children clients when they see their rooms for the first time is absolutely priceless. Watching their excitement brings tears to my eyes because they are so happy and grateful.' Ms Mahmood specializes in decorating kids' ultimate bedrooms and deals with specialty furniture companies that area able to create virtually any accouterments to fit their clients tastes with everything from $3,000 Cinderella lamps to $35,000 carriage-shaped beds. Ms Mahmood says she created a $200,000 princess-fairy themed room for a two-year-old girl in Virginia five years ago which included a castle-shaped bed complete with turrets for her toys. Even the bathroom walls were coated with  Swarovski crystals. Just two years later, when the girl was 4, Ms Mahmood was invited back for a redesign. After all, the little girl had begun to grow up and her tastes had matured. 'Every aspect of our design is carefully chosen for its details and timeless qualities. We will not settle for less and we do not expect our clients to be satisfied unless we are,' she says. Chocs away! This little boy traveled the world at a young age, fascinated with planes, a room was created that had realistic features . Flying high: Enjoying the spoils are interior designers who specialize in decorating kids’ ultimate bedrooms . Filling up: This aviation-themed room is proof that it's not just little girls that are interested in having a specially styled room . Of course, getting the princess look doesn't have to cost tens of thousands of dollars. A number of companies produce princess-like items at a fraction of the price. Pottery Barn Kids  introduced tufted headboards and tulle canopies two years ago and unicorn bedding last year. This year they introduced sparky chandeliers. Restoration Hardware has created a princess-like 19th-century Rococo bed from France which costs $1,300. Disney has a room-desinging arm called Rooms To Go which offers a Disney Princess collection with bedroom sets costing between $500 and $2,000. Toys R' Us is introducing a $380 carriage-shaped princess bed, however another company called PoshTots sells items at the top-end of the market including a $35,000 princess carriage bed. When it comes to indulging in that princess fantasy, some parents will stop at nothing to ensure their daughters wishes are fulfilled, and with tales as old as time, it doesn't look as though it is a trend that will disappear any time soon. Packing for a big trip? The drawers were designed to mimic luggage and a gas tank. Custom made a light fixtures were made for the airplanes . At the controls: Just think of the fun that could be had in this cockpit-inspired bed!

A source said: 'There is still some availability at Cromlix into September but it's going fast. 'Interest has really rocketed since Andy announced he was getting married there.' Experts are now predicting that the publicity surrounding the couple's wedding is likley to put the hotel in the same league as other famous venues such as Skibo Castle, near Dornock, where Madonna married film director Guy Ritchie in December 2000. The hotel has its own private chapel, where the privacy conscious couple will be able to say 'I do' away from prying eyes . The wedding party will have 10 bedrooms and five suites to chose from.

"Peter Sutcliffe, who was jailed for murdering 13 women, was recently baptised in a pool in a private room at the high security hospital Broadmoor . The Yorkshire Ripper has enjoyed a specially-arranged baptism service in Broadmoor after becoming a Jehovah's witness. Peter Sutcliffe, 68, who was jailed for murdering 13 women, was recently baptised in a pool in a private room at the high security hospital . The serial killer has been a practicing Jehovah's Witness for several years and holds bi-weekly bible study classes. Earlier this month the Daily Mail reported on Sutcliffe's cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor, where he eats chocolate, watches television and listens to music. Despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers he is allowed visitors four days a week - each of whom who can stay for up to four hours. He is said to have money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. In 2010 MailOnline reported Sutcliffe had been befriended over the last 15 years by Jehovah’s Witnesses, who are emphatic that he now shows remorse for his crimes. The former trucker claimed he was on a divine mission to rid the streets of prostitutes. The Sun on Sunday has now reported that two fellow Jehovah's Witness brothers from a local Kingdom Hall carried out the baptism. They quoted an unnamed source who claimed: 'Peter was really happy about being baptised and said afterwards he was now a Jehovah's Witness 'brother'. 'It is really odd that someone who did what he did is so religious now - they have even told him he will go to paradise because he has accepted God.' The source added that people who know Sutcliffe think Broadmoor is 'doing too much' to let him practice the religion. Sutcliffe has already tried to convert fellow patients at the Berkshire psychiatric hospital. Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . He was jailed for life in 1981 after admitting killing 13 women and attempting to murder seven more between 1975 and 1981 in Yorkshire and Greater Manchester. Mr Justice Mitting likened Sutcliffe to a ‘terrorist’, saying the ‘brutality and gravity’ of his crimes meant he should never be released. Sutcliffe has spent most of his life sentence in Broadmoor after being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left. He has spent most of his sentence in Broadmoor after he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia . It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. His health has deteriorated in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and later suffered from a debilitating cough. Medication has made him put on weight and has increased his blood pressure. Sutcliffe used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England.","Serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, 68, was jailed for life for murdering 13 women .

"Stanford alumna and Ford model has accused a Silicon Valley executive of raping  her so many times she was left with post-traumatic stress disorder. Elise Clougherty, 24, dated her college mentor Joseph Lonsdale, the 32-year-old co-founder of venture capital firm Formation 8, for a year between 2012 and 2013. But in court papers filed on January 27, the graduate who has modeled for Vogue, describes 'a sexually, emotionally, and physically abusive relationship,' in which she was allegedly assaulted on a regular basis. She claims Lonsdale deliberately deprived her of food, threw her against walls, and told her women need to be raped to learn respect. The ordeal, Clougherty says, left her suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Lonsdale has dismissed the allegations as 'a vicious and vengeful campaign...to destroy his reputation with false and outrageous accusations.' Rape claims: Former Ford model and Stanford graduate Elise Clougherty, 24, (left) has filed a lawsuit claiming her ex-boyfriend and college mentor, Silicon Valley executive Joseph Lonsdale, 32, (right) raped her . He has filed a counter-claim and set up a website with pictures of 'loving' emails from Clougherty that he claims show their intimacy was consensual. The pair met in 2011 at a bar in New York when Clougherty was in her second year of study at the Northern California school, and Lonsdale had just set up Formation 8. A year later, Lonsdale, himself a 2003 Stanford graduate, became Clougherty's official mentor in an entrepreneurship elective run by the university. They started dating and stayed together for a year. According to Clougherty, who is seeking at least $75,000 in damages, Lonsdale used his 'leverage' to ensure he would be her mentor in the entrepreneurship elective in February 2012. That month, she claims, he invited her to his home in Los Altos, California, where he 'repeatedly forced [her] to have sexual contact without her consent.' A month later, when Clougherty was on a vacation with her family in Spain, Lonsdale asked her to meet him in London and Rome, insisting they would stay in separate rooms, she says. Ambition: Clougherty first met with Lonsdale to ask him about making it in the world of technology and data . Model: Clougherty, a data science major, modeled for the cover of hit young adult novel series Airhead . 'Traumatic': The former model, now studying at UVa, claims Lonsdale deprived her of food 'to manipulate' her . Damages: Clougherty is seeking $75,000 in damages from Lonsdale and his firm for 'negligent supervision' When she arrived, however, he insisted that she stay in his room and 'forcefully raped' her throughout the trip. Clougherty's suit, published by TechCrunch, demands damages from Lonsdale and his firm Formation 8, which she accuses of 'negligent supervision'. It states: 'Throughout this period, Mr. Lonsdale repeatedly commented to Ms. Clougherty that women needed to be raped to learn to be loyal and that they really enjoyed being raped more than they let on. 'In addition to shaking her violently during sexual assaults, he also began strangling her, slapping her, scratching her, yanking her by the hair so hard that he would lift her torso off the bed, and slamming her body against the walls and bedboards.' She added that he 'deprived her of both food and sleep by scheduling late evening and early morning activities, delaying meals, not ordering her enough food and other such tactics.' And: 'He often would not let her buy tampons and seemed to relish getting her blood everywhere - on her clothing, bed sheets, hotel furniture, car and bus seats, and elsewhere.' Clougherty described Lonsdale as using 'many forms of psychological manipulation and control on her, including but not limited to 'positive intermittent reinforcement,' 'gaslighting,' isolation, sleep deprivation, food deprivation, anger, embarrassment, and guilt.' On her return, Cloughtery filed a complaint to the school, which supported her claim. Lonsdale has been banned from the Stanford campus for 10 years. Hit back: Lonsdale, 32, has rejected the claims as 'a vicious campaign...to destroy his reputation' Counterclaim: He has published emails from Clougherty that he says show their relationship was consensual . In his countersuit, which demands $150,000 in damages, Lonsdale says the relationship 'was always consensual'. He says Clougherty initiated intimate contact, and that they 'took multiple vacations together, got to know each others' families' and 'developed a deep affection for one another'. In addition, Lonsdale has published stockpiles of emails from Clougherty on a Wordpress site. Denying the incident she described at his Los Altos home, Lonsdale said they shared their first kiss that night and she emailed to say 'I love getting to know you'. He says their first sexual encounter was in Rome in March 2012, after which she described in an email as the 'day we shared such a beautfil moment together! If you know what I mean...' A later message reads: 'The love I feel for you is deep.' In another email, that spans 10 pages, Clougherty tells Lonsdale her 'perception was warped' when she met him, having just recovered from an eating disorder during which she was committed. Clougherty is currently a Data Science graduate candidate at the University of Virginia. Before Formation 8, Lonsdale founded Palantir Technologies in 2004. Both plaintiffs have requested a jury trial.","Elise Clougherty, 24, dated Silicon Valley exec Joe Lonsdale for a year .

"A grieving father has written a heartbreaking letter to his seven-year-old son who was killed during last winter's floods. Zane Gbangbola was overcome by fumes while he slept as floodwaters rose in the basement of his Surrey home during storms in February last year. His father Kye and mother Nicole Lawler were also taken ill as they ran generators to pump flood water out of their basement riverside property in Chertsey. Scroll down for video . Zane Gbangbola, aged seven, was overcome by fumes as his family ran generators to pump flood water out of their basement riverside property in Chertsey in February last year . Zane died later in hospital from a cardiac arrest and Mr Gbangbola, a company director, was left paralysed from the waist down. Surrey Police launched an investigation following the tragedy that occurred in the early hours of February 8 last year. A pathologist concluded that Zane died as a result of carbon monoxide intoxication - but his parents have always maintained he was killed by hydrogen cyanide poisoning. They believe the deadly gas, used by the Nazis during the Holocaust, was released through what they assert to be contaminated water from a former landfill site behind their home. Blood tests on Ms Lawler, 37, and Mr Gbangbola, 48, showed traces of the substance in their systems. But they say the pathologist was not told to test Zane's blood for the toxin, which disappears from the body within 48 hours. A pathologist concluded that Zane died as a result of carbon monoxide intoxication - but his parents have always maintained he was killed by hydrogen cyanide poisoning . The home of Kye and Nicole Gbangbola during the floods in February where their son Zane died last year . In a letter addressed to his son, Mr Gbangbola outlines the daily struggle the family has faced over the past year. 'As I stare at your toys and the places where I used to see you play, my tears fall as my heart breaks from the emptiness,' he wrote. 'Mum cries herself to sleep every night. I dream of us together again and wake up happy, then sad because you're not there. 'I see your toothbrush, shoes and look for you. I can't hear you and I can't turn back the clock. 'Your warm hugs, kisses and smile, the sound of your little feet on the landing floor as you come for your morning snuggle with mum and dad, all now just loving memories.' He added: 'I miss you so much Zane, from doing your hair and getting you ready to just being your proud dad.' For the past year, the family, along with their campaign group Truth About Zane, has been battling for a more rigorous investigation into youngster's death. Police seized a petrol-driven pump from inside the flooded property in Thameside, Surrey, at the time, and following their investigation, officers submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for their formal advice. However the investigation was dropped in December, with the CPS deciding there was no criminal case to answer. Zane's family staged a protest outside the Environment Agency headquarters in Westminster in November to demand answers over the youngster's death. Zane's parents Nicola Lawler and Kye Gbangbola, a company director, were also taken ill. Mr Gbangbola was left paralysed from the waist down, pictured right . The houses in Chertsey, Surrey, surrounded by flood waters close to the old landfill site (bottom left field) They also handed in a petition signed by 16,000 people urging Environment Agency bosses to reveal what happened. His parents claim the colourless gas hydrogen cyanide, which has in the past been linked to historic landfill sites, had permeated the floodwater from a former landfill site near their home. They fear that others living near or on old landfill sites could also be at risk. Mr Gbangbola wrote in his letter: 'I don't know what most think of your mum and I, but I do know what they would think if they lost their child, they would be devastated and want truth. 'So I ask their conscience to stand up for what is right and show solidarity with a parent in need. 'The authorities knew immediately what had happened, all they need to do is tell the truth. It makes it difficult asking children to tell the truth if certain adults can't.' An inquest into Zane's death is expected to be held some time this year. A petition can be signed here.

"An on-the-run Polish killer questioned over a ‘new Baby P’ case was part of a burglary gang that cut a man’s throat for his TV. The 30-year-old woman and two accomplices left the man for dead after making off with the set and his jacket worth just £179. Yet after absconding from her 12 year sentence for the appalling crime, she was able to freely enter the UK and move into a taxpayer-subsidised home. The 30-year-old mother  (pictured with her son) was jailed for 12 years in her home country after leaving a man for dead after making off with the TV and his jacket worth just £179 . Now the woman and her boyfriend are at the centre of a Scotland Yard murder investigation after their six-month-old son died from serious head injuries. Social services face serious questions over what steps they took to safeguard the youngster after discovering she was a wanted killer. Her local council, Haringey, is poised to launch a serious case review to discover what went wrong in the weeks before his death. The woman has appeared before an extradition court 14 times since she was arrested in Tottenham in January last year. Her brother revealed she may have been in the country for two years before she was finally tracked down by the police. The Daily Mail can now reveal full details of the horrific crime for which the Polish authorities want her extradited to serve the rest of her sentence. In December 2002, when she was just 18, she was part of a gang who robbed a man called Janusz Marosz in her hometown of Leczyca, in central Poland. According to court documents, he was beaten and struck with a ‘dangerous implement’ and struck ‘at least twice in the area of the jugular vein’. An on-the-run Polish killer questioned over a ‘new Baby P’ case was part of a burglary gang that cut a man’s throat for his TV set. Pictured, Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, died in August 2007 . The trio then ‘bludgeoned him with other blunt instruments causing damage to his main arteries and as a consequence, death.’ They then stole a TV set and his jacket from his apartment. The possessions had a total value of about 1,000 zloty, or £179. The woman and her boyfriend, aged 26, are due to answer bail later this month as inquiries continue into what happened in the days before he son was found fatally wounded. One source close to the inquiry said ‘this can only get worse’ amid fears opportunities were missed to save his life. Her son, known only as Baby O, was rushed to hospital from his home in Haringey, North London, last month after his parents dialled 999. Paramedics raced him to North Middlesex Hospital and he was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he died three days later. A post-mortem examination found he died from a head injury. The parents have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm. The woman’s brother, a 26-year-old employee of a medical supplies manufacturer, said her family have been told the little boy died in an accident. The woman's son, known as Baby O, died in Great Ormond Street Hospital after suffering head injuries . Speaking in Leczyca, a small industrial town two hours west of Warsaw, he said the woman emigrated to the UK ‘two or three years ago’. ‘She is devastated. What happened was a terrible accident as far as we know,’ he added. ‘[She] always spoke to me about her children in a loving way. I’ve never met her boyfriend but I have no reason to think anything bad of him. ‘She never gave me any sign that they were having problems. ‘We had a tough life growing up. We were definitely poor, we were four brothers and three sisters and Dad wasn’t around. Our mother just died in April. ‘When she was 18, she got in with the wrong people, small time crooks who were into heavy drinking and drugs. ‘She got a sentence for murder because she was with two of these guys when they were robbing a man in his home and beat him up so badly that he died. ‘The law came down very hard on her because she was an accomplice and had been hanging around with these people.’ Haringey Council endured a storm of criticism after the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, in August 2007. A spokeswoman said the Local Safeguarding Children Board is preparing to commission a review into the role of all agencies that were involved with the family. Haringey council is poised to launch a serious case review to discover what went wrong in the weeks before his death .

"Bad batch? Mary 'Shelley' Goldsmith was one of four deaths linked to molly in the summer of 2013 . The parents of a University of Virginia student who died after taking the club drug Molly are hoping to prevent further deaths from the drug by raising awareness of its deadly consequences in a new documentary. University of Virginia sophomore Mary 'Shelley' Goldsmith, 19, died in August 2013 at one of the largest dance clubs in Washington. At the time her family knew that she had overdosed. Her mom and dad, Rob and Dede Goldsmith are featured in a clip released by the makers of an upcoming documentary. Shelley, was a student at UVA in 2013 when she died after taking MDMA at an electronic dance concert in Washington, D.C. The Goldsmiths are looking for club organizers to introduce  policies that allow music festival organizers to put safety measures in place that reduce risks from drug use without fear of prosecution. Mrs Goldsmith is hoping to change federal drug laws through a policy known as harm reduction. 'She is a good messenger. She was a great kid. She was smart, she was affable, she was musically-inclined, she was the whole package and it happened to her. If it can happen to her, it can happen to your kid,' said Dede Goldsmith in the YouTube clip. The documentary is produced by DanceSafe founder Emanuel Sferios' Viveka Films and is expected to be shown at film festivals in the summer of 2016. Scroll down for video... Message: Rob and Dede Goldsmith are driven to ensure people understand that it is not stupid kids or drug addicts that are at risk, but regular teenagers and young people at colleges and universities . Gone but not forgotten: Her mother says her daughter, Shelley,  loved cupcakes . 'She had a presence about her and had a great big beautiful smile,' says her mom Dede, holding back tears. Dad Rob tries to explain his daughter's drug use. 'The connotation of drug user implies its someone who uses drugs all the time. She used drugs to enhance her experience and was looking to have a good time and to feel close to people around her. Education things say Molly is bad. Shelly and her friends took it because they liked the way it made them feel. That has to be acknowledged in a effective, realistic educational way. There's some good sides and attractive sides to this but there are some risks.' Her parents appear driven to ensure people understand that it is not stupid kids or drug addicts that are at risk, but regular teenagers and young people at colleges and universities. 'These are really smart kids. She was a smart girl,' says her mom. 'There is a need for education but a lot of information that is put out is not accurate so the only practical response is Harm reduction.' Harm reduction suggests that educators take on practical strategies designed to reduce the consequences of drug use. New policy: Shelly's parents want to see a new strategy of harm reduction be introduced. It suggests that educators take on practical strategies designed to reduce the consequences of drug use . Tragic: Goldsmith was a sophomore at prestigious University of Virginia, where she was awarded the highest merit scholarship. Her father has now come forward to say her death was caused by molly . 'If her death can open someone's eyes, then we need to talk about it,' Rob Goldsmith said. 'Shelley deserves a legacy of being someone who cared for people, someone who achieved, someone who contributed, and not a druggie who died,' he said. 'That's not who she was.' Goldsmith hailed from Abingdon, Virginia and was admitted to her prestigious university with the highest possible merit scholarship. She hoped to one day have a career in politics and had the resume full of distinctions to help her on her way. My girl: 'Shelley's death has to have a meaning for me as a rational loving mother.I can't live with the thought that she just died. There's no purpose. I believe that things happen for a reason,' says Mom Dede . Happy memories: Her Mom Dede says, 'I really want to do what I can to protect young people. I grew up with Shelley - she had a lot of friends and I miss not being involved with them' Tragic: Mary 'Shelley' Goldsmith was a sophomore at prestigious University of Virginia, where she was awarded the highest merit scholarship. She died in August 2016 after taking club drug molly . 'Her love of life was contagious,' reads Goldsmith's obituary. 'She volunteered at the food bank, worked for Democratic candidates, decorated cupcakes with her friends' 'The war on drugs hasn't worked. Harm reduction is our only viable option,' says Rob. 'Shelley asked for water just before she died and was heading to the bar but never made it. She was feeling the effects of being very hot and taking Molly, the risks of heat stroke and exhaustion are a real possibility.' Asked what is her driving force in taking part in the documentary, Dede Goldsmith has a clear answer: 'I really want to do what I can to protect young people. I grew up with Shelley - she had a lot of friends and I miss not being involved with them. Shelley's death has to have a meaning for me as a rational loving mother.I can't live with the thought that she just died. There's no purpose. I believe that things happen for a reason. I believe that she died so that other people would live.' Missing their girl: 'The war on drugs hasn't worked. Harm reduction is our only viable option,' says Rob. They hope the death of their beautiful daughter will help save the lives of others in the future . More dangerous? Molly has been known for years as MDMA or Ecstasy, but some say its powder form is more dangerous because it is easily adulterated when put inside capsules . Molly is a crystalline or powder form of the well-known club drug Ecstasy. However, some believe Molly--which can be snorted or swallowed in a capsule--is more likely than the drug in tablet form to be laced with anything from caffeine to methamphetamine. The moniker 'Molly' could also refer to the chemical MDMA (ecstasy) or to a variety of similar and related chemicals. The drug is popular at music and dance venues because of its ability to energize its user. Users also report a sense of heightened empathy and of a heightened ability to 'feel' the music. It is nearly impossible for a user to judge exactly how much Molly they can safely take because there is no set measure of potency and it is often impossible to tell if a dose has been adulterated.","Mary 'Shelley' Goldsmith, 19, in August 2013 in a Washington nightclub .

"Up to 1,000 patients die in NHS hospitals every month because of avoidable blunders, Jeremy Hunt warned today. The Health Secretary has ordered an annual review of 'avoidable deaths', which he described as the 'biggest scandal in global healthcare'. The yearly study of about 2,000 patient case notes will see England become the first country in the world to monitor the extent of avoidable deaths, in the hope of cutting the rate. Jeremy Hunt has ordered a review of patient case notes to establish how many cases are avoidable . Mr Hunt told the Sunday Telegraph how the latest reforms to improve the safety record in healthcare will be the 'most profound change' during his time in charge. 'It is about changing behaviour and the way everyone works in the NHS,' he said. The Health Secretary the NHS must learn from other industries where safety failures are not tolerated. 'In the 1970s there were about 2,000 deaths a year from airline crashes, and the industry realised that they would go out of business if people became too scared to fly,' he said. 'Now the global figure is around 500, even though there is nine times as much air travel.' The health service had to act to stamp out avoidable deaths: 'This is the biggest scandal in global healthcare. Why hasn't the health service adopted the kinds of standards we now take for granted in the airline and nuclear industry?' This week a report on the treatment of NHS staff who tried to air their care concerns will be published by Sir Robert Francis, who led the a damning report into the Mid Staffs Hospital scandal which found that at least 1,200 patients died because of poor care at the hospital. Mr Hunt promised more protection for whistleblowers to encourage them to speak out about power standards of care. 'On high death rates, failing hospitals and whistleblowing, we are calling time on the cover-up culture and ushering in a new era of transparency,' Mr Hunt said. Doctors and nurses will be given training in whistleblowing from this autumn so they know how to raise the alarm about care. Helene Donnelly, an A&E nurse whose warnings were ignored at Mid Staffs, will advise junior clinical staff on how to expose wrongdoing. A report by healthcare analysts Dr Foster published today has found a 'significant reduction' in the overall death rate in 11 NHS trusts that were put into special measures, which have been credited for saving hundreds of lives. The Health Secretary said the NHS had to learn from other industries which had refused to tolerate avoidable deaths . A spokeswoman for the Department of Health said under the annual review announced by Mr Hunt hospitals will be placed into bands depending on the number deaths estimated locally. 'By March 2016, every hospital board will have the first of an annual series of projected avoidable mortality rates to inform and drive local improvement,' she said. 'The Health Secretary will require every hospital chairman to write to him upon receipt of their figures each year to update him on how they plan to eradicate avoidable deaths in their organisation.' Mr Hunt said: 'I'm determined to go even further in rooting out poor care, and have ordered a national case-note review to work out the percentage of avoidable deaths by hospital. 'I want all hospital boards to have a laser-like focus on eradicating avoidable deaths in their organisation; even one life lost to poor care or safety error is too many.' Hospital mortality rates expert, Professor Nick Black said the review would 'provide a basis for stimulating quality improvement in each individual hospital'.","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announces a review of 'avoidable deaths'

"A dozen Cabinet ministers have been caught out ignoring David Cameron's ban on taking mobile phones into meetings. Blackberries, iPhones and other handsets were banned from Cabinet meetings in 2010 over fears they could be hijacked by foreign spies to listen in on top level discussions. But when security chiefs went to brief ministers on efforts to tackle cyber-terrorism, the Prime Minister was alarmed to find at least 12 had broken the rules. Mobile phones are banned from meetings in the Cabinet room in Number 10, but senior ministers were caught breaking the rules . David Cameron ordered a phone 'amnesty' for ministers to come clean about their secret phones before the GCHQ briefing could begin . On Tuesday, the head of the Government's eavesdropping agency GCHQ attended Cabinet at 10 Downing Street to brief ministers on cyber-security. Director Robert Hannigan was due to update senior ministers on progress in implementing the Government's Cyber Security Strategy. But when ministers were reminded that they should not have their phones in the room, many were forced to admit they were secretly trying to break the rules. GCHQ director Robert Hannigan was due to update senior ministers on progress in implementing the Government's Cyber Security Strategy . Mr Cameron announced a 'phone amnesty', according to the Mail on Sunday. 'He told the Secretaries of State and others present, that everyone had one minute to leave the room and dispense of any phones they had brought in. Almost instantly, a dozen ministers guiltily rose to their feet,' the newspaper added. Michael Gove, who last month disrupted a Cabinet meeting when his email and text enabled-watch started playing a Beyoncé song, also had to remove the gadget. Some ministers had to hand in more than on phone, and only once the mobiles had been removed from the room could the briefing begin. The £860 million five-year Cyber Security Strategy - which was published in 2011 - sets out measures to safeguard Britain's economic prosperity, national security and way of life by building a 'more trusted and resilient digital environment'. It aims to make the UK one of the most secure places in the world to do business online, by tackling cyber crime, promoting resilience to cyber-attack and helping to shape an 'open, vibrant and stable' cyberspace. Downing Street refused to discuss the content of Mr Hannigan's briefing. But a spokesman did reveal that there was no discussion in Cabinet of the recent incident in which a hoax caller managed to speak to Mr Cameron. Downing Street and the security services launched a major review of procedures following the breach, although Mr Cameron has said nobody would be sacked and no crime was committed. Michael Gove, who last month disrupted a Cabinet meeting when his email and text enabled-watch started playing a Beyoncé song, also had to remove the gadget before the meeting could start . The Cabinet meeting as attended by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) and Home Secretary Theresa May, but it is unclear who had their mobile phones with them . The Prime Minister revealed the call came after he returned from Saudi Arabia to pay his respects after the death of King Abdullah and he was enjoying a 'very nice walk' with his family when his mobile rang. He said: 'I had Florence on my back to add to the exercise regime that I'm undertaking. My Blackberry went in my pocket, I answered it and it claimed to be a conference call established – which I do obviously very frequently – between the head of GCHQ and some of the staff in my office. 'A voice came through, a voice I didn't recognise. The voice said he said he was sorry to wake me up, which I thought was strange as it was eleven o'clock in the morning, and so I quite rapidly asked 'who is this?', to which the answer came 'it is a hoax call', and so I pushed the red button on the Blackberry which ended the call. 'That is what happened so no harm was done, no national security was breached, but it is important when these things happen to make sure we do everything we can to put in place systems to we weed out hoax calls, but every now and again, I suspect these things will happen'. The call followed a separate astonishing security lapse earlier in the day when a caller, believed to be the same man, was given a mobile number for GCHQ director Mr Hannigan after he rang the organisation.","Prime Minister had banned mobiles over fears they could be use by spies .

"Boris Johnson has been accused of short-changing Londoners after embarking on a jet-set world tour seen as an audition to become a global statesman. The Mayor of London has now arrived in Boston, USA, for what is his third long-haul visit in three months, where he has announced plans for more underground roads in London, 3,000 miles away. Mr Johnson has been accused of using the international trips to boost his foreign affairs credentials ahead of a potential bid to become Tory leader. Boris Johnson walks through snow drifts on the streets of Boston as he starts a six-day visit to the US . The London Mayor braved sub-zero temperatures to pose for the cameras, but questions are being asked about why he spends so much time globe-trotting . In his second trip across the pond in three months, Mr Johnson has begun a six-day east coast tour . But Mr Johnson, who is hoping to return to parliament at the general election, has insisted his visits are to promote London. In his second trip across the pond in three months, Mr Johnson has begun a six-day east coast tour. This week he will hold talks with Hillary Clinton in New York City, as well as visiting Harvard University in Boston and a Congressional reception in Washington DC. After braving sub-zero temperatures for a walkabout in the snow, Mr Johnson announced plans to run more of London's roads through tunnels to improve air quality and free up land. Parts of the A13, A3, A316, A4 and A406 could be diverted underground, he said. Mr Johnson told LBC: 'Because of the huge growth of white vans as a result of internet shopping, congestion on our roads with the growth we've got is going to get worse and worse unless we put in mitigating measures. 'We're going to do a lot. We're working to get lorries off the roads at the peak, we're doing all sorts of things to manage the traffic, but in the end, you've got to start thinking laterally and thinking bigger.' The visit to the US comes two weeks after a trip to Kurdistan – where he was pictured with an AK-47 while meeting British troops training local fighters in the war against the Islamic State (IS) - and trips to the Far East and USA last November. He also made high-profile international visits to China and India earlier in his mayoralty. Labour claimed the Conservative mayor, who is not standing for re-election when his term as mayor ends in 2016, has 'mentally checked out' of City Hall, while Green Party peer Jenny Jones, who is also an Assembly Member, said other people were being left to run the city. 'I feel he is lining himself up to be a global statesman when what we need is a London mayor on the case,' Baroness Jones said. Soon after arriving in Boston, Mr Johnson was posing for selfies with business leaders at the Institute of Contemporary Arts . On the first day of his trip, the Mayor announced plans to run more roads underground in London, more than 3,000 miles away . NOV 2012 – India – six-day tour including visit to Delhi . OCT 2013 – Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, China - week-long tour . OCT 2014 – Umbria, Italy - three-day stay paid for by Evening Standard owner Evgeny Lebedev . NOV 2014- New York City, USA – tour to promote his book on Winston Churchill . NOV 2014 - Singapore, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur – six-day Far East tour . JAN 2015 – Kurdistan, Iraq – visited British troops helping to train local fighters in war against Islamic State (IS) FEB 2015 – Boston, New York City and Washington DC, USA – six-day east coast tour . Christian Wolmar, who wants to be Labour's mayoral candidate, said Mr Johnson had become a 'part-time mayor'. As well as campaigning in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where he is standing to become MP, Mr Johnson carried out 95 party political visits in 10 months last year, including campaigning for Conservative candidates in Bath, Swindon and Staffordshire. Labour has called for Mr Johnson, who is paid a salary of £143,911 to reimburse London taxpayers for the days he is absent from the city during the general election campaign. Mr Johnson, who has dual US and UK nationality as he was born in New York, began his visit with a speech in Boston on how innovation can help the poor. The message was interpreted as Mr Johnson positioning himself as a 'one nation' candidate for the Tory leadership when David Cameron steps down. He will meet former US secretary of state Mrs Clinton on Wednesday to discuss terrorism and the war in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State. Mr Johnson will also hold meetings with Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York, his predecessor Michael Bloomberg, as well as the British stars of Broadway and New York fashion week. In November, Mr Johnson conducted a tour of television studios in New York promoting his book on Winston Churchill. Mr Johnson takes aim with an AK47 during a visit  to the see the British Troops training the Peshmerga near the frontline, while on a visit to the Kurdish region of Iraq in January 2015 . In December Mr Johnson (left) visited the Petronas Towers, one of the tallest buildings in the world, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as part of a six-day visit to the Far East taking in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. In October 2013, he was in China at the same time as Chancellor George Osborne. The two met at Peking University in Beijing . In November 2012 Mr Johnson flew to India, where he played cricket with local Mumbai school boys on Juhu Beach in India . The Mayor's official spokesman dismissed the criticism, insisting overseas visits were often at the invitation of Governments or city leaders. 'Each trip is focused on driving investment for London and for British business and have delivered substantial results for London and for UK plc,' the spokesman said. 'The U.S. trip will focus on tech, life science, policing, higher education, Foreign Direct Investment, city to city co-operation, business engagement and investment, theatre, film, culture and tourism. 'The Mayor will be accompanied by senior leaders in tech and life science and a variety of SMEs in the sector seeking new business in the United States. 'Their association with the Mayor's export programme opened new opportunities in the Far East recently and we hope to do the same here.'","London Mayor accused of using his trips to improve his global image .

Dr John Tickell, who is a former Hawthorn footballer and brain cancer survivor, told the Herald Sun that Jolly may have suffered a build-up of fluid inside his head from an old football injury. The Channel 9 spokesman said a  biopsy has been taken to determine what the lump is. 'His surgery went well and two incision points were created to drain the fluid, which has eased the pressure and headaches,' the spokesman confirmed.

"Criticism: Many guests have been left less than impressed after staying at Gordon Ramsay's York & Albany Hotel in London . He is famed for turning the fortunes of faltering culinary ventures. But while Gordon Ramsay embarks on his new Hotel Hell fix-it tour of the US - many guests at his own London establishment are being left with a sour taste in their mouths. A spate of lousy reviews on popular website TripAdvisor criticise the 'horrible breakfast' while claiming the 'staff couldn't care less' and the guesthouse is 'poor value for money'. The cheapest room available at the York & Albany hotel and restaurant, which is next to Regent's Park, costs more than £200 a night - while a three-course meal is likely to set you back more than £40. Much of the criticism is aimed at the 'small bog standard' rooms but other reviewers lay into the food claiming their breakfast was 'pre cooked and kept tepid while a choice of eggs was added'. One reviewer called JCBrighton writes: 'Two out of our party of four chose maple-flavoured ham - which looked, and tasted, like it came straight out of a tin. 'Two small, rectangular slices of ham of suspiciously-identical thickness without a hint of maple flavour. Very, very poor. For a bill of £238.50 for four, including drinks, I expect much, much better. 'If you want to experience good quality food and cooking at fair prices, try any Jason Atherton place - so much better. 'Just leaves you with the feeling that Ramsay's empire has just got too big for its boots Only plus point? The guys behind the bar are great! Needless to say, won't be coming back.' There were some positive comments with one reviewer recently giving the establishment a five out five rating - although their comment ends 'I wouldn't stay here again and that's only because of the price'. Mixed reviews: The London establishment, situated near The Regent's Park, did get some positive feedback but many reviewers complain it's poor value for money . Scathing: A review from last summer lays into the 'small, dismal, bog standard room' at the London hotel . Another called it a 'lovely experience' and wrote: 'A great base for exploring and the town was extremely interesting.' Of the 138 reviews on TripAdvisor, 22 are average, 19 poor and eight call the hotel terrible. Many of the messages left in the comments book are also less than complimentary, The Daily Star Sunday reports. One note read: 'Room disappointing, good food, saving grace the cocktails and friendly bar staff.' Another guest from Scotland said 'a bit more attention to room cleanliness' was needed, although they did still call it 'a fab wee place'. The newspaper also took pictures in the hotel showing broken tiles, cracked mirrors, unattached bath fixtures and peeling wallpaper in one en-suite room. The swanky York & Albany has been voted 527th out of the 1,073 hotels in London. Less than complimentary: While giving the establishment a three out of five rating on TripAdvisor, two reviewers were ultimately unimpressed by their stay .

"Missing: Drake Kramer, 21, of San Antonio, Texas has been missing for the last week. He was last seen at the Grand Canyon on Saturday . Search and rescue teams have been searching 285 square miles of the Grand Canyon for the last week, combing the area for a 21-year-old geology student who went missing there after sending a puzzling text message to his worried parents. Drake Kramer of San Antonio, Texas was last spotted at the south rim of the Grand Canyon on Saturday, January 31. He checked out of the Bright Angel Lodge the next morning and hasn't been seen by friends or family since. His parents Robin and Brenda Kramer reported him missing on Monday, when they learned of the trip and received a text message from their son in which he said he 'needed to be with Mother Earth'. 'We don't know what his plans were. He may be hiking, we just don't know,' Kirby-Lynn Shedlowski of the Grand Canyon National Park told ABC News on Saturday. Mr Kramer told My San Antonio that his son was in 'good spirits' the last time the two met on January 29 to see the film American Sniper. 'He works and had just started school,' Mr Kramer said. According to Drake's Facebook page, he works at Lowe's and studies geology at Northwest Vista College. His parents say they lost contact with him for a few days, and when they reached out to his friends they said he was staying at a co-worker's house. The Kramers texted their son on Sunday, asking about his whereabouts and learned that he had unexpectedly traveled more than 1,000 miles to Arizona. Trail: The geology student checked out of this hotel at the south rim of the Grand Canyon on Sunday and hasn't been seen by family or friends since . Nature lover: Kramer's parents reported him missing on Monday after receiving a cryptic text message from him saying 'he needed to be with Mother Nature'. Pictured on the left during a 2013 trip to the Grand Canyon . Mr Kramer says it's 'completely out of character' for his son to pick up and leave without telling his parents. However, he is an experienced outdoorsman who has visited the park several times in the past. In pictures of the Grand Canyon posted to his Facebook page in August 2013, Drake wrote 'Great vacation which I coulda stayed'. His parents started worrying for his safety on Monday, when he sent a cryptic text message. 'He indicated that he needed to be with Mother Earth,' My Kramer told AZ Central. The National Park Service is currently leading the search for Drake from the ground and air. Drake has brown hair and blue eyes and stands 5-foot-7 at 140 pounds. It's unclear what he was last wearing, but he usually sports dark clothing with a backwards baseball cap. Anyone with information is being asked to call the National Park Service Silent Witness Line at 928-638-7840.

"On a wet Tuesday, I am hovering furtively in the fresh produce section of Sainsbury’s. But my absorption in the merits of Golden Delicious and Washington Reds is but a cunning charade. I’m really on a mission. I have just received four hours of tuition in the art of flirting from relationship coach Jean Smith and I’m here to put my skills to the test . Spotting a middle-aged victim, I sidle up and deliver the line suggested by Jean to provoke conversation. Scroll down for video . Could the fresh produce section of your local Sainsbury’s be the ideal place to meet your new man? ‘Um,’ I begin magnificently. ‘Have you tried that kind of apple before?’ The man gives no sign of noticing that I have spoken. I clear my throat and repeat myself. He looks up vaguely, and responds: ‘Mmm?’ I say the words for a third time. He stares at me, shakes his head and ambles off. Clearly, I’m in need of more practice. Flirting has been Jean’s specialist subject for more than a decade, after doing a masters degree in social anthropology. Not only has she produced an entire book on the subject (The Flirt Interpreter), but she runs ‘Flirtology’ courses. It has to be said that they’re not cheap. There’s a two-session Quick Fix for £299; a three-session promotion called Bag A Babe For Valentine’s (‘babe’ referring to either sex) at £399; and a three-month Ready For Change programme at £900. Relationship coach Jean Smith advises spending time in places where you can start up a conversation with a stranger without any expectations, such as a supermarket (picture posed by a model) Each one promises to identify where you are going wrong and give you a game plan to find your future partner. As a 51-year-old divorcee who has been largely single for a year, I give it a go. And I’m not the only one — business is booming for Jean, whose clients’ age range spans from the early 30s to the mid 50s. ‘I’m busier all the time, not because it’s harder to flirt these days, but because it’s become more acceptable to ask for help,’ she says. ‘People are just expected to know this stuff, and they think everyone else is born good at it.’ Jean’s three flirting secrets: . 1. If you see someone attractive, show signals of approachability — eye contact, open body language, smiles . 2. Ask an open-ended situational question involving a prop (so in a supermarket: ‘That cheesecake looks great — have you tried it?’) 3. Don’t worry about taking the direct approach. At the worst you’ve had a short conversation with someone you’ll never see again. At best — who knows? Indeed, the boom in online dating and the rise of so-called ‘silver splitters’, who divorce in midlife, means more of us than ever are struggling on the dating scene: one in five women over 45 is now single. ‘Clients appreciate a scientific approach. Flirting is a skill — you can learn it. I’m a catalyst to set people on track — it’s up to them to act on it,’ Jean says. My four hours with her are a condensed version of one of her courses. Judging by her central London flat where we met for the first two hours, she is doing very nicely. Jean asks what I’m looking for, ushering me away from ‘objectifying laundry lists’ such as height, weight and income. This is not to say she advocates hooking up with a short, fat pauper. But she urges me not to rule out someone just because I prefer taller men: ‘It’s holding you back. How much of your life are you standing up next to each other?’ Then she asks what I’m doing to improve my chances of meeting someone, and suggests a big party where everybody brings a single friend, adding: ‘You need to spend more time in places where you can start up conversations without expectations.’ This, it turns out, is largely what Jean’s ‘flirtology’ is about — not being coquettish, but simply going to places where there are other people, and talking to them. The idea is meeting as many potential partners as possible in the hope one will click. It’s a numbers game, but one you can only embark on if you’re confident enough — which is what Jean hopes to teach. Jean says that flirting is 'building rapport with strangers, with a frisson in the undertone to distinguish it from normal conversation' (picture posed by models) She has also devised an unlikely acronym for six flirting signals to look for. ‘It’s HOT APE — Humour, open body-language, touch, attention, proximity and eye contact. That’s what you look for to tell someone is flirting with you. Also self-disclosure — they tell you something about themselves.’ She tells me flirting is building rapport with strangers, with a frisson in the undertone to distinguish it from normal conversation. ‘British people don’t like intrusion, but they love to be talked to,’ says Jean. ‘My clients can be worried about bothering people. I teach you to break these unwritten rules about being polite which make it so hard to meet people. The real key to flirting is having the confidence to talk someone you find attractive (picture posed by models) ‘Would you be offended if you were at the supermarket and someone asked you: “Have you ever tried that kind of apple before?” ’ She seems astonished when I say I might be a tad surprised. ‘It’s only by trying it in a fun way that you’ll realise people respond really well,’ she replies brightly. I fear I’m not very good at this after being turned down in Sainsbury’s. Jean tells me I am ‘resistant’ to my ‘dating journey’, relating an anecdote about a client who asked a guy in a supermarket what rice he would recommend. ‘After a ten-minute chat, he invited her to his favourite curry house,’ she concludes triumphantly. I’m awed that anyone could have a ten-minute conversation about rice. But she is also very good at matters relating to rejection. ‘What does it matter if the person you’re talking to doesn’t engage? You’ve had a nice chat with someone you’ll never meet again.’ Some clients vouch for Jean’s methods. Laura Durham, a 28-year-old from London who works in marketing, describes Jean’s seminar last September as ‘life-changing’. ‘I had a two-year relationship which ended six years ago, and had only been on a few dates since,’ she says. ‘I was feeling hopeless because I find it so hard to initiate contact. ‘It’s made such a difference to my confidence to be able to talk to people without worrying I would do something wrong.’ Laura loved the £35 Fearless Flirting tour, a two-hour group outing starting at the National Portrait Gallery ‘where you will learn how to approach anyone without fear’. So I join one of these outings. Seven women and one man assemble, aged from their mid 20s to mid 50s, all sociable and attractive. James Hardcastle, a 35-year-old software developer, is the lone male. Jean tells us to make eye contact with and smile at three fellow gallery goers. Again I don’t have the knack, resembling a crazed escapee. Others find it easy. Then Jean dispatches us into a local Tesco to strike up conversation about groceries, telling us one client was so successful in a chat over cheesecake that the guy asked her out and they dated for three months. Jean says her goal is not always to find someone a partner, but rather to make people realise the great things they already have in their lives (picture posed by models) Unfortunately there are hardly any shoppers. I attempt a conversation about light bulbs with someone who it turns out cannot speak English. Or so he claims. We move on to a busy market to accost strangers for restaurant recommendations, and eventually adjourn to a bar. Everyone has enjoyed it, and James has even bagged a phone number. It turns out he is on Jean’s £900, three-month course. He has been single for several years, and I genuinely cannot work out why. ‘I have loads of friends but nothing seems to spark beyond that,’ he says. ‘I’ve done online dating and met one crazy person after another. I must be doing something wrong.’ Actually, it turns out Jean’s goal may not coincide with James’s. It’s not completely hooked on the end result of having a partner, more about realising the great things in what you already have,’ she says. And as bonkers as this course can seem, that’s a valuable lesson. The real thing she teaches is not flirting, but having the confidence to flirt. If you see someone attractive. Don’t contemplate talking to them. Do it, without worrying what they will think or whether they are single. ‘If he’s not single and you’re just having a friendly chat, is it inappropriate?’ says Jean. When I say I am going to the theatre that night, she tells me that in the bar at the interval, I must say to the man of my choice: ‘That looks an interesting drink. What is it?’ That night at the theatre bar I find myself next to a reasonable-looking man. He orders water. Sometimes, life just isn’t on my side.","Relationship coach Jean Smith has written an entire book on flirting .

"A teenage boy has been charged with the December mugging of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's teenage son. The young suspect, whose age was not immediately released by police, was arrested on Saturday and charged as a juvenile with robbery and aggravated battery in the public way. The attack had occurred on December 19 near the Emanuel family's home when 17-year-old Zach had been speaking on his cell phone around 10pm. According to a police report, two males approached him from behind. Rahm Emanuel's son Zach, left, had been approached by two men near the family's Chicago home on December 19. He was put in a chokehold and punched and had his cell phone stolen . One of the robbers put the teen in a chokehold and the second punched him, knocking him to the ground. The report says they took his cell phone and patted him down. 'The offenders then asked the victim, 'What else you got?' (and) forced the victim to enter his security code to unlock the phone,' the police report said. The robbers then ran away. At the time, a spokeswoman for the mayor said Zach was treated for cuts and bruises on his face by a personal physician at his home. There is no information on when the boy – who has confessed to the crime – will appear in court. Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins issued a statement following the arrest. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel pictured in 2011 with his family including son Zach (left). The former White House chief of staff, is currently running for re-election . 'The Mayor and Amy (Rule, Emanuel's wife) are grateful to the dedicated men and women of the Chicago Police Department for their hard work, and they would like to thank everyone who shared kind thoughts and wishes for their son's well-being,' Collins said in the statement. 'As parents, they continue to ask that the media respect their family's privacy.'

"Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia's guitar may help solve a 24-year-old homicide case of an unidentified woman dubbed the 'Tiger Lady' for the signature tattoo on her left leg. New Jersey State Police recently released sketches of the crude tiger tattoo in November, and immediately started receiving a flurry of tips from Deadheads who said it based a striking resemblance to a similar design on the guitar Garcia used from 1979 until 1995. 'It's indubitable a take on Jerry's guitar,' Dennis McNally, a longtime publicist for the band, told NJ.com. Scroll down for video . A break in the case? The picture on the left shows the tattoo found on a homicide victim's body in October 1991. Police released the sketch this past November, and received tips pointing to the connection to a detail on Grateful dead frontman Jerry Garcia's guitar (right) The connection to the Grateful Dead provides a crucial bit of evidence in a case where investigators were left stumped by a lack of clues. And it makes sense too - the Grateful Dead played a series of concerts in the area in the weeks leading up to the mystery woman's death. Similar design: Jerry Garcia used the guitar with the tiger detail from 1979 until 1995 . The naked body of the Tiger Lady was found decomposing on the side of the Route 94 turnoff in New Jersey on October 26, 1991. Police suspected foul play in her death,  but didn't know where to turn since they could neither identify her or figure out the cause of death. No drugs or alcohol were found in her system after a toxicology report and there was no sign of traumatic injuries such as blunt force or bullet wounds. At the time, it was estimated that she died about 10 days before. But experts say the decomposition of the body could have happened over a longer period of time. If so, she could have died sometime between September 8 - 18, when the Grateful Dead were playing nine back to back shows at nearby Madison Square Garden. 'The potential connection to the Grateful Dead touring in the area is something the detectives will look at,' said Sgt. Jeff Flynn, a spokesman for the New Jersey State Police. 'With social media, we can get new eyes on this case. With cold cases, you have to look at any new leads that pop up.' At the time, the only piece of evidence on the Tiger Lady's body for police to investigate was the tattoo, and they were successful in finding the ink supplier - Spaulding and Rogers of Vooheesville, New York. Who is she? Above, a sketch of the victim simply known as the Tiger Lady. Police are hoping the new connection to the Grateful Dead will help solve the case . Spaulding and Rogers helped out with the investigation, sending more than 20,000 fliers to tattoo artists they supplied in hopes that someone would recognize the design and be able to identify the woman. Now that police believe the victim was a potential Deadhead, they may have better luck since the community is close knit and have groups dedicated to aiding in these investigations. Those within the community say Deadheads were targeted when the band was still touring, since they were generally considered to be trusting people. 'It was assumed you were a good person, because you were a Deadhead,' McNally said. 'It was certainly an ideal environment if some twisted individual wanted to prey on people. This was an audience almost uniquely susceptible.We had some horrible things happen.' One Deadhead also pointed out a detail of the homicide that could further prove the woman was a fan of the band. 'It would make sense that she was found as naked as she was,' added Cunha. 'The people that she would have been with would have known she would be identified from the tie-dye, the jewelry.'","A woman was found dead on the side of a New Jersey road in October 1991, with a tiger tattoo on her left leg .

"Retired surgeon Ben Carson said on Sunday that he could form a committee to explore a bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination this month and make a formal announcement in May. 'That's a reasonable time frame,' Carson told Fox News Sunday when asked by host Chris Wallace about the timing of an exploratory committee and formal announcement. 'We're putting all that together,' Carson is a former Fox News contributor who is popular with Tea Party conservatives and ranked fourth among possible Republican candidates in a recent Fox News poll of potential voters in Iowa. He finished behind former Florida Governor Job Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul. The poll showed growing support for Carson, a bestselling author and conservative commentator, with 10 percent of potential voters saying they would vote for Carson, up from about 8 percent last year. With a dozen Republicans thinking seriously about running for president in 2016 and 10 more talking up the idea, it's a good time to be an experienced campaign hand. Potential candidates are scrambling to sort through the rosters of campaign veterans in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire and elsewhere in a talent search that reflects the fact that the Republican field for 2016 is the largest in recent memory. The competition, dubbed by some as a 'staff primary,' aims to find the right of mix of get-out-the-vote organizers, digital experts, fund-raising stars and messaging professionals able to set up a functioning campaign. 'There is a known universe of operatives with many of them headquartered in early primary states,' said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in his 2012 presidential campaign. 'Right now I think the contest is focused on all the candidates trying to go after that universe of staffers.' As many as 21 Republicans are in various stages of considering a presidential run, far more than the dozen or so who gave it a go four years ago. Of these, probably 10 or 12 are really serious and the rest are testing the waters or are trying to promote their personal brand. Every ideological slice of the Republican spectrum is represented, from mainstream former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a favorite of the small government Tea Party movement, to libertarian Kentucky Senator Rand Paul to retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a Fox News personality. Others exploring presidential runs include New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Texas Governor Rick Perry. The field is so large because there is no nominee-in-waiting as there is in the Democratic arena, where former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is widely seen as having a lock on the Democratic nomination should she choose to run. There is also a younger generation of Republican leaders eager to make their mark like Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is 47, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, 43.","Carson said on Sunday that he could form a committee to explore a bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination this month .

"Two Al Jazeera journalists being held in an Egyptian jail are set to go on trial again later this week after spending more than 400 days in prison. Baher Mohamed, an Egyptian national and Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy, were sentenced to between seven and 10 years in jail last year on charges including spreading lies to help a terrorist organisation - a reference to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. They were arrested along with Australian journalist Peter Greste in Cairo on December 29, as they covered the aftermath of the army’s removal of Mohamed Morsi from the presidency in July 2013. Scroll down for video . Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahy at a previous court appearance alongside freed colleague Australian Peter Greste . Last week Mr Greste was freed by order of Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, under a new law that allows foreign prisoners to be deported. However, his two colleagues remain in prison and today one of the men's lawyers confirmed that their retrial would be on Thursday. Mostafa Nagy, a lawyer for Mr Mohamed said: 'The session has been set for February 12, 2015. It is the new session for the retrial. Al Jazeera English also reported the date on its website. Last week, there had been reports that Mr Fahmy was due to be imminently released from prison after reportedly relinquishing his Egyptian citizenship in exchange for his freedom. John Baird, Canada's foreign minister, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation he expected Fahmy's release, but gave no specific timing. Producer Baher Mohamed, left, and Mohamed Fahmy, bureau chief, right, are set to go on trial again later this week after spending more than 400 days in prison . Australian journalist Peter Greste was released from an Egyptian prison last week by order of Egypt's president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, under a new law that allows foreign prisoners to be deported . However, his finacee said today that she had no information about his possible release. Egyptian authorities accuse Qatar-based Al Jazeera of being a mouthpiece of the Brotherhood -- the movement the army removed from power in 2013. Al Jazeera denies the allegations. The journalists were detained in December 2013 and they say they were doing their jobs. Their imprisonment reinforced the view of human rights groups that the government was rolling back freedoms gained after the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak. Baher Mohamed was given an extra three years for possessing a single bullet. Upon his release last week, Mr Greste revealed it was traumatic leaving his colleagues behind in a Cairo prison and he didn't truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus. He used his first interview since being deported from Egypt to call on the country to his colleagues the Cairo bureau chief Mr Fahmy and Mr Mohamed, a producer. Demanding release: Lawyer Amal Clooney waits on January 28, 2015 for the start of a hearing before the European Court of Human Rights in the eastern French city of the Strasbourg . 'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday. 'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.' Meanwhile prominent lawyer Amal Clooney has requested a meeting with Egypt's president to push for the release of Al-Jazeera reporter Mohamed Fahmy, a letter obtained by AFP on Saturday shows. Mrs Clooney, who married Hollywood star George Clooney last year, has thrown her legal clout and celebrity behind Mr Fahmy to secure his release. Rights groups and several media outlets condemned the verdicts as political, saying the three were doing their job during a tumultuous time. According to a law passed late last year, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has the power to deport foreign defendants or convicts if it's considered to be in the interest of national security. The law was seen as providing a potential legal instrument with which to free the journalists.","Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy set to go on trial again on Thursday .

"In the wake of Brian Williams' decision to temporarily step away from the NBC Nightly News, fresh footage has emerged of him lying yet again about the 2003 Iraq war story that has got him into so much hot water. The latest footage to surface is a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television in which Williams repeats his claim that a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at his helicopter. The news anchor admitted on Wednesday that the story is totally false, but in the interview with a student journalist he even goes further and claims that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of the weapon. In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams claims that he was close enough to stare down the barrel of an RPG that had been fired at his helicopter in Iraq in 2003 . 'I looked down the tube of an RPG that had been fired at us and had hit the chopper in front of ours. And I'm so fortunate to be sitting here,' Williams told his young interviewer prior to a speaking engagement at the campus. During the same interview Williams also recalls a close call in Israel in 2006 when he also claims he was lucky to escape rocket fire, reports Mediaite. 'I've been very lucky to have survived a few things that I've been involved in,' said Williams in 2007. 'The war with Hezbollah in Israel a few years back where there were Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in.' Yet Williams' original report on the July 2006 incident tells a rather less dramatic version of events. It does not reference anything close to rockets passing 'just beneath' his chopper and nor does he make any claims about being lucky to be alive. Fresh footage has emerged of Brian Williams, pictured above in 2014, lying yet again about the 2003 Iraq war story that has forced him to temporarily step away from anchoring the NBC Nightly News . 'The trails of smoke and dust visible out the window are where Katyusha rockets have landed - in this case in the uninhabited Israeli countryside, and in some cases they have set fire to the surrounding brush. The missiles are unguided and random. And plentiful,' writes Williams. 'Then, I noticed something out the window. From a distance of six miles, I witnessed a rocket launch. A rising trail of smoke, then a second rocket launch, an orange flash and more smoke — as a rocket heads off toward Israel.' But, in the 2007 interview, he told the student: 'I've been very, very lucky the way my life has turned out.' NBC News President Deborah Turness announced on Friday that an internal investigation had been launched after questions arose over Williams' false on-air statements that he was in a helicopter hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while in Iraq in 2003. Then in a memo on Saturday to NBC News staff, that was released by the network, the anchorman said that as managing editor of NBC Nightly News it had become 'painfully apparent' that he has become a distracting news story. Williams announced that was taking himself off the broadcast for several days with weekend anchor Lester Holt set to fill in. 'Made a mistake recalling': Williams, shown left in Iraq and right in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, has found his claims met with scrutiny . In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions.' As Managing Editor of NBC Nightly News, I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue. Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us. A source told the DailyMail.com Williams will not be involved in any of the day-to-day editing of the program during his absence. It has been repeatedly reported that NBC executives were warned a year ago about Williams constantly inflating his biography. The New York Times reports that it had got to the point where it was a joke in the news division but 'there was no one around to pull his chain when he got too over-the-top'. NBC News refused to comment Saturday on when or whether Williams would return and who would decide his future. Williams, however, said he would be back. 'In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions,' Williams said in his memo. 'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us,' he wrote. There was no indication by Williams, who has anchored NBC Nightly News since 2004, that an absence was forthcoming during his newscast on Friday. He signed off as he usually does, saying he hoped people would be back to see him on Monday. Holt did mention Williams' leave in Saturday's newscast. 'A word tonight about our colleague Brian Williams, who you may know has been under scrutiny this past week over his recollection of certain stories he's covered,' Holt said before reading Williams' memo to viewers. Since Williams' apology, questions also have been raised about his claim that he saw a body or bodies in the Hurricane Katrina floodwaters that hit New Orleans in 2005. His remarks in a 2006 interview drew suspicion because there was relatively little flooding in New Orleans' French Quarter, the area where Williams was staying. A person at NBC confirmed that Williams stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, which is in an area where a news photographer and a law enforcement official said they saw bodies. Nightly News has reigned as the top-rated evening newscast over its competition on CBS and ABC. Williams' importance to NBC News goes beyond his anchor status, said Al Tompkins, a faculty member for broadcast and online at The Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank. 'He sets the tone of the network. It may not be as critical as when (Walter) Cronkite was CBS' anchor, in every way, but he is more than a face,' he said. Williams' absence itself is a delicate challenge, according to Tompkins. 'He can't be gone long. The timing will be critical - too short and it won't seem like he has taken himself out of the game long enough, and too long and he looks like damaged goods,' he said. Replacement: Lester Holt anchors the weekend editions of NBC's Today show and Dateline . Lester Holt anchors the weekend editions of NBC's Today show and Dateline. The 55-year-old also hosts the weekend edition of the Nightly News. He has already spent time in the role he is taking over - having covered for Williams when he was having knee replacement surgery in August 2013. Holt's first job was as a DJ for a Country and Western station during college. Hoping for a career in the entertainment industry, he soon discovered he could only get a full-time job if he reported the news. The broadcaster spent 19 years with CBS beginning in 1981, when he was hired as a reporter for WCBS-TV in New York City. In August 2005, he assumed full-time duties at NBC News, where he became a substitute anchor for NBC Nightly News and Today. He then became a full-time co-anchor of Weekend Today following the death of his predecessor David Bloom. In September 2012 he faced embarrassment after turning up late to a Saturday morning show, because he overslept. Holt took to Twitter to alert viewers of his frazzled morning. 'For the first time in 9 yrs of hosting weekend @todayshow I overslept!' he posted on his Twitter account. The executive producer for the show ended up giving Holt a wake-up call at 5:45 a.m and he made a mad dash from his apartment, in the Flatiron District in New York City, to 30 Rock in midtown Manhattan where the show goes live at 7:00 a.m. He took the lead role during NBC's coverage of the London Olympics in 2012. And sleep also proved to be scarce for him during his stint across the pond. He was enjoying a nap on a train ride from London to Alnmouth, in the north of England, when he overslept, missed his stop and ended up in Scotland on August 7. He had to change trains four times over a time span of nine hours to get back where he needed to be. But in his typical good humor, the newsman joked about the incident and shared it with his fans over Twitter. 'If ya gotta end up in the wrong place u can do worse than Edinburgh. Catching some quick sights,' he tweeted, adding that on his return trip he would be 'drinking LOTS of coffee.' During the coverage of the Sochi Winter Oylimpics in 2014, he downed a shot of vodka with co-host Natalie Morales.

"Four bronze angels which were built for Cardinal Wolsey's tomb but vanished into obscurity for nearly 500 years are being bought for the nation - at a price of £2.8million. The opulent metre-high statues were made for Henry VIII's chief adviser in 1524 but disappeared after he fell out of the king's favour, at one point adorning the gateposts of a country manor. Now the popularity of BBC drama Wolf Hall, based on Hilary Mantel's double Booker Prize-winning book series, has helped thrust the sculptures into the limelight - and raised £87,000 from the public. Scroll down for video . Preserved: Originally designed for Cardinal Wolsey's tomb, these bronze angels will be preserved permanently in Victoria & Albert Museum in London after chiefs raised £2.8million to but them for the nation . Piece of history: Nearly £90,000 of the money came from the public, including the sale of 33,000 pin badges for £1 each in the museum shop. Wolsey fell out of favour with Henry VIII and his tomb was never finished . London's Victoria & Albert museum has raised £2.8million in all to acquire the works, led by a £2million grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. The Art Fund contributed another £500,000, the Friends of the V&A gave £200,000 and of the public fundraising, £33,000 came from the sale of Save The Wolsey Angels badges in the museum shop. V&A director Martin Roth said: 'The Wolsey Angels are a vital part of our national history and artistic heritage. 'We are very grateful to everyone who contributed to our fundraising appeal to ensure these outstanding sculptures, which were thought to be lost, are reunited and preserved at the V&A for future generations.' Drama: The campaign was given a boost by Wolf Hall, in which Wolsey is played by Jonathan Pryce . Played by Jonathan Pryce in the BBC adaptation of Wolf Hall, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey amassed considerable power in the early 1500s as one of Henry VIII's closest confidantes. But the pair fell out after the king's infamous attempt to annul his marriage with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, because she had not produced a healthy son. Cardinal Wolsey appealed for an annulment to Pope, based partly on the claim that Catherine was not a virgin when she married Henry - a claim she denied. Caught in an international deadlock between Henry and Catherine's powerful nephew, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, the Pope delayed the decision and Wolsey was stripped of many of his offices in 1529. He died just a year later mid-way through a journey to London, where he was due to face accusations of treason. Work on the angels had already started six years earlier in 1524, but the magnificent Renaissance-style tomb Wolsey had planned would never be erected. The four bronzes were commissioned from the Florentine sculptor Benedetto da Rovezzano, who made them between 1524 and 1529. Along with the rest of Wolsey's possessions and his planned tomb, the angels was appropriated by Henry VIII who intended to use them for himself. Benedetto was commissioned to complete the tomb and he established himself at Westminster, where he employed founders and other craftsmen. However, progress was halting and Henry VIII did not see the tomb finished. Each of Henry VIII's three children expressed the intention to complete the memorial after he died, but they also failed to do so. Battle: The Cardinal fell out with Henry VIII (played in the BBC drama by Damian Lewis, right) after he failed to persuade the Pope to annul the king's marriage so he could marry Anne Boleyn (played by Claire Foy, left) Shifting power: Mark Rylance as Thomas Cromwell and Claire Foy as Anne Boleyn in the BBC adaptation . Elizabeth I moved the parts of the tomb to Windsor in 1565, where they stayed for 80 years until parts were sold to raise money during the Civil War. Only a black stone chest - which now houses Lord Nelson's remains at St Paul's Cathedral - was known to have survived until two of the angels appeared at auction in 1994. Unillustrated and catalogued only as 'in Italian Renaissance style', they were acquired by a Parisian art dealer and later the Italian scholar Francesco Caglioti attributed them to Benedetto. The other two angels were discovered in 2008  at Great Harrowden Hall, Northamptonshire - where all four had once perched atop the country manor's magnificent gateposts. During the fundraising campaign, all four unevenly weathered angels were reunited for the first time since 1988 in the V&A's Medieval & Renaissance Galleries. They remain there and will now stay in the museum, where they will be conserved and made to look as similar as they did in the day of Henry VIII. Unlikely home: The four statues once stood upon the gateposts at Great Harrowden Hall in Northamptonshire . New home: They will now be preserved for the nation at the Victoria & Albert Museum in central London . Fiona Talbott, head of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, said: 'Many of us have been enjoying the BBC's production of Wolf Hall, which makes it even more fitting to celebrate the purchase of these extraordinary statues. 'Congratulations to the V&A for being so tenacious in securing their future. 'We feel proud to have played a part too and hope that the Cardinal Wolsey's Angels - thanks to their current high profile - will attract many admirers both now and in the future.'","Metre-high works made in 1524 to show wealth of Henry VIII's adviser .

"A self-published author was 'astounded' to discover her crime thrillers have sold a million copies after agents rejected her first efforts. Sheila Rodgers's first novel Only The Innocent, written under the pen name Rachel Abbott, and its two sequels, have together sold a million copies - but the 62-year-old had thought she would be 'lucky' to sell 1,000. The three e-books have been bestsellers on Amazon's Kindle store - and remain in the top 100. Sheila Rodgers self-published published her first novel, under the pen name Rachel Abbott, in 2011 . 'Nobody is more astounded than me,' she told The Sunday Times. Ms Rodgers self-published Only The Innocent in 2011 - which were soon followed by The Black Road and Sleep Tight. Her latest self-published psychological thriller - Stranger Child - is out later this month. All four novels feature protagonist Detective Chief Inspector Tom Douglas and focus on relationships and crime. 'Unlike the stereotype policeman, he's not a drunkard. 'He is divorced, but he's not bitter and twisted.' The author, who lives on Alderney with her husband, says on her website: 'For many years it was my ambition to write a book. 'I wasn’t particularly bothered about publishing it – I just wanted to write it.' She adds: 'But then – when it’s finished – what do you do with it? I was under pressure from my various readers to get it published, but I didn’t really have much heart for chasing agents and all that went with it. 'I decided that as it’s just sitting on my computer, I may as well publish it for the Kindle. Easy, I thought!' For frustrated authors rejected by publishers or wanting to cut out the middle man, self-publishing has never been easier. It has been revolutionized in recent years by a host of free self-publishing platforms from Amazon, Apple and specialists like Smashwords. These have created new opportunities and a huge market for both unknown hopefuls and a few established writers. As well as Ms Rodgers, success stories include E. L. James - whose Fifty Shades of Grey series was first self-published. It was then picked up by Random House and became the fastest-selling paperback of all time, propelling James to the top of the Forbes list of highest-earning authors in 2013. A big-screen adaptation starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson is hitting cinemas this month. Mark Coker, who founded Smashwords after having his own co-authored novel rejected by publishers, wrote in a recent blog post: 'The stigma that once haunted self-published authors is quickly melting away.'","Sheila Rodgers decided to self-publish her novel Only The Innocent in 2011 .

"Ordeal: Kelly Brown, 28, was left with brain damage after hitting her head on the road during a row with a taxi driver in 2009 . A mother-of-two has spoken of her dreadful ordeal after a row over a £4.40 taxi fare ended with her lying in a coma for a month with brain damage. Kelly Brown, 28, was forced to have a section of her skull removed after smashing her head on the road outside her home in Newcastle following St Patrick's Day celebrations in 2009. She claims she had got out of the taxi to fetch cash from her house but was still next to the vehicle when the driver suddenly lurched forward in the car - causing her to fall over. After smashing her head on the ground, she was left with brain damage and spent more than a month in an induced coma as medics desperately fought to save her life. The taxi driver, who says Ms Brown had threatened to run off without paying before their row began, claims he moved the car forward because he 'feared for his safety' - and insists he made no contact with the mother. He was never prosecuted but a High Court judge later allowed her to pursue a civil claim for damages. She won the civil case and is now set to receive a payout. Ms Brown, mother to Danny, eight, and Surri, said: 'Before the accident, I was hoping to get a job as a nurse and be able to buy a nice house and car. All that has been taken away from me. 'I feel incredibly lucky to be alive. There was a point when I thought I'd never see my kids again. 'Every day I spend with them now feels extra precious. It's affected my life in every way. It's really heartbreaking.' Ms Brown, who was 21 at the time of the crash, was airlifted to Newcastle General at around 1.40am on March 18, 2009. Over the next five days she had part of her skull removed and a string of operations to alleviate the pressure on her brain. Her family kept a bedside vigil as she staged a remarkable recovery. She was released four months later but suffered epileptic seizures at her home. Medics later intricately moulded a titanium plate on to her skull. Hospital battle: The mother-of-two spent a month in an induced coma as medics fought to save her life . In the High Court hearing, held in Newcastle to determine whether Ms Brown could launch civil proceedings against the cab driver, he claimed she had hurled drunken abuse at him and said she was trying to dodge the fare. He said he had driven forward because he 'feared for his safety' - but he refused to accept his car had touched her before she fell to the floor. However, Judge John Behrens dismissed the account as 'inconceivable' in a hearing to determine liability for the incident. A further court date will be set to assess what damages to be awarded. In a written ruling, Judge Behrens said that 'probably no one will ever know' why the taxi was moved forward. The judge wrote: 'It is possible that the movement was accidental but I make no finding to that effect. 'I am, however, satisfied that he did move the taxi forward and to the right at a time when he knew that the claimant was close to the front offside of the taxi. 'He plainly did not take reasonable care for her safety.' Permanent reminder: Ms Brown was left with a massive scar on her head after surgeons were forced to remove a section of her skull in an emergency procedure to relieve pressure to her brain . Ms Brown now suffers from memory loss, a string of mental conditions and often finds it difficult to go out. She is undergoing a process of rehabilitation and often relies on support workers to help her. She added: 'Everyone is really proud of how far I've come and how I've improved. 'It could have been so different. I can't really complain about things because it could have been a lot worse.' John Davis, a partner in the serious injury team at Irwin Mitchell solicitors who has represented, said: 'Kelly sustained life-threatening and life-changing injuries in the accident and she and her family have been through a real ordeal as she has battled not only to seek justice but also to return to health. 'I am naturally delighted by Kelly's court victory but I am even more pleased that she will now have access to the rehabilitation and help that she will need to overcome the difficulties that she has been left with as a result of her dreadful injuries. Requires care: The 28-year-old now suffers from memory loss, a string of mental conditions and often finds it difficult to go out . 'Kelly and her family deserve the chance to try to get back to how things were before the accident and I am really pleased that her court victory will now give her the funds which will give her the opportunity to do so.' A Northumbria Police spokeswoman said the case was now a civil matter. A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'In order to bring criminal charges in any case, there must be sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction. 'During the course of the investigation, significant doubts emerged about the credibility of key eyewitness accounts. 'This made it impossible to establish the exact sequence of events beyond any reasonable doubt. As a result, no criminal charges could be brought against the driver of the vehicle.'","Kelly Brown, 28 caught taxi home on evening of St Patrick's Day in 2009 .

"Victim: 46-year-old Daniel Wynn Smith was reportedly under the influence of methamphetamine and MDMA during a fatal attempt to trim a palm tree . A 46-year-old Las Vegas man was reportedly under the influence of drugs during a fatal attempt to trim a palm tree last month. Both methamphetamine and MDMA were discovered inside tree trimmer Daniel Wynn Smith's system, the Clark County coroner's office told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Citing the coroner's office, the newspaper reported that Smith died accidentally on January 11 due to asphyxia and chest compression. The Review-Journal reported that the coroner's office considered the presence of methamphetamine and MDMA to be 'significant factors.' According to MyNews3, Smith got snarled in a North Las Vegas palm tree - between 25 and 30 feet above the ground - on January 11. The television station reported 'Firefighter crews were not able to see the patient in the tree because of the palm fronds that were hanging down, completely covering him.' 'Once crews were able to use a ladder truck to reach the victim, they had to cut the palm fronds from around him in order to be able to attempt a high angle rescue. It took crews 15 minutes to rescue the middle aged adult male from the tree and transport him to the hospital, according to a North Las Vegas Fire Department news release.' Witness and neighbor Jay Atkins told 8NewsNow last month 'I just saw leaves and brush coming down and then I noticed a guy was up there cutting. And then, they had the street blocked off.' Atkins also told the television station 'You would think you wouldn't be up there in the rain.' Neighbor Pat Burgess also spoke to 8NewsNow at the time and said of the tree 'That's been growing like that for at least a couple of years.' An obituary for Smith says he has a widow and that 'Dan enjoyed collecting artifacts and rocks, fishing and working on cars. If anything broke down, eh [sic] could fix it.' The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that a 49-year-old man suffocated to death while trimming a palm tree on December 22 in North Las Vegas.

"Detroit Lions running back Reggie Bush is denying recently-published allegations that he gave out MDMA, or 'Molly,'  and that he spiked champagne with the drug at a nightclub. The denials are in response to a Friday report by the New Orleans Advocate, which quoted remarks Brandon Licciardi made in 2014 to Orleans Parish authorities. The newspaper reported that Licciardi is facing charges for allegedly assisting Darren Sharper 'drug women to prime them for rape.' Sharper was a New Orleans Saints player in the 2009 and 2010 football seasons. Licciardi once worked as a sheriff's deputy for St. Bernard Parish, the news outlet also reported. Athletes: Reggie Bush is seen with Darren Sharper in this file photo. The two men both played for the New Orleans Saints. Bush has denied allegations he gave MDMA, or 'Molly,' to women and that he spiked champagne with MDMA . According to the Advocate, Licciardi told authorities that he spotted Bush in a Vegas dance club's VIP section and that Bush recognized Licciardi as Sharper's pal. The newspaper quoted Licciardi as saying 'OK, um, I was in Vegas about three years ago and um, Reggie Bush put Molly in Champagne. He was handing out Molly on the dance floor to girls. Handing it out. Like giving it to them.' Then, Orleans Parish District Attorney's office investigator James O'Hern reportedly said 'And how do you know that?' According to the Advocate, Licciardi said ''Cause I saw it with my own eyes.' However, the newspaper reported that Licciardi went on to contradict himself and said: 'Reggie, yeah. No, I didn't see him put it in the drink. He told me. And he said he was handing it to people, in Vegas. 'He asked me if I wanted some. And I was like, ""I don't do that stuff.""' Bush, who was a New Orleans Saints player during the 2006 - 2010 seasons, is not accused of drugging or raping anyone, the Advocate pointed out. Athlete: Bush now plays for the Detroit Lions, and tweeted Friday report 'I 100 percent intend to take legal action against The Advocate if they do not retract their LIE-FILLED article. Shame on you!' Smiling: Bush posted this selfie on Saturday, with a caption that read ''#AdvocatingLies #ButYouTried #YourLiesWereOnFleek #SomeonesGettingFired #GetYourStoryRight #JuicyFakeTitlesToSellPapers' An attorney for Bush, Shawn Holley, denied the allegations while speaking to the Detroit Free Press in a report published Saturday, saying 'This is outrageous.' Holley echoed those sentiments on Sunday, telling Daily Mail Online in an emailed statement 'Reggie vehemently, adamantly and unequivocally denies each and every statement posted about him in The Advocate. We will be seeking an immediate retraction of this patently false story and we will seriously consider taking legal action against The Advocate and the irresponsible writers of this outrageous and fallacious ""story"".' Bush tweeted Friday 'I 100 percent intend to take legal action against The Advocate if they do not retract their LIE-FILLED article. Shame on you!' Bush also posted a selfie of himself smiling to Instagram Saturday, with a caption that read '#AdvocatingLies #ButYouTried #YourLiesWereOnFleek #SomeonesGettingFired #GetYourStoryRight #JuicyFakeTitlesToSellPapers.' Daily Mail Online has reached out to the Detroit Lions, Licciardi's attorney, as well as The Advocate, its New Orleans managing editor, and the reporters who penned the report for comment.","Reggie Bush and his attorney have denied allegations that Bush gave out MDMA, or 'Molly,' and that he spiked champagne with MDMA .

"At an eye-watering cost of £3.6billion and spread across almost 1,000 acres of an old farmland, these pictures show Disneyland Shanghai ahead of its grand opening next year. The highly anticipated theme park will include the world's largest Disney castle called the 'Enchanted Storybook'. It will also feature a production of 'The Lion King' in Chinese and a pirate-themed zone based on the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. An artificial mountain will loom over the park, becoming the highest hill in Shanghai's Pudong district, and a 420-room Disneyland Hotel is planned in an 'elegant Art Nouveau style', with another based on the Toy Story films. Scroll down for video . Aerial shots of the Disneyland Shanghai that will have the world's largest Disney castle called the 'Enchanted Storybook Castle' Workers make their way to the site on rickety bicycles - the theme park is expected to open its doors to the public in spring 2016 . The theme park is the first in mainland China and the second within the Greater China region, the other being the Hong Kong Disneyland . The site will cover 963 acres in Pudong, Shanghai, or approximately three times the size of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort . On a commercial level, an adjacent 'Disneytown' will have 495,000 square feet of shops, restaurants and a 1,200-seat theatre. As well as the Disney attractions, the park will also have a 'distinctly Chinese' character, namely through a park called the 'Garden of the Twelve Friends'. Shanghai Disney will also have 12 mosaics that will exhibit the Chinese Zodiac's 12 signs, but with the use of Disney characters. It is hoped the park will open to the public in the spring of 2016 and welcome more than seven million visitors a year, eventually rising to 16 million. It is built on a farmland in the once rural area of Chuansha, near the city's Pudong International Airport. Disney's latest venture comes 60 years after its first park was built, Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California . It was originally due to be transformed in time to open this year, but Disney chairman and chief executive Bob Iger last week announced a delay, pushing the opening back to next spring. He attributed the change to an expansion in the park's size and number of attractions . Disney's latest venture comes 60 years after its first park was built, Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California and it owns five other parks across the world, including one in Paris and Tokyo. It was originally due to be transformed in time to open this year, but Disney CEO Bob Iger last week announced a delay. Disney CEO Robert Iger said last week: 'I was in China the week before last and saw amazing progress. 'We just topped off our signature Shanghai Disneyland Hotel, and we're nearing completion on iconic features throughout the park, including the largest castle we've ever built, and we're getting ready to start casting the hundreds of performers we'll need to entertain our guests.' Shanghai Disney is a joint enterprise between state-owned company Shanghai Shendi Group and Disney with the former holding 57 per cent of the venture and the latter owning the rest.

"A baby badger has been nursed back to health after it was brought in from the cold a home in a Jack Russell's jaws. The tiny newborn has been named Little Star after the dog took it home to its owner in Derbyshire. The woman noticed 'something pink in his mouth' and the little badger was dropped cold and wet onto her kitchen floor. The tiny newborn, named Little Star, is now thriving after the dog took it home to its owner in Derbyshire . It appeared to be dead but was revived by the warmth of the woman's hand. When she realised it was alive she contacted her local badger group, who quickly contacted Somerset's Secret World Wildlife Rescue where the baby badger is now thriving. It had weighed only 80g when it was found by the woman - but is now gaining weight after being fed every two hours round the clock. This is the first orphan of the year for the wildlife rescue centre, which has years of experience in rearing cubs. Secret World cares for more than 5,000 injured and orphaned animals every year. The newborn is being hand-reared by workers at Secret World wildlife rescue centre and fed every two hours . Charity founder Pauline Kidner said: 'Badger cubs would not usually venture above ground until they are at least 10 to 12 weeks old, so this tiny badger is very lucky to survive. 'Despite being in an incubator, Little Star is so small and without her mum that an additional hot water bottle is needed to snuggle up to.' Secret World will open the doors to the public for its first open weekend over the Easter weekend with a 'Badger Bonanza' theme. The event is an opportunity to find out more about badgers and the work carried out at Secret World Wildlife Rescue.","The dog took newborn weighing only 80g home to its owner in Derbyshire .

"It was the moment when the oldest female hostage, being held inside the Lindt chocolate cafe for hours by a crazed gunman, had enough and confronted her captor because 'no one else had'. Mother and daughter were part of the Nine Network's television special on Sunday, recounting the ordeals of eight survivors: Paolo Vassallo, Harriette Denny, Joel Herat, Jarrod Morton-Hoffman, Fiona Ma, Selina Win Pe, Louisa Hope and Robin Hope. When quizzed about her confrontation with Man Monis, Robin, 72, told Liz Hayes on the Nine Network's siege special 'I just thought no-one else had (stood up to him) and I thought, well, I will have a go'. 'I just wanted to let him know that I wasn't impressed with what he was choosing to do with all of our lives.' Robin and Louisa Hope. Mother and daughter were trapped inside the Lindt cafe by gunman Man Haron Monis with 16 other hostages last December . Heavily armed Tactical Operations Unit police storm the building after Man Monis shot Tori Johnson . Louisa Hope suffered foot injuries in the climax to the Lindt Cafe siege on December 16 . Throughout their ordeal, the pair knew they would be unable to escape his clutches, with Louisa confined to the use of a walking stick. 'That's right. I'm not exactly able to run and my mother is elderly, so you know, reality, our reality was was that we really did have to wait for the police to come,' she said on the 60 Minutes program. The 72-year-old said to him: 'I just don't like your attitude. It's not an attitude of how we run. We don't need this. We come in here for refreshments.' The hostage-taker then turned to Louisa and said: 'Louisa, keep your mother quiet.' When quizzed about her confrontation with Man Monis, Robin, 72, told Liz Hayes on the Nine Network's siege special 'I just thought no-one else had (stood up to him) and I thought, well, I will have a go'. She was trapped with her daughter Louisa, who has MS . One of the last images of Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis, seen inside the Lindt cafe . But she would not and was determined to be heard by Monis. 'I want to go to the bathroom and my daughter needs her medication,' she told him and for a moment, he seemed to relent, offering to allow Louisa to take her medication. But then his mood shifts again and he focuses on the barrister Stefan Balafoutis, who he came to refer to as 'white shirt'. Louisa Hope recalls how her mother stood up to the crazed gunman . Survivors of the Sydney siege told their story to 60 Minutes in a two-hour special on Sunday . 'You, white shirt man, no talking,' he demanded. A short time later Mr Balafoutis would follow John O'Brien out the door, the first two taken hostage, to escape. John O""Brien and Stefan Balafoutis were the first hostages to escape the clutches of Man Monis . But there would be no escape for the mother and daughter. They were left inside, sitting with Tori Johnson. As the last group ran, Louisa remembers: 'I heard a bang and I looked up and I opened my eyes and they were all gone. Now, in the moment, in that moment, I assumed that the police had come. I didn't realise that they had escaped. Then, I saw the door and I went it's time to go.' But she couldn't. 'I stood up from my chair and went forward,' she said. 'But at the same time, went but mum's not coming and Tori, why are they not moving? In that moment, I went I can't go. 'You know, I can't go. I can't leave mum here. So what am I going to do? So I just laid down on the floor. I laid down face first and put my hands above my head, on the floor, and waited.' She had seen Jarrod Hoffman and Joel Herat lead the group of six out. 'Oh yes, and I also tried to encourage Tori to go. He is seated directly beside me.' Louisa couldn't explain why she and Tori didn't try to get out. 'Well, it was all so quick, you know,' she said. 'Look, truly, unless you are in the room, the experience of the quickness of the end was unreal. 'He came out and he was leaning over me and shouting ""Why are you there? Why are you there?"" and he grabbed me then by the - by my back, by my bra strap and hauled me up and I'm trying to get up and I'm saying ""I'm trying. I'm trying"". 'He drags me over to the middle of the room and says ""You stand here. You stand here"" and then ""No, no, you sit here. No you stand here. "" 'Then he calls me. He calls ""You"" and indicates to mum. Pulls her out. And he's hyper by this stage and he is anxious and, you know, alert and, you know, he has got his gun and he you know, he has got his gun and he - he is directing us and pushing us and, you know, you here. Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson seen here at the open of the store in 2013 was one of two hostages killed in the Martin Place siege on December 16 . 'And you to this side and me to the other side and he is spinning. And the back pack that he's wearing that supposedly had the bomb in it is moving and knocking me and probably knocking mum as well. And so it is all kind of go, go, go. And then, he says to Tori, he says ""You"" and he calls him over and says - says ""Neil down"" and, um, ""Put your hands on your head"". 'But what I heard was him then going back and saying ""Get down on your knees. Get down on your knees"". And time was just ticking, ticking, ticking again. I didn't know who was left. 'Tori, um, knelt down. And he was sobbing. And then the gunman scanning the room. And looking, he is expecting the police to come in the front door, seems to be blind that the back door is there and open. So he's looking for the police to come in the front and he's got the gun up high, holding it high and he's scanning and moving around and shuffling. 'And then his demeanour completely changes. It's like he's suddenly, like, steels himself, like suddenly goes very firm and very hard and very absolute in his body and feeling. 'And then he shoots Tori. So from the time that Tori was told to kneel, was some minutes. I can't remember how long those minutes or seconds were. But it wasn't immediate. It was time enough for Tori to steady his heart and then he shot him.'","Robin Hope, 72, was the oldest of the remaining hostages inside the Lindt cafe .

"The Australian Government is set to close the digital divide between the city and the bush by launching rockets and satellites into space to speed up internet connection speeds. In a first for Australia, the National Broadband Network has announced work is complete on all ten of its ground stations and the the first rocket will be launched in the next few months. The first satellite, which is the size of a large four-wheel-drive, will be shot into space from Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, in South America, by Arianespace. Scroll down for video . The Australian Government is set to close the digital divide between the city and the bush by launching rockets and satellites into space to speed up the internet connection . The news comes after Australia was recently ranked 44th on a global chart of internet speed in an Akamai report, suggesting schools business and homes in remote areas are falling behind. The satellites should ensure internet services to  400,000 Australian homes and 1,600 public buildings including 1,400 schools will be vastly improved. NBN Co's Satellite Architect, Julia Dickinson told Daily Mail Australia only a handful of these type of satellites have been launched into orbit, and they have all returned excellent results. The satellites will appear stationary to anyone looking at them from earth, however they will be orbiting about 36,000 kilometres above the equator. The main body of the satellites is about the size of a small bus or a large four-wheel-drive and the solar panels that extend from then measure about 26 metres - the length of a cricket pitch. In a first for Australia, the National Broadband Network has announced work is complete on all ten of it's ground stations and the the first rocket will be launched in the next few months . NBN Co's Satellite Architect, Julia Dickinson (pictured) told Daily Mail Australia that only a handful of these type of satellites have been launched into orbit in the past and they have all returned with smashing results . They will provide broadband to about three per cent of Australians, who will have a small dish or antenna on the roof of their home of office. 'Most of the satellites now are for broadcast activities so these satellites are specifically purpose built for broadband,' Ms Dickinson said. 'They've all been very successful in the past.' The satellites are set to cover the whole of Australia but NBN is targeting the people who live in remote areas. 'We’re expecting to get 100 times faster speed than what people in regional areas are currently experiencing,' she said. The satellites are set to cover the whole of Australia but NBN are targeting the population who live in remote areas . 'We’ll ensure these people get access where they haven’t before.' The rockets took six months to build but the massive satellites, which are some of the largest communication satellites ever built, took over three years to complete. Ms Dickinson said the three year process is a lengthy one, which takes a lot of planning and designing. 'They've completed build and they've almost finished their testing and then we have to wait for a launch vehicle availability,' she said. 'The satellite testing has been really good the we're very happy with the results.' The team will monitor the whole process from the ground stations located at Bourke, Wolumla, Broken Hill, Carnarvon, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Waroona, Roma, Geeveston and Ceduna . The satellites go through a rigorous testing process. They are shaken, vibrated, put in a vacuum, heated and cooled in a simulated environment to see how they will cope in space. 'It survived that really well and the second satellite is testing just as well,' Ms Dickinson said. These satellites will be the first launched in the five-year history of NBN. The company will monitor the satellites from ground stations at Bourke, Wolumla, Broken Hill, Carnarvon, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie, Waroona, Roma, Geeveston and Ceduna. 'Those of us who work in the satellite area have launched satellites before and been involved in satellite builds before,' Ms Dickinson said. 'It’s obviously very exciting and this project is really interesting because the satellites are specifically built for this and because we know it’s going to make such a difference to people’s lives.' The next step for NBN is to wait for a launch date, which Ms Dickinson says is very hard to predict due to a number of factors. However, she confirmed that the first satellite is ready to go and it will happen in 2015 . NBN Co launched the 'Shoot for the Stars' competition to give Aussie school kids aged 5-12 the opportunity to decorate the nose cone of the rocket which will launch the first satellite into space. In addition, the grand prize winner and their school will have the opportunity to name the satellite, etching their place in history.

"Sir Jon Murphy (pictured), has claimed that schools are pushing up violent crime figures by reporting petty playground squabbles to police . Schools are pushing up violent crime figures by reporting petty playground squabbles to police, a senior officer has claimed. Sir Jon Murphy, Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, said fights between boys, or girls pulling each other’s hair are no longer dealt with by teachers. Instead, staff are reporting minor incidents in playgrounds and classrooms to the police – driving an increase in one of the less serious categories of violent crime. Official statistics show the figures for assault without injury are on the rise, but the Department for Education denied schools were to blame. Sir Jon, who has been in the police for 40 years, was asked by local TV station Bay TV Liverpool why violent crime was increasing. He said: ‘What has actually arisen, and it’s risen sharply, is what is referred to as violent assault without injury. ‘When you and I went to school, if a couple of boys had a fight in the playground, that would be dealt with by the school and it would never come out of the school. ‘If it was two girls pulling each other’s hair, that would never be reported to the police. 'A whole host of physical interactions between people – sometimes it’s a punch where there’s no real injury – are reported to the police in a way that they never were.’ Official figures back up Sir Jon’s claim that more minor assaults are being recorded. After years of dramatic falls that had baffled experts, latest statistics show that violent crime is on the rise across England and Wales. The Office for National Statistics said violent crime was up 16 per cent in the year to September 2014 – although it could be that these figures are simply more accurate than previous totals, following claims that many offences were being ignored. Detailed figures seen by The Mail on Sunday show that there has been a sharp rise in the category of ‘assault without injury’, a type of common assault. A decade ago there were 241,229 such offences recorded by police and by 2012-13 the figure had fallen to 198,390. But in the 12 months to September 2014, there were 238,753 assaults without injury – the highest number for nearly ten years. Statistics show figures for assault without injury are on the rise and the Department for Education has denied schools are to blame. But official figures back up Sir Jon’s claim that more minor assaults are being recorded . Home Office rules describe assault without injury as ‘an application of force which generates a feeling of touch or a passing moment of pain’. Mike Hough, Professor of Criminal Policy at Birkbeck, University of London, said: ‘Jon Murphy is quite right that the increase in police-recorded violent crime is steepest for assault without injury. ‘My own belief is that the rise is a function not of real changes in crime, but arises from changes in recording practice. His schools point may be part of the explanation.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ‘We have not issued any guidance to schools on when they should call police to incidents. It is very rare for police to be called to schools.’","Schools are pushing up violent crime figures by reporting petty squabbles .

"A Falklands hero whose medal citation was lost by senior officers has been refused an award – despite a high-profile campaign by his family, MPs and The Mail on Sunday. The family of Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, 27, say the soldier was recommended for a gallantry medal hours after his death in the battle of Mount Longdon in June 1982. But because the handwritten citation was lost, the exploits of Cpl McLaughlin, of the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 Para), have gone unrecognised. Bravery: Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, 27, was recommended for a gallantry medal hours after his death, his family say . His family’s hopes were raised last year when Defence Minister Anna Soubry announced a fresh inquiry, but they have now been told that the review found no evidence that a citation was written. His brother and son furiously dispute this conclusion, while this newspaper has seen documents which appear to challenge the inquiry’s findings. These include a letter to Cpl McLaughlin’s commander, Lieutenant General Sir Hew Pike, written just days after the battle. In it, another Para officer, Major Mike Argue, writes: ‘You have read my citation. Prior to his death, he led his section like a demon on the rocks of Mount Longdon. This was McLaughlin at his best.’ The inquiry dismissed this reference to a citation, and also ignored the recollections of General Sir Hew, who is adamant that a medal recommendation was written at the time. How or when the citation was misplaced remains unclear. Last night, Cpl McLaughlin’s brother Mark, 53, from Liverpool, said: ‘We have had a battle royal with the Ministry of Defence who have been hellbent on refusing Stewart a medal no matter what evidence we put forward. A commemorative plaque at Mount Longdon, Falklands, where Cpl Stewart McLaughlin died in June 1982 . ‘The letter from Major Argue to General Sir Hew makes clear reference to a written citation. How can they dismiss it out of hand? I am disgusted but the fight for justice for my brother will continue.’ An MoD spokesman said last night: ‘The investigation was conducted to identify any material not previously available and found no new information, but again noted the courage displayed by him. 'It found no contemporaneous evidence that he was treated differently from the other servicemen who were considered for an award.’","Corporal Stewart McLaughlin, 27, was a member of 3rd Battalion, 3 Para .

Eyewitness Sophie Bichener exclusively told MailOnline Travel: 'I was just travelling to work  when I realised the border was closed. 'The updates from police and citizens showed there was an issue at the runway which turned out to be a suspicious suitcase on the easyjet flight which had just landed. 'I waited at the border for an hour and a half as police moved the crowds back. There didn't seem to be any immediate danger, but moving the crowd to a safe distance seemed appropriate. 'The Guardia were treating the situation well considering the tension between the two countries and were happy to provide information. 'This is the second time in a year I have been stuck at the border in the midst of a bomb scare. The Gibraltar threat level remained severe after the recent attacks in Europe and perhaps this is a side effect.' The Royal Gibraltar Police took to Twitter to explain the situation, saying that along with 'essential services', they were dealing with the situation.

The Gibraltar Chronicle have said the alarm was raised by a baggage handler, while the BBC state the situation was dealt with by military explosives experts. At least one flight was diverted, a British Airways plane had to go on to Malaga. The border with Spain was closed, and people were warned to stay away from the airport while an investigation took place. The incident began to affect those in and around the airport as security measures were put in place . The areas in and around the airport began to become very busy as the incident was heightened . However, easyJet have said the issue was only related to an unusual smell, and thatdidn't mention anything with regards to suspect luggage.

"The Home Office has been accused of failing to deport hundreds of foreign fraudsters who con Britons into marriage, to get a UK visa and to plunder their finances. Victims of immigration marriage fraud have told The Mail on Sunday that Theresa May's department is a 'shambles' and is not doing enough to tackle the problem. Not one alleged scammer has been deported or prosecuted despite an estimated 1,000 cases of marriage fraud being reported in the past year alone. Kim Sow, 58, has been calling for action since her Senegalese husband Laye walked out on her in 2013 after obtaining his British citizenship, leaving her £50,000 out of pocket . A new Home Office intelligence unit has been launched to combat the growing problem, but angry victims want the Government to 'wake up' and start investigating cases. 'We are seeing about 20 cases a week but no one is being prosecuted, no one deported,' said Kim Sow, of victim support group Immigration Marriage Fraud UK. 'These are long cons. The authorities need to realise it's not just about getting British citizenship, it's also about getting as many material assets as they can.' Mrs Sow, 58, has been calling for action since her Senegalese husband Laye walked out on her in 2013 after obtaining his British citizenship, leaving her £50,000 out of pocket. Working as a promoter within the World Music scene, she met musician Laye at a London nightclub in May 2007. He told her he was a widower supporting three young children in Senegal. He even showed her a death certificate for his late wife and three birth certificates for his children. 'He was a talented, intelligent and good-looking man, and seemed religious and humble. He seemed the perfect match for me,' she said. 'I thought it was love in his eyes, but it was pound signs.' The couple had an Islamic ceremony in Dakar, Senegal, in December 2007, and married again at Kingston-upon-Thames Register Office in June 2008. Mrs Sow bought a large Victorian home in Dover, in preparation for her becoming step-mother to his children. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire last night insisted the Home Office was tightening the rules on marrying foreign partners . After three years he won British citizenship. But then a shocked Mrs Sow found out that his wife was still alive, and found Facebook messages from Laye to scores of other women he was targeting on dating websites. He was also expecting a child with a British woman he'd been seeing behind her back. It later emerged he was wanted by immigration police in The Netherlands over an alleged marriage to a Dutch woman in 2002. Police have begun an investigation into Laye for bigamy, fraud and associated crimes. But it is unclear if he is still in Britain, and he did not respond to requests for comment. Following the break-up, Mrs Sow joined Immigration Fraud UK which has been founded in 2013 by Delene Alouane following problems with her Tunisian ex-husband. They have since been contacted by 600 people (70 per cent women and 30 per cent men) who say they have been targeted and duped into marriage by immigrants seeking a visa. After marriage, they apply to settle in Britain with their UK spouse, before dumping them when they are granted the right to remain here indefinitely, or acquire citizenship. It is common for the fraudster to claim half of their UK partner's home by having their name added to the property by the Land Registry without their spouse's knowledge. In many cases, they also rack up five-figure credit card bills and loans secured against their unsuspecting partner's property. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire last night insisted the Home Office was tightening the rules on marrying foreign partners.

"They were born just two years apart, grew up close and spoke daily on the phone as adults. But now, two sisters have been divided in court over  ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez's murder trial. Last Wednesday, Shayanna Jenkins was pictured sitting solemnly behind her fiancé, Hernandez, the former New England Patriot tight end who has been accused of shooting dead  Odin Lloyd in 2013. Just feet away, across the aisle, her sister, Shaneah Jenkins, was seen sitting alongside the family of her boyfriend, Mr Lloyd, 27, whose body was discovered in an industrial park in Massachusetts. Scroll down for video . Divided: Once-close Sisters Shayanna Jenkins (left), the fiancé of  alleged murderer Aaron Hernandez, and Sheneah Jenkins (right), the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd, have been divided in court over Hernandez's trial . Accused: Last Wednesday, Shayanna  was pictured sitting solemnly behind her fiancé, Hernandez (pictured), the former New England Patriot tight end who has been accused of shooting dead Mr Lloyd in June 2013 . Later in the hearing, Shaneah took the stand against Hernandez,  who has been pictured grinning in court a number of times. As she was cross-examined, her sister watched from the front row. During that time, the siblings made eye contact only once as Shaneah spoke of hearing the news of her boyfriend's death and how Hernandez had asked her how she was coping only once after it. The prosecutor then asked Shaneah if she had seen her sister in the courtroom, to which she replied 'no'. But when Shayanna craned her neck to make sure she was seen, she changed her response. The sisters, who shared a close bond just years ago, now appear to have a fractured relationship. Shaneah, 25, and Shayanna, 23, who introduced Hernandez and Lloyd the year before the latter was killed, grew up together in Bristol, Connecticut and took similar paths, Shaneah told the court. They both attended Bristol Central High School. During their last two years there, Shayanna began dating Hernandez. When he went to Florida to play football, Shayanna went to community college. Cross-examination: Just meters away from Shayanna, across the aisle, her sister, Shaneah  was seen sitting alongside the family of Mr Lloyd, 27. Later in the hearing, she took the stand (pictured) against Hernandez, 25 . Testimony: As Sheneah was cross-examined, Shayanna watched from the front row. During that time, the siblings made eye contact only once. Above, Sheneah is shown a transcript of her grand jury testimony . Killing: Hernandez (left) and Lloyd (right) first met less than a year before the latter was shot on June 17, 2013 . After Hernandez, now 25, was drafted by the Patriots in 2010, Shayanna left college and moved with him to a Massachusetts condo. Two years later, Hernandez signed a $40 million contract. That November, Shayanna gave birth to a daughter, whom they called Avielle Janelle. The family moved into a mansion in North Attleborough, not far from Gillette Stadium. Similarly to her sister, Shaneah enrolled in community college. However, she later transferred to Central Connecticut State University. She held down several jobs while majoring in criminology: at a home care company, for a law firm and at a Comfort Suites hotel in Southington, Connecticut. It was there she met Mr Lloyd, who was carrying out electrical work with a crew staying at the hotel, in January 2012. They started dating and after Lloyd's work ended, their relationship deepened. Mr Lloyd, who lived in Dorchester, and Hernandez first met in August 2012, when, for the younger sister's birthday, Hernandez got a skybox for a Patriots game at Gillette Stadium. Looking at evidence: Hernandez is pictured looking at a photograph of the drivers license of Mr Lloyd, admitted as evidence during the former football player's murder trial at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Mass . Tattooed: Hernandez pens a note during his high-profile 2013 murder trial using his heavily tattooed right hand . Solemn: Shaneah and Shayanna grew up together in Bristol, Connecticut and took similar paths, Shaneah told the court at Wednesday's hearing. Above, Shayanna is pictured at Britsol County Superior Court on Thursday . After that, the men saw each other a few times a month, Shaneah told the court. She would stay with her sister and Hernandez when she went to Massachusetts to visit Lloyd every couple of weeks. 'Almost every time I went there, he was with me,' Shaneah testified. During those visits, while the sisters would hang out upstairs, go shopping or get their nails done, Lloyd and Hernandez would sometimes hole up in the basement 'man cave' and smoke marijuana, often with other people, Shaneah testified. A few times, the couples went to clubs together. By May 2013, Shaneah graduated college and had big plans: pursuing a law degree at New England School of Law. She was moving to Boston, she said, and she and Mr Lloyd planned to live together. The next month, her boyfriend was dead. Investigation: Police officers stand near a bus sitting in front of Hernandez's North Attleborough, Mass, home on Friday. Mr Lloyd's body was discovered less than a mile away from the property, at an industrial park . Judge: Massachusetts Superior Court judge Susan Garsh, left, and a court officer, right, depart Hernandez's home on Friday, when a site visit was held for the jury. Hernandez has denied the charges against him . Back in court: Judge  Garsh presides during the afternoon session of the murder trial on Friday last week . He was killed less than a mile from Hernandez's North Attleborough home. Shaneah, now a second-year criminal law student, tearfully testified about receiving the call from police in the middle of the night. She called her mother. Her next call was to her older sister. After heading to see Mr Lloyd's mother in Boston, Shaneah and her uncle drove to the home that Shayanna and Hernandez shared. Surveillance video played in court from inside the home showed Shayanna giving her a long hug. As she watched the video, Shayanna put her hand on her forehead, then wiped away tears. But other parts of Shaneah's testimony seemed to agitate the older sister, who had her arms crossed and bounced her leg, occasionally emitting sighs as her sister spoke. Former NFL star: Hernandez, who was drafted by the Patriots in 2010, is pictured in court with his attorney . On trial for murder: Hernandez (left) smiles as defense attorney James Sultan fumbles over diagrams during his murder trial at Bristol County Superior Court on Friday, before turning and licking his lips (right) Shayanna pulled out a notebook and began writing notes at a few points, including when Shaneah said Hernandez had checked in with her only once to see how she was coping with Mr Lloyd's death. In the days after Mr Lloyd was gunned down, Hernandez's lawyer presented Shaneah with her own grand jury testimony, when she said he had periodically asked if she was OK. Shayanna then shared the notes with Hernandez's legal team. It is not yet clear if Shayanna will testify. Prosecutors say they might call her. They have accused her of getting rid of possible evidence at Hernandez's direction - a box from the basement - using her sister's car. Previous court apperance: Shaneah was seen crying as she testified during the murder trial on Tuesday . Shaneah testified she saw her sister carry a garbage bag to the basement after getting calls and texts the morning after Mr Lloyd's body was found. Hernandez has denied his involvement in the June 17, 2013, killing. Shayanna and Shaneah's mother, Jodi Jenkins, declined to comment to AP. The siblings also have a 16-year-old sister. The trial continues.","Shayanna Jenkins, 25, and sister, Shaneah, 23, used to talk on daily basis .

"An old story often repeated by Brian Williams about his bravery growing up in a quiet New Jersey suburb is being questioned by local residents in the light of his admission that he lied about taking enemy fire in Iraq. Williams announced on Saturday that he is temporarily stepping down from the NBC Nightly News amid questions about his false memories of war coverage in 2003, calling it 'painfully apparent' that he has become a distracting news story. Since apologizing over his exaggerated claims on Wednesday, questions have been raised about several previous claims by Williams including that he saw a body in the Hurricane Katrina floodwaters that hit New Orleans in 2005. Brian Williams (left today and right as a high school senior) announced on Saturday that he is temporarily down from the NBC Nightly News amid questions about his false recollections of covering the war in Iraq in 2003 . Now local residents in the sleepy New Jersey suburb of Red Bank are the latest to question his credibility over a story he told Esquire magazine in 2005 about being mugged at gunpoint during the 1970s. Williams recalls being left 'looking up at a thug's snub-nosed .38 while selling Christmas trees out of the back of a truck.' According to his story he was trying to help a local church when the thief grabbed his money. 'That wasn't a bad job, until a guy came up and stuck a .38-caliber pistol in my face and made me hand over all the money. Merry Christmas, right? Of course, I suddenly appreciated the other jobs I thought I hated,' Williams recalled when he told New Jersey Monthly in 2008. Scroll down for more . An old story often repeated by Brian Williams about his bravery growing up in the quiet New Jersey suburb of Red Bank, pictured, is being questioned after he admitted lying about his bravery in Iraq . HBO's Bill Maher joked that Brian Williams told such big lies that he could work at Fox News . But several longtime Red Bank residents aren't convinced by Williams' claims. 'I would highly doubt he's telling the truth,' Danny Murphy told the New York Post. 'I find it hard to believe anyone was held up in this area in the '70s. It was very safe,' said Murphy who owned a restaurant just a few blocks from where Williams claims he was accosted. The Post spoke to several residents who recall the area being so safe at the time that kids could walk around alone at night on their own. 'It was never dangerous here,' said Yolanda DeMaria, 93. 'It was a very peaceful town, a lovely town. It was a small town with a dress shop and a five-and-dime. No one locked their cars.' Another local resident also found Williams' claims difficult to take seriously. 'Don't listen to Brian Williams,' said Les Carbone, 85. 'He's going to tell you a lot of things. I doubt he was robbed at gunpoint. I was born in Red Bank, there were no crimes like that. Tell Brian Williams to stop lying.' Conan O'Brien also poked fun at Williams in a parody video where the news anchor takes credit for just about everything . Williams' troubles started on 30 January when the Nightly News ran a tribute to a retired soldier he had first met in Iraq in 2003. In his report Williams repeated his claim that his aircraft was hit by enemy fire and then the complaints started to flood in . With Williams’ credibility being called into question over his wild claims about his time in Iraq, NBC News announced on Friday that an internal investigation is being carried out. Also on Friday, Williams found himself the butt of a joke by Bill Maher, who suggested that the news anchor told such big lies that he could work at Fox News. 'When we get older… we misplace our keys, we have trouble with people’s names, we can’t remember if the helicopter we were in crashed,' quipped the late night host during his HBO show. Williams made such a 'blatant departure from the truth, he got an offer from Fox News,' joked Maher. Conan O'Brien is another late night host getting mileage out of Williams. He joked that the NBC News presenter had tried to 'get in on someone's glory' more than once. O'Brien then showed manipulated video of Williams saying he was responsible for the Miracle on the Hudson plane landing and climbing a giant rock - like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 2.","Locals in Red Bank, New Jersey, are questioning the credibility of claims by Brian Williams that he was threatened at gun point in the 1970s .
According to a regularly repeated Williams tale, he was selling Christmas trees as a young man when someone 'stuck a .38-caliber pistol in my face'

"I have sensitive eyes and always struggle to find a decent, affordable eye make-up remover. Which ones do you recommend? Jane, 56, Ayrshire. Eye make-up remover is one of the biggest unsung heroes on our bathroom shelves. Even if you wear only mascara, you still need something to take it off effectively without irritating your eyes. Many women struggle to find an eye make-up remover that is both effective and good for their skin (picture posed by model) Dr Hilary Allan, cosmetic dermatologist at Woodford Medical (woodfordmedical.com), advises trying make-up removers containing botanical ingredients, and staying away from fragranced formulations as they can irritate. ‘Micellar cleansing waters are water-based cleansers containing molecules that act like magnets, lifting away make-up and impurities from the skin,’ she says. ‘They tend to work well for sensitive eyes as they’re gently formulated.’ The new Garnier Pure Active Micellar Cleansing Water, (£3.33, Boots) is unperfumed and suitable for sensitive skin. Sally Penford, education manager at the International Dermal Institute, says: ‘It’s always better to use a specialised product for the eyes rather than an ordinary cleanser, as these products are specially tested for use on the thin skin of this very delicate area. ‘A water-soluble oil is best for removing heavy eye make-up and waterproof mascara. ‘A gel is particularly good for people who wear glasses, contact lenses or have sensitive eyes because they are light, gentle and won’t leave a residue on the eyes.’ You don’t have to break the bank with eye make-up removers. Here are my top budget options that are as easy on the purse as they are on the eyes: . Bourjois Maxi Format Express Eye Make-Up Remover (£5, Tesco) Bourjois Maxi Format Express Eye Make-Up Remover (£5, Tesco) This non-greasy formula removes heavy, smoky eye make-up, liner and waterproof mascara without having to rub the sensitive eye area. One saturated cotton pad gets everything off in one swipe. This is the best value of all the ones I tried — the 250ml version will last for ages. 10/10 . L’Oreal Paris Dermo-Expertise Gentle Eye Make-Up Remover (£2.53, Boots) L’Oreal Paris Dermo-Expertise Gentle Eye Make-Up Remover (£2.53, Boots) An eye make-up remover that has been designed for those with particularly sensitive eyes and those who wear contact lenses. Though it isn’t good for removing waterproof mascara, it is refreshing and soothing and it won’t irritate. 9/10 . Waitrose Pure Eye Make-up Remover (£1.99, Waitrose) Waitrose Pure Eye Make-up Remover (£1.99, Waitrose) Pure is a well-priced skincare range from Waitrose and the eye make-up remover is gentle and effective, even getting rid of waterproof eyeliner. This is not 100 per cent organic, but at this price, I won’t hold that against it as it’s gentle, which is what we’re looking for. 9/10 . Halo Eye Make-Up Remover Pads (£1.50, Superdrug) Halo Eye Make-Up Remover Pads (£1.50, Superdrug) These hypoallergenic and fragrance-free pads are handy if you’re travelling and they are also fabulous for removing morning-after panda eyes if you failed to cleanse properly before going to bed. They’re great value, as they work out at only 5p per pad. They didn’t irritate my eyes or leave oily residue. Keep in your handbag to repair mascara smudges during the day. 8/10 . MONDAY MASTER CLASS: TWO-MINUTE BROWLIFT . Big, bushy brows are fashionable, but what do you do if yours have become thinner and shorter over the years? I went to make-up artists Sam and Nic Chapman, the top-rated YouTube beauty gurus with millions of subscribers to their Pixiwoo channel, for a lesson in the two-minute brow lift. ‘The aim is to get real-looking brows that don’t look stencilled on,’ says Sam. ‘If you are using a pencil, make sure it is sharp or you won’t get the fine, feathery strokes you need. And you don’t want to draw lines that are too thick and end up with caterpillar brows.’ Elsa McAlonan (centre) visited make-up artists Sam (left) and Nic Chapman (right) for a lesson in the two-minute brow lift . First, Sam applied a neutral shade of shadow, Maybelline Color Tattoo eye shadow in Strip Nude (£4.99, Boots), all over the lid using an oval shadow brush (£15, Real Techniques Bold Metals Collection, Boots). Its full, round shape makes it easy to apply shadow quickly. Next, Sam used a pointed crease brush (£12) to apply a darker brown shadow along the lash line and into the socket and then blended it in. ‘As we age, the lids droop, so doing this gives the illusion of a brow lift,’ she says. The next step is to brush your brows into shape — upwards to give an arched look. They used Maybelline Brow Drama sculpting mascara (£4.99, Boots), which is a tinted gel that sets your brows. Colour is key: avoid too dark or too gingery. The finishing touch is to apply a tiny amount of gel brow mousse — Anastasia Beverly Hills Dip Brow Pommade (£15, Cult Beauty) applied with an angled liner brush (£10), which can be used for liner and to fill in sparse brows. This brush’s firm, slanted head allows you to get really close to the lash line, and it is also excellent for painting tiny fine strokes into your brows, making them look thicker and fuller. If you buy only one make-up brush, make it this one. Real Techniques Bold Metals Collection exclusively at Boots.","Eye make-up remover is a bathroom essential for most women .

"The Danish royal family are enjoying a break from official duties with a family ski holiday in Verbier, Switzerland, this week. Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and Crown Princess Mary headed to resort with their four children Prince Christian, nine, Princess Isabella, seven, and four-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine. The royals looked to be having a great time as the posed up for photographers at the resort this morning. Clockwise from top left: Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Crown Prince Frederik, Prince Christian, Princess Isabella,  Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine pose for photographers during their family holiday to Verbier, Switzerland . Australian-born Mary, who met Frederik at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and relocated to Denmark three years later, raced her husband down the slopes in a plastic toboggan. The 43-year-old looked radiant in a royal blue quilted jacket, black salopettes and a stylish pair of designer sunglasses. Frederick was dressed in a simple navy blue jacket and khaki salopettes but unlike the rest of his family, he steered clear of snow boots and wore a functional pair of hiking shoes. The children were dressed in a range of primary colours and the twins continued with their tradition of matching jumpsuits, with Vincent in blue and Josephine in red. Crown Princess Mary raced down the children's slope with her daughter Josephine . Crown Prince Frederik chased his wife down the slope with his son Vincent . Princess Isabella squealed with delight as she took charge of a racer toboggan . Its is their second trip to Verbier in as many years - the royals all decamped to the resort last year in exactly the same week for some fresh mountain air and a week's skiing. The family will have enjoyed a quiet few days on their own after a busy Christmas that saw them celebrate with the Greek royal family. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, her two children and their families joined Princess Benedikte and Queen Anne-Marie of Greece and their families at Fredensborg Palace on the Danish island of Zealand. Mary and Frederik co-ordinated their ski looks with chic shades of blue . Christian took a tumble on the slopes after taking a corner at high speed .

"A forgotten Magna Carta manuscript which could be worth up to £10million has been discovered in a Victorian scrapbook in a Kentish town's archive. It has been hailed an important historical find in the week the four original copies were brought together for the 800th anniversary of the charter which established the principle of the rule of law. The parchment, discovered in Sandwich's archive, was ripped and a third had been lost, but experts were able to establish it was issued by Edward I in 1300. Speaking from Paris, Professor Nicholas Vincent, of the University of East Anglia, who authenticated the document, said: 'It is a fantastic discovery which comes in the week that the four other known versions were brought together at the Houses of Parliament. Scroll down for video . A forgotten Magna Carta manuscript which could be worth up to £10million has been discovered, pictured the four original surviving copies were brought together for the first time at the British Library . King John signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215 – a moment hailed as one of the most significant in English history . 'It is a fantastic piece of news for Sandwich which puts it in a small category of towns and institutions that own a 1300 issue.' Archivist Dr Mark Bateson discovered the historical document  at the Kent County Council history and library centre in Maidstone. It is one of only 24 editions of the Magna Carta in known existence around the world. Professor Vincent said the fact Sandwich had its own Magna Carta means that is may have been issued more widely than previously thought to at least 50 cathedral towns and ports. 'And it is very likely that there are one or two out there somewhere that no one has spotted yet,' he said. More than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see the four surviving original Magna Carta copies, but only 1,215 will get the opportunity . The medieval history expert said the value of the Sandwich edition could be up to £10million. The first Magna Carta was agreed between King John and the barons in 1215 and was reissued on many occasions. Dr Mark Bateson found the document in December when he was asked to look up a copy of the town's original Charter of the Forest. It was found next to the charter in a Victorian scrapbook and its high value comes from the fact it also comprises the Forest Charter. There is only one other such pair in the world, owned by Oriel College, Oxford. It is understood that Sandwich does not intend to sell its Magna Carta but instead is hoping to benefit from its potential as a tourist attraction. Paul Graeme, mayor of Sandwich Town Council, said: 'On behalf of Sandwich Town Council, I would like to say that we are absolutely delighted to discover that an original Magna Carta and original Charter of the Forest, previously unknown, are in our ownership. King John signing the Magna Carta reluctantly by Michael, Arthur C, which was painted in 1945 . 'To own one of these documents, let alone both, is an immense privilege given their international importance. 'Perhaps it is fitting that they belong to a town where Thomas Paine lived, who proposed in his pamphlet Common Sense a Continental Charter for what were then the American colonies, 'answering to what is called the Magna Carta of England ... securing freedom and property to all men, and ... the free exercise of religion'. 'Through the American Declaration of Independence, continuing in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Magna Carta still underpins individual liberties worldwide. 'To own such a document - and the Charter of the Forest - is an honour and a great responsibility.' The four known 1215 editions are from Salisbury Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral and two held at the British Library. They were brought together for a one-day exhibition at the British Library Parliament for a crowd of 1,215 chosen by a public ballot. The first Magna Carta was  agreed by King John (left) in 1215, pictured (right) is 13th century copy which sold for £10million . Speaking of the exhibition, the Lord Speaker, Baroness D'Souza, said: 'Magna Carta established the principle of the rule of law and equality before the law; for 800 years we have been influenced by its contents and it remains one of the most important political documents in the world, with countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada tracing constitutional influences back to Magna Carta.' The Speaker, Rt Hon John Bercow MP, said: 'Over the past eight centuries the public and their Parliament have shaped society and changed the way we live our lives. 'The sealing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Montfort parliament of 1265 marked the start of the journey towards modern rights and representation, paving the way for the House of Commons and democracy as we know it today.' The parchment, which was issued by Edward I in 1300, is the final version of Magna Carta and three of its clauses remain on the statute books today. These include the defence of the church, the protection of the City of London and the right to trial by jury. The first Magna Carta was drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and agreed by King John on 15 June 1215 to make peace with a group of rebel barons. It was reissued and reaffirmed on many occasions in subsequent years. Eight centuries after King John sent copies of the first Magna Carta across his kingdom, just four remain. Two of the survivors are kept at the British Library, were they lay alongside the other two copies which are usually found at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. The two British Library copies came from the private library of the MP and and antique collector Sir Robert Cotton, whose collection of preserved documents laid the foundation for the library back in 1753. One of these manuscripts was almost destroyed in a fire in 1731, suffering some damage but remaining largely intact.. Staff at the British Museum Library in the early 19th century also made it harder to read by using outdated techniques to flatten and mount the historic document. The Salisbury Magna Carta has been at the Cathedral since the 13th century. It may have been deposited there by William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury and one of King John’s chief advisers, or it may have come from Elias of Dereham, who supervised the building of the Cathedral from the 1220s. The manuscript has rarely left the Cathedral in its 800 year history. The Lincoln Magna Carta has belonged to the Cathedral for 800 years. It is arriving at the British Library directly from the United States after going on display in Massachusetts and Washington, DC, where over 200,000 people viewed it. On its return to Lincoln, the manuscript will move from the Cathedral into a new permanent home at the ‘Magna Carta Vault’ in nearby Lincoln Castle.

"Scientists are making plans to beam messages from Earth out into the universe, effectively cold-calling the solar system to find signs of other life. Astronomers will transmit signals from radio telescopes to hundreds of other star systems in the hope of making groundbreaking discoveries. The plan, put together by scientists at the Seti (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in California, has been trumpeted as a major step in humanity's exploration of space. American scientists are preparing plans to launch a welcome message into the universe using a radio telescope. Above, the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory in Tasmania . Systems within a 20-light year radius of the planet will receive the message if the project is green lit. 'There could be many civilisations out there but if they are all listening and no one is broadcasting then nothing will happen,' said David Black, an astrophysicist and Seti's chief executive told the Sunday Times. 'One question is... if we go ahead, what message should we send? Should it be the work of a few scientists or should we involve the whole world, perhaps through the internet?' 'For half a century SETI has been searching for something that we ourselves do not produce: deliberate transmissions towards distant worlds,' added Douglas A. Vakoch. The project will be discussed at at the annual meeting of the American Association of Advancing Science next week. Leading academics however fear it could backfire, with Stephen Hawking, the world's most prolific scientist, warning against inviting aliens to the planet if they are found to exist. The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico (above)  sent out the largest radio telescopic message in 1974 . Leading scientists have warned against inviting contact with other life species including Stephen Hawking . The physicist is famously convinced of life beyond planet Earth, but has spoken of the dangers of extraterrestrial beings in the past. 'If aliens do visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans,' he said in a 2010 documentary. If the plan is approved, researchers will use radio telescopes to send out the messages. The telescopes transmit and reflect radio light off planets in the solar system and observe the longest wave lengths of light. In 1974 a radio telescope was used to transmit the largest beam in history out into the universe from Puerto Rico. The broadcast was sent from the Arecibo Radio Telescope and consisted of a simple image aimed at clusters 21,000 light years away.","Astronomers to put forward plans to transmit message to the solar system .

A neighbor named Kurt Vreeland told the Bergen Record that Michael Tabacchi's father got a text message from Michael then went to the couple's house on Friday night. Vreeland also told the newspaper that the father came over to his home where Mr Vreeland's EMT wife attempted resuscitation but 'It was too late.' Molinelli told The Bergen Record in July 2013 there was a civil ceremony for the couple and a May 2014 church ceremony. In October 2013, the couple's 15-month-old child was born, he also said. Michael Tabacchi was a JPMorgan Chase employee and his wife Iran Pars Tabacchi worked at the Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital as an administrative assistant in Hackensack, New Jersey. Social media profiles for the married couple show an outwardly happy existence. Iran posted pictures of her son's second Christmas and repeatedly noted that she was 'grateful' for the life she had - despite references to a 'frustrating and uncertain' period in her life.

It's much too early in the year to talk about crop tops, in the UK anyway!

Look at that stomach! Apart from the perfect fit, the standout red on Kim is a great colour, and the maxi length of the skirt makes her look taller than her five foot two inches.

"David Cameron insists his promised EU referendum could not be brought forward because he needed time to 'renegotiate a better deal for Britain' Britain will not get a say on leaving the European Union until 2017, after Downing Street rejected claims a referendum could be held next year. Number 10 made clear there are 'absolutely no plans' to hold the referendum in 2016, after a minister was quoted as saying a vote next year was the 'preferred route'. Prime Minister David Cameron told MailOnline the vote could not be brought forward because he needed time to 'renegotiate a better deal for Britain'. However, Scottish and Welsh nationalists are demanding a veto on Britain leaving the EU, insisting every nation in the UK require a majority in favour of exit. The Tories have promised that if they are returned to power, they will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. But with the Lib Dems opposed to the timetable, and a hung parliament a likely outcome of the election, there are doubts about whether the referendum will happen. In an interview with MailOnline last week, Mr Cameron banged the table and insisted the vote would happen if he remains prime minister: 'Yes. By the end of 2017. Yes. Yes. Yes.' But there have been calls for him to bring the vote forward, to end uncertainty and give the people a say on the EU as soon as possible. Asked why the referendum cannot happen sooner, Mr Cameron replied: 'Because I want to renegotiate a better deal for Britain, I think people would rather have a choice between staying in a reformed Europe or getting out rather than I think the false choice of today which is stay in Europe we are not satisfied with or leave.' Today the Sunday Times reported that how holding the vote in 2016 was under consideration in Number 10. A source told the paper: 'A referendum in 2016 is very actively on the table. You would do a quick renegotiation, make a big statement at conference and get it done next year.' However, the idea has been rejected by senior Downing Street figures who insist up to two years will be needed to secure a successful renegotiation with the other EU countries. A No 10 source said: 'The Prime Minister has made a clear commitment to hold an in-out referendum on Europe by the end of 2017 - and the Conservatives are the only party that can and will deliver a referendum for the British people. 'But there are an absolutely no plans to hold the referendum in 2016.' Mr Cameron has promised that if he is still Prime Minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Under the plan, the decision on whether to stay in the EU would be decided on a straight majority of all the people in the UK. Chancellor George Osborne today played down the idea of an earlier vote, and rejected the idea that offering a referendum has increased instability. But Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon has demanded that an outright majority in Scotland should be required. The idea was backed today by Leanne Wood, leader of Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru. He told Sky News' Murnaghan: 'My position is that the votes in each of the countries should be added up separately and we should only pull out of the EU if all four countries want to do that. 'We have had a lot of talk during the Scottish referendum about the UK being a family of nations. This is such a big decision that all members of the family need to be involved in taking that decision.' Mr Cameron used a major speech in November to set out key demands on banning EU nationals from claiming in-work benefits or social housing in Britain for four years, deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has been ordered to tour every European capital city before the election to build support for the Tory renegotiation. Chancellor George Osborne played down the idea of an earlier vote. 'We would be delighted if we could conclude those negotiations sooner but we have set the end of 2017 as the deadline,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr. 'The essential issue here, and again it's something which is at stake in this general election, is do we want to change our relationship with Europe, do we want a Europe including a Britain that is job creating, that is opportunity creating. 'Do we want to make sure that non-Euro members like Britain have a fair relationship with the Eurozone, and do we want to make sure that the British people have a choice in a referendum. 'And you only get that from David Cameron and from the Conservatives in this election.' He rejected the idea that offering a referendum has increased instability. 'We've received a huge amount of investment form around the world since we set out our policy. 'Actually business and investors are the first people who say we want a more competitive European Union and a more competitive Britain within that European Union.'","Number 10 made clear there are 'absolutely no plans' to hold vote in 2016 .

"Solicitor-general Robert Buckand is claimed to have been a member of the Invicta Film Partnership No 25 for nearly a decade . A Tory MP has denied attempting to avoid tax after being named as an investor in a film partnership scheme under investigation by the tax man. Solicitor-general Robert Buckand is claimed to have been a member of the Invicta Film Partnership No 25 for nearly a decade. The scheme is thought to be under investigation by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) into whether it is a legitimate business or whether it was primarily set up as a way for investors to avoid paying tax. It follows a court ruling against two other film partnership schemes in 2011 that found they were primarily used for tax avoidance. Mr Buckland’s involvement in the scheme is potentially hugely embarrassing for David Cameron who has pledged to tackle tax avoidance. The revelation comes just days after Mr Cameron faced questions in the Commons about Smythson, the upmarket leather goods firm employing his wife, being based in a tax haven. Mr Buckland  insisted that the companies he invested in were beyond reproach. In a statement, the Conservative MP for South Swindon, said: ‘I have not attempted to avoid tax, and my investments are a matter of public record. ‘Before making them I asked an independent, accredited financial adviser to look into the companies, who found them to be completely beyond reproach. ‘HMRC look into many different types of investments, but I have been assured that there is no active investigation into my tax affairs. ‘I pay my taxes as required each year, and I have been fully open with government officials and declared my interests in line with usual reporting processes.’ The office of the Attorney General would not comment on whether Mr Buckland had provided legal advice on tax avoidance issues. The Sunday Times reported Mr Buckland had joined the Invicta Film Partnership No 25 scheme in 2005, but a memo sent to members last year showed it was now ‘the subject of an open HMRC inquiry’. HMRC has declined to comment on the case. The partnership is a sale and leaseback scheme where the rights to a film are bought and then leased back to its producers. Film partnership schemes were intended to boost the UK film industry by offering tax breaks for investors of low budget films. But tax tribunal ruled in 2011 that investors in two film partnership schemes were not entitled to claim the tax relief as they were primarily being used for tax avoidance rather than for business purposes. Most tax inquiries involving such schemes are currently at a standstill as the ruling is subject to appeal. Chancellor George Osborne has branded ‘aggressive tax avoidance’ as 'morally repugnant’ Following a number of high-profile cases involving celebrities, the Coalition government pledged to crack down on tax avoidance – which is legal. Chancellor George Osborne deemed ‘aggressive tax avoidance’ to be ‘morally repugnant’. On Saturday, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘There is nothing pro-business about defending tax avoidance.’ He added: ‘I am not going to back down. The time has finally come to put an end to a society in which one group of people can play by different rules to the rest.’ Last year after Mr Buckland, a barrister, was appointed solicitor-general, it emerged that he had been found to have breached the legal profession's code of conduct in 2011. A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said at the time: ‘It is a matter of public record that in May 2011, Robert Buckland was found to have committed a minor breach of the Code of Conduct of the Bar of England and Wales. ‘He was not suspended or fined and continued to practice and sit as a recorder. ‘This finding was removed from the Bar records after two years and therefore Mr Buckland was not required to declare it upon appointment as solicitor general.’ Last week it emerged that Samantha Cameron’s employer Smythson is owned through a holding company in Luxembourg and linked to a secretive trust in the Channel Island of Guernsey, another well-known tax haven. The leather goods and luxury stationery firm, which has a store on New Bond Street that sells £2,000 python skin handbags, has employed Mrs Cameron as a creative consultant since 2010 on a salary thought to be up to £100,000 a year.","Robert Buckland QC insists his investments are beyond reproach .

"Winter-weary New England was hit by another bout of snow on Saturday - and that's just the start of it. Schools will be closed across Boston on Monday and Tuesday as the city prepares to shoulder another foot of snow. Meteorologists warned Providence, Rhode Island, and Hartford, Connecticut, should also to expect a winter storm before the early morning hours of Tuesday. Forecasters are calling the latest snowfall a 'long duration' storm, which is expected to become more intense later on Sunday. A parking ban was issued across Boston at 4pm on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Alex Ranere, of Boston, uses a shovel to remove snow from his car on Sunday in Boston. Winter weary New England is being hit with a protracted snowstorm that started Saturday night and could last until early Tuesday morning. Just getting started: A long duration winter storm was forecast to begin Saturday night and remain in effect for a large swath of southern New England until the early morning hours Tuesday . By Monday night, 12 to 18 inches of fresh snow could be on the ground in parts of the region, which is still coping with the aftereffects of storms that hit over the last couple of weeks and dumped record-high snowfall totals in some places. Michelle Currie, a mother of five whose kids have already missed several days of school, posted on her Facebook page a photo of a weather map showing up to 18 inches of snow could fall on her home in Dracut, less than an hour's drive north of Boston. 'I have to laugh because otherwise I may cry,' she said. The snow is likely to cause problems for commuters on Monday, though it's not expected to accumulate as rapidly as in some of the earlier storms, including a record-busting late January blizzard. There also is little risk seen of significant coastal flooding, a problem during last month's winter blasts. Boston's transit system, the nation's oldest, has been particularly hard hit. The buildup of snow and ice on trolley tracks combined with aging equipment has stalled trains in recent days, delaying and angering commuters. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority general manager Beverly Scott said Saturday that crews were doing everything they could, including deploying massive jet-powered snow blowers, to clear tracks before the next storm. Gov. Charlie Baker acknowledged on Friday that the MBTA was handed an extraordinary situation with old equipment but said the system's overall performance was unacceptable. What forecasters are calling a 'long duration' storm is expected to become more intense on Sunday . In many New England communities, the obvious problem is where to put the next batch of snow. In Revere, just outside Boston, schoolteacher Ingrid Samuel said there were 'mountains of snow' and the streets 'can't take another hit of snow on top of what's here.' 'There's a bunch of snow everywhere, and there's no more place to put it,' said Samuel, who lost a week of work after the last snowstorm canceled classes. 'There are no sidewalks left in Revere. My whole yard is covered with snow. Where will it end?' David Lombari, public works director for West Warwick, Rhode Island, told the Providence Journal his town was already clogged with snow piles several feet high and school buses were parked in the usual snow storage lot. 'I don't know what we're going to do yet,' Lombari said. 'It's tough trying to find a place that meets all the proper (environmental) criteria.' State snow disposal guidelines require that communities use locations that won't harm environmental resources and have barriers that prevent contaminants from seeping into groundwater when the snow melts. Adding injury to insult perhaps, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency warned that potentially record cold temperatures and wind chills are expected to move into the region later in the week after the storm.","Snow storm warning issued for Boston, Hartford and Rhode Island .

"Sir Cliff Richard, who has added an extra date to his forthcoming tour despite an allegation for child sex abuse . Sir Cliff Richard is said to be so confident that child sex abuse allegations against him will be dropped that he has extended his forthcoming sell-out tour, it has been reported. Detectives swooped on the 74-year-old's £3.1million apartment in Berkshire in August amid accusations he sexually assaulted a schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago. Police launched a probe after receiving a report that a teenager under the age of 16 was attacked in Sheffield at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham in 1985. The singer has strongly denied the allegation and South Yorkshire Police have not pressed any charges. But despite the allegation, Sir Cliff has added an extra date at the Royal Albert Hall for his 75th birthday tour in October, with concerts in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield sold out. And although neither the singer or his management have recently commented on the six-month police enquiry, a source told the Sunday Mirror, they are confident the allegation will be dropped in time for the beginning of the tour in September. They told the newspaper: 'He is impatient to put this behind him and get on with his life. He knows he is innocent and just cannot understand why it is taking so long for the police to clear his name. 'These events have to be organised up to a year in advance and were already being planned before the enquiries began. 'Cliff has always vehemently protested his innocence. He is hoping all this will be behind him before these concerts begin.' Sir Cliff has issued two statements since the allegation first sufaced to deny any wrongdoing and to thank his fans for support. In a statement published on Facebook last September, he said: 'Hi everyone, this is just a brief message to thank all of you who have shown support, including those in the Press. Sir Cliff was in Portugal when his Berkshire mansion was searched and the singer has always strongly denied any wrongdoing . 'I wanted to let you know that I'm doing ok and it goes without saying that I fully intend to clear my name. 'Just to be absolutely clear, the allegation is completely false and I will continue to cooperate with the police should they wish to speak to me again. 'Once again...many thanks!' It is the second statement he has made in relation to the investigation having first denied the accusations on Facebook on August 14 . Then, he wrote: 'For many months I have been aware of allegations against me of historic impropriety which have been circulating online. The allegations are completely false. 'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen. The £3.1million complex in Berkshire, which South Yorkshire Police raided in August amid accusations Sir Cliff sexually assaulted a schoolboy at a Christian rally almost three decades ago . 'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press. 'I am not presently in the UK but it goes without saying that I will cooperate fully should the police wish to speak to me. 'Beyond stating that today's allegation is completely false it would not be appropriate to say.' Detectives swooped on the apartment while Sir Cliff was on holiday in the Algarve, Portugal. Officers spent five hours inside the property searching for evidence. Previously one of the country's most senior police officers was accused of 'sheer incompetence' over his handling of the raid, which was aired live on the BBC. The corporation and South Yorkshire police clashed in Parliament over how TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of the search last month. The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton said the BBC put his force in 'a very difficult position' after officers were confronted with the leak . The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police David Crompton said the BBC put his force in 'a very difficult position' after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search in connection with allegations of a historic sexual assault. Mr Crompton told MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that his force was convinced that the broadcaster would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal. Committee MP Julian Huppert said it was a 'rather remarkable blackmail attempt'. But the BBC flatly rejected the accusation and claimed they would have pulled the story if the police had asked.

"Hardline Muslims protesting against the depiction of the Prophet Mohammed in cartoons swarmed around a statue of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery yesterday. The show of disrespect to one of Britain’s greatest heroes in the war against Nazi suppression of freedom came as more than 1,000 Muslims demonstrated in London against ‘offensive’ caricatures of the prophet. A boy aged no more than ten was among those carrying placards saying Insult My Mum And I Will Punch You – quoting Pope Francis in the wake of the Paris attacks. Scroll down for video . No respect: Protesters wave placards and take photos from Field Marshal Montgomery's statue . Thousands of British Muslims gathered outside Downing Street today to protest against Charlie Hebdo's publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed . A petition signed by 100,000 British Muslims was handed to No 10 after a rally was held on Whitehall . Men and women were kept separate during the protest 'out of respect', organisers said . Muslims scaled the statue of Viscount Alanbrooke, a Second World War Army commander, during the protest in central London . The Pope had said people ‘cannot insult the faith of others’ and that he would punch someone if they offended his mother as he debated freedom of speech following the murders of the Charlie Hebdo magazine cartoonists. Yesterday organisers refused to allow men and women to protest together, insisting they were segregated. Despite the rally passing off peacefully with no arrests, the banners carried a thinly veiled threat of violence towards those who continued to exercise free speech. Leaders of the protest also sparked anger by claiming the ‘extremist’ cartoonists massacred in Paris for depicting the Prophet Mohammed were as bad as the jihadis who gunned them down in cold blood. A young boy was among those carrying placards saying Insult My Mum And I Will Punch You – quoting the Pope in the wake of the Paris attacks . In a gathering outside Downing Street, the hardline Muslim Action Forum berated ‘uncivilised expressionists’ who drew satirical images of the prophet for ‘sowing the seeds of hatred’ – effectively blaming the victims for their own murders. Muslims gathered outside the gates to No 10 to protest against ‘offensive’ caricatures in Charlie Hebdo and other Western publications. Protesters gathered yards from the Cenotaph which commemorates those who gave their lives in wartime for freedom. Children were among the crowd which waved placards emblazoned with the words Charlie And The Abuse Factory, and Learn Some Manners. The rally, which blocked off half of Whitehall, was staged a month after two AK-47-wielding terrorists attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices, killing 12 and wounding 11 in revenge for printing cartoons of the prophet – deemed blasphemous in the Muslim world. But speakers at the protest provoked anger by appearing to equate in seriousness the drawing of the cartoons with the murders that followed. Shaykh Tauqir Ishaq, a Muslim Action Forum spokesman, said: ‘Perpetual mistakes by extremists, either by cold-blooded killers or uncivilised expressionists, cannot be the way forward for a civilised society. ‘The peace-loving majority of people must become vociferous in promoting global civility and responsible debate. At this time of heightened tension and emotion, it is crucial that both sides show restraint to prevent further incidents of this nature occurring.’ The crowd of protesters shouted slogans and waved placards with the words 'Charlie and the abuse factory' and 'learn some manners' Organisers the Muslim Action Forum handed a petition signed by 100,000 people to 10 Downing Street . Muslim protesters knell for communal prayers on Whitehall this afternoon during the demonstration . Thousands descended on Westminster for the protest, where Muslim speakers addressed the crowds . Davis Lewin, deputy director of the Henry Jackson Society security think-tank, said: ‘These comments are shameful. Let me be crystal clear: discussion of the content of such cartoons is absolutely irrelevant in the context of the radical Islamist executioners that carried out the Paris attack. ‘In Europe, you do not get to object to any kind of material, however distasteful to your beliefs, in that manner. We must reject categorically the false equivalence his risible comments assert.’ Although peaceful, the protests echoed those staged in Britain a decade ago after a Danish newspaper published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. More than 300 protesters marched to the Danish Embassy in central London. On that occasion, the crowd threatened murder and glorified the July 7 bombings in London which killed 52 innocent people. A leaflet issued by the Muslim Action Forum yesterday claimed recent republishing of cartoons of Mohammed were a ‘stark reminder’ that freedom of speech was routinely abused to ‘insult personalities that others consider sacred’. Muslims gathered for prayers and to hear speeches during the rally against Charlie Hebdo, which was attacked by terrorists last month, killing 12 . A number of speakers addressed the throngs of Muslims, with organisers saying the cartoons are 'an affront to the norms of civilised society' The crowd of protesters shouted slogans and waved placards with the words 'Charlie and the abuse factory' and 'learn some manners' The rally was organised by the Muslim Action Forum, which expressed 'deep regret' at the Paris terror attacks . Stand-off: A Muslim protester is directed away from a nationalist counter-demonstration by far-right group Britain First . Clash: A nationalist demonstrator points his finger at one of the Muslim protesters earlier this afternoon . It said: ‘Such actions are deliberating insulting and provoking to Muslims worldwide. ‘In an already fragile world we need to move from actions of incitement, hatred and provocation to civility, consideration and respect.’ The group did express ‘deep regret’ at the Paris terror attacks, insisting the massacre was a ‘violation of Islamic law’. But a number of speakers who addressed the throng of Muslims claimed the drawings were ‘an affront to the norms of civilised society’ – an accusation that drew fury from critics who pointed out that they had not denounced the beheading, crucifixions and rapes in Iraq and Syria. A delegation took a petition signed by more than 100,000 British Muslims to 10 Downing Street. Last night it remained unclear who is behind the Muslim Action Forum, founded in 2012, which issued the call to gather in Downing Street. According to their website, they want to ‘promote peaceful demonstration’ in ‘defending the honour’ of the Prophet.","Vast crowd of British Muslims gather for Charlie Hebdo protest in London .

"Most beauty pageant entrants say they want to see world peace. And the current Miss Universe now has the opportunity to help stop fighting in her home country of Columbia after being invited to peace talks by Marxist FARC rebels. Newly-crowned Miss Universe, 22-year-old Paulina Vega, has been asked to peace negotiations between the FARC and the Columbian government, in a bid to end 50 years of fighting. Newly crowned Miss Universe Paulina Vega, who has been invited to take part in peace talks between FARC rebels and the Columbian government . Miss Vega, a 22-year-old business student from northern Columbia had previously said in interviews she would be willing to travel to the talks . The business student from Barranquilla in the north of the country had previously said in interviews that she would be willing to travel to the talks. And in a statement posted on their website, the FARC confirmed they had asked her along to negotiations, taking place in Cuba. The statement said: 'We have read with interest your desire to contribute with your good work to reaching peace. 'We salute your willingness to travel to Havana, at this time we invite you to make a visit.' In a statement posted on their website, the FARC confirmed they had asked her along to negotiations after reading about her desire to promote peace . The FARC did not say how Miss Vega's input would help advance the peace talks and it is unclear whether she will take up their invitation. Miss Vega, a relative pageant newcomer, was crowned Miss Universe last month, beating contestants from more than 80 other countries at the event in Miami. She said she would wear the crown with 'pride and excitement' as she heard the news that fans in Colombia had taken to the streets to celebrate. But her victory wasn't without controversy as instead of the usual cheering, the audience erupted into boos of disapproval as favourite-to-win Miss Jamaica Kaci Fennell only made it to fifth place. Shortly after Miss Fennell, 22, left the stage in the 63rd annual contest, her name began trending on Twitter along with the hashtag #MissJamaicaShouldHaveWon. FARC negotiator Joaquin Gomez, centre, speaks to the media while flanked by fellow FARC members in Havana. The FARC has waged an anti-government guerrilla war for the past 50 years in Columbia . Unlike Miss Vega, who looks every inch the beauty queen, Miss Fennell gained a large following due to her striking beauty, confidence intelligence and unconventional style - wearing her hair in a Halle Berry-esque pixie cut instead of the traditional long pageant waves. Fans claim Miss Fennell was denied the title after she proudly called Usain Bolt, the world's fastest short-distance runner, and reggae-king Bob Marley her country's greatest contributions to the world. Meanwhile, the FARC has waged an anti-government guerrilla war for the past 50 years over land reform, an end to the illegal drugs trade and political participation for ex-guerrillas. News of the peace talks come as Colombia's second-largest rebel group said on Wednesday it's willing to lay down its weapons if government-brokered peace talks open political space for leftist groups. The National Liberation Army made the announcement by releasing a video in which the group's top commander, Nicolas Rodriguez, addresses guerilla fighters gathered in the jungle for a clandestine congress. Commander of the FARC guerillas Rodrigo Granda attends peace talks in Havana. The group has some 8,000 fighters . Founded 50 years ago by Rodriguez and a group of leftist Roman Catholic priests and activists inspired by Cuba's revolution, the ELN has about 2,000 fighters, compared to some 8,000 for the FARC. The group, considered a foreign terrorist organisation by the United States, has a long history of kidnapping foreigners for ransom, of extorting businesses and of sabotaging Colombia's main oil pipeline. The apparent engagement with the ELN comes as Santos tries to close in on a deal with the FARC, holding out this week the possibility of a bilateral ceasefire to reflect what he considers the group's demonstrated commitment to reduce hostilities.","Miss Universe Paulina Vega has been invited to peace talks by FARC rebels .

"It could become the US Army's new 'superchopper' - able to transport troops, carry heavy goods and be fitted out as a flying gunship. This futuristic helicopter from Texas firm AVX is the frontrunner to win a $100bn contract from the Pentagon for the next generation of attack helicopter. It uses two rotors to create lift, while fans propel it forward to reach 230 knots. Scroll down for video . The AVX chopper entry is what¿s called a compound coaxial helicopter. It has a pair of rotors spinning in opposite directions on top of the carbon-fiber fuselage to lift it, and two fans at its rear end to push it. The AVX design is made up of . counter rotating rotors on top and twin ducted-fans in the rear of the . aircraft, which eliminates the necessity for a tail rotor.

'The AVX design offers the capabilities the Army wants for the future fleet of utility and attack aircraft at a very attractive price,' the firm, also called AVX, says. 'The AVX JMR aircraft has entry doors on both sides of the fuselage as well as a large rear ramp for easy cargo handling. 'Additionally it has retractable landing gear and the attack variant (see below) carries all armaments stored inside until needed which provides a “clean” aerodynamic design. AVX has teamed with a number of experienced aerospace companies for development of the AVX JMR/FVL design. 'The teaming concept has allowed AVX to keep the cost of development and eventual production of the aircraft lower than those of other offerings while maintaining a high level of performance by the aircraft.' The firm is among four vying for a $100bn contract for the Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator, and the firms are expected to begin a 'flyoff' contest in 2017. The AVX chopper will come in several configurations, carrying cargo, troops and the injured . The design will replace the Black Hawk, shown here .

"Film makers have been banned from shooting action scenes in Paris in the wake of the terrorist shootings which left 20 people dead. It means that the kind of classic segments which have thrilled generations of movie lovers cannot be repeated. Announcing the measure, police commander Sylvie Barnaud said: ‘There’s a problem with these action scenes, as the actors in uniform could be targets for terrorism. Scroll down for video . Filmed in France: The 2008 thriller Taken, starring Liam Neeson (above) as a CIA operative, also features numerous gun fights, explosions and car chases through Paris streets, and at a city airport .

Commander Barnaud said the indefinite restrictions were hugely important in a city where thousands of armed police wearing bullet proof vests are still on the street. This follows the January attack on the officers of the anti-Islamic satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people died.

A policewoman was shot dead the next morning, and then there were four more fatalities in a Kosher store before three Al Qaeda and Islamic State-linked terrorists were themselves gunned down. Commander Barnaud said: ‘I was shocked to hear witnesses of the Charlie Hebdo attacks say on television that “it seemed like a movie shoot to us”’.’ Paris is one of the most popular film locations in the world, with producers using its ancient squares and boulevards constantly. Last year alone there were 930 shoots in the capital, 20 of which were by international teams, including ones from Hollywood.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has promised 'good government starts today,' after surviving an attempt to spill the Liberal leadership that he called 'a very chastening experience.' But Mr Abbott's future as prime minister remains in doubt after 39 of his own MPs voted for the spill in the secret party room ballot. A majority of the Liberal backbench is thought to have voted against the prime minister, with the vote count totalling 61 votes to 39. The vote count is considered so dire for Mr Abbott because there was no direct challenger for his leadership. In a recorded statement released following the vote, Mr Abbott said: 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us.' 'We are absolutely determined to work for you, the people.' Scroll down for video . Relieved: Mr Abbott enjoys a moment of peace during a press conference this afternoon. He survived a leadership motion, telling reporters: 'Good government starts today' While Mr Abbott expressed contrition about his performance in recent weeks, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today revelled in the prime minister's misfortune, questioning whether he had the mandate to remain leader . Isolation: Prime Minister Tony Abbott, pictured in Parliament, was deserted by 39 of his colleagues who voted against the spill . Leadership murmurs: Mr Abbott was not opposed by any of his colleagues, including Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The pair are pictured sharing a moment on the floor of Parliament today . Discussion: Mr Abbott is now formulating plans on how his team can claw back support in the polls . Survivor: Mr Abbott has survived the threat to his leadership, but 39 of his own MPs voted against his leadership . The victor: Prime Minister Tony Abbott walks from the party room after a majority of his backbench voted against his leadership . Mr Abbott is due to give his first statement to the media following the vote shortly . At a press conference later, Mr Abbott conceded the government had been having a difficult time recently, citing the Queensland election result that delivered a massive swing against the Liberals. 'Who wouldn't be nervous after watching the result in Queensland,' he said. 'So all of us are determined to lift our game and the fundamental point I make is that the solution to all of these things is good government. 'And good government starts today.' Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting on Monday morning flanked by a large throng of supporters. Malcolm Turnbull - his potential  leadership rival - was not one of them, sidling into the meeting on his own. Mr Turnbull has remained coy about his position and has not publicly challenged the leader. Today's vote was instigated by rebellious backbenchers, who revolted following his controversial decision to knight Prince Philip and the disastrous defeat of Campbell Newman's Liberal National government in Queensland two weeks ago. Mr Abbott faced more grim news this morning, with a Newspoll commissioned by the Australian newspaper finding that more than 68 per cent of voters are dissatisfied with his performance. Worse, the Newspoll figures revealed Mr Turnbull was by far the preferred Liberal Party leader, with 64 per cent voting in support of him compared to just 25 per cent backing Mr Abbott. On a two-party preferred basis, Labor led the Coalition by 14 points, 57 points to 43. The poor approval ratings are the most bleak ranking for a Prime Minister in more than 20 years, comparable only to Paul Keating in 1994. Mr Abbott began today with a visit to a Canberra church. It was a traditional service held at the beginning of each parliamentary sitting year. He told reporters afterwards that the government would 'get on with being the government we were elected to be' following the vote. Contrast: Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting accompanied by his deputy leader, Julie Bishop and a huge column of supporters . On his own: Malcolm Turnbull arrived to today's party room meeting without any supporters in tow . Cheeky stunt: Labor bigwigs Bill Shorten (centre), Tanya Plibersek and Penny Wong swept by the assembled media after buying coffees . Time to pray: Mr Abbott appeared with his wife, Margie, at a traditional church service prior to the beginning of the year's first sitting week of Parliament . After grim polling this morning, Mr Abbott is facing one of the most critical tests of his leadership in the form of a spill motion this morning . Tony Abbott and his family spent time in Sydney's China Town on Sunday afternoon after he had announced the spill motion would take place in Canberra on Monday . Tony Abbott claims he has moved the spill motion forward because, 'the last thing Australia needs right now is instability'. However, others believe he made the decision to avoid an awkward question time on Monday . Senior Liberal figure Arthur Sinodinos has said he is very disappointed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to move the spill motion forward to Monday, and revealed he will vote in favour of a spill . The most influential person to come out in favour of the spill motion was Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos, the former chief of staff to Prime Minister John Howard. 'I believe it will help precipitate a discussion', Senator Sinodinos told Fairfax Media on Sunday. He said he was 'very disappointed' with the Prime Minister's decision to move the spill forward from Tuesday to Monday. He said: 'MPs should be given time to discuss the matter at hand. Tuesday is the time to do that.' Treasurer Joe Hockey has said any Cabinet minister who supports the Liberal leadership spill motion should resign. Mr Hockey said he expected all cabinet members to reject the spill motion, but if they supported it they should declare their hand now. 'If I disagreed with the prime minister and if I believed he wasn't the best person to lead the team I would step down from the cabinet - that is the appropriate thing to do,' he told Sky News on Sunday. He said he trusted his Cabinet colleagues Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop. 'If you are going to be disloyal to someone, you should front them,' Mr Hockey said. He expected the motion would be voted down, but not unanimously. 'There will always be a third of the party room that are upset about one thing or another,' he said. The treasurer rejected media reports that he could lose his job in a compromise to head off the leadership spill. 'I think everyone should do the jobs they have and properly serve the Australian people, not engage in commentary on gossip.' Mr Hockey stood by the government's controversial decisions to overhaul Medicare, higher education, pensions and welfare, which have contributed to the leadership unrest. 'We have no choice,' he said of the budget changes. Queensland MP Wyatt Roy, 24, has also declared that he will vote in favour of the motion to spill the leadership of the government. Wyatt (left) is pictured with Abbott in 2010 . Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull welcomed Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to Sydney on Sunday . Mr Turnbull has only voiced his opposition to Mr Abbott moving the vote forward, labelling it a 'captain's call' - what the prime minister has dubbed some of his less popular decisions, including knighting Prince Philip. Mr Turnbull said anyone was in a position to contest the leadership without being disloyal. 'If, for whatever reason, the leadership of a political party is vacant then any member of the party can stand, whether they be a minister or a backbencher, without any disloyalty to the person whose leadership has been declared vacant,' he said outside his home on Sunday. On Sunday Mr Abbott said he wanted to deal with the spill line 'as quickly as possible' so the Liberal party can put the matter behind them. 'The only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the Labor party in dragging down a first term prime minister,' he said. 'Now obviously I've been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do - to clean up Labor's mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve.' Turnbull has refused to deny he will challenge the Prime Minister for leadership of the Liberal party, and said if anyone stands for a vacant position that does not mean they are disrespecting the person whose leadership has been declared vacant . Malcolm Turnbull refused to say if he will run for the leadership but maintains he supports Mr Abbott in line with cabinet solidarity . As Prime Minister Tony Abbott battles to secure the backing of his own party members amidst next week's leadership spill motion, a new Galaxy poll has revealed that 55 per cent of voters  want him to stand down . As reports that  Malcolm Turnbull will contest the leadership continue to circulate, the poll showed he would improve the Liberal's chance of winning at the next election if he were made Prime Minister . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is also preferred as leader when measured up against Mr Abbott, but still not as much as a Labor government according to the 53:47 two-party preferred vote focused on her taking the top spot . There may be some hope yet for Mr Abbott, as sources reveal Mr Turnbull would offer him his support  on Tuesday if he were to be promised the role of Treasurer, dumping Joe Hockey (pictured) from the position . The Communications Minister took to Twitter this week to deny he was in secret meetings with deputy leader Julie Bishop . He also revealed he believes the spill will fail and if so he will take that as an endorsement of his leadership . Ms Bishop said as Mr Abbott's deputy, she supported the prime minister .

"A shocking photograph of the bruised and battered face of the victim of a homophobic attack in Paris has gone viral after he shared it online. This photo was taken of Wilfred de Bruijn's cut and bloodied face shortly after he was kicked unconscious by unknown assailants in the city on Sunday, leaving him with five fractures in his head, deep cuts and a lost tooth. Posted on Facebook under the simple headline 'This is the true face of homophobia' the image has been shared nearly 8,000 times since. Mr de Bruin says the attack took place in the mainly Muslim 19th arrondissement of Paris as he was walking arm in arm with his boyfriend. Wilfred de Bruijn, a Dutch citizen who lives and works as a librarian in Paris, France, shows a photo of his face after he was beaten in a 'homophobic attack' Now he is using the picture to fuel a growing protest for equality, as a divisive reform bill to . allow same-sex marriage in France drives a spate of homophobic attacks. It . was brandished by gay groups during a demonstration of several thousand . people as they claimed that homophobic acts have tripled nationwide . over opposition to a law legalising gay marriage. De Bruijn, a Dutchman resident in Paris for a decade, told France Inter radio on Wednesday that he had 'no doubt' that an assault on him and his boyfriend, who was punched in the face as they walked together, was a homophobic attack. De Bruijn was beaten unconscious near his home early Sunday morning in central Paris, sustaining 5 fractures in his head and face, abrasions and a lost tooth . The 19th arrondissement of Paris has a large Muslim and North African immigrant population, who live adjacent to Orthodox jews, but it is not known who is behind the attack. The area was also the location of some of the worst scenes of unrest during the city’s riots in 2005. Gay rights issues have divided France in recent months as President Francois Hollande has pushed through a bill to legalise gay marriage despite angry street protests. The law, backed by two in three people in surveys, is set to pass without major hitches in a parliament where Hollande's Socialists have a majority. Yet a passionate debate, particularly on whether same-sex couples should have parenting rights, has triggered a surge in verbal and physical attacks on the gay community, according to records kept by the campaign group SOS Homophobie. The group has recorded more than 60 reports of homophobic attacks, two to three times higher than normal, in the past week as the bill makes its final passage through the Senate. 'It feels like the most violent time in our history,' said Michael Bouvard, vice-president of SOS Homophobie. The incident has shocked France, and garnered support far and wide as a gay 'cause celebre.' On Tuesday night, Interior Minister Manuel Valls called De Bruijn personally to express his shock. 'I certainly feel there's been an increase in homophobia,' said De Bruijn from his apartment in Paris' working class 19th district, where the attack took place. 'What (the anti-gay marriage campaign) are saying is that they're not homophobic: lesbians and gays are nice people, but don't let them get close to children - that's very dangerous. It's OK for them to live together, but not like other couples with the same protection because it's not really the same thing.' 'These people are all professionals of the spoken word. They know very well what can happen if you repeat, repeat, repeat that these people are lower human beings. Of course it will have a result.' In light of the attack - which has forced members of the anti-gay marriage campaign to defend themselves - 30 gay associations organized the anti-homophobia rally for Wednesday. Associations SOS Homophobia and Refuge have used De Bruijn's case to highlight the spike they've recorded in homophobia since the gay marriage bill was announced last year. De Bruijn, a Dutchman resident in Paris . for a decade said he had 'no . doubt' that an assault on him and his boyfriend, who was punched in the . face as they walked arm-in-arm, was a homophobic attack . Both associations report that homophobic acts - verbal and physical - in the first three months of 2013 have tripled compared with the same period in 2012. Meanwhile, Frigide Barjot, the stage name of an activist who has led protests against the bill, insisted the anti-gay marriage movement is opposed to violence. Speaking on RMC radio Wednesday, Barjot was careful to distance herself from a rightwing movement called the 'French Spring,' whose name was supposedly inspired by the revolutionary values of 2011's 'Arab Spring.' 'We don't want violence. We denounce this violence and these acts, we have nothing to do with (Catholic) fundamentalists or extremists,' she said. However, De Bruijn, said: 'It was not Frigide Barjot who was hitting my head, or the bishop of Avignon lurking in that street to attack us. 'But they are responsible.'","Image of Wilfred de Bruijn's face taken after he was kicked unconscious .

"Brian Williams has cancelled an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman 24 hours after announcing he would be temporarily stepping down from the NBC Nightly News. The embattled broadcaster was set to be interviewed on the chat show next Thursday, but sources at NBC News have told the Daily Mail Online he will not be appearing. On Saturday the veteran journalist announced Lester Holt would be taking over his role 'for several days' after he admitted lying about a story. During an appearance on Letterman in 2013 he gave a vivid account of how a helicopter he was travelling in was hit by an RPG while covering the Iraq conflict. Staying off air: Brian Williams has cancelled an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. He an appearance in 2013 he gave a false account of how a helicopter he was in was hit by an RPG in Iraq . Williams apologized on Wednesday and revealed he was actually in a trailing video. In a statement released on Saturday he said: 'I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue.' Since apologizing over his exaggerated claims on Wednesday, questions have been raised about several previous claims by Williams including that he saw a body in the Hurricane Katrina floodwaters that hit New Orleans in 2005. Now local residents in the sleepy New Jersey suburb of Red Bank are the latest to question his credibility over a story he told Esquire magazine in 2005 about being mugged at gunpoint during the 1970s. Williams recalls being left 'looking up at a thug's snub-nosed .38 while selling Christmas trees out of the back of a truck.' According to his story he was trying to help a local church when the thief grabbed his money. 'That wasn't a bad job, until a guy came up and stuck a .38-caliber pistol in my face and made me hand over all the money. Merry Christmas, right? Of course, I suddenly appreciated the other jobs I thought I hated,' Williams recalled when he told New Jersey Monthly in 2008. Scroll down for videos . HBO's Bill Maher joked that Brian Williams told such big lies that he could work at Fox News . But several longtime Red Bank residents aren't convinced by Williams' claims. 'I would highly doubt he's telling the truth,' Danny Murphy told the New York Post. 'I find it hard to believe anyone was held up in this area in the '70s. It was very safe,' said Murphy who owned a restaurant just a few blocks from where Williams claims he was accosted. The Post spoke to several residents who recall the area being so safe at the time that kids could walk around alone at night on their own. 'It was never dangerous here,' said Yolanda DeMaria, 93. 'It was a very peaceful town, a lovely town. It was a small town with a dress shop and a five-and-dime. No one locked their cars.' Another local resident also found Williams' claims difficult to take seriously. 'Don't listen to Brian Williams,' said Les Carbone, 85. 'He's going to tell you a lot of things. I doubt he was robbed at gunpoint. I was born in Red Bank, there were no crimes like that. Tell Brian Williams to stop lying.' Conan O'Brien also poked fun at Williams in a parody video where the news anchor takes credit for just about everything . Williams' troubles started on 30 January when the Nightly News ran a tribute to a retired soldier he had first met in Iraq in 2003. In his report Williams repeated his claim that his aircraft was hit by enemy fire and then the complaints started to flood in . With Williams’ credibility being called into question over his wild claims about his time in Iraq, NBC News announced on Friday that an internal investigation is being carried out. Also on Friday, Williams found himself the butt of a joke by Bill Maher, who suggested that the news anchor told such big lies that he could work at Fox News. 'When we get older… we misplace our keys, we have trouble with people’s names, we can’t remember if the helicopter we were in crashed,' quipped the late night host during his HBO show. Williams made such a 'blatant departure from the truth, he got an offer from Fox News,' joked Maher. Conan O'Brien is another late night host getting mileage out of Williams. He joked that the NBC News presenter had tried to 'get in on someone's glory' more than once. O'Brien then showed manipulated video of Williams saying he was responsible for the Miracle on the Hudson plane landing and climbing a giant rock - like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 2.","Embattled broadcaster was due to appear on the talk show next Thursday .

"Earthquakes that rattled North Texas last month were concentrated along a fault line that runs through Irving into West Dallas, according to researchers. Initially, the locations for the series of earthquakes were mapped centered on the former Dallas Cowboys stadium. However, they have been found to run in a two-mile line north-by-northeast from Texas Highway 114 to Walnut Hill Road along the Trinity River. The subsurface fault, which is ancient and has been reactivated, was narrowed down by researchers from Southern Methodist University (SMU) after they surveyed data from earthquake monitoring devices. Scroll down for video . The two-mile subsurface fault line runs north-by-northeast from Texas Highway 114 to Walnut Hill Road along the Trinity River (above a map of the epicenters of earthquakes from January 6 to January 23) Southern Methodist University seismologist Brian Stump (above) said that now that the the location and depth of fault has been identified, they can study how it moves . There were a reported 26 felt earthquakes in January by the National Earthquake Information Center. The earthquakes were relatively shallow and concentrated along a narrow two mile line extending from Irving into West Dallas, the preliminary findings revealed. The fault line was discovered after SMU researchers reviewed data from 20 portable earthquake monitors they installed near the earthquake sites. Seismologists said earthquakes have been felt in North Texas because of their location near the surface in the granite basement, according to WFAA. The largest earthquake to date measured 3.6 in magnitude and there have been five earthquakes measuring over a magnitude of 3. Earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 are generally the smallest people can feel. From April 17, 2014 when the earthquake sequence began in Irving and Dallas to January 23, there have been 46 reported earthquakes. The U.S. Geological Service plotted the epicenters of the first four of nine earthquakes (above) that occurred last month to northeast Irving, a Dallas suburb in North Texas . The January series of earthquakes were mapped as being centered on the former Dallas Cowboys stadium (above) prior to enhanced data which revealed they run in a narrow line extending from Irving into West Dallas . Some of the earthquakes were located near two wells drilled for shale gas, as well as a wastewater injection well. The scientists have not drawn any conclusions from the location of the wells and the earthquakes. As scientists continue to investigate the cause of the earthquakes that occurred on January 6, which were described as 'the largest' since they started happening last April, it is the first step forward. SMU seismologist Brian Stump, said: 'This is a first step, but an important one, in investigating the cause of the earthquakes. 'Now that we know the fault's location and depth, we can begin studying how this fault moves – both the amount and direction of motion.' His colleague Heather DeShon added: 'Then we can move on to what might have triggered it – examining factors both natural and man-made. 'Sometimes what triggers an earthquake can be very small, so all of these factors have to be considered when looking for that trigger.' Some of the earthquakes were located near two wells (above) drilled for shale gas, as well as a wastewater injection well . From April 17, 2014 when the earthquake sequence began to January 23, there have been 46 reported earthquakes (above the earthquakes mapped during that time frame) The mapping of the earthquakes from last month by seismologists will allow for city officials, if the fault remains actives, to know which areas of Dallas and Irving might experience the worst shaking - as there is no prediction for how long the series will last. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings has said he is looking at the city's building codes and a separate discussion will take place on whether they need to be changed or not, according to CBSDFW. SMU plans to continue locating both felt and smaller earthquakes in the area, which will help to refine the geometry of the fault. The Irving area, with a population topping 250,000, has had more than 25 minor earthquakes since early September, according to Stump. About 40 miles west of Irving, a series of small earthquakes rattled the town of Azle a year ago, causing sinkholes and cracks in house foundations. Residents blamed fracking and injection disposal wells for drilling waste as the cause but an official finding is still pending.","Researchers from Southern Methodist University said earthquakes run along fault line from TX Highway 114 to Walnut Hill along Trinity River .

"Women in society are judged by their looks while men are judged by what they say, according to TV presenter Claire Balding. The broadcaster said that this is having a ‘pervasively negative’ effect on society as a whole. Ms Balding told The Daily Telegraph: ‘We look at women and we judge, whereas we listen to men and we judge. Their voice as in what they say is stronger than their look. Clare Balding has spoken out about how women are treated in society. She says that they are judged on their looks, not on what they have to say . ‘That’s in every walk of life, not just the media. And it has a pervasively negative effect seeping through everything.’ The 42-year-old also discussed how women are treated in television, adding that older women are often personally criticised for their look or how they dress. A recent study found that out of 481 presenters on BBC, Sky, ITN and Channel  5 only 26 were women over 50. Clare Balding was widely praised for her informative and enthusiastic presenting at London 2012, pictured alongside Mark Foster, left, and Ian Thorpe, centre . Clare Balding (right) and her partner Alice Arnold (left) have both spoken out about women in TV . She also used veteran television personalities John Humphries and Andrew Neil as men who are not judged by their looks because they know what they’re talking about. Ms Balding, who recently won a Bafta, also added that she has been criticised for how she looked, but that she tries not to let it affect her. She said: ‘I know that when I’m on TV, I’ll get a lot of comments about my personal appearance. It’s demoralising but it shouldn’t be destructive.’ Arlene Phillips was replaced on Strictly Come Dancing by younger Alesha Dixon . Ms Balding is the daughter of the Queen’s ex-horse trainer Ian Balding, and is civil partners with Alice Arnold, a Radio 4 newsreader who has also spoken out against age discrimination in TV. In 2011 former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly won a case for age discrimination. She was one of four presenters aged over 40 to be dropped from the show. The 63-year-old newsreader Moira Stewart was also dropped from her role, and Arlene Phillips, then 66, was famously fired from Strictly Come Dancing to be replaced by Alesha Dixon.","Said that women are judged on looks but men on what they have to say .

"The head of the Royal Air Force has launched a blistering attack on politicians for penny pinching and 'making it up as they go along'. Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford said military figures wanted 'answers now' but had to deal with civilian leaders who left everything till the last moment and were obsessed with cost. The comments, which are likely to spark anger in Westminster, came in a speech to a conference organised by the military think-tank the Royal United Services Institute. Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford said politicians lacked decisiveness and accused them of 'making it up as they go along' Sir Andrew, Chief of the Air Staff, told the event in London that the RAF's core function was to look after the airspace of British territory - but accused politicians of always wanting to do more with less cash. 'That balance between what the politicians might want me to do and how much they want me to pay for it, and how much time and effort and resource they wish me to invest in it. 'That has always been the way, that balance between politics and the military.' Sir Andrew went on: 'I am a military man, I want an answer now. The politician - ""if I could leave it a couple of days, could you wait till the end of next week, I really don't feel like making a decision just yet. I'll leave it right till the last moment, do I have to make a decision now?"" 'I want that decision now... I want to know exactly what you want me to do and I want the end state... Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is unlikely to react kindly to Sir Andrew's remarks . 'The politician, he's not really sure what the end state is, he doesn't really care, he's got to be seen to be doing something, ""we need to be there, I'll make that up as we go along."" That doesn't sit comfortably.' He said the military were only concerned with whether they had 'enough people and enough equipment to get the job done'. But he said, for the Government 'the big cruncher' was always 'how much is all this going to cost?' He added: 'I don't care about the cost. I need the resource, the people to get the job done, get the end state in the timeline. 'We are trying to balance that political ambition with my military ambition, my need to explain to the politicians, if you give me X, I can do Y.' Senior military figures have repeatedly raised concerns about the impact of the coalition's spending curbs, which have seen force levels cut and equipment programmes trimmed. An RAF spokesman said: 'The comments made by the Chief of the Air Staff must not be taken out of context. His commentary was based on previous academic discussions at the conference and related to the differences between any international military leader, who has to make decisions based on tactical circumstances and political decision makers who have to take into account a far broader and more complex picture. 'It was certainly not intended as any form of critique of the current UK Government or any previous UK Government.'","Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford reveals tension with politicians .

"Opposition Leader Bill Shorten blasted the government's instability this morning, after taking a cheery and almost certainly staged walk past the Liberal Party's leadership meeting. Mr Shorten, Deputy Leader Tanya Plibersek and Senators Penny Wong and Stephen Conroy clutched coffees and laughed among themselves as they strolled past the assembled media pack. 'Tony Abbott promised he would run a stable and united government,' said Mr Shorten, who is more than familiar with a leadership crisis, given he played a pivotal role in knifing prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. 'This is his biggest broken promise yet.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott managed to cling to power during Monday morning's meeting, defeating a spill motion led by rebellious backbenchers 61 votes to 39.

Survivor: Mr Abbott survived the spill motion, 61 votes to 39, but his grip on the party leadership appears tenuous . Winning position? Mr Shorten is well ahead in the latest opinion polls, more than a year-and-a-half out from the next scheduled federal election . But Mr Shorten has reason to celebrate given grim polling for Mr Abbott overnight. The latest Newspoll showed Labor was ahead of the Coalition 57 points to 43 on a two-party preferred basis. The Newspoll also found the Labor leader was preferred prime minister by 48 per cent to Mr Abbott's 30 per cent. However, the political landscape would likely be less rosy for Labor if Malcolm Turnbull ascends to the Liberal leadership in the coming months, according to a weekend poll. The Galaxy poll found the Liberals under Mr Turnbull would narrow the gap to 51 - 49 two party preferred, still in Labor's favour. Labor spokespeople have honed their attacks on Mr Turnbull in recent days, with Mr Shorten saying Mr Turnbull 'may have a nicer suit than Tony Abbott... (but they) are cut from the same cloth.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott did not take questions from the media today but will likely face a grilling in an interview on ABC's 7:30 program tonight .

"The mother of James Foley - the first American hostage beheaded by ISIS - says the alleged death of Kayla Mueller is proof the government has let their children down. Diane Foley, whose son was killed by Jihadi John in August last year, says 'nothing was done' to save those in captivity. Mueller was captured by jihadists in August 2013 and has been held alongside other prisoners - some of whom have been shown in the regime's trademark beheading videos. Her identity was not widely known until Friday, when ISIS claimed Mueller died in a bombing raid by Jordan. Scroll down for video . Standing by: Diane Foley (left), whose son James was beheaded by ISIS last August, believes the alleged death of Kayla Mueller is further proof the government has let their children down . Outspoken: She accused the American government of standing by as the hostages were held in captivity for two years . Foley told ABC's World News Tonight: 'Kayla, along with our son and others were held for nearly two years and there were many opportunities along the way: several times when the captors reached out, several times when returning hostages brought sensitive information. 'And yet nothing was done to save our young Americans. So that's the part that deeply concerns me.' The news comes on the back of reports U.S. special operations forces were incredibly close to finding Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, during a rescue mission in July 2014. A similar mission was launched to try and bring back James Foley just months before his death, however he had been moved by the time special forces arrived. Foley added: 'I certainly applaud the young, courageous soldiers who went on that mission. It was much too late and the intelligence obviously was poor -- it wasn't good enough for those courageous soldiers -- so they went in for nothing,' Failed attempts: Mrs Foley, who has been outspoken since her son's (pictured) death, says officials squandered many opportunities to save the hostages while they were in captivity. Since her son's death Foley has been outspoken about the government's complicity. In September, she told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at efforts to rescue her son from captivity. Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview, Mrs Foley said her son 'was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization.' 'Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' said Diane Foley. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.' The reports of Kayla's death were met with widespread scepticism, including her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller, who believe their daughter is alive. Allegations: The reports of Kayla's death were met with widespread scepticism, including her parents, Carl and Marsha (right) Mueller, who believe their daughter is alive . In a statement released by couple Friday, from their home in Prescott, Arizona, they said they are 'hopeful that Kayla is alive'. They also begged her captors to contact them privately, and hinted that they had already been in contact with ISIS, who typically demand enormous ransoms for the return of prisoners. Mueller's parents did not know their daughter was alive until May 2014 - nine months after her kidnapping - when they received contact from her.","Diane Foley said there was 'nothing done' to save Americans in captivity .

"A long list of celebrities including Australian model Elle Macpherson and media tycoon Kerry Packer have become embroiled in a massive tax scandal with a British bank. A cache of leaked files shows prominent Australians are among thousands identified as having held secret Swiss accounts with one of the world's largest banks HSBC. The files, released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, show the Swiss arm of HSBC had almost 500 clients linked to Australia, with 856 accounts, and total combined holdings of about $1.24 billion. Scroll down for video . A long list of celebrities including Australian model Elle Macpherson and media tycoon Kerry Packer have become embroiled in a massive tax scandal with a British bank . One client with connections to Australia had accounts worth $A184.21 million. A string other celebrities have also been caught out in the tax scheme including Genesis frontman Phil Collins, actor Christian Slater, tennis star Marat Safin, former Manchester United footballer Diego Forlan, MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi and actress Joan Collins. It it not illegal for Australians to hold Swiss bank accounts, and there is no suggestion any of the individuals have broken the law. But the report raises concerns about the potential for high net worth individuals to use the highly-secretive Swiss banking system to avoid or minimise tax. The data in the ICIJ report was secreted away by former HSBC employee Herve Falciani, who turned the information over to the French government in 2008 after which its tax authority launched an investigation. Australians named include the late media baron Kerry Packer, model Elle MacPherson and former ANZ chairman Charles Goode. There are others with adverse findings against them at the hands of regulators or the courts. According to the ICIJ report, Mr Packer was the beneficial owner of a client account under the name of C.P. International Management Services Limited, set up in 1994, closed in 2000 and linked to his Consolidated Press media empire. Mr Packer died in 2005. The files, released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, show the Swiss arm of HSBC had almost 500 clients linked to Australia, with 856 accounts, and total combined holdings of about $1.24 billion . A cache of leaked files shows prominent Australians (including Kerry Packer pictured above) are among thousands identified as having held secret Swiss accounts with one of the world's largest banks HSBC. Ms MacPherson is listed as a model, entertainer and entrepreneur. The report says Ms MacPherson was connected to seven HSBC client accounts, and was the beneficial owner of five. 'The four client accounts still operative in 2008 were linked to 25 bank accounts that together held as much as $US12.2 million ($A15.73 million) in 2006/2007,' the report said. In a statement, Ms MacPherson's lawyers say she 'is an Australian citizen who has accounted for UK tax on the basis of full disclosure in accordance with UK law'. Three of the accounts for which she was the beneficial owner were closed in 2000, 2001 and 2004. Mr Goode said his account was never used. International stars including actor Christian Slater (left) and Genesis frontman Phil Collins (right) have also been mentioned in the report . 'There were no deposits (except to open it) and no withdrawals (except to close it),' Mr Goode said in a statement to The Guardian. International tax avoidance was a key issue at the G20 leaders summit in Brisbane in November with world leaders vowing there would be crackdown. Treasurer Joe Hockey said then the leaders were 'very determined' to eliminate tax avoidance, particularly by multinational companies. The leaked files also mentioned actress Joan Collins. International tax avoidance was a key issue at the G20 leaders summit in Brisbane in November with world leaders vowing there would be crackdown . Russian politician and retired tennis player Marat Safin was also named in the document where the HSBC are accused of helping prominent clients evade tax . 'Wherever companies engage in extraordinary activity in order to avoid tax, we will go after them,' Mr Hockey said. A BBC Panorama investigation which will air in the UK on BBC tonight will investigate the claims further to see how bankers helped clients to avoid taxes. Offshore accounts are not illegal but they are often used as a way of hiding earnings from HM Revenue and Customs. HSBC claims that since the documents were leaked, it has radically overhauled its private banking business and reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70 per cent since 2007. The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green  told Panorama: 'As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present.' The bank now faces criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina. HSBC said it is 'co-operating with relevant authorities.

"A man suspected of committing a horrific suitcase killing in San Francisco died Saturday morning before authorities could find enough evidence to formally charge him. But Markus Andrus was cut loose for lack of evidence to charge him on Tuesday and on Saturday morning he went in to septic shock and died as he was getting treatment for a drug problem. 'I am sorry to learn that Mark Andrus died Saturday morning at San Francisco General Hospital,' his Public Defender Jeff Adachi wrote to the Daily News. 'During the short time I represented Mark, I found him to be a kind and engaging person.' Scroll down for video... Grisly: Mark Andrus, seen in news footage Friday covered in a bed sheet as he was led away by San Francisco street following an arrest on charges he murdered a man then stuffed his dismembered body into a suitcase, died Saturday when he went into septic shock . Pictured: Police could not comment on exactly how they linked Andrus to the body, but said they were aided by the surveillance footage and witness statements, yet lacked enough evidence to file charges . Andrus, 59, had been spotted on surveillance footage near where the suitcase was discovered and was booked into county jail hours after he was detained as a 'person of interest,' Officer Grace Gatpandan said. The bag was discovered Wednesday in the city's SOMA neighborhood and contained a male's body's parts, though not his head or hands. Police said other body parts were found in a nearby trash can. But evidence was still in short supply. 'Until we have the evidence necessary to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt, we are ethically obligated to hold off on charging this suspect,' San Francisco District Attorney's office spokesman Alex Bastian told press upon the suspect's release. Authorities remain on the hunt for Andrus' former roommater, Omar Shahwan, 58, who has been missing since the suitcase was discovered. At the time Andrus was taken into custody, Gatpandan said she could not comment on exactly how police linked him to the body, but said they were aided by the surveillance footage and witness statements. She did not have any additional information about Andrus, the body parts found in the suitcase or a possible motive. According to WPTV, police acted on an anonymous tip. Andrus' family told the San Francisco Chronicle he had run-ins with the law, kept to himself and drifted so far from them that they didn't know where he was or how to reach him. 'We haven't heard from him in, oh my gosh, years and years and years,' said Helen Andrus of Spokane, Wash., who is married to Mark Andrus' older brother, Jon. Horrific: Police in San Francisco last week found body parts in a suitcase and a trash can in the city's SOMA neighborhood . 'My husband at one point tried to reach out and find him, but I'm guessing it's been 20 years now since we last saw him.' The newspaper said Andrus had arrests in Missoula, Montana, in the 1980s and '90s for suspected drug possession, theft, burglary and jumping bail. Police received a call on the department's anonymous tip line that a 'person of interest' in the suitcase incident had been spotted in the city's Tenderloin neighborhood, Gatpandan said. They responded and detained two people, including Andrus. Police had released photos of Andrus from the surveillance footage earlier in the day showing him in a striped baseball cap, light blue jeans and a blue and orange jacket. Video evidence: Homicide detectives were on the scene and trying to recover surveillance footage from nearby businesses . The suitcase was found outside a Goodwill thrift store in the city's South of Market neighborhood. More body parts were found in a trash can nearby. The San Francisco medical examiner determined that the remains belong to an unidentified light-skinned man. Authorities will now turn to a DNA laboratory to identify him. The condition of the man's torso had police considering the possibility that organized crime or a gang was responsible for the remains, Officer Albie Esparza told the Chronicle before the announcement of Saturday's arrest. He did not elaborate in the story.

"The Japanese national  who was killed in a shark attack while surfing near Ballina on the New South Wales north coast has been named as 41-year-old Tadashi Nakahara. The surfboard technician, was reportedly sitting on his board just 10m from shore at popular surfing spot Shelley Beach near four other surfers  when the shark - believed to be a four-metre great white - attacked just before 10am on Monday.

Scroll down for video . 41-year-old Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara (pictured left) died after being attacked by a shark in Ballina . The victim lost both his legs and the other surfers brought him to shore where they attempted to tend to his injuries, but he lost too much blood and was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr Nakahara was from Japan but had been living in the area for a number of years. He has been formally identified and police are working with the Japanese consulate to inform his family of his death. Authorities are searching for the shark using helicopters, rescue boats and jet skis. Detective Inspector Cameron Lindsay said a witness had been filming the beach at the time but said the footage appeared to have been taken after the attack. A tribute left on Shelly Beach for Mr Nakahara who is originally from Japan but had lived near Ballina for years . Local residents lay flowers at the beach where the Japanese surfer was killed by a shark. Authorities closed the beach, near Ballina in northern NSW . Authorities are searching for the shark - believed to be a four-metre great white - using helicopters, rescue boats and jet skis . 'At this stage we don’t believe we have video of the actual attack,' Det Insp Lindsay said. 'What it appears to capture is a large amount of blood in the water.' Friends of the man told local cafe owner, Karen, the shark came out from nowhere. 'It just came up between a bunch of surfers,' she told AAP on Monday. 'They weren't even that far out. 'He lost both his legs.' The victim's friends were shaken up and looked 'white as a ghost' as they carried their mate's board away from the beach, the local said. Ballina Shire Mayor David Wright said it was believed to be a four metre great white shark that attacked the man. Authorities kept swimmers and surfers out of the water after today's fatal attack by a shark, which severed both of the man's legs . 'It came up and took the back of the board and part of the gentlemen too, there are not many sharks that can do that,' Cr Wright told Daily Mail Australia. Police said a shark expert would assist police in confirming the type of shark, if it is likely to still be in the area and if it still poses a threat to humans. Cr Wright said authorities believed it could be the same shark that attacked a surfer at nearby Seven Mile Beach yesterday. 'Now the sharks had two bites, if it's the same one, we certainly have to keep our eyes on it,' he said. Cr Wright said surf life saving helicopters, jet skis and boats were now searching for the great white. 'It's a pretty big shark so it's most likely gone,' he said. Paramedics at Shelly Beach attempted to revive the man following the attack just before 10am on Monday but he was pronounced dead at the scene . Three other surfers pulled the victim out of the water following the attack just before 10am on Monday and said the shark was about four metres long, the Ballina Shire Advocate reported. 'The people who pulled him out weren't all that old so we're trying to get some counselling for them,' Cr Wright said. A 15km stretch of beach from Lennox Head to South Ballina has been closed to the public. NSW Life Saving Manager Andy Kent said lifeguards had been stationed at all beaches in the Ballina Shire to keep the public informed and out of the water. 'This is obviously a very serious incident and we would ask that the public follow the directions of emergency service workers and lifeguards by remaining clear of the water,' Mr Kent said. 'Our thoughts go out to the man's family and friends, who are dealing with this tragedy.' The man's death brings the number of shark attacks to six in the past year and four in the past five months in Australia. There have been 174 fatal shark attacks in the past 100 years and 809 attacks reported. The beach will stay closed until authorities decide it is safe for swimmers to return to the water .

The Grenadier Guardsman who broke strict rules by dancing on parade outside Buckingham Palace is potentially facing a 21-day prison sentence and a £1,000 fine . The guardsman faces hours of marching practice and physical fitness tests at a military prison in Colchester, Essex. He also faces losing his wages for the period of his sentence – about £1,000.

His conduct is contrary to everything being a guardsman is about. ‘He is facing a stint in the jail with no pay and, when he returns to the Grenadiers, he could lose privileges such as going out in London with the other lads in his company. Twenty-one days has been discussed as a prison sentence.

Last night, defence sources confirmed that Army bosses are taking legal advice before they convene a disciplinary hearing with the soldier, now nicknamed ‘Private Dancer’, who is based at Wellington Barracks close to the Palace. The Queen is understood to have been away when the soldier entertained the crowds. As tourists laughed and cheered, he repeatedly spun around, stopped mid-stride with his foot in the air for several seconds, brushed dust off his rifle and bent down as if to pick something up. The footage was uploaded on to the internet last month. But senior officers now believe he should be formally disciplined. Under the Armed Forces Act 2006, a soldier may receive a custodial sentence for ‘conduct prejudicial to good order and Service discipline’. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the video. Anyone who is found to fall short of the Army’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action.’ Do you know the identity of the pirouetting palace guardsman?

"Sarah West, the first female commander of a Royal Navy warship, has been sent home after allegedly having an affair with another officer . The first female commander of a Royal Navy warship has been sent home after allegedly having an affair with another officer. Commander Sarah West, 42, took charge of the frigate HMS Portland in May 2012, but has been sent home from duty after claims she was having a relationship with a male officer on the same ship. This would breach the Armed Forces’ Code of Social Conduct, which prohibits personnel from having relationships with subordinates if they compromise ‘operational effectiveness’. While the Royal Navy is investigating the affair, Cdr West, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, retains her position as commander of HMS Portland. It is not known whether the male officer is married. Cdr West recently described herself as ‘single’, having been married to a former Royal Navy pilot in 1998. The pair later separated. A Royal Navy spokesman said last night: ‘We are aware of an allegation of a breach of the Code of Social Conduct on board HMS Portland, which we are treating seriously. ‘Anyone who is found to fall short of the Royal Navy’s high standards can expect to face appropriate action. It would be inappropriate to comment further.’ Earlier this year, Cdr West said work commitments had got in the way of her love life. She said in a newspaper interview: ‘I’m really proud to be the first woman but I’m not reinventing the wheel. Lots of women in the services have challenging roles. It’s just that I happen to be newsworthy at the moment. ‘There are drawbacks, though. Years at sea probably explains why I’m single. But every person in the military makes sacrifices.’ She added: ‘I’m a comprehensive-educated northerner who knew nothing about the military as I grew up. I worked as a trainee manager for two years after leaving university – then got bored with the nine-to-five.’ The military’s policy on relationships between servicemen and women is that they are permitted but that they must not undermine ‘trust and cohesion’ or damage ‘operational effectiveness’. The types of disciplinary action that can be taken when military personnel breach the Code of Social Conduct include formal warning, official censure or the re-assignment of those involved.

"Royal Air Force jets were deployed from Scotland to intercept Russian military 'Bear' aircraft that were flying too close to the airspace it guards. Aircraft based at RAF Lossiemouth, based in Moray, were sent to identify the aircraft - Tu-95 Russian Bear H bombers - that were spotted in international airspace. It was the first time a Quick Reaction Alert had occurred since the base took on the role of defending the UK’s Northern airspace. Scroll down for video . A British Typhoon jet, bottom, is seen intercepted one of two Russian 'Bear' aircraft that were spotted flying in international airspace . The interception, which involved two Typhoon jets pictured, was the first time a Quick Reaction Alert had occurred since the Lossiemouth, Scotland, base had taken on the role of defending the UK's Northern airspace . RAF Lossiemouth’s Station Commander, Group Captain Mark Chappell, said the 'first successful launch' was what all the 'hard work' by the base had been for. He said: 'The relocation of two Typhoon squadrons was a significant challenge, one that was met by our whole team. 'The many months of preparation and infrastructure improvements have made us absolutely ready for this launch, and shows we are in the best position to provide the service to the United Kingdom that the Royal Air Force was primarily created for - that is, the protection of our airspace.' Royal Air Force Lossiemouth began a new era in its history on the 1st of September when it assumed the provision of what the RAF calls the ‘Quick Reaction Alert (Interceptor) North’ task for the United Kingdom. The role is carried out by crews from 6 Squadron. The pilot involved in the mission called it a 'flawless scramble and execution' and said it was a milestone moment for RAF Lossiemouth . The pilot of the first launch, who has not been named, said 'it was an honour' to be part of the first alert, something he called a 'milestone in the history of RAF Lossiemouth'. He added: 'The fact that we had a flawless scramble and intercept of two Russian Bears was a testament to the hard work and commitment of all personnel involved. 'A very proud moment, not just for the pilots who did the intercept but the engineering crews who did a fantastic job, as well as many other station personnel involved in this constant commitment.' In June two Typhoon jets were scrambled into action to head off four separate groups of Russian aircraft that were flying near the Baltic. The jets were deployed to ensure the Russian planes didn't enter the airspace of  Estonia, Lithuania or Latvia. The Ministry of Defence said the aircraft appeared to be carrying out  a 'routine training' exercise in international airspace and were later escorted out of the area. That incident followed another where four Typhoons were sent to the Siauliai air base in Lithuania in May to support a Polish-led Nato force which was operating in the region. That mission was a gesture by Nato following the Ukraine crisis.","The mission was RAF Lossiemouth's maiden Quick Reaction Alert .

"President Barack Obama finally broke his silence this morning on the problems plaguing his administration's Veterans Affairs Department. The president said he 'will not stand' for allegations of misconduct. 'Not as Commander in Chief, but also not as an American. None of us should,' he said. Obama called VA Secretary Eric Shinseki 'a great public servant and a great warrior on behalf of the United States of America.' 'We're gonna work with him to solve the problem,' Obama said, confirming that he had not asked Shinseki for his resignation. However the president said he would wait to see the results of the VA's internal report before making any decisions about the future of the beleaguered agency. As Commander in Chief, 'the responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me,' Obama said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . As Commander-in-Chief, 'the responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me,' Obama said on Wednesday . The president held a rare press conference and addressed his administration's efforts to sort out the VA mess, but he only took two reporters' questions . The president's remarks followed a last minute . meeting with Shinseki and White House Deputy Chief of . Staff Rob Nabors. Nabors is overseeing an internal . review of the VA's operations in light of allegations that 40 veterans died after staff at a VA facility in Phoenix, Arizona put them on secret waiting lists to cover up how long it was taking them to receive care. The president said he expects to see a preliminary report from Nabors on the secret waiting lists next week and full report next month on 'how the VA can up their game.' Before Obama's 10 am meeting with Shinseki even began, the White . House announced that the president would make a statement at 10.45 am . directly after, leading observers to believe the president may be asking for Shinseki's resignation during their meeting. The . White House had already forced Under Secretary of Health for the VA, . Robert Petzel, to abruptly resign last Friday after his lackluster performance a day before at a Senate Veterans Affairs hearing. Petzel . was already set to retire this year, but the White House forced him out . early, sensing that someone's head needed to roll over the alleged . misconduct at VA hospitals. Even as Petzel's employment with the VA was terminated early, the White House stood by Shinseki, who has repeatedly said he's not going to step down. 'The president supports Secretary Shinseki’s decision,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Friday. Obama reiterated that support during his press conference today, fondly referring to Shinseki by his nickname, 'Rick,' throughout his remarks. 'Across the board, he has put his heart and soul into this thing, and he has taken it very seriously,' Obama said. Secretary Shinseki serves the country because 'he cares very deeply about veterans, and he cares deeply about the mission,' Obama said. Unhappy warriors: American Legion members have camped out in congressional hearing rooms as Veterans Affairs officials field questions about extended wait-times and secret waiting lists for medical care at VA hospitals and clinics . 'And I know that Rick, his attitude is, if he does not think he can do a good job on this, and if he thinks he's let our veterans down, then I am sure that he is not gonna be interested in committing to serve,' he continued. 'At this stage, Rick is committed to solving the problem, and working with us to do it.' Safe, for now: U.S. Veterans Affairs Secretary, retired general Eric Shinseki, met with Obama Wednesday morning to outline how the VA will fix its now legendary shortcomngs . The president said during his prepared remarks that he has been inspired by wounded veterans' 'spirit and their determination to recover and often to serve.' 'These men and women are the best that our country has to offer,' Obama said. 'So when I hear allegations of misconduct - any misconduct,' he said, 'whether it's allegations of VA staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books, I will not stand for it. Not as Commander in Chief, but also not as an American. None of us should. 'So, if these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable. It is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it period.' 'Once we know the facts, I assure you, if there is misconduct, it will be punished,' Obama said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell immediately criticized the president for not taking a heavier hand. 'A crisis of the magnitude facing the VA on providing care to our veterans . demands clear leadership from President Obama,' McConnell said. 'Unfortunately, so far I have yet . to hear from the president that he is treating the VA crisis with the . seriousness it deserves.' Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus raised similar questions about the president's decision not to act yet given recent reports that his team has known for five years that VA hospitals were falsifying records to make it look like veterans were waiting for care for shorter periods of time than they actually were. 'Why did President Obama wait to address this situation only to ask our veterans for more time and to offer nothing but words?' Preibus said in a statement. 'We've known about these problems for weeks—facilities cooking their books, veterans dying while waiting for an appointment and bonuses being handed out to those in charge. The Administration, we now know, has known about them even longer.' Anyone who . is found to be guilty of the allegations will  be held . accountable, Obama promised during his remarks, and called on both Republicans and Democrats to work together and not let the scandal 'become another political football.' Out: Veterans Affairs Undersecretary for Health Dr. Robert Petzel resigned suddenly on Friday, just a day after defending his record in a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing . 'If somebody’s engaged in mismanagement or misconduct, not . only do I not want them getting bonus, I want them punished,' Obama said. He pointed out that the individuals involved . in creating the secret wait lists at the Phoenix VA hospital at the . center of the scandal have already been put on administrative leave. 'I . know that people are angry and want swift reckoning. I sympathize with . that. But we have to let the investigators do they're job and get to the . bottom of what happened,' the president added. Obama said several times today that doesn't want to 'get ahead' of the internal review or any other investigations such as the report the VA Inspector General is working on. The somewhat slow pace of the investigation into the secret wait list 'is not as a consequence . people not caring about the problem,' it's that 85 million . appointments are made through VA hospitals a year. 'That's a lot of appointments,' the president said. The president said under his leadership, the VA made benefits available to two million veterans who did not have them before and expanded access to care for veterans with mental health issues and women veterans, all of which are positive developments, but also created stress on veterans health systems and contributed to wait times. Based on the results of . the investigation so far, the long appointment wait times were for . 'folks who may have had chronic conditions,' and 'it was not necessarily a situation where they were calling for emergency services,' the president said. Furthermore, 'there . are parts of the VA health care system that have performed well, ' Obama . said, and the satisfaction rate of many veterans has been . 'high.' The president admitted he did not know whether the secret wait lists were 'systemic' or if the Phoenix scandal was 'just an episodic problem.' 'There are going to be a lot of questions that we have to answer,' he concluded.","President Barack Obama finally broke his silence on allegations that a VA hospital lied about how quickly it was providing veterans with care .
The president said he 'will not stand' for allegations of misconduct, but currently they are just that - allegations .
Obama said he wouldn't take further action until Deputy Chief of Staff to the White House Rob Nabors completes his internal review of the VA .
Regarding, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki, Obama said, 'We're gonna work with him to solve the problem'
But he left the door open to fire Shinseki if it turns out the VA scandal was worse than he first thought ."
"Lord Tebbit has urged tactical voters to back the UK Independence Party in tomorrow’s local elections. In an extraordinary intervention, the . Tory grandee said UKIP’s policies were now those ‘closest to a . traditional Conservative agenda’. And . he urged Right-leaning voters in Labour areas to vote tactically for . whichever candidate had the best chance of causing an upset – even if . they are not Conservative. Amid growing signs that the Tories could haemorrhage support to UKIP, David Cameron signalled an end to personal attacks on his rivals, insisting: 'I'm not calling anybody anything.' The parties go into battle in 34 councils in tomorrow's elections, with the Tories braced for big losses in areas last contested in 2009 when Gordon Brown was leading Labour to a major defeat. But all eyes will be on what impact UKIP can make, and how many votes it can take from the bigger parties . Pollsters predict UKIP could win between 40 and 100 seats when voters got to polls in 34 councils in England and Wales. Nigel Farage's anti-EU party is fielding almost as many candidates as the Lib Dems, and is confident of coming at least third in the overall share of the vote. One poll of areas where elections are being held on Thursday put UKIP on 22 per cent, well ahead of the Lib Dems on 12 per cent and only just behind Labour on 24 per cent. The Conservatives were in first on 31 per cent, but Tory strategists fear their recent attacks on UKIP could backfire and see more voters switch to back Mr Farage. Lord Tebbit, who has been warned by . David Cameron against making pro-UKIP remarks – said he would vote . Conservative because he supported his local Tory council. But, . in comments on a newspaper blog that could result in disciplinary . action, he added: ‘If you have a Labour councillor then I suggest that . the best vote is the one most likely to replace him or her with either a . Conservative, UKIP or sound independent one.’ UKIP has been under sustained assault from the Tories, with Kenneth Clarke branding the party a ‘collection of clowns’ supported by 'racists'. And . Tory sources believe the anti-EU party could do serious damage tomorrow . with Conservatives potentially forced to go into coalition with UKIP . councillors in once-safe Tory areas. But . Lord Tebbit said his party’s tactics were counterproductive and accused . senior Tories, including Mr Clarke, of waging a ‘smear campaign’ against UKIP which could drive disaffected voters into the arms of the . smaller party. David Cameron has curbed criticism of UKIP in recent days amid fears the attacks could backfire and encourage more voters back the anti-EU party. Lord Tebbit (right) risks a rebuke from the Conservative leadership for his suggestion that tactical voters should support UKIP in some areas . Lord Tebbit added: ‘It may well be that many former Conservative voters are so fed up with the Cameron coalition that they will turn to UKIP as the party which comes closest to a traditional Conservative agenda, and a reasoned position on the European issue. One can hardly blame them for that.’ In 2009, Lord Tebbit urged a boycott of all three main parties – bringing a sharp rebuke from Mr Cameron, who suggested the peer could be kicked out of the party if he went further and actively backed UKIP. Today Mr Cameron refused to be drawn into the row over UKIP being branded 'clowns' and 'racists'. He told ITV's Daybreak: 'I’m not calling anybody anything, what I’m doing is talking about what the Conservatives offer at the local elections and in the end it’s people who will go and vote and people who will choose.' He said he would not make predictions about the scale of Tory losses in tomorrow's elections. 'The Conservatives are defending more seats than anyone else, we control more councils than anyone else, so everyone’s having a shot at us.' However, Foreign Secretary William Hague today defended Mr Clarke's criticism of UKIP. He told BBC Radio 4: ' I think when you look at the financial commitments you can see why a former chancellor thinks they have a clown-like aspect.' He went on to insist votwers had to make a 'choice' between Labour and the Tories. ' Voting for a fringe party is opting out of that choice and wasting your vote' he added. In recent days UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been forced on to the back foot over his party’s ‘very odd’ candidates – one was pictured apparently giving a Nazi salute. Mr Farage acknowledged the photo of Somerset candidate Alex Wood did ‘not look very pretty’ – but insisted the party did its best to weed out extremists. He said UKIP had a blanket ban on former BNP activists and had rejected a number of candidates who ‘seemed to be very, very odd’. But he admitted the rapid growth of the party meant some undesirables had slipped through the net. ‘We have done what due diligence we . can at branch level,’ he said. ‘If people seemed to be very, very odd we . didn’t accept them but we have taken people on faith. ‘We . don’t have the resources to trawl through absolutely everybody’s social . media sites and that has led to one or two embarrassments.’ Mr . Wood was suspended from the party yesterday pending a police . investigation into a series of allegedly racist postings on his Facebook . page. In . one picture he was photographed apparently making a Nazi salute. In . another, he was pictured in front of a Union flag holding a dagger . between his teeth. UKIP leader Nigel Farage was questioned about his party's vetting of candidates during a campaign visit with Richard Elvin, right, in South Shields, Newcastle . Mr Wood yesterday strenuously denied making the comments, claiming his Facebook account had been hacked. He . said the words attributed to him were appalling, adding: ‘I am . completely against the Nazi beliefs, I am a democratic libertarian.’ Mr . Wood said the picture of him apparently making a salute had been taken . as he reached out to grab a camera from a friend who had been ‘taking a . photograph of me pretending to be a houseplant’. The picture with the dagger was taken while he was getting ready for a fancy dress party, he said. Candidate: Alex Wood giving the alleged Nazi salute . Mr Wood will continue as a candidate in the Blackmore Vale ward because the ballot paper has already been printed but he will be an independent if he is elected. n There was further chaos in UKIP ranks last night as the father of a rising Tory star tried to withdraw his candidacy for the party just 90 minutes after it was announced. Securing the support of Sushil Patel – a British Asian and parent of Right-wing MP Priti Patel – was a coup for the Eurosceptic party. But shortly after yesterday’s announcement  that he was their candidate in the Bushey South ward of Hertfordshire County Council, Mr Patel told a journalist he had stood down. It is understood he was unable to withdraw fully since his name was already on the ballot paper. Sources claimed he had a ‘wobble’ after Conservative central office was alerted to his candidacy. A YouGov poll yesterday put UKIP on 14 per cent, ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 11 per cent. Labour’s Ed Miliband is also under pressure to live up to his One Nation slogan by making big gains in the south of England. The Tories have challenged Labour to win an extra 1,000 seats, although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely. However, UKIP could be the big winner . of the night with the party confident it can push the Lib Dems into . fourth place in total votes cast. Tories fear they could lose 400 seats. Conservative strategists point out that in 2009 the Tories were as far ahead in the polls as Labour are now. In 2009, the Tories won 35 per cent of . the vote with Labour under Gordon Brown 13 points behind on just 22 per . cent, pushed into third behind the Lib Dems. Today opinion polls put . Labour up to 10 points ahead of the Tories. One Cabinet minister claimed based on a uniform swing Labour should gain 1,500 seats but 1,000 was more realistic. Labour has sought to downplay expectations, predicting just 200 gains. In 2009 it suffered catastrophic . losses in areas where the party once dominated, including losing 28 of . 44 seats in Lancashire and 29 or 32 seats in Staffordshire. Other councils where Labour is . expected to make strong gains are all in the north of England, including . Derbyshire, Durham, Nothumberland and Nottinghamshire. Tories are braced for hundreds of losses after gaining control of seven councils and 244 seats in 2009. Just a year before the general election which forced Mr Brown out of power, Labour lost of four councils and 291 seats. After being humiliated by the UK . Independence Party in the Eastleigh by-election, the Tories will seek to . portray UKIP as being allies of Labour, warning a vote for any party . other than Conservatives will lead to council tax rises. Voters will be told that backing UKIP . will allow Labour to gain control of councils and drive up bills. ‘If . you want to put up your council tax, vote UKIP or Labour,’ will be a key . message. In total almost 10,000 people are standing for election to 2,449 seats. A total of 12 Tories are already home . and dry after being returned unopposed. However Conservatives have . already lost a Surrey seat after failing to file nomination papers on . time.","Lord Tebbit said the Conservatives face a drubbing when voters go to the polls in Thursday's local elections .

"Religious groups representing Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs last night banded together to demand an end to sex-selective abortions – saying current legislation is not sufficient to prevent it. The 25 groups, including the Muslim Women’s Network, the Hindu Council and the Sikh Women’s Alliance, have written to every MP to demand the change. Around 100 MPs have said they will support an amendment making it clear that it is illegal under the 1967 Abortion Act to terminate a pregnancy on the grounds of the unborn child’s sex. Campaigners say the practice is more common among many of Britain’s ethnic communities, where girls are less prized than boys. Religious groups representing Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs have banded together to demand an end to sex-selective abortions. File photo . The letter expresses regret at the unwillingness of parties on both sides to see beyond the rhetoric around whether they are ‘pro-choice’ or ‘pro-life’. It states that the wording of the present law, which does not specifically rule out sex-selective abortions, provides ‘mixed messages’ which is ‘causing confusion’. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service, for example, argues that sex-selective abortion is not illegal because ‘the law is silent on the matter’. The signatories warn: ‘We are confident that this contributes to complacency in the minds of those who, for whatever reason, do not want a girl.’ Led by Tory MP Fiona Bruce, pictured, around 100 MPs are believed to be in favour of an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill . The letter is also signed by the Sikh Council and other religious organisations including Imam Ajmal Masroor, Sharan Project, Jeena International and Karma Nirvana. Led by Tory MP Fiona Bruce, around 100 MPs are believed to be in favour of an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, which is likely to be debated on 23 February. The amendment reads: ‘Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.’ The letter says: ‘Since news broke of the sex-selective abortion amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, we have been concerned by how much airtime has been given to radical voices opposing the initiative. ‘Sex-selective abortion must end. We were campaigning for this long before Fiona Bruce or anyone else became interested. We are delighted that so many MPs have responded positively to our efforts.’ The letter adds: ‘If the current framing of the law allows the British Pregnancy Advisory Service to argue that sex-selective abortion is not illegal because “the law is silent on the matter”, or the British Medical Association to say that aborting for foetal sex is permissible in some circumstances, then the law requires clarification. ‘To be clear: the amendment does not change the grounds of the Abortion Act. It merely makes explicit something which is already unlawful. ‘It does not preclude abortion where there is a sex-linked disability in the foetus.’","Groups including Muslim Women’s Network, Hindu Council and Sikh Women’s Alliance are demanding change .

Highly trained: The combat dolphins are prepared for military duties at the Crimean State Oceanarium, which was inherited by Ukraine when the Soviet Union collapsed 23 years ago . In March, Russian media reported that the dolphins had 'defected' to Moscow - along with many Ukrainian forces in Crimea. Today, however, was the first confirmation that Putin is now the mammals' chief commander . Moscow has taken charge of 13 elite unit of dolphins and a number of sea lions. The creatures are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. Others were schooled for anti-sabotage and rescue missions. The use of bottlenose dolphins as naval assets was begun during the Cold War in Sevastopol by the Soviet Union in 1973. NATO is now running constant patrols in the Black Sea due to the Ukrainian crisis, which means in theory that Russia could deploy them against Western ships.

Russia's rouble hit a new low against the dollar today. The currency has been hit by falling oil prices and a decision by the central bank not to raise interest rates despite investor concern over the economic effect of the Ukraine crisis. Russian assets took a beating last week after the United States and European Union imposed new sanctions over Moscow's role in the separatist conflict in Ukraine. The action further limits access to foreign capital for some of Russia's top companies. The rouble fell to a new all-time low of 38.00 roubles to the dollar in the first hour of trading today. By 09:00 GMT the rouble had extended losses to trade 0.81 per cent weaker against the dollar at 38.09, and 0.55 per cent lower at 49.21 versus the euro. Russia relies on oil and gas for about two-thirds of exports and half of federal budget revenues. Experts are predicting the rouble could fall still further over the coming week. These estimates are based on the fact rates for Russian companies looking to park foreign currency holdings at the central bank remain low, reflecting a weak demand. Four other dolphins used in Sevastopol in helping to treat children suffering from cerebral palsy, mental disorders and psychological stress have been moved to civilian duties by the Russians and will continue this valuable work. In March, the Russian media reported that the dolphins had 'defected' to Moscow - along with many Ukrainian forces in Crimea - but this is the first official confirmation that the mammals' commander in chief is now Vladimir Putin. In July a Ukrainian official demanded that the dolphins should be handed back to Ukraine. 'The military dolphins need to be returned to our country in the same way that Russia returned Ukraine's seized military equipment,' he said. Last year three of five spy dolphins went absent without leave in the Black Sea - apparently in search of love. 'They deserted a naval exercise and went on manoeuvres of an amorous kind,' said a source. 'They swam away to look for mates.' Later they returned to duties.Yury Plyachenko, a former Soviet naval anti-sabotage officer, explained that this was something that had to be taken into account in working with the 007 mammals. 'If a male dolphin saw a female dolphin during the mating season, then he would immediately set off after her. But they come back in a week or so.' The Sevastopol facility is one of only two such combat dolphin training centres in the world. The other is run by the US Navy in San Diego.

"Louis van Gaal could not have wished for a better start at Manchester United. From the 7-0 opening win over LA Galaxy to the victory over Liverpool in Miami, Van Gaal returns home with the Chevrolet Cup, International Champions Cup and, most importantly, an unbeaten record. Here are five things Sportsmail have learned from United’s tour of America... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney celebrate bizarre ghost goal against Liverpool . Confident: Louis van Gaal (right) seems to have already transformed United back into a winning team . Meeting of minds: Van Gaal speaks to his coaching staff after the pre-season friendly between United and Liverpool . 1. Van Gaal is a winner. It sounds a simple enough quality but one that cannot be underestimated at United after the club’s shocking decline under David Moyes. The Dutchman has taken largely the same group and transformed them into a team which, even at this early stage, will clearly be a very different proposition. Whether it was the faultless penalties in the shootout win over Inter Milan or the character shown to come back and beat Liverpool, United are already playing for their new manager and that is half the battle. Not giving in: United came from behind to defeat Liverpool in their latest pre-season friendly . 2. The Dutchman is not scared to make radical changes. The new 3-4-1-2 formation is quite a departure from United formations under Sir Alex Ferguson and Moyes, but Van Gaal believes that is the best system to get the most out of the players at his disposal. Rather than simply throwing money at new signings, he is prepared to alter the fundamental line-up of the team to suit the players he has. Those who don’t fit into his plans – Fellaini, Nani, Anderson, Hernandez and Kagawa – will not be kept hanging around. They will be shipped out at the first opportunity. On the move? Van Gaal looks set to allow several players to leave the club, including Marouane Fellaini (above) 3. Wayne Rooney is onside with the new regime. Having almost left United in Ferguson’s final season because of the favouritism shown towards Robin van Persie, and then been cajoled back into line by Moyes, there were concerns that Van Gaal’s close relationship with Van Persie would alienate Rooney all over again. Instead, he has scored five goals on tour, won the Most Valuable Player award at the International Champions Cup and impressed the manager to such an extent that he is set to be named captain ahead of Van Persie. You only had to listen to Van Gaal and Rooney speaking about one another in Miami to see that the England striker is happy with the situation. Stick with me: Wayne Rooney (right) looks to be happy playing under the new United boss . In the mood: Rooney (above)  has scored five goals during United's impressive pre-season tour . Silverware: Darren Fletcher and Rooney lift the International Champions Cup 2014 Final . 4. Juan Mata is United's first choice No 10. Ignore the fact he wears No.8, Mata’s deployment in that role behind two strikers in Van Gaal’s new formation on tour shows that he has the manager’s faith. He never looked comfortable playing in a wider position under Moyes following hsi £37.1million move from Chelsea, and there were even questions about his future at Old Trafford when Van Gaal came in. But Mata has benefitted from the manager’s willingness to mould the system around the players he likes, and the Spaniard appears much happier in the new system. Kagawa, on the other hand, has been deemed surplus to requirements. In the middle: Juan Mata will be United's first choice No 10 after a good pre-season with Van Gaal's side . In action: Martin Skrtel competes with Mata during the International Champions Cup 2014 final . 5. Ashley Young has a future at United after all. If you had to draw up a list of players likely to leave Old Trafford if Moyes had stayed at the club, Young would have been towards the front of the queue right behind Anderson. Even when Van Gaal took over, his aversion to using out-and-out wingers meant that Young, Nani and Wilfried Zaha were immediately under threat. Young has tried to reinvent himself as a wing-back in the mould of Antonio Valencia, even though his defensive deficiencies were exposed by Raheem Sterling against Liverpool. That is something he needs to work on, but going forward Young was a real threat and looks like he has a new lease of life at United. VIDEO Van Gaal wants reinforcements . New skill: Ashley Young has tried to reinvent himself as a wing-back in the mould of Antonio Valencia . Easy street: Mata scores against Roma during United's unbeaten pre-season tour .

"A father of three died in an avalanche on the last day of a family skiing holiday in the Italian Alps near to the French border. Graeme Porteous, 48, was swept to his death on Saturday after his off-piste ski party was hit by a 45ft-wide wall of snow in Argentera in Piedmont. Mr Porteous, who lived in Wimbledon, South-West London, with his wife Alexandra, survived the initial impact of the avalanche but suffered ‘multiple trauma’ when he was trapped against a tree and died within minutes. Danger: Graeme Porteous, 48, was swept to his death in Italy's Argentera region of the Alps (pictured) Last night a neighbour confirmed that Singapore-born Mr Porteous was a private investment banker who ran his own business from the £5.8million family home. The neighbour said: ‘This is a tragic accident for a lovely family.’ Mr Porteous is one of three skiers killed this weekend across Italy by heavy snow falls. Italian authorities said that he was part of a ‘really well organised’ group of ten friends and two guides enjoying the final day of their holiday but that conditions in that area were perilous. Raffaele Bagnis, head of the local Alpine Rescue team, told The Times: ‘They had gone off piste and provoked the avalanche. Thick snow: A skier in the Argentera region (file photo). The group had taken precautions . ‘There was one metre of fresh snow there and two metres higher up, with massive drifts built up by the wind . ‘There was too much snow to be out there. You can be the best skier in the world, but that doesn’t count in conditions like that. ‘Mr Porteous was conscious after the impact, but complained of pain in his leg and died five minutes later.’ The group had taken good precautions against the weather and each skier was wearing a backpack containing twin airbags, which can be inflated when an avalanche approaches to help stop the wearer being buried by snow. None was buried and all excepted for Mr Porteous escaped unharmed. Captain Giuseppe La Torre, the local commander of the Carabiniere police said the spate of avalanches across the region have been caused by unseasonably warm weather. He said: ‘There are lots of avalanches here at the moment because of snowfalls followed by sun. It can be very dangerous and this was indicated to skiers.’ Mr Porteous’s group, which is believed to include his wife, returned to the UK yesterday and were said to be ‘destroyed’ at his death. There were numerous other incidents in the region over the weekend. At Cortina d’Ampezzo in the Veneto region, rescuers spent four hours recovering the body of a 24 year old Dutch skier buried by a an avalanche while skiing off piste. And i the Trentino region, a group of snowboarders headed off piste at Passo Brocon but were struck by an avalanche which killed one of them after he was buried under nearly five feet of snow.","Graeme Porteous, 48, hit by 45ft of snow in Argentera near French border .

"A man who formerly managed a walk-through zoo in northwestern Pennsylvania will spend 10 to 20 years in prison for having sex with a 14-year-old family friend at his house and the zoo, where the girl worked alongside his wife. Bruce Sankey, 45, of Greene Township, was sentenced by a Mercer County judge on Wednesday. He had previously pleaded no contest to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Sankey apologized vaguely for 'anything involved on both sides,' which left Judge Robert Yeatts to admonish him, saying, 'You couldn't bring yourself to refer to the victim. You referred to the 'other side.' Sick: Bruce Sankey, a former Pennsylvania zoo manager, has been sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl during which he had sex with her at his workplace . 'Unless you can show remorse and admit to what you've done,' Yeatts said, 'you will stay in the full 20 years.' What's more--after reviewing letters written to the court describing Sankey's good character, reports the Sharon Herald--Yeatts told the court: . 'I think there's a dark side to you that your family hasn't seen...I was concerned that in none of the letters did they express concern for the victim.' Prosecutors say the incidents occurred in 2011, when Sankey worked at the Pymatuning Deer Park. The girl hesitated to report the sex because she didn't want to harm Sankey's children and because of pressure from Sankey's wife. Following Sankey's arrest, his wife was charged after prosecutors say she tried to cover his tracks. In April 2014, Sankey's victim told a court that his wife Rachelle contacted her in an attempt to keep her silent about the months of abuse. In tearful testimony, the girl revealed Rachelle tried blaming her in order to keep her quiet and even gave her Bible verses to shame her into silence. Prosecutors offered Rachelle Sankey a chance to enter a diversionary program called Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition top avoid standing trial for witness tampering. Her husband will be registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life. Sankey once managed the Pymatuning Deer Park, where he worked with his wife Rachelle. She is awaiting her day in court on witness tampering charges after she allegedly tried shaming the teen into silence .","Bruce Sankey, 45, had a sexual relationship with a girl for months and had sex with her at the Pymatuning Deer Park in 2011 .

"With their little faces looking up to the camera, six breeds of foxes stand patiently awaiting their lunch. This is Fox Village, in Japan’s Miyagi prefecture, where for less than £4 (700 Japanese Yen) visitors are allowed entry and can feed the animals. Foxes are heralded in Japan, with many believing they have mystical powers, as well as others who believe they bring    good luck as they descend from Inari Okami, the Shinto deity of fertility, prosperity and rice. The foxes get ready to be fed at the Japanese Fox Village in the Miyagi prefecture . Guests are encouraged to feed the foxes, but it's sensible not to put your fingers too close . And while foxes have received a fair amount of negative press for involving themselves in urban areas and causing mischief, these are simply too cute. The sanctuary is found near the mountains near Shiroishi, where in addition to six different types of foxes, there are over 100 varieties of animals housed. And don't worry if you are slightly fearful of feeding the foxes - staff are on hand to advise you of the correct way to pass them the food. The fox village is split into two sections. The first has foxes in pens and cages, some are sadly on a lead, but that's more for their own safety. This character looks to have eaten too much as he takes a nap in the sanctuary .

However, after going through another door, you are thrust into a very different environment.

"Jordan says it has carried out 56 airstrikes on Islamic State targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh. The country's air force chief said the three consecutive days of attacks were 'just the beginning' of campaigns  planned in a bid to avenge the 26-year-old's death. Last week, ISIS released a video purporting to show Kasasbeh being burnt alive in a cage as masked militants in camouflage uniforms looked on. Scroll down for video . Airstrike: Jordan has carried out 56 aerial bombings on Islamic State targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh. Pictured: Aerial strike from video released last week by officials . Tribute: A plane belonging to the Jordanian Royal Air Force made a deliberate diversion over over the home town of the pilot brutally murdered by ISIS after carrying out airstrikes against the terror group in Syria . Major General Mansour al-Jabour (pictured) said: 'We achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath' The act has been widely condemned as among the most sickening ever committed to film and sent waves of revulsion across the Middle East. Today, Major General Mansour al-Jabour said: 'We achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath. And this is not the end. This is the beginning.' According to Major General, the strikes - dubbed Operation Martyr Moaz in the pilot's memory - targeted ISIS's weapon depots, training centres, warehouses and military barracks. Jordanian military experts say the kingdom could soon struggle to sustain the intensity of the past few days of air strikes, given the air force only has 40 mid-life F16 jets at its disposal. A squadron of F16 jet fighters from the United Arab Emirates arrived in Jordan on Sunday a day after the Gulf state announced it was being sent to bolster the coalition's military effort. A squadron of United Arab Emirates F-16 fighters has arrived in one of Jordan's air bases to support it in strikes against the Islamic State group . Brutal: ISIS released footage purportedly showing the 26-year-old pilot being burned to death in a cage . Major General Mansour al-Jabour said the strike had 'achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath' Looking for revenge: King Abdullah (pictured today with Prince Charles) had vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against ISIS militants who control parts of neighboring Syria and Iraq . It will conduct joint air strikes with Jordanian colleagues against the Islamic militants, Jordanian officials said on Saturday. The focus of Jordan's airstrikes are reported to be Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria. The intensified air assaults come almost one week after the extremists released the chilling footage, which sparked protests throughout Jordan. Entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film showed the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and being seemingly doused in fuel, as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is set alight. Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the stricken pilot. After the footage was released, Jordanian officials promised to retaliate harshly and quickly executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS. This included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. King Abdullah II later said Jordan's response would 'be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.' In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'. Days later, the country released a slickly-edited video showing its war planes being prepared for bombing strikes against ISIS jihadists in Syria. Jordan released a video last week showing its war planes being prepared for bombing strikes against ISIS . The video also featured a pilot holding up a sign that reads: 'And do not think that God is unaware of what the evildoers are doing' - an apparent warning to ISIS militants . The footage, believed to have been broadcast on state TV, was understood to have been recorded at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base and showed troops on plane-mounted missiles before the fleet of fighter jets are launched. The clip shows uniformed people, believed to be members of the Jordanian military, writing messages in Arabic across plane-mounted missiles. One reads 'for you, the enemy of Islam'. ISIS seized control of large areas of Iraq and Syria last year, prompting hundreds of raids by coalition war planes. The United States and several Arab allies, including Jordan, have been striking ISIS in Syria since September 23. Warplanes from the U.S. and other countries have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer. The campaign aims to push back the jihadi organisation after it took large parts of Iraq and Syria and declared a 'caliphate.' Al-Jabour said coalition planes have flown 5,500 sorties since the beginning of the air campaign, including 2,000 reconnaissance flights. He did not say whether this included flights over both Syria and Iraq. He said Jordan's air force participated in 946 sorties. The general said about 7,000 Islamic State group militants have been killed since the beginning of the coalition airstrikes.","Air force chief Mansour al-Jabour said attacks were 'just the beginning'

"Kicked, punched, and hurled against a blood-soaked wall, animals shriek and writhe in agony as they await their slaughter. Cows are seen hanging by one leg still mooing even after their throats are cut, while a pig is repeatedly struck by a metal gate after being shot incorrectly by a bolt gun. The undercover footage exposes the practice at a 112-year-old family butcher's abattoir in Staffordshire. Scroll down for video . 'Barbaric': A worker at S Bagshaw and Sons butchers in Staffordshire is seen stamping on a sheep as it struggles for dear life on the blood-stained ground after apparently being stunned . It comes days after similar evidence emerged of cruel treatment at a halal slaughterhouse in Thirsk, North Yorkshire. The latest footage was captured by animal welfare campaigners over a six-month period at S. Bagshaw and Sons butchers near Leek. Several scenes show pigs, cows, and sheep being kicked, thrown around and strung up – many appearing not to have been adequately stunned. Under guidelines, it is an offence 'to cause or permit avoidable pain, excitement, or suffering to any animal'. Anyone who is found guilty of cruelty to animals can face a fine of up to £20,000 or a jail term. In one clip, an employee attempts to pick up a wriggling sheep and slam it back-first against the blood-saturated ground before stepping on its neck. He eventually manages to haul the terrified animal up by its leg as it continues to struggle for its life – looking far too energetic to have been recently stunned. Another shows three workers repeatedly kick a pig before slamming it against the wall and squashing it with a metal gate, having already attempted to kill it with a bolt gun. Thrown around: The abattoir worker picks up the sheep and slams it on to its back on the blood-soaked ground before stamping on it . The animal staggers around a pen before two of the men use all their weight to pin it to the wall while one takes another shot, finally ending the pig's torture. Other scenes show cows continuing to moo and writhe around as they are hung up by one leg – even after their throats have been cut. An investigator from Hillside Animal Sanctuary in Norwich, which carried out the probe, said: 'We received a tip-off saying that things weren't right at this slaughterhouse so decided to start setting up hidden cameras last August. 'The way the pigs and sheep were treated was really barbaric. The way they were getting kicked like that was monstrous and shows absolutely no respect for the animals.' Last week, a halal abattoir worker was sacked and three others suspended after being filmed breaking strict rules on sheep slaughter. Investigation: Animal welfare campaigners set up hidden cameras at the 112-year-old S Bagshaw and Sons butchers in Butterton, Staffordshire after receiving a tip-off . Cruel: Three men were secretly filmed slamming a metal gate against a black pig which they had already shot with a bolt gun . Torment: The men use all their weight to squash the animal against the wall while still alive and struggling . Slaughtermen at the Bowood Lamb abattoir were recorded by animal welfare campaigners 'hacking and sawing' at animals' throats in apparent contravention of Islamic practice. The RSPCA slammed the 'shocking' footage amid renewed calls to ban halal slaughter, which is opposed by the British Veterinary Association. The RSPCA has now launched a probe into the most recent footage at S. Bagshaw and Sons after being handed the footage. Abattoir manager Antony Bagshaw told The Sunday Mirror he was in the wrong and expected to have his licence suspended. The Hillside investigator said: 'The men seemed to be deriving great pleasure from killing the pig. We have some of the best animal welfare laws in the world in this country but they are hardly ever upheld. The authorities need to do more.' Aware of surroundings: Animal welfare officers believe this cow showed signs that it was not properly stunned as it reacted to what was happening around it even after having its throat cut . Distressing: The investigators set up hidden camera after getting a tip-off that animals were being mistreated in the Staffordshire butcher's abattoir . Shocking undercover footage of workers 'hacking and sawing' at animals' throats caused outrage last week. The secret filming by Animal Aid took place in December at the Bowood Lamb abattoir near Thirsk, North Yorkshire, where sheep did not appear to be killed according to Islamic law. One worker has been sacked and three others suspended pending a Food Standards Agency investigation that could lead to prosecutions. Campaigners are now calling for CCTV cameras to be installed in all abattoirs to prevent similar cruelty . The controversy has fuelled concerns that similar abuse could be going on across the country. All abattoirs must be approved by the FSA, but the regulatory body does not check whether halal meat is prepared according to religious rules. Many certify themselves as adhering to halal standards or are accredited by unofficial halal organisations. Halal rules state that animals must be killed with a single sweep of a surgically-sharp knife through the jugular vein, carotid artery and windpipe while a Muslim recites a prayer. They should not see the knife or witness the death of other animals. But the Animal Aid video shows many of these practices being flouted. Its secretly installed spy cameras showed staff laughing as a sheep bled to death after a worker allegedly drew spectacles around its eyes in green paint. They were filmed taunting animals, waving knives in front of them, smacking them on the head and shouting at them. The law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering, but there are exemptions for Jewish and Muslim producers.

"Australia's hottest property market looks set to continue to boom after a cut in mortgage interest rates on Tuesday saw the auction clearance rate jump to 82 per cent in Sydney this weekend. The cut, which means potential savings of $60 a month on a $400,000 mortgage, has also sent prices soaring with buyers having more cash in their budget to use for bidding at auction. In Sydney 82 per cent of the 256 properties listed for auction on Saturday sold under the hammer on that same day, the Domain Group reported. On the same weekend last year the clearance rate was just 78 per cent. Scroll down for video . This late 1800's Victorian semi is up for auction in Balmain, Sydney, with a price guide over $1,200,000 . Steven Duong, of Ray White Lidcombe, told Daily Mail Australia that he has seen a surge of interest since the mortgage rate cuts. 'There are a lot more buyers and new buyers compared to last year and people are willing to spend a little bit more than when I spoke to them previously last year.' He said the hottest areas for investors right now are in Sydney's west in areas like Penrith and Blacktown. Mr Duong told Sydney Morning Herald that the rate cut probably added about $150,000 to the price of one house he sold in Lidcombe, Western Sydney. ‘The interest rate played a big part, otherwise we would only have achieved $1.3 million or $1.35 million for this block,’ he said. 'We didn't expect that sort of price,' he commented. This detached three-bedroom, two-bathroom Edwardian house in Middle Park Victoria is priced $1,200,000 - $1,300,000 . In Bexley, Sydney, a spacious family home is also selling for at a price guide over $1,200,000 . Meanwhile, in Melbourne 67 per cent of the 135 listed properties were sold. The percentage of those purchased was higher than the previous week before mortgage rates were cut but similar to the same period last year. The decision by the Reserve Bank on Tuesday to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points is likely to take the typical standard variable mortgage rate down to 5.7 per cent and discounted variable rates to 4.85 per cent; the lowest cost of mortgage debt since July 1968. The lower mortgage rates appear to have added further fuel to what is already a strong housing market. Real estate data provider, CoreLogic RP Data, has warned the challenge for the Reserve Bank is to stimulate stronger economic growth without over stimulating the housing market. In North Melbourne a spacious double fronted elevated Victorian house is listed as $1,600,000 - $1,700,000 at auction . Treasurer Joe Hockey said the cut to interest rates was good news for business and households. 'This is good news for Australian families and it's good news for Australian business,' Mr Hockey said in Canberra. 'The government is working hard to take the pressure off interest rates by keeping inflation low.' Before the mortgage rates were cut, the company CoreLogic RP Data reported that for the week ending February 1, 2015, there was a clearance rate of 61.6 per cent on the 457 auctions held across the capital city market. Compare that to the same week a year ago, when the rate was recorded at 64.3 per cent, the rate was lower overall. In January there were 36,931 newly advertised properties added to the market which is 7.7 per cent fewer than at the same time one year ago. In the heart of Melbourne (left) a one bedroom property is going under the hammer at $390,000 - $430,000 and in Coogee, Syndey, (right) this one bedroom apartment is available for $645,000 .","The Reserve Bank of Australia have cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent .

"Twitter and Facebook users who persistently spread racial hatred online should be given 'internet Asbos' under proposals by MPs to tackle rising levels of anti-Semitism. They called on the Crown Prosecution Service to examine whether prevention orders similar to those which can be used to restrict sex offenders' online access could be applied to hate crimes. It would mean that 'determined' perpetrators of anti-Semitism online could be blocked from sites such as Facebook and Twitter. Scroll down for video . Twitter and Facebook users who spread racial hatred should be given 'Internet Asbos' to combat rising anti-Semitism, say MPs . The report said 'Hitler' and 'Holocaust' were among the top 35 key words used on Twitter last summer . The All Party Parliamentary Inquiry Into anti-Semitism, which was convened following an alarming rise in incidents against Jews during fighting in Gaza and Israel in July and August, said social media platforms have 'increasingly been used for the spread of anti-Semitism'. The report said 'Hitler' and 'Holocaust' were among the top 35 key words used on Twitter last summer. Highly abusive posts on the microblogging site were singled out, including the hashtag 'Hitler was right', which was trending in July, as well as the 'presence of Hitlerian themes and imagery on Facebook'. The MPs' report also called for a government fund to be established to cover the costs of security at synagogues, and for new guidance for teachers on handling the Middle East conflict in the classroom. David Cameron described the report as 'hugely important', saying: 'Tackling anti-Semitism goes right to the heart of what we stand for as a country.' 'Britain is proud to be a multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy. It is something we have built over generations and which generations have given their lives to defend. We will not weaken our resolve now but instead redouble our efforts to stand up and defend the values we believe in. 'This report has a vital role to play. There can be no excuses. No disagreements over foreign policy or politics can ever be allowed to justify antisemitism or any other form of racism, prejudice or extremism. 'While I am Prime Minister I promise we will fight antisemitism with everything we have got. Together we will make sure Britain remains a country that Jewish people are proud to call home – today, tomorrow and for every generation to come.' The warnings about social media sites in the MPs' report comes after Twitter chief executive Dick Costolo admitted they 'suck' at dealing with abuse and so-called trolling, vowing in an internal memo to 'start kicking these people off right and left'. David Cameron said the report was 'hugely important', adding that Britain must remain 'a country that Jewish people are proud to call home' The MPs said: 'There is an allowance in the law for banning or blocking individuals from certain aspects of internet communication in relation to sexual offences. 'Informal feedback we have received from policy experts indicates that this is a potential area of exploration for prosecutors in relation to hate crime. 'If it can be proven in a detailed way that someone has made a considered and determined view to exploit various online networks to harm and perpetrate hate crimes against others then the accepted principles, rules and restrictions that are relevant to sex offences must surely apply.' The report added: 'Given the scale of social media content produced on a daily let alone minute by minute basis, we have some albeit limited sympathy for the companies that are responsible for hosting it. 'Whilst there is rightly an expectation on those companies to act as there is on government, police and prosecuting authorities, so too civil society has a crucial role to play.' The panel outlined measures to tackle online abuse as it called for 'urgent action' from Government, police, prosecutors and the Jewish community to combat a 'disturbing' rise in antisemitism. Last week figures released by the Community Security Trust – a charity that monitors anti-Semitism and provides security for the Jewish community in Britain – showed there were a record number of anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK last year. Data from the Metropolitan Police supplied to the panel showed that there were 306 anti-Semitic incidents and 236 offences in London between April and November last year. The issue has come under renewed scrutiny following the Paris terror attacks in which a Jewish supermarket was targeted. Labour MP John Mann, who set up the committee, said: 'This report is a plan of action and a work programme for parliament and government. 'It is the responsibility of parliamentarians to take the leads in this fight. Whoever is in power... can be on notice that we expect it to be the basis of their work programme on tackling antI-Semitism and the new government will be held to account on its delivery.'","Panel of MPs convened after disturbing rise in hate incidents against Jews .

"Tottenham teenager Keanan Bennetts is in the unique position of playing for England AND Germany. And even Nigeria have tried to convince the 15-year-old to join them, too. Bennetts qualifies for all three nations through his German mother, Nicole, Nigerian father, Richard, and being born in Edgware, London. The exciting winger – known for his blistering pace and technique – has been turning heads with his performances for Tottenham's youth sides, which have prompted a three-way tug of war for his services. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Keanan Bennetts plays for England in 1-0 defeat to Wales . Keanan Bennetts takes on his man while playing for England against Northern Ireland earlier this month . England called up 15-year-old Bennetts after he was offered a trial with Germany . The German national team first called him for a trial earlier this year. They had spotted Bennetts playing for Spurs in youth tournaments in Germany and, when they learned of his eligibility, emailed the family to see if he was interested in a trial. Of 130 kids, Bennetts – who speaks fluent German – made it down to the final 18 and has since played in friendlies, including against Holland, for their Under 16 side. He has joined up for training camps three times. Soon after, England began to show interest in the player, keen not to be out-manoeuvred by their bitter rivals, and he has featured in their recent Victory Shield matches against Wales and Northern Ireland. 'As soon as Germany came in for him England invited him to play for them,' his father Richard told Sportsmail. 'He's the only kid to play for Germany at that level and not be at a German club. 'It's tough playing for both teams but very exciting. Keanan has a strong German background from his grandparents, he's been visiting there three times a year since he was born. 'With England he probably feels slightly more settled as he has some of his Spurs team-mates in the team as well.' Bennetts' performances for Tottenham's Under 16s and Under 17s have been attracting attention. Last month he starred in an Under 17 tournament, held at Arsenal's Hale End academy, which Spurs won. It included Real Madrid, Juventus and Arsenal. The young winger is a fluent German speaker and is also eligible to play for Nigeria through his father . Nigeria were next to come calling, with their national team manager Stephen Keshi ringing Richard to see if Bennetts would represent them. At present, Keanan's father considers Nigeria and the distances his son would have to travel as too big a commitment, but they have not ruled out representing them in the future. Richard remains in touch with Keshi. Under FIFA rules, until he wins a senior cap, he will be able to play for any nation he is eligible for. 'He doesn't have to make a final decision now,' Richard added. 'There will be no rushing. We don't want to shut any doors. He can mix and match. He'll keep playing as much as possible until he gets the feel of who values him the most.'","Spurs teen Keanan Bennetts has played at youth level for two countries .

"A former member of the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints believes he watched his daughter get kidnapped only days after her rescue from a trailer she was living in. Ron Rohbock, 63, was looking on at a store parking lot in Mesquite, Nevada, when a white truck registered to a member of the polygamous cult, known as the FLDS, drove up and stopped. He saw his daughter, 17-year-old Sherilyn, get pulled inside the vehicle. Scroll down for video . Ron Rohbock (left) with daughter Sherilyn (center and far right) and wife Geri (middle right). Rohbock was kicked out of the FDLS in 2002 and thinks Sherilyn was kidnapped by his ex-wife Rachel Jeffs . Warren Jeffs (center) in court after he was arrested by a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper. Jeffs was wanted on charges linked to allegations of arranging marriages between men and underage girls . Pictured in 2004, this is a compound built by FLDS leader Jeffs in Utah. He was sentenced to life in jail for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered his wives and is imprisoned in Texas . Rohbock believes the teen was kidnapped, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. He said: 'You could see it in her face. 'You could see it in her eyes as she was pulled into the truck.' Only five days before the alleged street snatch, Sherilyn was rescued from a trailer she had been living in since July. Ron Rohbock and wife Geri at their home in Hildale, Utah. Rohbock wants his daughter Sherilyn back . The girl had been placed in the trailer by a 'priesthood caretaker' and was only allowed to leave to go to a nearby house to bathe and wash laundry. Sherilyn was supposed to be living with her mother, Rahcel Jeffs, but had not been with the woman for at least two years. Even though the girl refused to provide any information about her mother's whereabouts, it was determined that Mrs Jeffs had been living in Pringle, South Dakota at an FLDS compound. Rohbock and his wife Geri had Sherilyn with them until she was grabbed in the parking lot. After Sherilyn was taken in Nevada, her worried father alerted the sheriff's office in Utah's Washington County and a kidnapping investigation began. As part of the search for Sherilyn, a detective looked into whether marshals in the collective FLDS towns of Short Creek in Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona helped cult members find Sherilyn. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents located the girl with her mother. Sherilyn reportedly told agents she wanted to stay with the woman. Mrs Jeffs is the sister of incarcerated FLDS leader Warren Jeffs. He was sentenced to life in jail for sexually assaulting underage girls he considered his wives and is imprisoned in Texas. It is believed Mr Jeffs is still heading the cult by communicating via letters and phone calls from behind bars. An attorney representing Mrs Jeffs, Jim Bradshaw, said: 'The FBI acted responsibly and appropriately, did an investigation and determined this child was in a safe environment.' He declined to comment about his client's location but has confirmed she was in the truck that Sherilyn got into in October. Jeffs was found guilty on two counts of rape as an accomplice for allegedly coercing the marriage and rape of a 14-year-old follower to her 19-year-old cousin in 2001 . The FLDS, which has at least 10,000 members, is a radical offshoot of mainstream Mormonism and believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven. They see Jeffs as God's spokesman on earth. The church's traditional headquarters is along the Utah-Arizona border, but it established a Texas compound in 2004. Police raided the group's remote West Texas ranch in April 2008, finding women dressed in frontier-style dresses and hairdos from the 19th century as well as seeing underage girls who were clearly pregnant. More than 400 children were eventually returned to their families. Rohbock was kicked out of the FLDS in 2002 and filed for bankruptcy as well as contemplated suicide after his dismissal. Despite all the bad memories, the contractor now lives with Geri in Hildale. He said: 'I continually blamed myself and thought I was going to go to hell because they tell you that's exactly what's going to happen. 'But I can tell you: This is hell. It can't get worse this. If this is heaven, you don't want anything to do with it.' FBI agents have told Rohbock that Sherilyn and three more of his children with Mrs Jeffs - two girls and one boy - are probably in Mexico. Sherilyn is the oldest. Rohbock has never filed a custody petition for any of the four children.","Ron Rohbock, 63, says daughter was taken from a parking lot in Nevada .

"Gatwick Airport has launched an urgent investigation after a man passed through to the departure lounge without a ticket. The man, believed to be a Turkish national, managed to pass through the security area and reach the departure lounge at around 8.20am this morning, despite not having a boarding pass. The incident comes less than a week after it was revealed that security checks were being enhanced at airports with uncharged electronic devices being refused access. Security breach: A man got airside at Gatwick Airport this morning despite not having a boarding pass . It is believed that the man was not intending to travel, but wanted to see his family off. They passed through a buggy lane – but security staff failed to tally the number of boarding passes with the number of people coming through. They then passed successfully through the airport’s scanning procedures and into the departure lounge. Shopped: A retail unit asked the man for his boarding pass and alerted security teams when he failed to produce one . Airport security staff were alerted to the breach by a retail unit, which as a matter of course had asked the man for a boarding pass when he tried to make a purchase. One source told The Surrey Mirror: ‘A Turkish man managed to walk straight through customs to departures - and he had no tickets. He managed to get airside. ‘It’s a huge breach of security but staff have been told not to talk about it and not to tell anyone. I think it’s appalling. ‘How did he get through? He was with his wife and came through the buggy and family track. Security are playing it down and saying it’s no big deal but it is.’ A Gatwick Airport spokesperson said: ‘Earlier this morning a gentleman accompanying his family through the airport was incorrectly allowed access to the departure lounge without having a boarding pass. ‘The incident is being investigated but all individuals correctly passed through the series of full security search and screen processes.’ The electronic device checks introduced by the Department for Transport last week will not affect all UK passengers. Although they have refused to make public the routes affected, ministers have provided a list of flights they consider require additional security checks. It is understood this includes flights to and from the Middle East, Africa and parts of southern Europe. If your flight is hit by additional security checks, it is unlikely you will know much about until you reach the boarding gate. Arriving at the airport, passengers will check-in their hold luggage and pass through body and bag scanners into the departure lounge in the usual way. This will include ensuring all electronic devices being taken on board the flight - such as cameras and laptops - are packed away inside hand luggage bags. Passengers are likely to expect extra checks if they are called to the departure gate earlier than usual. This is to allow for the extra time it takes security staff to check every electronic device is working properly. The Department for Transport says all passengers arriving or leaving the UK must prepare for the special measures. The teams working on the checks will have been hired by the airlines themselves, not by the airport, but the Department for Transport has insisted all will be fully qualified security staff. If, for whatever reason, your device fails the security check, you will be forced to leave your device behind, and may even be banned from taking the flight itself.","Gatwick Airport has launched an urgent investigation into a security breach .

"A veteran jockey with a track record of cheating accusations was photographed with what officials say was an electric device during a win in Texas, though he claims 'someone was trying to frame him.' Roman Chapa, 43, of Big Spring has been charged with unlawful influence on racing after being allegedly caught in the act of using the device in a photo taken near the finish line. The jockey was running in fifth place in the $50,000 Richard King Stakes at Sam Houston Race Park on January 17 when his mount, Quiet Acceleration, pressed to the front of the pack and won by half a length. Scroll down for video . Photo finish: The photo (magnified to show detail) shot by Jack Coady, shows what officials say is jockey Roman Chapa, 43, using a banned device in a Texas race . Shocking: The device, which officials say is similar to the one pictured, is designed to deliver a shock to the horse in order to cause it to accelerate . Track photographer Jack Coady snapped a photo of Chapa just before the finish of the $50,000 race, which Quiet Acceleration had entered at 10-to-1 odds. According to the Paulick Report, the photo accompanied a write-up on the track's website about the day's races. The day after the race, according to a probable cause complaint, Chapa contacted Coady, telling him to take the photo down from the website because 'it was a bad picture.' After being confronted by Texas Department of Public Safety investigator Jeff Green, Chapa first denied having seen the photo, then claimed it was 'photo-shopped and someone was trying to frame him,' the complaint stated. Two days after the race, Texas Racing Commission stewards suspended Chapa, pending an investigation and hearing. ESPN reports that Chapa faces a felony charge and that a warrant was issued for his arrest on Tuesday, but authorities have so far been unable to locate him. Video from PETA .

Chapa was sanctioned by Texas officials in 1994 for using a nail to spur his horse, Silver Sixes, at a qualifying race at the Gillespie County Fair. He was suspended from racing for nine months and fined $2,500, though at the time he was still an apprentice. New Mexico racing officials suspended him for five years after he was reportedly caught using an electrical device back in 2007. Training ground: The horse's trainer is Dan Pish, who is based at these stables on the outskirts of San Antonio, Texas . Chapa was also suspected of using a prohibited device after a Peta investigation in 2014 caught assistant trainer Scott Blasi on tape talking about the jockey using an electric buzzer. 'That silly-a-- Roman Chapa put it in his mouth in New Mexico,' Blasi was heard saying to jockey Gary Stevens and trainer D. Wayne Lukas. 'They came in to shake him down, he stuck it in his mouth, then he spit it out in his wash bucket,' Blasi added. Chapa also received a sentence of 10 days in 2002 for a plea deal on cruelty to animals charges, after police said Chapa 'torture[d] an animal, namely a dog, by beating it with a strap'. Quiet Acceleration, a bay, was born in 2009 and is trained by its owner, Dan Pish,  at his stables just outside San Antonio, Texas.","Roman Chapa, 43, of Big Spring, Texas, was photographed with what officials say is a prohibited electric device used to shock the horse .

"The elderly man was pushed into the garishly lit room. In front of him, a smartly dressed man in a frock coat held out his hand. Instinctively, the elderly man shook it, briefly noting the absurdity of formally greeting his executioner. However, his attention was distracted by the sight of a long black table in the centre of the room, attached to which were buckles and straps. And, rising above the table, hanging menacingly high, was a huge silvery-black blade. Within a few moments, the condemned man was bound face-down on the table and a steel rod was pressed on to his back. With his face looking into a basket, his nostrils detected the smell of dried blood over the stench of disinfectant and sawdust. Grim discover: The Nazi guillotine which was used to kill thousands of people during the Third Reich . This, he knew, was the very minute of  his death. But the man had other plans. Thanks to a glass vial of cyanide hidden in his mouth, he would cheat the guillotine and take his own life. The Nazis may have sentenced him to death — but he would control his final moment. Above him, the executioner whispered: ‘Now!’ The man bit down on the capsule, but as he did so, he could hear the rushing sound of the blade falling. For an agonising split second, he knew that he had left it too late: the blade would claim him before the poison. As his head landed in the basket, his decapitated torso convulsed, pushing itself up  against the straps. For a few moments, the executioner’s assistants held it down. Then, everything was still. This gruesome scene comes from a classic 1947 novel by Hans Fallada called Alone In Berlin. Though fictional, it is based on the tragic true story of Otto and Elise Hampel, a working-class couple who were guillotined in Berlin’s notorious Plotzensee Prison in 1943 for distributing anonymous postcards denouncing the regime. Victim: Sophie Scholl, student at Munich University and a member of The White Rose, an anti-Nazi resistance movement, was found guilty for treason on April 22 1943 and executed by guillotine on the same day . Today, we associate the guillotine with the brutality of the French Revolution, when 16,549 men and women were executed by the device. However, the Nazis were equally devoted to it.  They are thought to have beheaded almost as many victims as the French Reign of Terror during their 12 horrific years in power. The Nazis’ use of the guillotine came disturbingly to light again over the weekend, when the guillotine used to chop off the head of one of the regime’s youngest and bravest opponents was re-discovered in the basement of the Bavarian National Museum in Munich. Experts have concluded that the guillotine, which has been hidden in a store room for decades, was responsible for the beheading of the 21-year-old Sophie Scholl on February 22, 1943. Her ‘crime’ was to have been a leading member of the White Rose movement, which had peacefully resisted the regime by writing anti-Nazi leaflets and distributing them around university students in Munich. Sophie was the first of her fellow conspirators to be led to her death, which took place within just three hours of being found guilty by the rabidly Nazi judge, Roland Freisler, in his People’s Court, notorious for its kangaroo trials. Sibling: Hans Scholl, Sophie's brother, also a member of the White Rose, and was beheaded in February 1943 . At 5pm that day, she was led from the cell she shared with her brother Hans and their friend Christoph Probst, also members of the White Rose movement. According to one account, Sophie walked proudly across the yard to a small building, which contained the guillotine. Before being strapped down, Sophie is said to have uttered these, her last words: ‘How can we expect righteousness to prevail when there is hardly anyone willing to give himself up individually to a righteous cause? Such a fine sunny day, and I have to go, but what does my death matter, if through us, thousands of people are awakened and stirred to action?’ Within seconds, the young woman’s head lay in a bloodied basket. She was just one of the 3,009 people despatched by Nazi Germany’s leading executioner, Johann Reichhart, who was later to claim that Sophie was the bravest person he had killed. Within the hour, Reichhart had also beheaded Hans Scholl and Christoph Probst. Hans is reputed to have shouted ‘Long live freedom!’ as he was marched across the prison yard. Soldiers: Hans Scholl (right), pictured with Alexander Schmorell (left), a fellow resistance fighter who was executed in the summer of 1943 . It is often forgotten that, when the Nazis took office, they were  initially cautious about using the death penalty. Their grip on power was not as firm as it would come to be and they were aware that public opinion might turn against them if they executed too many of their own citizens. At Plotzensee Prison, for example, where the execution described in Hans Fallada’s novel takes place, only 45 people were put to death from 1933 to 1936 — a figure that would be dwarfed in years to come. In those early years of the Nazi regime, Hitler was concerned by the idea that, across Germany, methods of judicial execution varied. There was the guillotine, but also hanging, shooting, and perhaps most medieval of all, the axe. Hitler therefore established a commission to standardise the way in which he would put supposedly miscreant citizens to death. At first, the Fuhrer was reluctant to use the guillotine, as it carried with it the alarmist image of the French Reign of Terror. He preferred to remove people to the concentration camps. ‘At least we have not set up a  guillotine,’ Hitler said in a news-paper interview at the end of 1933. ‘Even the worst elements have only needed to have been separated from the nation.’ However, in October 1936, acting on the advice of his justice minister, Franz Gurtner, Hitler decided that the guillotine should be Nazi Germany’s preferred method of execution. Twenty guillotines were secretly ordered — and distributed to prisons across the Reich. Last act of defiance: Hans (left), pictured with his brother Werner, is believed to have shouted 'Long live freedom' before he was killed . Over the following eight-and-a-half years, some 16,500 souls were killed with the device. Though it was talked of as a supposedly painless way to die, there is anecdotal evidence that the brain still functions within the severed head for at least 90  seconds after the blow. Nevertheless, one Nazi doctor was to claim absurdly that a trip to the ‘dentist was worse than the guillotine’, because the severance of any nerve endings in the beheading meant the brain would not feel any pain. Those who were killed came from all walks of life — and all age groups. The youngest to be beheaded was Helmuth Hubener, who was just 17 when he was guillotined for distributing anti-war leaflets around Hamburg. After he had been sentenced to death, Helmuth said to the judges: ‘Now I must die, even though I have committed no crime. So now it’s my turn, but your turn will come.’ The sentencing of a child to death appalled many. Even members of the Gestapo appealed for  clemency. However, at 8.13 on the evening of October 27, 1942, Helmuth was beheaded. For executioners such as Sophie Scholl’s killer Johann Reichhart, the Nazi boom in the use of the guillotine made them wealthy. Those who dropped the blade  were paid 3,000 Reichsmarks per year — and received a 65  Reichsmark bonus per  execution. Reichhart made enough to buy a villa in an affluent  Munich suburb. Fallen: Willi Graf, another member of the anti-nazi resistance movement, was found guilty for treason and executed by guillotine in 1943. Cruelly, the Nazis even charged the families of those they had imprisoned and beheaded. For every day that a prisoner was held, a fee of 1.50 Reichsmarks was charged. The executions cost 300 Reichsmarks. Even the 12 pfennig cost of posting the invoice was demanded back by the Nazi state. On October 12, 1943, another member of the White Rose sat in his prison cell waiting for the guillotine. His name was Willi Graf, and he had acted as a recruiter for the group. He wrote to his family that morning. ‘On this day I’m leaving this life and entering eternity,’ he wrote. ‘What hurts me most of all is that I am causing such pain to those of you who go on living.’ They had no idea that Willi had been beheaded and found out the truth only when a letter they sent to him was returned, stamped with the bald word ‘Deceased’. His own letter reached the Graf family a few days later. It is likely that Willi met his fate on the same guillotine as Sophie Scholl. In fact, several hundred — perhaps more than 1,000 — died on this piece of macabre machinery. Today, the Germans are divided as to what to do with the instrument of death and misery unearthed from the Munich museum’s basement. Some think the guillotine should form the centrepiece of a new exhibition about those who resisted the Nazis. Franz Josef Muller, on the other hand, the last surviving member of the White Rose, feels that it should stay locked away. ‘No, this should not go on display,’ the 89-year-old Muller says. ‘No entertainment must be made of their violent deaths. The memory of Sophie and Hans is deep within me. I think of them every day.’","We associate the guillotine with the brutality of the French Revolution .

"A veteran jockey from Texas is facing felony charges after being accused of cheating during a race by using an outlawed electrical device to 'buzz' the animal and make it run faster. A criminal investigation was launched after a photograph of Roman Eric Chapa, 43, taken near the finish line at Sam Houston Race Park on January 17, was widely circulated through the racing community. Chapa won the $50,000 race while riding Quiet Acceleration but he has now been charged with unlawful influence on racing. He appeared in court before a judge at the Harris County Criminal Justice Center Friday morning. Scroll down for video... Cheat? Roman Eric Chapa, 43, is charged with unlawful influence on racing. He went before a Houston judge. An investigation was launched after a photo allegedly shows Chapa holding an electrical shocking device . Caught? Race Park officials said the photograph was snapped by a man contracted to take photos of the races for promotional purposes . Photo finish: The photo (magnified to show detail) shot by Jack Coady, shows what officials say is jockey Roman Chapa, 43, using a banned device -  a small beige object in Chapa's left hand . Court records say the device seen in Chapa's hand delivers an electrical shock to the horse. Suspicions were only aroused when the photographer told them Chapa asked for the photograph to be removed from a website but did not give him a specific reason as to why, only that 'it was a bad picture.' Chapa denies using the device during the race and claimed the picture was photoshopped because 'someone was trying to frame him.' Sam Houston Race Park President Andrea Young released a statement: 'We are pleased to see the swiftness with which the Texas Racing Commission, Texas Department of Public Safety and the Harris County District Attorney's office have moved in their investigation of Mr. Chapa's January 17th mount at Sam Houston Race Park. These sorts of actions have no place in our sport, and are a disservice to the tens of thousands of people involved in our sport who play by the rules every day. We will continue to support this investigation in every way possible.' The owner of the horse said he was shaken and upset by allegations his animal was 'buzzed' with the device. Mr Pish insisted he had never seen anyone using a similar device in his three decades in the sport and was appalled to learn it appeared to have been used on his six-year-old horse. The married father-of-one who runs a racing stable in rural Cibolo, just outside San Antonio, Texas, told Daily Mail Online: 'This has been really painful to me and my family. Shocking: The device, which officials say is similar to the one pictured, is designed to deliver a shock to the horse in order to cause it to accelerate . Upset: Trainer Danny Pish (right) said that he was shaken by the claims of abusing the horse he has raised since birth but added: 'We are in a country where it's innocent until proven guilty.' 'I'm the breeder, I've raised this horse and have had him his whole life. 'If this was used on him - and we are in a country where it's innocent until proven guilty - then it would be very upsetting to me.' Roman Chapa, 43, of Big Spring has been charged with unlawful influence on racing after being allegedly caught in the act of using the device in a photo taken near the finish line. The jockey was running in fifth place in the $50,000 Richard King Stakes at Sam Houston Race Park on January 17 when his mount, Quiet Acceleration, pressed to the front of the pack and won by half a length. Track photographer Jack Coady snapped a photo of Chapa just before the finish of the $50,000 race, which Quiet Acceleration had entered at 10-to-1 odds. According to the Paulick Report, the photo accompanied a write-up on the track's website about the day's races. The day after the race, according to a probable cause complaint, Chapa contacted Coady, telling him to take the photo down from the website because 'it was a bad picture.' After being confronted by Texas Department of Public Safety investigator Jeff Green, Chapa first denied having seen the photo, then claimed it was 'photo-shopped and someone was trying to frame him,' the complaint stated. Two days after the race, Texas Racing Commission stewards suspended Chapa, pending an investigation and hearing. Chapa faces a felony charge and that a warrant was issued for his arrest on Tuesday, but authorities have so far been unable to locate him. There does not appear to be a direct precedent for prosecution of a jockey over use of such a device. The horse has earned career winnings of $200,000 Mr Pish said. Mr Pish is a trainer, but has also bred some horses for racing, including Quiet Acceleration. 'He's done well in the past. Of the limited number of horses I've raised as a breeder, he's the best one,' Mr Pish said. 'He's had nine lifetime victories, ten if you include the race in question. 'I don't know how this device works because I know nothing about it. I know they are commonly used in dog training but they are not legal in horse training. 'It's illegal and I would never condone any illegal activity. 'I had no idea about any of this until the photo came out. I felt total disbelief, I just can't believe it's true. Video from PETA .

In action: Roman Chapa on Quiet Acceleration during the race at Sam Houston Race Park which ended in victory - but which he appeared to have won after using a device to shock the six-year-old . Big win: Quiet Acceleration had entered the $50,000 race at odds of 10-to-1 . Victory salute: Roman Chapa celebrates victory on Quiet Acceleration but is now facing a felony charge over the use of an electric shock device . 'I've checked him out. His health seems to be good and I don't see any after-effects.' Chapa, 43, is one of a number of jockeys who have ridden Quiet Acceleration to victory, helping the mount amass winnings in excess of $200,000. Mr Pish said: 'Jockeys are free agents. They jump from horse to horse. 'They have an agent and I let him know about possible races and that I'm interested in a jockey. 'I have limited control other than giving suggestions as to how the horse may be ridden. 'Mr Chapa has ridden the horse in the past and he's won on him before. I was aware of his one prior conviction but I never dreamed he would do something like this. 'This sort of thing is not seen as acceptable within horse racing. If he's found guilty he should be punished.' Training ground: The horse's trainer is Dan Pish, who is based at these stables just outside San Antonio, Texas . In addition to the felony charge, Chapa faces the probability that the Texas Racing Commission will take way his license to race. He has a checkered history as a jockey and has been suspended twice before for buzzing horses.

'They came in to shake him down, he stuck it in his mouth, then he spit it out in his wash bucket,' Blasi added.

"Snow is clobbering New England for the third Monday in a row - threatening to cover Boston with up to two feet by the end of the day and leaving city officials at a loss over where to put it all. Nearly five feet of snow has been dumped on Boston in just over two weeks and plows have removed enough to fill 90 football stadiums, according to Governor Charlie Baker. The city has already drained its $18 million snow removal budget and it's now struggling to keep up with the newest batch. 'Quite honestly we're running out of space where to put all the snow that we have in the city of Boston,' Mayor Marty Walsh said on Sunday. The four-day storm that has sat over the region is set to intensify today - making for a hellish morning commute, canceling school across Boston through Tuesday and scuppering hundreds of flights. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for central New York, the western Catskills and much of New England as the region gears up for yet another wintry week. Scroll down for video .

Wintry weather: Much of the north will be covered with clouds on Monday but only New England will see snow . Some areas of Massachusetts had about a foot of snow before dawn on Monday, and the storm was expected to last all day Monday. The weather service reported an unofficial measurement of almost 14 inches in Norwell as of 5 a.m. Monday. Fitchburg, Leominster, Lunenburg and Ashby in north-central Massachusetts were all at 11 inches or more. Boston, already reeling from record snowfalls, could get two feet more, while more than eight could also fall on Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island and parts of upstate New York. Logan airport in Boston canceled 60 per cent of all flights Monday. Just before noon on Monday, more than 1,800 fights had been canceled across the country - with those heading to Logan most affected. A total of 280 flights leaving Logan on Monday were canceled, while 334 incoming flights were also scrapped - with many more delayed, according to FlightStats. It received almost eight inches of fresh snow Sunday and nearly four inches of snow fell on the airport between midnight and 7am on Monday - totaling more than a foot since Saturday. In New York, accumulations of six to eight inches were predicted in northern New York, five to 10 inches in the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes, and four to eight inches in western New York. Buffalo was expected to get two to six inches. 'I'm frustrated. The last thing I want to be talking about is another 24 inches of snow. I want to move on to something else,' Mayor Walsh said at City Hall on Sunday. 'It's unprecedented. ... Maybe up in Alaska or Buffalo, they have this amount of snow and they're used to it.'

Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker ordered non-emergency state employees to stay home and most public schools are closed. The Weather Channel predicted that a light accumulation of snow could amass over Monday night. Driving delays were predicted from New England to the east of Pennsylvania, with I-95, I-84, I-90, I-91 and I-81 highways are those expected to be hit hardest. The Massachusetts Turnpike was reduced to 40 mph along the entire length of the highway, and in New Hampshire, speeds were reduced to 45 mph on the highways. Some 36 million people in the region are under a government winter weather advisory, with a more significant winter storm warning for the majority of New Englanders. The storm is expected to sit over Massachusetts for most of tomorrow, then move north into Maine and leave the region by Tuesday evening. Schools will be closed across Boston on Monday and Tuesday in anticipation of the coming downfall, and a parking ban is currently in effect. In addition, court closings Monday meant another weather-related delay in jury selection in the Boston Marathon bombing trial and in the murder trial in Fall River of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez.

'I have to laugh because otherwise I may cry,' she said. In New Hampshire, the steady run of winter blasts has already sucked up over 70 percent of the Department of Transportation winter maintenance budget. The small college town of Henniker, which lost its fleet of plows in a fire Jan. 30, was using plows on loan from the state. DOT spokesman Bill Boynton said the three back-up trucks would probably remain with the town throughout the winter. While the snow is welcome at New England ski resorts, it's a headache for some businesses. 'I normally have 15 to 20 dogs for day care but that's down to half a dozen; people can't get here,' said Bruce Billings, owner of Canine College and Bow Wow Resort, a dog training, day care and boarding center in Holbrook, Massachusetts, 10 miles south of Boston. Billings said he's trying to clear outdoor play areas with a snow blower because only the biggest dogs can frolic through snow that's 2 to 3 feet deep. Boston's transit system, the nation's oldest, has been particularly hard hit. The buildup of snow and ice on trolley tracks combined with aging equipment has stalled trains in recent days, delaying and angering commuters. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority general manager Beverly Scott said Saturday that crews were doing everything they could, including deploying massive jet-powered snow blowers, to clear tracks before the next storm. Governor Charlie Baker acknowledged on Friday that the MBTA was handed an extraordinary situation with old equipment but said the system's overall performance was unacceptable. What forecasters are calling a 'long duration' storm is expected to become more intense on Sunday . In many New England communities, the obvious problem is where to put the next batch of snow. In Revere, just outside Boston, schoolteacher Ingrid Samuel said there were 'mountains of snow' and the streets 'can't take another hit of snow on top of what's here.' 'There's a bunch of snow everywhere, and there's no more place to put it,' said Samuel, who lost a week of work after the last snowstorm canceled classes. 'There are no sidewalks left in Revere. My whole yard is covered with snow. Where will it end?' David Lombari, public works director for West Warwick, Rhode Island, told the Providence Journal his town was already clogged with snow piles several feet high and school buses were parked in the usual snow storage lot. 'I don't know what we're going to do yet,' Lombari said. 'It's tough trying to find a place that meets all the proper (environmental) criteria.' State snow disposal guidelines require that communities use locations that won't harm environmental resources and have barriers that prevent contaminants from seeping into groundwater when the snow melts.","Snow is falling in Boston for the third week in a row as a four-day storm intensifies today through Tuesday .
Two more feet of snow are expected in Boston, while upstate New York, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont could get as many as eight inches .
More than 1,800 flights have been canceled across the country with Boston's Logan airport most affected .
Schools were closed in Boston and most non-emergency state employees were ordered to stay home .
Boston has already drained its $18 million snow removal budget and snowplows are battling to clear the newest snowfall while still tackling snow from two previous storms .

"New questions have arisen in the Deflategate scandal as it is now being reported that all 24 of the Patriots footballs were tested prior to the game under standard NFL practices, and all 24 passed inspection. What's more, Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson, assumed by many to have put the events in motion which led to the current NFL investigation of the New England Patriots, has denied stating that a ball he intercepted from Tom Brady during Sunday's AFC Championship game felt underinflated. Speaking to the press following a Pro Bowl practice on Thursday, Jackson said; 'I'm a linebacker, I'm a defensive guy. If anybody recognized anything it definitely wouldn't come from me.' This as many are calling on the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell to make a statement about just what caused 11 of the team's 12 balls to have less air pressure than is required by league rules. Scroll down for video . Indianapolis Colts linebeacker D'Qwell Jackson (above) has denied having anything to do with Deflategate, saying a ball he intercepted from Patriots quarterback Tom Brady on Sunday did not feel underinflated . 'I'm a linebacker, I'm a defensive guy. If anybody recognized anything it definitely wouldn't come from me,' said Jackson of intercepting Brady (above) Meanwhile, many are wondering when the NFL and commissioner Roger Goodell (above) will offer an explanation as to what happened to make 11 of the team's 12 balls underinflated . 'According to an NFL source with direct knowledge of the situation, referee Walt Anderson inspected all 24 of the Patriots’ footballs with a pressure gauge supplied by the league, as well as all 24 footballs from the Colts' reports The Boston Globe. 'All 48 footballs were found to be within the allowable range of 12.5-13.5 pounds per square inch.' Furthermore, when officials decided to swap out the 12 balls at the half, they grabbed the other 12 that had previously been tested, and were properly inflated. As for why Jackson, and why he tossed the football he intercepted to a member of the Colts' equipment staff after he picked off Brady, he claims he just wanted a 'souvenir,' and that anything that happened after that is 'beyond' him. 'I don't know how it got to this point,' he said. 'Somehow I'm in the middle of it.' He even went so far as to say he thought the entire thing was 'comical' when he first heard about it on Monday. Jackson also addressed rumors that the Colts organization had noticed that the Patriots were playing with underinflated balls earlier this year during a regular season game in November, saying that no one on the coaching staff told the players to look out for anything on Sunday and that they were all just focused on the game. His fellow teammate and Pro Bowler, safety Mike Adams, also seemed eager to downplay the Deflategate scandal on Thursday, telling reporters; 'I'm not going to even touch that subject.' Others however, especially former players, are calling for the NFL and Goodell to come down hard on the Patriots, specifically Brady, with many former players saying there is no possible way the quarterback had nothing to do with the team's underinflated balls on Sunday. Some are also none too happy the Goodell (center) spent Sunday before the game with his good friend, Patriots owner Robert Kraft (second from right) Brady shocked many at a press conference on Thursday (above) when he said the NFL had yet to even speak to him about the underinflated balls . At a press conference Thursday afternoon Brady told reporters; 'I would never do anything outside of the rules of play.' He then added of his pregame ritual; ' When I pick those footballs out, at that point, to me, they're perfect. I don't want anyone touching my balls after that. I don't want anyone rubbing them, you know, putting any air in them, taking any air out. To me, those balls are perfect and that's what I expect when I show up on the field.' Not buying that is former Dallas Cowboys star Troy Aikman, who, like Brady, has three Super Bowl rings, and who told a Dallas radio show; 'It's obvious that Tom Brady had something to do with this.' This sentiment, expressed by many, makes Brady's statement yesterday the neither the NFL or Goodell has sat down with him to talk about what happened even more shocking. Not helping matters either is the fact that Goodell spent the hours before Sunday's game enjoying some time with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, a longtime pal. Some are saying that Brady should be benched and replaced by backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo (above in 10 behind Brady) for next Sunday's start . Even Patriots fans have reached their breaking point with the team, with the Boston Globe saying if the team truly had nothing to do with the scandal they need to come out and make it clear now. Because, as it looks now, despite the fact that Brady may get his fourth Super Bowl ring a week from Sunday, tying him with all-time greats Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw, and coach Bill Belichick may join former Pittsburgh Steelers Chuck Noll as the only other man with four Lombardi trophies,  the team has lost their claim as the greatest football dynasty of all time. 'But the most important thing - the Patriot legacy - is lost,' writes Dan Shaugnessy. 'The Patriots and their fans will never win the best ever argument. Everything is tainted. Footballs (reportedly) have been doctored, headlines have been written, and opinions have been formed.' There is however a chance that this scandal could lead to a new era in Patriots football, especially if the league decides to bench Brady and Jimmy Garoppolo steps in for next Sunday's start.","It has been revealed that the NFL tested all 24 of the Patriots pregame footballs, and they all passed inspection .

"With an election fast approaching, the Tories are eager to raise as much money as they can. But the guest list for tonight’s glittering black and white fundraising ball is likely to raise eyebrows from some traditional Conservative supporters. Sex shop queen Jacqueline Gold, her porn baron father David Gold and gentleman’ s club owner Peter Stringfellow joined the Prime Minister for the glittering event, which it was hoped would be the most lucrative dinner in modern party political history. Sexing up the election: Ann Summers boss Jacqueline Gold and her father, porn baron David Gold (left) joined gentleman's club owner Peter Stringfellow with his wife Bella Wright (right) at the Tory fundraiser . Also attending was Apprentice star Karren Brady, who worked for Mr Gold's sex-obsessed Sport Newspapers, and David Sullivan (right) who made his fortune from porn films, magazines and sex shops . Hedge-fund kings, City tycoons and captains of industry were also among the 1,100 guests paying between £500 and £1,500 a ticket for the bash at London’s Grosvenor House Hotel. They sat at tables alongside Mr Cameron, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Party Chairman Grant Shapps. The dress code for the lavish event was ‘Winter Cool’, with Mr Cameron opting for a lounge suit, rather than black tie, and his wife Samantha, wearing a knee-length cream dress. Zoe Purvis, a celebrity makeup artist, chaired the dinner's organising committee. One top table was taken by her multi-millionaire husband Andrew Law, chief executive of Caxton Associates, which uses its £4.5billion hedge fund to bet on international currency movements.

"A pensioner sentenced to 25 years jail for killing his wife battered his new lover to death just weeks after being released - so he could go back and enjoy 'three meals a day and a warm bed'. Stanislaw Chmielewski, 64, told police he had struggled to survive after being released from prison in Gdansk, a city on Poland's Baltic coast. Chmielewski then hatched a plan to return to jail and signed up with an online dating agency. He then used a hammer to beat to death the first girl they set him up with, a 25-year-old office worker. Police lead Stanislaw Chmielewski back to jail; the 64-year-old killed a woman he met through a dating agency, just weeks after being released over his wife's murder, so he could return to prison . Police spokesman Jurek Wysocki said the former inmate called authorities and said he had 'just murdered someone'. When officers arrived they found the woman lying on the kitchen floor. Chmielewski was said to have confessed to the killing which he told police he had planned to commit. Mr Wysocki said: 'His reason, he said, was that he wanted to go back to jail because he had money problems and life was easier in jail than it was living on the outside.' Chmielewski was said to have confessed to the killing and said that he had planned to do it as life was much easier in prison; the pensioner said he looked forward to returning to 'three meals a day and a warm bed' He was then taken into custody. When told he was likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, Chmielewski told officers, 'That suits me just fine'. He then added: 'Life out here is nastier and more dangerous than anything you can see in jail. I'm sorry for the girl, but I'm looking forward to three meals a day and a warm bed.'","A dating agency sent an office worker to meet Stanislaw Chmielewski .

"In the battle of the search engines Google is the undisputed king, but Apple could be aiming to take its crown. A job listing has appeared on the tech giant's official recruitment site that is advertising for an Engineering Project Manager in its Apple Search division to develop 'a search platform supporting hundreds of millions of users.' This has fuelled speculation from last year that Apple is aiming to launch a standalone search tool across iPhones, iPads and Macs. A job listing has appeared on the tech giant's official recruitment site that is advertising for an Engineering Project Manager to develop 'a search platform supporting hundreds of millions of users.' This has fuelled speculation that Apple is aiming to launch a standalone search tool across iPhones, iPads and Macs . The listing was posted on 2 February and said: 'Apple seeks a technical, driven and creative program manager to manage backend operations projects for a search platform. 'Program managers in our team focus on complex technical issues and are expected to analyse data to provide an in-depth evaluation of variable factors.' Back in 2010, analysts at Piper Jaffray claimed there was a 70 per cent chance Apple would launch its own mobile search engine by 2015. Google's deal as the default search engine on Safari (pictured) expires this year. Apple could replace it with Yahoo or Bing, or develop its own tool . In November, Apple Insider reported that a so-called web-crawling bot had been spotted on Apple's servers. This could be the start of developing its own search engine, but may also simply be used to boost its local and built-in search options. For example, OS X Yosemite's Spotlight Search tool scours the desktop, but also the web, maps and Wikipedia. The rumours were bolstered in November when reports claimed Apple was looking to ditch Google as its default search engine on its Safari browser. Google has been the default engine on Safari for the past five years, but the deal is due to expire this year. Although this could see Microsoft's Bing or Yahoo taking its place, the tech giant could also be working on developing a search engine of its own. Both Yahoo and Microsoft have already started canvassing Apple about becoming the default engine on iOS devices and Macs, according to The Information's Amir Efrati. Mr Efrati said Apple is likely to base the decision on the 'quality of the product as much as the potential money made from search ads.' Google reportedly paid Apple $82 million (£52 million) in 2009, and $1 billion (£636 million) last year for the partnership. Firefox ditched Google as its default search engine last year. From the start of December, people using the browser in the US were switched to Yahoo. Search engines make money from partnerships by sending traffic to their servers, and profiting from ad revenue. A proprietary Apple engine could be used as an extra income . As of 9 January, Apple's Safari browser is the third most used web browser in the world, behind Google's Chrome and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. It has overtaken Firefox and is now used by by 15.2% of the market . Search engines make money from such partnerships by sending traffic to their servers, and profiting from ad revenue. After a decade, Mozilla announced in November it was ending its partnership with Google as the default option for Firefox web searches. From the start of December, people using the browser in the US were switched to Yahoo. In Russia, Firefox is using local search engine Yandex, and Baidu continues to be the default search engine in China. Mozilla said the UK will remain unaffected, for the time being. Firefox is an open-source browser that was launched by California-based Mozilla in 2002. As of 9 January, it is the fourth most used web browser in the world, behind Google's Chrome, Microsoft's Internet Explorer, and Safari. Apple's Safari is used by 15.2 per cent of the market, compared to Firefox's 15.1 per cent. But Apple has been distancing itself from its rival for sometime. When it launched iOS 7, the default search engine for Siri was Microsoft's Bing, for example. Yahoo was the default weather app until Apple launched iOS 8, at which point it was replaced by the Weather Channel. Apple also replaced Google Maps with its own proprietary service, and stopped pre-installing Google-owned YouTube on devices. Within Apple Maps, local searches are made using services such as Yelp. In 2013, Re/code reported Yahoo was 'aggressively' working to increase revenue and the focus was to become the default on Apple products. Firefox signed a deal with Yahoo last year to replace Google as the default search option - although users can revert back in Settings. Five years ago, Yahoo signed a deal with Microsoft to have Bing to carry out behind-the-scenes indexing of online content. Yahoo and Microsoft agreed to split ad revenue under terms of the 10-year search deal, which let Yahoo focus on customising query results for users. Yahoo boss Marissa Mayer has repeatedly stressed that Yahoo remains devoted to the search market that the company pioneered, but which Google eventually dominated. Even if Apple does replace Google as its default engine, users are expected to be able to revert back, or select an alternative in the browser's settings.","A job listing has appeared on the tech giant's official recruitment site .

"Prediction: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve between 1987 and 2006, expects Greece to default on its debts and leave the euro . Greece will be forced to leave the eurozone, the former head of the US central bank Alan Greenspan predicted yesterday. Mr Greenspan warned that he could not see anyone willing to offer loans to the country. Athens has until the end of the month to secure around £5billion of financing to keep the Greek economy running. Failure to do so would cause the nation to default on its debts and pull out of the single currency, the former Federal Reserve chairman said. But the country’s far-Left Syriza party has vowed to ditch austerity, setting the nation on a collision course with the rest of the single currency bloc. New prime minister Alexis Tsipras has pledged to write off some of the country’s debts and renegotiate the terms of its £185billion bailout package — a deal that Germany has already said is ‘too generous’. Mr Greenspan told the BBC yesterday: ‘Greece’s position is if they don’t get additional loans they will default and leave the Euro. ‘I don’t see any people willing to put in their funds having been disappointed so often.’ He added: ‘All the cards are being held by the members of the eurozone.’ Alan Greenspan was the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, between 1987 and 2006. His dire assessment comes as George Osborne warned that Greece leaving the euro would cause ‘real ructions’ in the UK economy. The Chancellor said: ‘This stand-off between Greece and the eurozone is increasing the risk every day to the British economy. ‘Greece has worked hard to stay in the eurozone, and frankly a Greek exit from the eurozone in my view would have very serious consequences.’ The Chancellor will today  fly to Turkey for a meeting of the G20 finance ministers, with the economic crisis facing the eurozone high on the agenda. There is an EU summit later this week, and on Wednesday next week the European Central Bank will vote on whether to extend loans to Greece. Greece’s bailout is arranged by a trio of lenders, called the Troika – the European Central Bank, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Germany’s finance minister Wolfgang Schaeble last week said that the package that was already agreed was ‘generous beyond all measure,’ in a sign that Europe’s richest nation would be unwilling to give ground to Greece. Scroll down for video . Hope: Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras addressing parliament yesterday, where he announced Syriza's anti-austerity programme including free electricity for the poor and an increase in the minimum wage . Mr Tsipras, the Greek Prime Minister, was swept to power last month promising to stand up to the eurozone and usher in left wing alternatives. In spite of the parlous state of the country’s finances, his policies include free electricity for poorer citizens and hiking the minimum wage. He will meet EU leaders in a summit in Brussels on Thursday to set out his demands. But Mr Greenspan warned that Greece’s exit would be ‘miniscule’ compared to the effect of the Eurozone breaking apart – something that he thinks is inevitable. He warned that Greece could be forced out of the single currency bloc – the first country to leave. This would lead to others following, and could eventually see the Eurozone split in two, with the richer Northern nations divided from the Southern countries. He added: ‘I believe [Greece] will eventually leave. I don’t think it helps them or the rest of the eurozone, it is just a matter of time before everyone recognises that parting is the best strategy. ‘The problem is that there is no way that I can conceive of the euro of continuing, unless and until all of the members of eurozone become politically integrated - actually even just fiscally integrated won’t do it.’","Alan Greenspan says eurozone holds 'all the cards' against Greece .

"A former Australian Defence Force contractor who sent a series of  emails detailing his sexual exploits with women - including a secretly recorded video of him having sex - to other defence personnel has been sentenced to 15 months imprisonment. But the judge has asked Hastings Fredrickson be assessed for an order that would have him serve the term in the community rather than behind bars. Calling himself the 'Wolf of Woolloomooloo', the 41-year-old sent degrading emails in 2010 to colleagues who were part of an 'adolescent boy's club' called the 'Jedi council'. In one sent to four ADF email addresses, Fredrickson included images of a woman whom he had secretly filmed while having sex with her. Scroll down for video . Hastings Fredrickson (centre) sent emails to colleagues who were part of a group called the 'Jedi council' Describing her as 'Melbourne Mistress/Melbourne Mole #5', he told the group he would no longer be able to email as regularly because his wife was about to give birth. Two days later, Fredrickson sent an email titled 'interesting menu', with photographs of a female senior officer whom he expressed interest in having sex with. In sentencing him on Monday for three counts of using a carriage service to menace, Judge Peter Lakatos condemned Fredrickson's behaviour, saying it was exploitative and demeaning of women. Fredrickson, he said, had shown little remorse. The 41-year-old was sentenced on Monday for three counts of using a carriage service to menace . The court heard Fredrickson felt he was 'acutely unattractive as a child' and, following a 'severely disrupted' childhood, had joined the army at 16. He went to Afghanistan but did not see combat there and left the ADF in 2009. At the time of his offending, he was employed as a defence force contractor and was in the army reserves. The court heard Fredrickson saw these sexual exploits as 'having notches on the board' and likened anal sex to 'stealing a woman's soul'. At the time of his offending, he was employed as a defence force contractor and was in the army reserves . Fredrickson will return to court next month to determine whether he can serve his sentence via ICO .

"They are said to taste like asparagus, celery or fennel when cooked and were eaten by the Aztecs, who praised them for their taste and health benefits. And now growers - who have spent two years developing edible dahlias - say they can be substituted for any potato dish. The dahlias will be on sale from March this year and come in six varieties - Hoamatland, Black Jack, Kennedy, Sunset, Buga Munchen and Fantastic. Growers have spent two years developing the edible dahlias after taking inspiration from the Aztecs, who would eat the bulbous roots of the common garden blooms for their taste and nutritional value . They are said to taste like asparagus when cooked, while others taste similar to celery and fennel . Swiss growers Lubera are urging amateur gardeners to plant the dahlias by May so that when the flowers die out at the end of the summer they can eat what's left of the plant. The six varieties each has with its own taste. Some are said to taste like asparagus when cooked, while others taste similar to celery and fennel. They're also healthy because they're packed full of carbohydrates. The edible dahlias, called DeliDahlias cost £4.99 for a 1.3-litre pot of young flowers. Dahlias are easy to grow and will thrive in a wide range of soil types and situations. They are best planted in fertile, well-drained soil in full sun in May to early June. Planting could be carried out slightly earlier in southern counties or later in the north of England and Scotland. The trend for eating dahlias died out in the 1700s when the colourful flowers were brought to Europe and they became popular for their ornamental qualities rather than their taste. The roots of the edible dahlia (left) resemble tubers (right) and can be substituted in potato dishes . Growers advise planting the dahlias in May so that the roots can be eaten by autumn, when the flowers die . The freshly dug dahlia tubers (left) resemble carrots, potatoes and radishes when peeled and washed (right) A spokesman for Lubera said the company had spent two years working with Austrian dahlia Peter Haslhofer to develop its range of edible dahlias. He said: 'The Aztecs used the dahlia tubers as food. They knew they tasted wonderful and that they were healthy. 'When the dahlia was bought over to Europe on 1700s it became more of an ornamental flower. 'But now, more than 500 years on, we have made an attempt to renew this tradition and to select the best dahlias for eating. 'We have spent the past two years working with Austrian dahlia breeder.' He added: 'Amateur gardeners no longer need to be sad when they dig up their dahlias in autumn. Although the festival of flowers is over, the eating adventures can begin. 'If you plant should the young dahlias in May, by autumn you will be able to enjoy eating the tubers. 'They can be used as a substitute for potato in any dish - you can have them steamed, boiled, mashed, baked or roasted, and they're full of carbohydrate for energy. 'With our DeliDahlias you get two for the price of one - beautiful flowers and tasty dinners.'","Growers spent two years developing the six new varieties of dahlia .

"Fossils of bacteria found in Australia are the oldest yet discovered anywhere on Earth and predate the formation of oxygen on our planet, new research claims. The fossils found in north-west Australia's Pilbara region are thought to be nearly 3.5billion years old and caused by bacteria which existed just one billion years after the Earth formed. Now Old Dominion University's Nora Noffke, one of the researchers who worked on the project, says the discovery could help inform Mars rover Curiosity's searches for traces of life on the Red Planet. A boulder trapped in the Knox Gorge, Pilbara: Researchers examining sedimentary rocks in this region of Western Australia claim they have found the world's oldest fossils which date back 3.5billion years . She told the Washington Post the bacteria traces 'are the oldest fossils ever described. Those are our oldest ancestors.' The fossils are spider web-like imprints on the surfaces of sandstone which are thought to have been sculpted by once-living organisms interacting with sediment. In a process that still takes place in some parts of the world today, thick mats of bacteria are thought to have trapped and glued together sand particles beneath them and protected them from erosion. Sand stuck in this way gradually turned into rock with its particular texture shaped by the living organism that once covered it. The ancient rocks in Western Australia's Pilbara region are some of the oldest anywhere on earth. Once shoreline, the sedimentary rocks in the area piled up billions of years ago and are now exposed for examination. Scientists have discovered older rocks, but Professor Noffke told U.S. News that those rocks have eroded to the point traces of life are all but impossible to find. 'I can confidently say the structures we're working on cannot be found on older rocks — until now, there has been bothing that is this well preserved,' she said. 'There are some that are much older, but they experience metamorphosis - anything that's on them has been overprinted and it's difficult to reconstruct what was there.' The first dinosaur to have walked on Earth may have been found by scientists. Nyasasaurus parringtoni would have been alive 10 to 15 million years before any previously known dinosaurs - and more than 150million years before the mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex. The size of a Labrador and slight of build, Nyasasaurus had a five foot-long tail and likely walked upright on two legs. With only a few ribs and arm bones to go on, the scientists can't be sure what the world's oldest dinosaur ate. However, it is likely it had a similar diet to other early dinosaurs of small prey, insects and plants. The remains do allow for its size to be estimated. Nyasasaurus is believed to have been 6.5 to 10ft from nose to tail, with its tail accounting for half of that.Its slight build means it would have lived 'in the shadow' of other much larger reptiles alive at the time. The patterns found by Professor Noffke and her colleagues are ridges which criss-cross the rocks like strands in a spider's web, hinting that primitive bacteria linked up in sprawling networks. Like many such bacterial colonies which still exist today, they may have lived in the equivalent of microbial cities hosting different kinds of bacteria all communicating via chemical signals, the Washington Post reports. It is thought the ancient microbes fed on sulphur, as many still do today. The textures seen in the Australian rocks are similar to those already seen in 2.9billion-year-old rocks from South Africa which Professor Noffke and colleagues reported on in 2007. However, old Australian rocks have deceived researchers in the past. Rippling layers found in some from the Strelley Pool, also in Western Australia, were claimed in 1980 to be the work of bacteria, but subsequent research showed the patterns could be formed by natural non-organic processes. In an effort to corroborate their most recent findings, Professor Noffke and her colleagues measured the carbon that made up the textured rocks. They found the tell-tale signatures of 'organic' carbon-13 that usually comes from living beings. 'It’s always nice to have a number of different lines of evidence, and you definitely want to see organic carbon,' said Dr John Stolz, a geomicrobiologist at Duquesne University, Pittsburgh. The discovery could now help inform further searches for life on Mars, where such remnants of life may be even better preserved thanks to a lack of geological processes shaking things up like on Earth. Nasa's Curiosity rover is equipped with instruments able to detect similar fossils, Professor Noffke told U.S. News. 'Our structure is one of the structures the rover is looking for—if we've found sedimentary structures like that on Earth's most well-preserved rocks, could they be on rocks of similar ages on Mars?' she added.","The fossils found in north-west Australia are thought to be 3.5bn years old .
Not actual petrified remains, they are rather traces of organic processes .
Researchers claim the discovery could help the search for life on Mars ."
"Just 12 hours before John Jonchuck allegedly threw his 5-year-old daughter to her death off a Florida bridge, his own lawyer called a state child abuse hotline warning that his client was suffering from mental delusions. But according to documents released by child welfare officials Monday, the hotline operator failed to pass on the call to investigators because she didn't think the child was in danger. One week earlier, another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past. That call, however, also failed to get to DCF investigators because the operator hung up before she got John Jonchuck's address. Instead of calling back, she simply closed the case, according to the state's investigation. Scroll down for video . 'Preventable tragedy': The Florida Department of Children and Families has released a report detailing the department's failing in the case of Phoebe Jonchuck (right), 5, who, was hurled off a bridge by her father, John (left) last month . Tragic: Police say John Jonchuck pulled over on the Sunshine Skyway bridge in St Petersburg January 8, pulled Phoebe from the back seat and dropped her to her death . Simple tribute: A memorial has been set up in honor of the late Phoebe Jonchuck, 5, on the south side of the Dick Misener Bridge near the north end toll booths of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge . The lapses have cast the already troubled DCF in a harsh spotlight, prompting new Secretary Mike Carroll to change hotline protocol. Going forward, if a caregiver seems to be experiencing a psychotic episode, a child protective investigator will be required to visit within four hours. Police say Phoebe Jonchuck was likely alive when her father sped past a police officer January 8, stopped on the Sunshine Skyway bridge in St Petersburg, pulled the girl from the back seat and dropped her to her death. He was arrested and accused of first-degree murder, but hasn't formally been charged as he is undergoing mental health evaluations. Jonchuck's own divorce lawyer had warned authorities of his mental state January 7, telling the hotline operator that Jonchuck had driven to three different churches in his pajamas with Phoebe in tow and asked his attorney to translate a Bible in Swedish. Could Phoebe have been saved? A lawyer handling Jonchuck's divorce case called a state hotline a day before Phoebe's death to warn about his client's mental state, but the operator ignored the red flag because she did not think the 5-year-old (pictured left and right) was in any danger . So small: The casket of Phoebe Jonchuck is carried out after memorial services at Lake Magdalene Methodist Church in Tampa last month . Jonchuck was also expressing paranoid fears that Phoebe was not his biological daughter, his lawyer said. 'He's calling the office every five minutes and saying these religious things and saying the child might not be his, it just really concerns me,' the unidentified attorney told an operator, later adding, 'It's all craziness and it doesn't make any sense and he's out of his mind.' But the report noted the relatively inexperienced operator said the caller seemed more worried about Jonchuck's mental state, not the child's safety and labeled the call as 'inadequate supervision' and did not turn it over to investigators. The attorney even noted that DCF had an open investigation on the family, but the operator said she couldn't find the report and did not ask a supervisor, according to the state's investigation. The missing report came from a caller who alleged family violence, inadequate supervision and substance misuse at the Jonchuck home. 'We are reminded yet again that every process within our system should be critically examined at every opportunity to ensure that the role it plays is carried out effectively,' Carroll said in the report. Ignoring calls has been a problem in the past and the hotline has been undergone a multi-million dollar overhaul. Red flag: Another worried caller told the Department of Children and Families a week before the bridge drama that Jonchuck's daughter Phoebe had been physically abused in the past . In 2011, the hotline received multiple calls worrying about the safety of Nubia Barahona, a 10-year-old former foster child whose partially decomposing body was later found doused in toxic chemicals in the back of her adoptive father's pickup truck along a busy highway. A hotline caller warned the Barahona twins were being tied by their hands and feet and locked in the bathroom for days, but DCF officials never contacted the police and the hotline operator didn't flag the call as an emergency. The DCF investigator assigned to check on the children also didn't have the family's phone number. Since then, DCF officials said they have collaborated with law enforcement to develop protocol for future emergencies. Among the other problems uncovered in the investigation of Phoebe's death, Hillsborough County Sheriff's child protective investigators had 25 vacancies and were overwhelmed by the high number of new cases. Help: Michelle Kerr is helped away from her daughter's funeral last month. Phoebe Jonchuck was in the custody of her father when he threw his child to her death . And although the area has a network of nearby mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence resources, investigators don't routinely seek expert advice before closing cases, using the organizations only for referrals. Investigators also seemed more focused on whether Phoebe and her siblings' basic needs were being met, instead of addressing the histories of domestic violence, mental health, and substance abuse issues in the home, according to the report. DCF investigators have struggled over the years to look at the big picture in several other high profile child abuse deaths. A call in June of 2013 first brought child investigators to the Jonchuck home where they closed the case, agreeing that family violence threatened Phoebe. Jonchuck was arrested as a result of the call after an altercation with Phoebe's mother. He and Phoebe later moved out of the home, but Monday's report noted that no services or interventions were put in place.","John Jonchuck charged with first-degree murder in his daughter Phoebe's January 8 bridge fall .

"This property guide based on the London Underground map reveals the huge disparity between homes in the capital’s richest and poorest areas. Homes lining the streets around Bond Street station - the most expensive area - cost £3million more than those near Dagenham East - the cheapest. Big differences between stations include a £1million fall from Bond Street to Green Park, according to a study by online estate agents eMoov. Scroll down for video . Top ten: This graphic shows the most expensive areas in the capital to buy a house, based on the London Underground map . Bottom ten: Nine of the bottom ten Tube stations for house prices are in east London. The tenth is on the other side of the capital at Heathrow - although there are only four properties listed for sale, due to the proximity of the station to the airport, so it is something of an anomaly . CENTRAL: Homes lining the streets around Bond Street station - the most expensive area in London - cost an average of £3,231,559. The 'demand' figures shown in these graphics are determined by the percentage of properties sold, reflecting the demand and stock in an area . DISTRICT: This line is home to the stations with the cheapest prices in London; Dagenham East (£194,058) and Dagenham Heathway (£197,542) METROPOLITAN: Wembley Park to Finchley Road on this line - between zones four and two in north-west London - has a price fall of £600,000 . NORTHERN: Leicester Square in the West End is this line's most expensive station, with an average house price of more than £2.1million . PICCADILLY: A study says Ruislip in north-west London on this line and the Metropolitan is best for value, demand and a reasonable commute . The average house price also drops £600,000 drop from Wembley Park to Finchley Road, and £400,000 from King’s Cross to Highbury and Islington. Meanwhile the price gap from Hampstead to Golders Green is a £260,000 fall, while Vauxhall to Stockwell comes with a drop of £280,000. In addition, the 'demand' figures shown in the graphics are determined by the percentage of properties sold, reflecting the demand and stock in areas. Russell Quirk, the founder of eMoov, which carried out the research, said savvy buyers should look at where new gaps could appear on the network. As an example he cited the Northern line extension to Nine Elms and Battersea in south London, which is expected to be completed and open by 2020. Dropping: House prices fall sharply between zones one and two, before levelling off from zone three - before rising again at zone eight . Pricey: Holland Park (Central), Golders Green (Northern), Richmond (District) and Stanmore (Jubilee) are the most expensive stops per zone . Mr Quirk said: ‘These locations and their surrounding areas will see a dramatic rise in house prices and demand as they open the new service.’ The cheapest three stations on the map are Dagenham East, Dagenham Heathway and Becontree - all towards the east end of the District line. But while the average house price in Dagenham East is a mere £194,000, the most expensive station in London is Bond Street at £3,232,000. This is followed by Hyde Park Corner at £2,611,000, Knightsbridge at £2,574,000, Sloane Square at £2,275,000 and Victoria at £2,231,000. JUBILEE: After Bond Street, Green Park is the next most expensive station to live on the line - with an average house price of £2.2million . HAMMERSMITH AND CITY: Many stations with the lowest house prices are towards the east of this line - including Barking and Upton Park . CIRCLE: The average house price on this line is more than £1.5million - although it only operates inside zones one and two . VICTORIA: The average house price drops £400,000 from King’s Cross to Highbury and Islington, and £500,000 from Stockwell to Brixton . BAKERLOO: This line has two stations in the top ten most expensive - Piccadilly Circus (£2,196,650) and Oxford Circus (£2,051,713) Similarly priced are Piccadilly Circus at £2,197,000, Green Park at £2,191,000, South Kensington at £2,152,000 and Leicester Square at £2,135,000. Official figures revealed last month that the average house in London costs £501,000 – which is almost double the UK average of £271,000. Mr Quirk added: 'It is fascinating to see the gulf in demand between lines and the difference one stop can make to the value of a property.' The firm's study said that Ruislip is the best place for a mixture of value, demand and a reasonable commute - with an average price of £345,000.","Homes around Bond Street station, most expensive area, cost £3m more than near Dagenham East, the cheapest .

"Prince Charles rounded off his third day in the Middle East with a tour of the naval ship HMS Dauntless in Kuwait City this afternoon and a relaxed cup of tea with the Commanding Officer Adrian Fryer. Charles, who is on a six-day tour to the Gulf states, attended a sunset ceremony, dressed in his tropical whites bearing his rank of Admiral of the Fleet, on the British destroyer, which is currently on operation in the Gulf. The ship, commissioned in 2010, has been working with the US fleet in the region, as well as undertaking counter piracy and anti smuggling operations. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles landed in Kuwait City earlier today and spent the afternoon  on HMS Dauntless, which is docked in the capital. Despite his busy schedule, the royal looked relaxed as he enjoyed a cup of tea with Commanding Officer Adrian Fryer (left) The Prince of Wales shares a joke with a sailor on board the British destroyer, which is currently on operation in the Gulf (left), the royal also took part in a sunset ceremony on the vessel (right) Charles watched as the ship's flag was symbolically lowered at the end of the day and inspected some of its 200-strong company. The prince, who was himself in the Royal Navy for five years and rose to command a minesweeper, enthusiastically took a tour of the £1 billion vessel, described as the most advanced ship Britain has ever built. Lieutenant Commander Mile Klidjian, second in command, said: 'The prince made a point of chatting to as many of the staff as possible, remembering the banter - which hasn't changed in 30 years- and wanting to know about what it was like to work on such a world class destroyer. He continued: 'It was a huge honour to welcome him.' Earlier today, Prince Charles saw a very different side of the Middle East as he flew into Kuwait to be met by pair of adorable flower girls. Charles was all smiles as they handed him a posy at the private Amiri Terminal alongside the Gulf state's Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf. Welcome to Kuwait! Prince Charles is met by a pair of young girls clutching bouquets of flowers at the airport . Fleet: Outside the Amiri Terminal was a fleet of around 40 identical maroon Mercedes Benz cars . Charles was introduced to dozens of dignitaries in an official line-up, before standing for the British national anthem  and a brief inspection of a military guard. The heir to the throne was then whisked out of the airport and into one of around 40 gleaming maroon Mercedes Benz cars waiting for him outside. With the Crown Prince, he then travelled on for a meeting with Kuwait's ruler, His Highness The Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Sabah Al Ahmed Al Jabber Al Sabah, at the Bayan Palace. The Emir, who last met Charles during a state visit to the UK in 2012, appeared to be quite a fan of the Queen and solicitously asked about her health through his official interpreter. 'She is in remarkable form,' replied Charles, adding: 'My father will turn 94 and he has very good eyesight. He is still out shooting.' His remark prompted approving laughter from the Emir, who looked even more delighted when Charles told him: 'They remember with great affection your visit in 2012 to the UK'. Not so fast: Before he was driven away, he was introduced to local dignitaries at the airport . Greeting: He was met by Kuwaiti Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf at the private VIP terminal at the airport . Inspection: An honour guard of troops in red uniform were lined up in the arrivals hall to meet him . The Emir replied, with obvious pride: 'I will not forget the remarkable happiness and generosity of Her Majesty. I was living next door to her, I was her neighbour.' By that point, Charles may have been forgiven for thinking the formalities were over but in accordance with Arab tradition, he was then ushered into a lavish lunch attended by 150 dignitaries, each of which he was required to greet and shake hands with. Inside the dining room, the future king, a notoriously light eater who prefers to skip lunch, was offered dish after dish of fish and lobster delicacies. Impressed: Charles and his Kuwaiti counterpart inspected the troops before driving off in the convoy . Meeting: Charles met the Emir of Kuwait who asked him about the health of his mother, the Queen . Charles will stay overnight in Kuwait, a country he has visited on six previous occasions, before travelling onto the Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The prince is undertaking the tour at the request of the British Government, just a year after he last visited the region. Sources said it is a sign of how important Arabia is to the UK and of how significant Charles's role is in fostering good relations. Saying goodbye: Charles' arrival in Kuwait came after he made a ceremonial departure from Jordan . Royal wave: Charles waved goodbye to his Jordanian hosts from the doorway of the jet . Honour guard: As Charles departed, so did his Jordanian honour guard . Warm words: Charles met with Jordan's King Abdullah during his trip to the Middle Eastern country . She's back! The Queen returns to London after quietly marking 63 years on the throne at Sandringham . The Queen returned to London today, after spending Christmas and all of January at her Norfolk home, Sandringham. Resplendent in a lilac wool coat and, unusually, without one of her trademark hats, she was seen marching along the platform at King's Lynn station as she prepared to catch a train to the capital. With her was her team of close protection officers and a lady in waiting, all of whom followed her onto the train. On her way: The Queen prepares to board a train at King's Lynn as she returns to London . The Queen traditionally spends Christmas at Sandringham and usually marks the anniversary of her accession to the throne at the Norfolk property. It was also at Sandringham that her father, George VI, died on the 6th February 1952. The Queen herself was in Kenya at the time. The Queen, who also arrived at Sandringham by train, has spent much of her annual visit relaxing with the Duke of Edinburgh, although she has also made several official visits. As well as attending a WI meeting, an annual tradition for the Queen, last Monday visited South Lynn Fire Station. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the 88-year-old monarch toured the engine bay and met local firemen before officially opening the new facility. More of the same awaits on her return to Buckingham Palace this afternoon, with both the Queen and Prince Philip scheduled to complete a busy run of engagements between now and June's visit to Germany. Elegant: The Queen, who last week celebrated her 63rd year on the throne, was resplendent in lilac . Staying safe: The train was cleaned before the Queen arrived, overseen by police officers .

"A Chinese mining billionaire who once launched a bid for Australia's Sundance Resources was executed for multiple murders today. Liu Han, his younger brother Liu Wei and three accomplices were condemned to death in May for 'organising and leading a mafia-style group', murder and other crimes. Their appeals were unsuccessful and all five were put to death, the Xianning Intermediate court in the central province of Hubei has confirmed. Liu Han, a Chinese mining billionaire said to have links with disgraced former security tsar Zhou Yongkang, has been executed for 'organising and leading a mafia-style group', murder and other crimes . The group were said to have met with their families before being executed. 'The executed criminals' legal rights were fully protected,' the court added. Liu, 48, was the former chairman of Hanlong Group, who were involved in mining, real estate, electricity, energy and finance. The Liu siblings were said to have built an empire after starting out running gambling dens. Liu was said to have had links to former security czar Zhou Yongkang who was the most high profile official caught in China's anti corruption campaign. Hanlong was based in the southwestern province of Sichuan and launched a takeover bid of more than $1 billion for Sundance, a listed Australian iron ore firm, in 2011. The deal collapsed in 2013 after the Chinese firm failed to follow through. Chinese media reports said at the time that Liu had been detained. Sichuan is one of the power bases of Zhou, who once enjoyed vast power as China's security chief but whose targeting in a corruption investigation was announced in July. The influential business magazine Caixin has reported that Liu once had dealings with a businessman believed to be Zhou's son. State media have also hinted that the gang had connections to central government officials. Zhou was handed over to prosecutors in December. The official announcement of the long-rumoured probe into Zhou made him the most senior member of the Communist Party to be investigated since the infamous Gang of Four - a faction that included the widow of founding leader Mao Zedong - were put on trial in 1980. At the time of their trial, state media reported that the Liu brothers had started out by running gambling dens in their base in Guanghan, in China's southwestern Sichuan province, in the early 1990s. The brothers were said to have gathered 'a gang of local thugs and vagrants' around them. A public shooting at a Gyanghan teahouse in January 2009, allegedly ordered by Liu Wei, brought them to the attention of authorities. His older brother also developed a reputation for philanthropy. He built a rural school campus in the aftermath of an earthquake in Sichuan in 2008. Liu Wei had also been a torch-bearer in the build-up to the Beijing Olympics.","Liu Han and his brother were arrested during a crackdown on corruption .

"A photographer has documented the struggles of California women who give birth while in jail and others who are bringing up their children in prison. Photojournalist Mae Ryan captured the images of women at facilities in Chino and Pomona who were among the estimated four per cent of state and three per cent of federal inmates that are pregnant. Her photos expose the complicated lives of many inmates who are separated from their children after only hours together or others trying to be good mothers while behind bars. Scroll down for video . Photographer Mae Ryan captured images of women at California prisons. Above, Denise Bussell, in prison for having three DUIs in ten years, sits with son Justice in the Community Prisoner Mother Program . Regina Zodiacal was getting ready to give birth when Ms Ryan shot her Pregnant in Prison series in 2013 . Ms Ryan's work explores two centers in California, where 200 mothers gave birth while incarcerated in the state between 2011 and 2012. The pregnant women the photographer met in 2013 are given pre-natal care by a resident gynaecologist before their births. They are then taken to local hospitals for their births, which cost the state between $6,500 to $14,000 per birth, according to Feature Shoot. However, the time after giving birth can be harrowing for the mothers. Women, waiting for photos or news of newborns that they gave to relatives, develop post-partum depression. Others struggle with physical pain of pregnancy while watching their children given to foster care. Christina Bray already had three children when she went into labor while being arrested for embezzling money from a banking client. She said through tears that she held her daughter Lola Mae close to her heart before having to let her go, according to KPCC. Women who deliver while incarcerated are given between 24 and 48 hours with their newborns. Ms Zodiacal, five months pregnant when she was arrested for shoplifting and forgery, was worried that she would not be heard if she went into labor in her cell . Prison inmates are transported to local hospitals by guards in order to give birth, which costs between $6,500 and $14,000 . An estimated four per cent of state prisoners and three per cent of federal inmates are thought to be pregnant . 'There's really no after care here. They just handed me a Kotex pad and said have a good day,' inmate Britney Bass, in prison because of a parole violation, said two weeks after giving birth. She said she was happy to finally be able to sit down without pain after being whisked back to the prison 48 hours after she delivered her baby and handed it over for adoption. Women who deliver while incarcerated are given between 24 and 48 hours with their newborns. The resident gynaecologist at the California Institute for Women, a state prison in Chino, said that many pregnant women come off the street and have not received any treatment before going to prison. Corazon Navarro said that the prison cannot afford to give inmates exceptional quality of care, but said that she tries to do the best she can. But pregnancy in prison often presents issues not thought about by those on the outside. Pregnant inmates meet with a gynaecologist like Corazan Navarro in the lead up to birth, though they say after care is lacking . The Community Prisoner Mother Program in Pomona allows women to live with their children under age six . Unoccupied cribs at the Community Prisoner Mother Program can be used for women to take care of their infants . Inmates getting ready to give births face worries beyond those normal for first-time mothers. Regina Zodiacal, who was five months pregnant when she was arrested for shoplifting and forgery, told Ms Ryan that they worried about going into labor while in their cells and wardens will not hear them, leaving them alone for the ordeal. Advocates for the rights of expectant women in California prisons also won a victory in 2012  when the state legislature passed a law prohibiting women from being shackled during their pregnancies. While many women give their children to relatives to take care of, some prisoners have the opportunity to live with their children in special facilities such as the Community Prisoner Mother Program in Pomona. The 24-bed facility only allows a select group of incarcerated mothers and has no armed guards and no barbed wires. It does, however, have a kindergarten. Inmates with children under six are allowed to live with their kids while developing 'skills necessary to become a functioning, self-sufficient family that positively contributes to society' according to the California Department of Corrections. An estimated 250,000 children are separated from their mothers because of incarceration, according to AETN. The Pomona center is designed to keep mothers and children together while the prisoners learn skills to help them reintegrate into society . Inmates are allowed to take their children to the playground or away from the facility for doctor appointments . Only 46 per cent of mothers in prison reported having a personal visit from their children since being incarcerated. However, inmates at the Mother Program are allowed to take their kids to a playground at the facility or even leave for doctor appointments. The women are required to do chores as they would in prison, but they are also able to read their children bedtime stories. Though children are thought to do better when not separated from their mothers, the environment is not often 'child friendly' and can seem more like a medical clinic than a home, according to a study from Legal Services for Women with Children. The advocacy group has pushed for better food and medical conditions at the facilities. Despite problems, the mothers said they wouldn't want their children anywhere else. Mrs Bray was eventually able to be reunited with Lola Mae after 13 months apart after she was accepted to the Pomona program. 'There is no home without a mother,' she said, adding that prisoners deserve second chances. Luckily for women at the facility, the situation is often temporary. Woman accepted to the program must be sentenced to 36 months or less. The same women accepted to the nursery program are often good candidates for being transferred to community supervision rather than prison.

"Police and leaders of an orthodox Jewish group in Brooklyn say two little girls from their community have been missing since January 31. Authorities are seeking the whereabouts of Riva, 4, and Yosefa Kutsy, 3, from the Crown Heights area of Brooklyn. While the girls are believed to be with their mother and father, Alan Velvel Kutsy and Chana Yehudis Kutsy, the parents are not supposed to have left town with the girls. According to WABC, the girls disappeared with their mother and father after the Administration for Children's Services said it wanted to talk to the family. Missing: Police and members of an orthodox Jewish group in Brooklyn are searching for Riva, 4, and Yosefa Kutsy, 3 . The couple had been given only 'trial custody' of the girls for unknown reasons, reports Col Live. 'By leaving with them they didn't follow the conditions put in place,' said Detective Raymond Weng of the NYPD 71st Precinct. Along with police, members of the tight-knit orthodox community in Crown Heights have asked for the public's help in getting the girls home. 'We are involved in this case for over a year,' Gadi Hershkop, a member of the community public safety group Shomrim, said on Sunday. 'We need those kids back home in Crown Heights as soon as possible to a safe and loving home.' Police said the couple could be driving a red 2001 Toyota 4-Runner with New Jersey license plate A68EMS. Shomrim's search efforts have expanded beyond New York and into New Jersey and elsewhere along the East Coast. It remained unclear whether the children were in any danger. Also unclear was the reason the couple had lost full custody of the girls. The girls are believed to be with their parents, Chana Yehudis Kutsy and Alan Velvel Kutsy. The couple had only trial custody of the girls and have broken the terms of that custody by taking off .",Police and members of an orthodox Jewish group in Brooklyn are searching for Riva and Yosefa Kutsy .
"At 56, Madonna sent shock waves across the red carpet at last night's Grammy Awards with her OTT cleavage and fishnet stockings. But not all the mature red carpet guests were choose to flash the flesh yesterday evening - over here in London, the ladies at the BAFTAs enjoyed a more sophisticated approach to mature dressing. Julianne Moore, Imelda Staunton and national treasure Julie Walters were among the women over 50 who wowed at last night's event. Scroll down for video . Julie Walters lead the way for the over-50s in a dazzling floor-length sequin dress. The dress from Adrianna Papell came in at just £330, a snip for a red carpet show-stopper . Although they opted for an air of sophistication, the women showed that they were no means wallflowers, opting for show stopping ballgowns and bold colours. One outfit that was sure to grab the paparazzi's attention was the bold choice of Julie Walters, who graced the red carpet in a floor-length sequin dress. The 64-year-old proved that sequins can be worn at any age as she dazzled in a glittering dress by Adrianna Papell. The actress who presented the Outstanding British Contribution Award to cinema to Christine Langan for BBC Films, matched the dress, which cost just £330, with silver court shoes and added an air of elegance to her look with a pretty black shawl worn over her shoulders. Madonna, 56, shocked onlookers at the Grammy Awards last night when she turned up in a revealing corset and fishnet tights . Imelda Staunton, 59, was joined on the red carpet by her husband Jim Carter who looked rather dapper in black tie. The Harry Potter star dazzled in a full-skirted ball gown and took away a BAFTA for supporting actress for her role in the British film Pride. As well as British beauties taking the crown for over 50s-dressing, several overseas actresses also provided some lessons in mature style. Imelda Satunton, 59, was accompanied by husband Jim Carter, but refused to be outdone, catching everyone's eye in an emerald green, full-skirted ball gown . American actress Julianne Moore, 54, demonstrated that you can steal the show at any age by wearing a floor-length red dress. The actress who took home a BAFTA for Best Actress for her role in Still Alice, complemented her fiery red hair with an equally fiery ensemble from Tom Ford. The top half of the dress, which boasted a halterneck at the top of a sheer panel, was made from velvet, with the sleek floor-length skirt making the most of Julianne's trim shape. The skirt was also split at the front, showing off a killer pair of black strappy heels. American actress Julianne Moore, 54, dazzled in a floor-length red dress at last night's awards . Julianne took home the BAFTA for Best Actress for her role in Still Alice . Monica Bellucci showed that glamour has no age restrictions in a figure-hugging black floor-length gown. Monica was recently revealed as the latest Bond girl and will star in the new 007 flick Spectre. At 50 she will be the oldest femme fatale of the movie series to date and last night she proved she was most-deserving of the part. The Italian actress looked the epitome of vintage elegance in her sleek, simple and effective dress, which hugged her slender shape in all the right places. Her eye-catching garment was complete with long sleeves and flared cuffs - a shape which was replicated down the skirt. At 50, Monica Bellucci will star as the oldest Bond girl to date in the new movie Spectre and exhibited Hollywood glamour at last night's BAFTAs as she was joined by co-star Lea Seydoux (right) Dame Kristin  Scott Thomas, 54, had the enviable task of presenting heart-throb Eddie Redmayne with his BAFTA for leading actor. But some may argue that Eddie was the lucky one as Kristin presented the picture of elegance. The actress showcased her enviable figure in a floor sweeping dress with a fish tail hem and completed the look with a pair of dazzling diamond earrings and a clutch bag. Fashion writer Simon Glazin says that unlike their younger counterparts, women in their 50s tend to be more honest about their personal style and rely less on stylists. Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, 54, looked stunning in a floor-length dress with a fish tail hem . Simon says: 'I love seeing women over 50 on the red carpets because what you see really is their true style. 'The younger stars are very much led by stylists, designers befriending them for one reason, and pushy PRs throwing dresses at them, sometimes in exchange for money. 'But it's only when you reach a certain age that you become comfortable in your skin, and are not 'trend' led.' Simon added that none of the actresses had been held back their age and says that they could teach people a thing or two about red carpet style. Dress for your body shape: Highlight the body parts you are happy with (an interesting neckline, straps if you have good shoulders, ruched at the waist to draw the eye in to the smallest part). Colour is key too: Play up to pale in a standout colour, or just chose black for a bit of chic. And sparkles can be a women's best friend. And finally: Nobody, apart from Madonna, wants to look like mutton dressed as lamb. You'll get all the wrong press! 'Julianne Moore, one of the best dressers on any red carpet, was the star of the BAFTAs. 'Red on a redhead is a great move, and Tom Ford obviously knows how to dress women. 'Julie Waters was a walking masterclass at how to dress at a certain age: long sleeves, long length and a scoop neckline. 'Her glittered gown was perfect on her, also showing off her fantastic figure. 'Kristin Scott Thomas turned on the vamp in plain black. Cinched in at the waist, long sleeves again, and a plunge at the cleavage. Very understated glamour! 'And Imelda Staunton, one of our finest actresses, had fun with her emerald green ball gown. It was slightly too mother-of-the-bride, but she definitely owned it, and clearly loved her frock.'","Last night's BAFTAs saw plenty of style successes and fashion fails .

"Nick Gordon was 'jealous' of Bobbi Kristina's fame and 'couldn't understand why Whitney's daughter was offered more money than him for a reality TV deal,' according to reports. The only daughter of Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, remains comatose at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta over a week after being found face down in the bathtub at her home - in a scene that echoed the untimely death of her mother in 2012. It has now been claimed that the couple's fights were almost always triggered by 'Nick's jealousy over Bobbi Kristina's fame'. Bobbi Kristina and partner Nick Gordon allegedly had a violent relationship according to sources - and he was 'jealous of her fame'. She has been in hospital for over a week after being found comatose in the bath . While Bobbi Kristina and Gordon's violent relationship was well known among their friends, it was fueled by his jealousy of her fame, a source told TMZ. Gordon felt he was also Whitney Houston's child and so could not understand why people focused more on Bobbi, the source claimed. Bobbi Kristina and Gordon were brought up as brother and sister after Houston took Gordon in when he was 12. But following her death the duo announced they were in a relationship. Whitney Houston raised him as her own son at her home outside Atlanta but never legally adopted him. Bobbi Kristina's parents Whitney and Bobby Brown (pictured) had an famously turbulent marriage . Now sources claim he is jealous of his partner and cited a recent incident in which the couple were trying to get their own reality TV show, but Gordon wasn't offered the same deal as Bobbi Kristina so they turned it down. Gordon has been summoned to appear in court today to answer charges of reckless driving. A warrant for his immediate arrest will be issued if he does not turn up at Fulton County State Court in Atlanta at 9am. Gordon, 25, was caught driving at over twice the speed limit along a suburban road in November 2012. Suspicious injuries found on Bobbi when she was taken to hospital made them suspect foul play may have been involved, according to TMZ. Bobby Brown (pictured) has been visting his daughter Bobbi Kristina regularly in the Atlanta hospital where she is fighting for her life . Reports have suggested Gordon will also be the focus of a police investigation into how Bobbi Kristina ended up in hospital. Singing legend Whitney was found dead in the bath tub of her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on February 11 2012. Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in Whitney's suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned. Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances last Saturday. While police said they had found drugs in the house, it is not clear how Bobbi came to lose consciousness. Her cousin Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change', but her father has slammed claims the family are preparing to say goodbye. Bobbi was found unconscious by her partner Gordon and her friend Max Lomas at her home. Lomas discovered Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said. It was revealed on Friday that she could have been submerged for up to 15 minutes before she was discovered. She was rushed to hospital and her family have remained tight-lipped about her condition. Her father Bobby Brown spoke out last week to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon. Last January the couple had announced that were married and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media. But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father said: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.' 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon.' Relations between Gordon and other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston. Bobbi's parents' 15-year marriage was dogged by rumors of drug-fueled domestic violence.

"Former Dallas Cowboy running back Tony Dorsett revealed he is 'in a battle' with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) after being diagnosed. Many scientists believe the brain disease is caused by head trauma. Dorsett, 60, called his condition 'frustrating' and said he never realized 'the end was going to be like this'. Scroll down for video . Ex-Dallas Cowboy running back Tony Dorsett was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 2013 .

CTE is a degenerative condition that is characterized by dementia, aggression and depression. Dorsett talked about how the condition has been affecting his life during an interview yesterday with Dallas radio station 1310 The Ticket, according to the Dallas Morning News. He said: 'I'm in a battle, obviously. 'I got diagnosed with CTE and it's very frustrating at times for me. 'I've got a good team of people around me, my wife and kids, who work with me. 'When you've been in this town for so long and I have to go to some place I've been going to for many, many, many years, and then all of a sudden I forget how to get there.' Dorsett said he is 'trying to get better' and he has good days and bad days battling with the disease . Former San Diego Chargers linebacker Junior Seau committed suicide but didn't shoot himself in the head so that his brain could be studied by medical researchers . Ex-Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson, a four-time Pro Bowler and Super Bowl winner, committed suicide at 50 . Dorsett won the 1976 Heisman Trophy while playing for the University of Pittsburgh.

"If you settle down to watch television this evening, you might want to think twice about what you say out loud. Samsung has warned owners of its internet-connected ‘smart TV’ that anything they discuss while sitting near the device may be overheard. The popular televisions are voice activated, so users can switch channels or ask for suggestions of what to watch simply by giving a verbal command. The Voice Recognition feature has to be enabled by the user, and they agree to let it track their conversations when they accept the TV's terms and conditions. Samsung said it sends voice commands, 'along with information about [the] device, including device identifiers' to a third-party service . However, the technology which allows this to happen has a worrying side effect: it records everything else that goes on near the television. A clause in the Korean firm’s privacy policy warns: ‘Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party.’ That means it could, for example, record a family argument going on in the living room. Companies that use the televisions in boardrooms risk sharing confidential information such as employees’ salaries or business strategies. Privacy campaigners drew comparisons between the TVs and ‘Big Brother’ – the authoritarian state which watches people’s every move in 1984, the dystopian novel by George Orwell. Renate Samson, of Big Brother Watch, a campaign group named after this very notion, said: ‘This thing is going to be in your house, listening in on you. ‘Samsung say they are providing you with a service, but really the only service you need from a television is to watch programmes.’ More than half of smart TVs sold in Britain are made by Samsung. The company says its televisions constantly listen out for simple commands to switch on or change channel, which are interpreted by the machine itself. However, it can only process more complicated requests by recording users’ speech and sending it to a third-party company called Nuance, in the US. That firm then sends the data to a computer server, which translates it into text and sends a response. To give these complex commands, viewers must press a button on the remote control as they speak, and during that time, anything within ‘earshot’ will be collected. The data is encrypted, but can be listened to by authorised Nuance staff. Last year, IT consultant Jason Huntley realised his LG smart TV was tracking his family’s viewing habits and even knew his children’s names because he had watched a family video on his set. An LG set is pictured . SMART TVs are television sets that link to the internet, allowing viewers to browse the web or watch programmes on demand, for example on BBC iPlayer . Most are voice activated, so users can change channels without the remote control . The TVs do this by constantly listening to the discussions around them, ‘filtering’ for simple key words, such as ‘turn on’ When they hear these predefined commands, they carry out the instructions . To give a more complex command – such as a request to recommend a good programme – users must hold down a button as they speak . Most smart TVs then record the user’s speech, and send it via the internet to a powerful computer, which processes it and sends a response back to the TV set . This has to be done remotely because it takes far more computing power than there is in an affordable home TV . 141 million smart TVs will be sold worldwide this year, and more than half of TVs sold are now ‘smart’ models . The technology giant remained tight-lipped about whether it then keeps users’ data, only saying that it does not sell information on, and that it operates within privacy laws, which vary by country. Professor Peter Sommer, a digital forensics expert who has lectured at the London School of Economics, said there was ‘no reason’ Samsung would not be storing up data. ‘The fear is they could be building up a pattern of your preferences, or learning your voice,’ he said. Users can stop Samsung from recording their conversations by turning voice recognition off. However, even then, the firm collects certain information. Its privacy policy says that, if the feature is turned off: ‘While Samsung will not collect your spoken word, Samsung may still collect associated texts and other usage data so that we can evaluate the performance of the feature and improve it.’ Renate Samson slammed Samsung for forcing people to ‘opt out’ of recordings, rather than giving them the option to opt in. ‘It is the wrong way to go about it, and even if you do opt out, you can’t guarantee [your privacy],’ she said.","Samsung's privacy policy warns users about having private conversations .

Both Connor and Lillie have a lot in common: educated at the same Scientology school, adopted at a young age by Hollywood stars, and, most importantly, are staunch Scientologists. They’ve both completed Church courses including one on leadership and competence on the huge Scientology cruise ship called Freewinds. Lillie’s heartbreak has caused them to grow much closer. On 9 January, they met up in New York and went straight to a hotel for deep and meaningful chats. Connor said in one message: ‘Real Talk. Brutal.’ They even have nicknames for each other - Connor is ‘Golden Eagle’ and she is ‘Von Strut’. Connor and Lillie were both adopted at a young age by Hollywood stars and educated at the same Scientology school. They even have nicknames for each other - Connor is ‘Golden Eagle’ and she is ‘Von Strut’ Lillie posted this picture of herself draped over Connor with a loving arm around his chest when they went out for drinks to celebrate her mom Kirstie's birthday . Two days later, they met up with mother Kirstie for her birthday, and along with fellow Scientologists including Lillie’s mentor Kim Joyce, enjoyed hot stone massages at the trendy urban NY retreat The Red Door Girl. Lillie posted a picture of herself and Connor in a clench at the spa. Later on that evening they went out for drinks and Lillie was pictured draped over Connor with a loving arm around his chest. When Connor had to leave two days later to DJ in Panama, the pair sent loving messages to each other on Twitter. Lillie started it off by saying: ‘missing you already’, then she followed it up with another message, adding: ‘good morning Connor… miss you, thank you for being there for all of us… love you.’ Connor responded: ‘miss you too!!!!! much love!’ On 17 January, four days later, it was Connor’s turn to celebrate his birthday and he got a message from Lillie saying: ‘happy birthday to my best friend.’ On 9 January, the pair met up in New York and went straight to a hotel for deep and meaningful chats. Connor said in one message: ‘Real Talk. Brutal’ The pair  enjoyed hot stone massages at the trendy urban NY retreat The Red Door Girl last month . Connor met Lillie at the Scientology school The Delphian Academy in Oregon and became friends with her mother Kirstie. While his sister Isabella moved to the UK to complete studies, Connor forged a career as a dance DJ, encouraged by a bizarre mentor in former Cheers star Kirstie, who started DJ-ing as DJ Lil’ Buttercup four years ago. Connor would often meet up with Kirstie either at her house in LA, Tom’s pad on Torreyson Drive in Beverly Hills, or at the Scientology Celebrity Centre on Franklin Avenue in Hollywood. They’ve posted pictures of some of their visits online like their meet up at the celeb center in August. She visited Connor when he got a new dog last year and he calls Kirstie his ‘Spirit Animal’, a special term to use when you revere or look up to someone’s life and achievements. This also isn’t the first time that Connor has grown close to high profile Scientology families with beautiful daughters. Respective parents Tom and Kirstie are two of the highest ranking Church members and have completed Operating Thetan 7, which is only one step away from having the ‘full knowledge.’ Connor Cruise has forged a career as a dance DJ, encouraged by his bizarre mentor Kirstie Alley who he calls his 'spirit animal' Kirstie talked about OT7 to radio DJ Howard Stern last month, saying: ‘It’s an awareness level, it's an achievement… I think that people need to always, no matter what path they choose, the goal I hope would be to become more and more aware and less insane.’ She also revealed that her children are Scientologists, saying: ‘It was their choice… it really helped them a lot so that's good.’ A former Scientology pal Tiziano Lugli was declared a ‘Suppressive Person’ after leaving and had to disconnect from a close friend - Connor. He says: ’[Connor and Isabella] are so protected. You can't live a normal life if you're Tom Cruise's son, especially being in Scientology. There are strict ethics around them. They have staff dedicated to Tom Cruise.’ He claimed that his last contact with Connor was on Facebook. Lugli said he wrote: 'Man, you rock. It's a dangerous commodity to still be friends with us. Keep your head up high and I will see you up the line, my friend.' Connor and Lillie met up last month for mom Kirstie's birthday and were joined by fellow Scientologists including Lillie’s mentor Kim Joyce, right . Then Connor replied: 'Ha, ha, ha, ha, I know.' And then deleted his entire Facebook page. The likes of Tom and Kirstie have closed ranks since the furor over the anti-Church documentary Going Clear. Kirstie even took to Twitter to air her views, saying: ‘Asking a defected Scientologist about Scientology is like asking a KKK member to represent the views of white people on blacks...pure s***.' Tony Ortega, who stars in the Going Clear documentary and went to the Sundance Film Festival for the documentary explained more on the relationships between celebrity Scientologists. He said: ‘There does seem to be some ""circling of the wagons"" going on. Connor has gotten very close to Kirstie and her family, and with his sister Isabella seemingly back in LA, that only seems to confirm that Tom's children are as dedicated to Scientology as ever. ‘There's a social element to Scientology that's important to keep in mind. Separate from the courses and fundraisers and other official church events, Scientologists often surround themselves with other Church members - and Isabella and Connor have been prime examples of this.’ Isabella, left, was pictured alongside the other students after being awarded the Sassoon Post-Graduate Diploma after finishing her hairdressing studies in London . Isabella Cruise has now finished her hairdressing studies in London. It was reported in December that she’d completed her 12-month diploma course at the prestigious Sassoon Academy in central London. But we can reveal that Isabella, 21, then went on to do a post-graduate course in coloring and cutting, which was a 12-week program and finished last month. Since returning to Los Angeles for the Christmas holidays, she’s now got little reason to return to London. All her Scientology friends have finished their own university courses and have either moved back to the US, France or begun working at the British Scientology HQ in Saint Hill, West Sussex. The friends on her hairdressing course have also mostly jumped ship and returned to their respective countries. As the fees for the course runs into tens of thousands, most students are either from the US or south east Asia. The 21-year-old was pictured alongside the other students after being awarded the Sassoon Post-Graduate Diploma, which is highly respected in the hairdressing world.","Connor Cruise has formed a deep relationship with fellow Scientologist Kirstie Alley's daughter Lillie Parker .

"Remains of a former lord mayor of London, a notorious criminal and political activists will be unearthed when excavation of an infamous burial ground is undertaken by the London Crossrail project. Crossrail-led research has identified the names and backgrounds of more than 5,000 people buried at the old Bedlam cemetery site at Liverpool Street in London. Names include Sir Ambrose Nicholas, who was lord mayor of London in 1575, and Dr John Lamb (also known as Lam or Lambe), an astrologer and advisor to the First Duke of Buckingham. Their skeletons are among those of tortured former patients of Bethlem Royal Hospital, thought to have been the world's first mental asylum. Scroll down for video . Archaeologists at the burial site on Liverpool Street, London, work to excavate a centuries-old skeleton . Intense archival research has identified the names of more than 5,000 people buried at the Bedlam site in London in the 16th and 17th centuries . Workers divide the Bedlam site into sections in order to carefully excavate the skeleton of a person buried at the cemetery . The site is found beneath Liverpool Street station in the city of London, with thousands of skeletons lying undisturbed beneath it for centuries . Lamb was said to have been stoned to death by an angry mob outside a theatre in 1628 following allegations of rape and black magic. Others identified in the research, carried out by 16 invited volunteers and covering burials in the 16th and 17th centuries, include victims of riots by 'Fanatiques', noted in the diaries of Samuel Pepys in January 1661. Also buried in the area was soldier Robert Lockyer, an activist in England's first democratic political movement known as the Levellers, The Independent reported. Executed by firing squad in 1649, he became a martyr for the fledgling left-wing group after he refused parliamentarian military bosses' orders that he be sent away from the capital in a bid to mitigate his dissent. More than 4,000 people were reported to have attended his funeral at Bedlam, wearing green ribbons to show their allegiance to the Levellers. Crossrail workers recently discovered the gravestone of Mary Godfree, who died in 1665 as a result of the Great Plague . The Crossrail team will use the information when work to excavate 3,000 skeletons from the Bedlam site starts next month. But with mental patients showing no physical symptoms of illness, determining which of the remains belonged to those treated at the hospital will be near impossible. The hospital is considered the first asylum in Britain. It has been moved several times since and is now found in Bromley. Bedlam burial ground was established in 1569 to help parishes cope with overcrowding during outbreaks of plague and other epidemics. Crossrail workers recently discovered the gravestone of Mary Godfree, who died in September 1665 as a result of the Great Plague which peaked that year. Jay Carver, lead archaeologist at Crossrail, said: 'This research is a window into one of the most turbulent periods of London's past. 'These people lived through civil wars, the Restoration, Shakespeare's plays, the birth of modern industry, plague and the Great Fire. 'It is a real privilege to be able to use Europe's largest construction project to uncover more knowledge about this fascinating period of history. 'Our heartfelt thanks go to the volunteer researchers, who have contributed immensely to Crossrail's legacy.' The archaeological excavations at Liverpool Street are being undertaken by Museum of London Archaeology on behalf of Crossrail. Scientific analysis of up to 3,000 skeletons will provide new insights into the lives and deaths of early modern Londoners. The upcoming dig is also expected to uncover medieval and Roman artefacts, and help piece together centuries of history. After excavation, the skeletons will be reburied on consecrated ground. To date, Crossrail, which will be fully opened in 2019, has found more than 10,000 artefacts from London's long history across over 40 construction sites. Thousands of Londoners were buried at the site, including Bedlam patients among the first to be treated for psychiatric illness in the 14th century . Researchers will not be able to distinguish between the skeletons of former Bedlam patients and others, with mental illnesses bearing no bodily symptoms . Thousands of people have been buried at the site over hundreds of years. The Royal Bedlam Hospital now operates in Bromley and is considered a leading psychiatric facility . Bedlam: The scene inside the hospital as depicted by William Hogarth in The Rake's Progress . The Bethlem Royal Hospital was the first dedicated psychiatric institution in Europe, having been founded as a priory in 1247 and converted into a hospital in the early 14th century. It was founded by Goffredo de Prefetti, who had been elected Bishop of Bethlehem, and was originally located just outside the London city wall, on the site of what is now Liverpool Street station. Due to the hospital's reputation as the principle treatment centre for the insane, a bastardised version of its name - 'Bedlam' - came to signify madness and chaos more generally. Although it is sometimes thought to have treated its patients cruelly, most were free to walk around the grounds, and conditions were not much worse than the average home of the period. In 1674, the hospital's governors decided that the institution should move a few hundred metres to the west to Moorfields, with the area's open space thought to be healthier than its original premises. Bethlem moved against in 1815, to St George's Fields in Southwark, which is now the site of the Imperial War Museum. A final move came in 1930 when the hospital relocated to the suburb of Bromley - it is now run by the NHS and is considered to be a leading psychiatric hospital.","Crossrail project at Liverpool Street, London, has uncovered a cemetery .

"Three Chinese naval ships have docked at a British base for a formal visit that samples the strength of the fleet being built up by the country. Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming and hundreds of flag-waving UK-based Chinese residents welcomed the ships into Portsmouth Naval Base. Heading a task group on enhancing military understanding between the two countries is the assault ship Chang Bai Shan. She was accompanied by the frigate Yun Cheng and the replenishment ship Chaohu at the Hampshire dockyard. During the five-day visit, senior officers from both navies will discuss maritime topics including counter-piracy operations across the Indian Ocean. Scroll down for video . Arrival: Three Chinese Naval ships berthed at  Portsmouth Dockyard. HMS Warrior (bottom) and HMS Victory (right) can also be seen . At the front: Heading the task group on improving military understanding between the countries is the assault ship Chang Bai Shan (pictured) Also on the scene: The assault ship has been accompanied by the frigate Yun Cheng (pictured) and the replenishment ship Chaohu . The visit comes seven months after a report from the US Pentagon which examined how China was growing the size and reach of its naval fleet. And that followed revelations that China was increasing its military budget by 12 per cent to more than £86billion - compared to £33billion in the UK. China now spends three times as much as India on defence - and more than neighbouring Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea put together. Task group commander Rear Admiral Zhang Chuansha said: ‘Our visit to the UK is a good opportunity to enhance our understanding of each other. ‘It’s a great opportunity for our sailors to get exposure to local people and our counterparts in the British Navy. ‘All sailors share something in common. We share the same sea, the same international obligations such as dealing with piracy.' Standing to attention: Members of the Chinese Navy stand aboard the assault ship Chang Bai Shan at Portsmouth Royal Navy Base . Sailors: During the five-day visit, senior officers will discuss maritime topics including counter-piracy operations across the Indian Ocean . The Mail reported in October 2013 how the Royal Navy had 15 times more commanding officers than active warships, with 40 admirals and 260 captains but just 19 ships. To make £4.7billion savings and help eliminate a £38billion deficit in the equipment programme, the Navy was cutting its force by 5,000 sailors and four warships. Last June, former first sea lord Lord West of Spithead said naval fleet cuts had gone too far and were a 'national disgrace'. But the Ministry of Defence insisted 'tough decisions had to be taken to deal with the budget deficit'. Four years ago, the Mail revealed that the Army had more top brass than battle tanks. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said: ‘This visit gives a flavour of the partnership between China and the UK. ‘It is also good for the British public to understand the Chinese military and what it is able to do. It has been seven years since our last visit. ‘The world has changed and so has the reach of the Chinese navy. 'We’ve carried out 48 missions in the Gulf region in that time and helped to protect 6,000 vessels. ‘So we have a lot to talk about - there is a lot for the two navies to share. 'And this visit will go a long way to strengthening our relationship.’ Commodore Jeremy Rigby, naval base commander, said: ‘We welcome our Chinese visitors to the operational home of the Royal Navy. ‘As with our ship visits abroad, these events are not only of great diplomatic significance, but also very useful militarily given that we share similar global challenges including counter-piracy, preventing conflict, protecting our citizens overseas and supporting UN peacekeeping efforts. ‘China, like us, relies on trade at sea for its prosperity and we work together around the world. ‘The visit to Portsmouth is a really good way for us to talk, navy to navy, with like-minded sailors, sharing information on our operations.’ Smiling: Hundreds of flag-waving UK-based Chinese residents (right) were among those who welcomed the ships into Portsmouth Naval Base . Waving the flags: Crew members from the vessels will be given tours of attractions including HMS Victory, HMS Warrior and the Mary Rose . Crew members from all three vessels will be given tours of local attractions including HMS Victory, HMS Warrior and the Mary Rose. They will also be shown around the Royal Navy’s newest warship, Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan.

"Tens of thousands of people are mistakenly signing up to subscriptions for skin creams and weight loss pills after registering for a free sample online, a bank has warned. The Royal Bank of Scotland receives up to 400 complaints a day from customers who have been duped into costly subscriptions after applying for a ‘free trial’ for beauty and nutrition products. Customers are asked to enter their card details online to cover a small postage and packaging fee for a trial of everything from teeth whiteners to muscle-building supplements. But many are also unwittingly agreeing to a recurring subscription if they do not cancel within the trial period – a detail usually buried in the small print. Scroll down for video . Thousands are mistakenly signing up to subscriptions for skin creams and weight loss pills after registering for a free sample online, the Royal Bank of Scotland has warned. File photo . Companies typically offer a 30-day free trial via websites and social media but, weeks later, customers discover a large monthly fee – typically £80 – has been taken out. In January, the most-complained about companies included Age Renew, Aloe Vera Cleanse, Aloe Vera 4 Diet and Healthy Ketone. Now Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, which includes Natwest, has urged regulators to take action after noticing firms ‘taking advantage of consumers’. The bank’s fraud department detected this scandal last summer and reported the worst offenders to payment companies such as Visa and Mastercard. At the time, RBS and NatWest were receiving over 390 customer calls a day on unrecognised payments following ‘ free trials’, although this has now fallen to about 50. Ross McEwan, chief executive of RBS, is urging regulators to take action after noticing firms ‘taking advantage of consumers’ The ‘scams’ were costing customers over £30,000 per day in fees, the bank estimated. Mr McEwan said the victims were often unable to find out how to stop the payments or even contact the company. In other cases, they were forced to agree to the terms and conditions before they even appeared on the computer screen. He has now called on lenders to stop financing companies which extract unauthorised payments from customers’ accounts in this way. He told the Financial Times: ‘They are making it so difficult for people to actually stop the payment. ‘We are going to work through who are the players, who are the worst at it and to start calling it out with the regulators.’ The bank said that, since June last year, it has helped 37,000 customers stop payments to companies offering free trials. Terry Lawson, head of fraud at RBS said: ‘Too many of our customers have fallen victim to these scams. ‘We want to help raise awareness so that both our customers, and the wider public, are aware of these scams and look out for unclear or confusing terms and conditions.’ Customers are typically charged £4.95 for postage and packing for a trial product, but the average first subscription fee is about £80. Banks can ensure that all future payments to a firm are cancelled but give customers a refund for the money which has already been taken. Since August, information supplied by the bank has led to 1,000 firms being barred from processing payments.","RBS says it receives up to 400 complaints a day from duped customers .

"He travelled the country during the independence referendum, proudly defending the Union while standing on upturned Irn-Bru crates. But Jim Murphy's fondness for Scotland's 'other' national drink means that taxpayers have been forced to fund his habit – handing over the princely sum of £1.30. Parliament bosses have uncovered two claims from the Scottish Labour leader in his Westminster expenses following a Freedom of Information request, it emerged today. Labour leader in Scotland Jim Murphy has claimed Irn Bru on expenses . Under existing rules, MPs – who earn £67,000-a-year - are allowed to claim for non-alcoholic drinks during overnight stays. Mr Murphy, who does not drink alcohol, is a huge fan of Irn-Bru and purposely chose to tour the country with the branded crates as he visited 100 towns and cities in 100 days before the referendum. He endured heckling from Yes voters and was hit with eggs while speaking in Kirkcaldy, Fife, sparking claims that independence campaigners were 'orchestrating a campaign of intimidation'. His expenses claims were both ridiculed and criticised yesterday. A spokesman for pressure group The TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'This is ludicrous and will leave taxpayers fizzing with rage. Expenses are supposed to be to help MPs do their job, not for caffeine-heavy refreshments or PR stunts.' An SNP spokesman said: 'Labour's bottle has crashed and this is a further embarrassment for Jim Murphy. Unlike Scotland's favourite national soft drink – he is neither 'original' nor 'best'.' Nationalist politicians took to Twitter to mock the Labour leader, with Europe Minister Humza Yousaf posting a picture of himself drinking Irn-Bru with the caption: 'Pleased to say I always buy my own Bru.' MSP Mark McDonald ‏joked: 'I cannot believe that story about Jim Murphy claiming for Irn-Bru. I had no idea he even liked the stuff. There were no clues to this.' A Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: 'As most people know, Mr Murphy drinks bucket loads of Irn-Bru. Over the years it's thought that he has single-handedly kept the House of Commons Irn-Bru supplier in business. He has paid for it himself except for these two cans totalling £1.30.' Mr Murphy was involved in heated confrontations with independence supporters on his 100 towns in 100 days tour of the country, where he spoke from an Irn Bru crate . The Freedom of Information request was spotted by the team at anti-establishment blog Guido Fawkes. (PLS KEEP) In response to the unknown individual who requested the information, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority wrote: 'Under the MPs' scheme of business costs and expenses, MPs may claim for the cost of purchasing food and non-alcoholic drinks where they have necessarily stayed overnight neither in the London area nor their constituency. This is limited to £25 for each night. 'MPs may also claim reimbursement of the costs of an evening meal (excluding alcoholic drinks), when they are required to be at the House of Commons because the House is sitting beyond 7.30pm. This is limited to £15 for each night. Irn Bru has been described as Scotland's 'other' national drink . 'In processing your request, we have searched through all claims made by Jim Murphy MP for food and drink for any which identify Irn Bru. We have identified two such claims. Both claims were made before April 30, 2014, and amount to £1.30.' A spokesman for Irn-Bru makers A.G. Barr declined to comment. The revelation comes just weeks after it emerged that SNP MSP Richard Lyle charged taxpayers for his £1.80 bill in an Edinburgh fish and chips shop. Originally, only the price-tag was released by parliament bosses, sparking a hilarious guessing game on social media about what he bought for the paltry sum. Now, a Freedom of Information request by the Scottish Daily Mail has finally revealed what Mr Lyle purchased at the Royal Mile chippy. An order for 'small chips' was made at 10.43pm in April 2013, the receipt shows, which the MSP - who earns nearly £59,000-a-year – later took the time to formally submit to Holyrood authorities, where it was processed by taxpayer-funded staff. Expenses documents show that Mr Lyle, a Central Scotland MSP, is fond of his takeaway dinners. As well as claiming for chips, he clawed back a £5.40 bill from the Happiness Chinese restaurant on four occasions in 2013-14. And seven other receipts for an evening meal were submitted from an unknown restaurant or takeaway, each priced just £4.20. An SNP spokesman said: 'Members are permitted to claim some money towards meals on evenings when parliamentary duties mean they must stay in Edinburgh. 'The claim of £1.80 is in line with the Scottish Parliament allowances system, which has already been reformed and has always been more stringent and transparent than its Westminster counterpart. By definition, Mr Lyle's claim for an evening meal was as cheap as chips.'","MPs  are allowed to claim for non-alcoholic drinks during overnight stays .

"A doctor who was known as 'an octopus' has been jailed for groping colleagues at the hospital where he worked as an anaesthetist. Dr Niaz Ahmed viewed women's genitals as they recovered from surgery and gave saucy underwear to a stunned young colleague, a court heard. The 55-year-old was known as 'always the octopus, hands all over the place' by nurses and staff who he made repeated lewd comments to at South Tyneside Hospital in Tyne and Wear. Dr Niaz Ahmed, pictured, was jailed for groping staff at the hospital where he worked as an anaesthetist . Newcastle Crown Court heard the 'highly skilled' doctor, who boasted he was 'looking for women the day after he got married' was repeatedly warned by hospital bosses to tone down his behaviour. A jury convicted him of two indecent assault charges on his co-workers, during incidents more than a decade ago. Judge Simon Hickey jailed Ahmed, of Broadlands, Cleadon, for 18 months and said he must sign the sex offender register for ten years. The judge said Ahmed had shown 'no remorse' for his behaviour, which he tried to pass off as 'social clumsiness'. The 55-year-old was known as 'always the octopus, hands all over the place' by nurses . Judge Hickey told him: 'These women expected, and could expect, to be treated not only with respect and courtesy but as professionals in their own right. 'You were expected not to touch them in any way, particularly a sexual way. 'The evidence in the case revealed your inappropriate behaviour towards women in general in the hospital. 'The nurses spoke in terms of you leaving your post as an anaesthetist and viewing the private, genital areas of women when they were unconscious. 'Others speak of you giving inappropriate underwear to one young nurse, extremely embarrassing her. Others speak of suggestive behaviour and comments. 'The evidence was overwhelming in terms of what you were doing and the boundaries you were stepping over. 'You used your authority over those two victims to commit these offences. 'This was not social clumsiness, this was a man who knew he was stepping over a clear line.' Ahmed, who was suspended from medical practice at a tribunal earlier this year for groping a nurse who was treating him after an accident in 2010, was cleared of three similar charges. The General Medical Council ruled Ahmed, who no longer works at the hospital, could continue to practice, under strict conditions, after the recent convictions. Prosecutor Michael Hodson told the court during the trial that Ahmed had not committed 'grave' sex crimes and caused no serious physical injury to his victims. But he added: 'Imagine what it was like going to work with a sex pest, always the octopus, hands all over the place, underlined by innuendo.' Ahmed made lewd comments to nurses and staff while working at South Tyneside District Hospital, pictured . Mr Hodson said one victim was targeted in the scrub room at the hospital, where Ahmed squeezed her bottom and asked her: 'Do you fancy it?' Another had her breasts prodded by the medic while she was at work and said he had told her 'put them away'. Ahmed denied the charges against him and claimed his behaviour was 'jokes and banter'. Mr Hodson added: 'As all sex pests may well do to get away with their nuisance behaviour, they pass it off as banter, as he did.' The court heard that during a meeting with hospital bosses in 2000, Ahmed accepted it was inappropriate to touch nurses and said any offence caused by him was entirely innocent and accidental. During a later meeting with management, he said his behaviour continued to be innocent and in fitting with the 'culture' of the hospital. Ahmed had claimed he was the victim of a 'witch hunt' in 2012 after he was cleared of sexually assaulting two teenage girls at a fireworks display in South Shields in 2011. The youngsters claimed Ahmed had groped them after boasting about the size of his manhood and complaining about his sex life with his wife. Tom Moran, defending, said Ahmed has had an offer of work out of the area, adding: 'He is highly regarded for his professional abilities.' Newcastle Crown Court, pictured, heard Ahmed viewed women's genitals as they recovered from surgery and gave saucy underwear to a stunned young colleague .","Dr Niaz Ahmed was jailed for 18 months for two counts of indecent assault .

Stapleton took the opportunity to redecorate the prison to pay homage to his favourite soap opera with a 10ft high painting of the TV show's pub (pictured) Throughout his trial, Stapleton showed no remorse, telling the judge: ‘I’m not bothered. I love prison. ‘Lock me up for 55 years. Does this face look bothered?’ Police believe he had his teardrop tattoo done to show off to other criminals  that he had killed someone. He was initially sent to Full Sutton prison near York but was transferred to Strangeways in Manchester after he attacked a priest. As part of his rehabilitation at Category A Strangeways, he was given art lessons and the chance to help re-decorate the walls of the special intervention unit where he was housed. Stapleton took the opportunity to pay homage to his favourite soap opera with a 10ft high painting of the ITV show's pub. The artwork took him two weeks to complete and now marks the outer wall of the building which houses six of the prison’s most dangerous inmates. But the project has been met with dismay from MPs who branded his treatment a disgrace. Indian student Anuj Bidve (pictured) was shot in the head as he made his way to the post-Christmas sales in 2011 . Labour MP Keith Vaz last night told The Sun: ‘Those close to Anuj Bidve will be distraught that the thug that killed him is seemingly enjoying his time behind bars. Tory MP David Davis added: ‘Most people agree he should never be let out of prison and he shouldn’t be given leeway to pursue his hobbies whilst in there.’ But penal reform campaigners defended Strangeways. Andrew Neilson, of the Howard League, said: ‘Arts play an important part in helping people change their lives. ‘If this project is making him less likely to reoffend then it needs to be welcomed. ‘There is anecdotal evidence that art is a therapy which makes people think about what they have done and for that very reason the prison should be applauded.’ The special unit at Strangeways was home to Stapleton and other notorious criminals including police killer Dale Cregan. Both are now living on a general wing. Last night the Ministry of Justice said it did not comment on individual offenders. Pictured from left are Mr Bidve's brother in law Rakesh Sonawane, mother Yogini Bidve, and father Subhash Bidve outside the Houses of Parliament during a visit with MP Keith Vaz in the wake of their Mr Bidve's death .

"The boyfriend of a Pennsylvania college freshman is facing a homicide charge after her lifeless body was found inside a campus dormitory. Authorities said Monday they added the charge of criminal homicide against 19-year-old Gregorio Orrostieta after an autopsy showed signs that Millersville University student Karlie Hall, 18, had suffered multiple injuries from a beating and had been strangled. Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman says Orrostieta didn't mention anything about strangulation when he told police he shoved Hall and hit her with the back of his hand. Scroll down for video . Fatal fight: Karlie Hall, 18 (left), was found dead in her dorm room at Millersville University early Sunday morning. Following her death, her boyfriend Gregorio Orrostieta, 19 (right), was arrested and charged with assault . Issues: The teen couple reportedly got into a physical fight shortly before Hall was found dead. Above, Hall's dormitory at Millersville University . Orrostieta told police that he and Hall got into an argument at a party Saturday night but that they amde up by the time they returned to her dorm room around 1:30am. However, they started arguing again around 2am and the altercation turned violent. Happier time: In a picture posted to Facebook just one day before her death, Hall is seen leaning in for a kiss with a man who appears to be her boyfriend (left) Residents in the dorm overheard the couple arguing around that time but when an RA went to knock on Hall's door no one answered. Police believe Hall died then, but it wasn't until 5am that her boyfriend called 911 asking for paramedics. When emergency responders arrived on the scene, they found Orrostieta performing CPR on his unresponsive girlfriend, with blood smeared on his face and dried in some areas. His shirt was also ripped, with scratch marks on his chest with more blood on his hands and jeans. Hall was allegedly 'severely beaten' according to anonymous sources quoted by Lancaster Online. Orrostieta told police that he shoved Hall in teh course of their fight, which caused her to fall and hit her head on a chair. He then hit her with the back of the hand and that's when he said she passed out. The teen was initially charged with just aggravated assault, but those charges were increased to include homicide when an autopsy performed Monday showed Hall suffered stangulation. ""He's responsible and we're going to hold him accountable,"" Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman told reporters at a news conference on Monday. Orrostieta and Hall had allegedly been dating for 11 months. Dorm residents said the two also got into a fight last fall where authoritites were called. 'I knew that the relationship wasn't that great,' Hall's friend, Trisha Faust, 19, said. 'It was on-again, off-again.' Hit her head? Orrostieta (right) allegedly told police that the two got into a fight and that he shoved his girlfriend (left) who fell and hit her head on a chair. An autopsy revealed that Hall was strangled . Hall was a freshman from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. Orrostieta, of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, did not attend the Lancaster County university. The university is about an hour drive from Orrostieta's home. He appears to have been visiting Hall for the weekend, according to a picture she posted to Facebook just one day before her death. In the picture, the couple appear happy as they lean in for a kiss, Hall wearing a Millersville University t-shirt. Orrostieta is being held at the Lancaster County Prison after being unable to post $1.5million bail. In his mug shot, blood is visible on Orrostieta's brow. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for February 19. Officials said university counseling staff will be available on campus to talk to students who need assistance.","Millersville University freshman Karlie Hall, 18, was found dead in her college dorm room early Sunday morning .

"This is the terrifying moment a female lion tamer was mauled by one of her animals in a circus in Egypt - ten years after her husband was killed performing the same act. Faten El-Helw is seen prancing around the ring and waving to her adoring fans when the big cat suddenly leaps from its stool and lunges at her. As the panicked audience jump to their feet  screaming, the lion tamer is pinned to the ground and bitten in the shoulder. Scroll down for video . Floored: Dramatic footage shows the moment a lion lunges at circus performer Faten El-Helw in Egypt . Footage of the incident, which took place in the Egyptian city of Tanta, was uploaded to YouTube and has been watched more than 50,000 times in three days. When the video begins, the lion that is about to launch the attack can be seen sitting on a stool on the left-hand side of the shot - with two more of the big cats also in the ring. In the blink of an eye, the animal lunges towards the circus owner - dramatically flooring her. Amazingly, Ms El-Helw was able to get up and was led to safety while another circus worker coaxed the lions back into their cages. Waves to audience: The lion tamer prances around the ring during the routine act. To the left of the picture, the lion that attacks her is sat on a stool . She suffered a hairline fracture to her pelvis and was rushed to hospital, where after three days she is in a stable condition, Ahram Online reports. The El-Helw family is renowned in Egypt for their lion-taming, with a history of circus performing dating back to the 19th century. Ms El-Helw's late husband Ibrahim died from his injuries after being attacked by a lion in 2004. The troupe at their latest circus, the Egyptian-European Circus, has been performing to audiences all over Egypt since the mid-1990s. Lion dismounts: The animal suddenly leaps from its position and prepares to pounce on an oblivious Ms El-Helw - whose husband was killed by a lion ten years ago in a similar act . Lucky to be alive: The lion bit the circus performer on the shoulder and she also suffered a broken pelvis . Over the years, there have been at least five reported incidents of family members being attacked by their own lions. Family patriarch Mohamed El-Helw also died at Egypt’s National Circus in the 1980s after being mauled when he tried to break up a fight between two of the animals during mating season. On his deathbed, he famously asked that the lion be spared - but the animal refused to eat any food following the clash and eventually died of starvation.","Circus owner seen prancing around ring and waving to audience in Tanta .

"A former public schoolboy who has joined the fight against ISIS today insisted he would never be captured alive and vowed: 'I’ve got a grenade in my pocket and I’ll take them with me'. A former Young Conservative, the man gave up a top job in the City in December to volunteer with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Iraq and Syria. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline from Iraq, he attacked David Cameron for failing to tackle extremism and called on him to 'do the right thing' by offering more support in the war. The man, who went to a £23,000-a-year public school but is operating under the 'nom de guerre' of Macer Gifford , also vowed to stay on the front line until the terror group has been crushed. The 28-year-old, who once stood as a Tory councillor, said: 'I passionately believe in democracy and freedom of speech – all the rights we take for granted in the UK. 'I have left my family and a comfortable life in Britain to risk suffering the most horrific death at the hands of ISIS. 'But they won’t take me alive. I’ve got a grenade in my pocket and I’ll blow myself up and take them with me. I won’t let my family see me publicly executed.' A former public schoolboy has given up a top job in the City to volunteer on the front line in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria after saying he felt compelled to battle for their freedoms . In an exclusive interview with MailOnline from Iraq, the man attacked David Cameron for failing to tackle extremism and called on him to 'do the right thing' by giving more support to the Kurdish forces . The man left for Syria two weeks before Christmas after telling his parents he going to Istanbul for a low-paid job with the Kurds. ‘I was about to start work at a major bank, but the idea of coming out here and helping the Kurds meant much more to me. ‘I want to help the Kurdish people. I want to shine a light on their plight here. ‘It was the Kurdish people who took the fight to ISIS and now have the chance to build their own country.' But he said the Kurdish people were being let down by a failure to act in the West, notably from Britain. He told MailOnline: 'The British government hasn’t done enough. ‘If David Cameron was in the room with me now, I would say that he must stick to the core values of the Conservative Party, which is liberty and justice. ‘I’d tell him not to play politics with this and take a stance on principle. 'If the British government were to help more – even just with non-lethal equipment like night-vision goggles and trainers – the Kurds would win this war much more quickly.' Weapons training: The former Young Conservative gave up a top job in the City in December to volunteer with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) in Iraq and Syria in the battle against ISIS . His comments come a day after MPs blasted Britain's ‘tiny’ role in the global fight against Islamic State terrorists. Just days after the sickening video of a Jordanian pilot being burnt alive emerged, the Defence Select Committee attacked Britain’s contribution as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘deeply concerning’. The UK has so far carried out only 6 per cent of the air strikes against Islamist jihadists – amounting to less than one a day, the committee’s report will reveal. And there were only three UK military personnel outside the Kurdish regions of Iraq, compared with 400 Australians, 280 Italians and 300 Spanish, when the MPs visited Iraq before Christmas. Since arriving in the Middle East, he has been trained up by the YPG in the mountains. He has also been helping to move weapons across the border and train other would-be fighters as they bolster resistance in the region. He is one of a just a handful of British fighters who are known to have joined the Kurds. Two others - ex-solders James Hughes from Worcestershire, and Jamie Read, from Lanarkshire - were both out fighting last year, but returned home over fears for their family's safety. Since arriving in the Middle East, he has been trained up by the YPG in the mountains and is now helping them to move weapons across the borders surrounding Syria as they bolster resistance in the area . Left a comfortable life: The man went to a £23k-a-year boarding school before studying politics at university . His new life is a far cry from the one he left behind. He grew up in a quaint village in the East Midlands with his mother, a retired fitness instructor, his photographer father and two brothers. He went to a £23,000-a-year boarding school before studying politics at university. During his studies, he also found time to become one of the youngest people to run for public office when he stood in council elections in 2006. He also worked for a Tory MP. After he graduated, he would go on to begin a career in finance - like so many others from his background. But he always had a desire to not be pinned down to an office job. His father told MailOnline: 'He's always off on one escapade or another, we never know what he's doing. 'It's not done my health or my wife's health much good over the years.' During his second year at university, he went to Zimbabwe to work with human rights lawyer David Colthard, who was then the shadow Minster for Education of the opposition party. He was intrigued by Mr Colthard's role in Zimbabwe's opposition. During his studies, he also found time to become one of the youngest people to run for public office when he stood in council elections in 2006. He also worked for a Tory MP . The man, who uses the nom de guerre Macer Gifford, left for Syria two weeks before Christmas after telling his parents he going to Istanbul for a low-paid job with the Kurds . He then went to work for a marine security company defending boats from pirates in the horn of Africa. But he was based in a London office and it seems he got itchy feet. His next adventure was in a country which is ranked the eighth most dangerous in the world, the Democratic Republic of Congo. This time, he was sponsored by the charity PAP-DRC to go into the Ituri Forest, in the east of the country, to find and map the pygmy villages. He was also there to help them, as the pygmys are thought of as second class citizens in the central African country. Exactly how dangerous a country he had travelled into was about to become all too clear when he found himself held at gunpoint by a group  army deserters. The deserters said they were 'killing monkeys' - but his charm got them out of the situation. He is also fighting alongside the Kurdish Women's Protection Unit in Syria and Iraq . But the experience certainly didn't dissuade him from either his love of adventure or his desire to help those less fortunate. He toured Ethiopia and Somaliland for several months in between lucrative jobs in currency trading. So when, two weeks before Christmas, he told his parents he was off to Istanbul to take a low-paid job helping the Kurds, they didn't think twice. 'He's always been interested in politics, right from day one. He's very, very passionate. He always wants to help people,' said his mother. However, he didn't reveal his end destination to his parents - who only discovered where their son was later. 'He went to Istanbul and changed planes and went to Northern Iraq,' his father revealed. 'From there he went overland to the Kurdish area of Turkey and now he is between Syria and Turkey.' MailOnline has chosen to use alternative names and leave out some details at the man's request over fears for his family's safety.","British man, 28, is volunteering with the Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria .

"A Utah man has allegedly shot dead his girlfriend and then tried, and failed, to commit suicide just hours after telling her family he was planning to propose to her on Valentine's Day. Christian Emerson, 26, is a convicted rapist but had been dating Amanda Hoyt, also 26, for about a year. Police believe he pulled out a gun while the two were driving home from a family birthday party on Sunday night and shot Hoyt several times. He then shot himself in the head. Amanda Hoyt was shot multiple times and killed by her boyfriend Christian Emerson while the two were driving home from a birthday party . Emerson posted this photo around Halloween time of him wearing a Michael Myers mask from the 'Halloween' slasher movies. He joked on his Facebook page that he's a serial killer . Authorities were called to the Salt Lake City suburb of North Logan, Utah, about midnight after Emerson's Subaru crashed into a curb. Inside, they found Hoyt dead and Emerson with a gunshot wound to the head, the Deseret News reports. Emerson was flown to the hospital and is expected to survive his injury. Hoyt's stepfather says Emerson had pulled him aside just hours before and said he wanted to propose to her on Valentine's Day. 'We talked for a little while, and then I knew that they were thinking about getting married around Christmas of this year,' Jeff Tingey told the newspaper. Mr Tingey said no one in the family ever had any indication that Emerson was violent. Hoyt had been dating Emerson for about a year and he recently told her family he planned to propose on Valentine's Day . 'I feel pretty confident in my abilities to discern if there was something that didn't feel right, and I never saw this one coming. All I saw was somebody who deeply loved Amanda,' he said. Mr Tingey said Emerson was open about his 2007 rape conviction. Emerson is on the sexual assault registry in Utah for the crime, which was committed in Oregon. Emerson's Facebook profile picture shows him and Hoyt smiling together and both of them have several happy photos posted to their social media accounts. Emerson also posted a photo of himself wearing a creepy Michael Myers mask from the 'Halloween' slasher films. When a friend commented: 'Dude that makes you look like a serial killer just thought I'd let you know that,' he responded: 'I am lol.' Hoyt, who had suffered diabetes since she was a girl, recently underwent surgery and was on the mend. Mr Tigey said she was 'turning her life around' and planned to attend school to become a nursing assistant.","Christian Emerson, 26, shot his girlfriend Amanda Hoyt, also 26, several times before shooting himself in the head, police say .

"Health officials can now add Georgia to the list of states affected by a surge in measles cases--a list that now includes 122 patients in 18 states and the District of Columbia. Authorities in Georgia announced Monday that an infant brought into Atlanta from outside the United States has tested positive for the highly contagious and potentially dangerous virus. This suggests the child may not be among over 100 cases and counting that have been traced back to an outbreak that originated from Disneyland in early January. Plus Georgia: The CDC will need to update its list of states affected by the current surge in measles cases after Georgia health officials announced monday an infant in Atlanta has tested positive for the virus . The Georgia baby is being treated at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta according to a Georgia Department of Public Health statement obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It was unclear from the department's statement from where the child had traveled. All but 18 of the cases are tied to an outbreak that started at the Disneyland amusement park in California. Until recently, it was unusual to see more than 100 cases a year in the United States. A fact many have linked to the anti-vaccination movement. Uptick: The Georgia case puts the number of a cases so far this year at 122--a number that puts 2015 on par to easily surpass the 644 cases reported last year . Most of this year's measles cases have been traced back to an early January outbreak at Disneyland in California. The Georgia infant came into Atlanta from outside the United States, making it unlikely the child is among the over 100 who've thus far become infected following a trip to the theme park . According to the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. experienced 23 measles outbreaks in 2014. One of these outbreaks saw 383 infections total, most of them among unvaccinated Amish populations in Ohio. Measles are most commonly seen in winter and early spring, brought in by foreign visitors or by U.S. residents who pick up the highly contagious virus overseas. Last week, the CDC announced 102 total cases in the U.S. so far this year. With an increase of 20 in just a week, 2015 is on par to easily surpass last year's total of 644 cases, notes the Washington Post. Measles has become relatively rare in the United States, thanks to very effective vaccine. A recent outbreak tied to Disneyland has shown that even among some doctors, knowledge of the once-common illness is spotty. Some questions and answers about a still-dangerous disease that's re-emerged as a leading public health concern: . Measles: An electron microscope image of a measles virus particle . Q: How dangerous is measles? A: For most people, measles is miserable but not life-threatening. The most common symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, and a rash all over the body. However, a very small fraction of people get much sicker, and can suffer complications like pneumonia and encephalitis. Before there was a vaccine, about 450 to 500 Americans died from measles each year, on average. Also, measles can cause pregnant women to have premature, fragile babies. Q: How is measles spread? A: Measles is considered one of the most infectious diseases known. The virus is spread through the air when someone infected coughs or sneezes. It can live up to two hours in the air or on the surfaces of a room afterward. It's so contagious that 90 percent of people who aren't immunized are infected if exposed to the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Q: How well does the vaccine work? A: Health officials say the vaccine is 97 percent effective; people who are vaccinated can still get the measles, although it's usually a mild case. The vaccine was licensed in the United States in 1963, and as more children were vaccinated, cases plummeted. About a decade ago, the nation was down to fewer than 100 cases a year. In 2000, measles was declared eliminated - no longer constantly spreading in the country. Q: Who should be vaccinated? A: The government recommends that all children get measles vaccine with the first dose when they are about 1 and a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6. The CDC guidance is based on advice from a panel of experts that decides which vaccines are needed and when. Following that guidance, states have made vaccination a requirement for attending school. Q: Are there any side effects? A: Most people have no reaction. Some experience temporary pain or swelling where the needle went in. About 5 to 10 percent of those who get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine experience a low-grade fever and a mild rash, according to the CDC. Recommended: A doctor in Miami administers the measles vaccine to a four-year-old girl. Parents have been reluctant to vaccinate their children due to suggestions of a link between vaccinations and autism . Q: Do most parents get their kids vaccinated? A: Yes, and the rates have been fairly stable. Overall, 95 percent of children entering kindergarten are vaccinated. But in a number of states, a rising number of parents have filed for exemptions to vaccination requirements. Some are for medical reasons, but many are for religious or philosophical reasons. Some of those involve doubts that the vaccine is necessary. Others fear that the vaccine can cause autism - a concern sparked by a study published in a British medical journal in 1998. That paper was later retracted and thoroughly discredited. Other studies have found no link. The new outbreak has spurred a backlash against vaccination holdouts. Q: So if measles was eliminated in the U.S., why are we seeing cases now? A: Measles is still a big problem in some other parts of the world, and travelers infected abroad can bring the virus into the country and spread it. That's what California health officials think happened at Disneyland amusement park, although they haven't found the person who triggered the outbreak. The last several years have seen more and more of that. Last year, 644 measles infections were reported in 27 states, the most since 1994. More than half of the cases were in an Amish community in Ohio; missionaries brought measles back from the Philippines. Q: I'm an adult. Do I need a shot? A: Most likely not. Anyone born before 1957 is thought to be immune because measles was so widespread, and most kids got it. Adults who got the vaccine as kids are OK, too - they are protected for life. However, there was a less-effective vaccine from 1963 to 1967. Anyone who got that vaccine or those who aren't sure they were ever vaccinated can get the shots now.

"The Army fell short of its recruitment target in 2014, despite the Ministry of Defence's £30million spending on TV adverts. It has also emerged that up to a third of the Army's top brass will be cut in a command 'revolution'. The MoD splashed out £14.5millon on Royal Navy commercials, £6million on the Army and £8million on the Royal Air Force. But despite the lucrative campaign, only 6,000 people signed up to the Army last year - falling shy of the 10,000 it needed. Big spenders: The Ministry of Defence spent £30million on TV adverts for the armed forces in 2014 . Revelation: The TV ad figures were revealed after a parliamentary question by Labour's Kevan Jones . Failure: espite the lucrative drive to attract recruits, only 6,000 people signed up to the Army last year - well shy of its 10,000 target. The TV advert figures were revealed after a parliamentary question by Labour's Kevan Jones. It has also emerged that up to a third of the Army's top brass will be cut. The plans by General Sir Nicholas Carter, the new head of the army, will see many of the army's 500 colonels and 200 brigadiers axed. The changes will be in place from April and are designed to reduce bureaucracy and make the force more professional. It follows revelations in Parliament that another 20,000 cuts to soldiers are also in the pipeline. Sir Nick Harvey, a former defence minister, told MPs last week that the Ministry of Defence had drawn up secret proposals which would see another 20,000 troops axed. Under an Armed Forces shake-up, ministers are already cutting the strength of the regular Army by 20,000 to 82,000. They are also planning to double the part-time Territorial Army – now called the Army Reserve – to 30,000 by 2020. But the further cuts would reduce the army to just 60,000 regular soldiers. As well as axing senior officers, General Carter wants to see 'more professional' senior officers which are trained to be loyal to the army rather than to their regiment. Recruitment drive: The MoD splashed out £14.5millon on Royal Navy commercials (right), £6million on the Army (left) and £8million on the Royal Air Force . He also wants to end obligatory two-year job rotations, allow career breaks for women to have children that do not affect the chance of promotion and also introduce performance reviews with more honest feedback. The plans have been set out after decades of weak leadership where commanders are rarely held to account, according to more than a dozen former senior and more junior officers interviewed by The Times. They added that bureaucracy takes precedence over common sense and people are not encouraged to take risks. One defence official told The Times: 'It is the revolution.' Gen Carter's Army Command Review will bring sweeping changes across the whole army. However, General Rupert Smith said it may not go far enough.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said last night: 'The Army Command Review is the next step in the development of Army 2020. 'It builds on the delegated model that Defence has implemented as a result of Lord Levene's report on Defence reforms. 'It will ensure that the Army's command structure and its staff are best placed to meet future challenges in an agile, imaginative and effective manner.'","£14.5million spent on Royal Navy ads, £6million on Army, £8million on RAF .

"Dozens of Labour MPs employ staff on zero-hours contracts — despite Ed Miliband claiming they have 'no place in the 21st century'. Official figures from Parliament's expenses watchdog show 36 Labour MPs employed staff on the casual contracts last year. Some of Mr Miliband's closest allies in the Labour Party have used the contracts – including his election campaign co-ordinator Lucy Powell and parliamentary bag carrier Karen Buck – who has six staff on the contracts. Ed Miliband claimed zero-hours contracts have 'no place in the 21st century' - even though 36 Labour MPs employ staff on them . Mr Miliband has repeatedly criticised zero-hours contracts and companies using them. Just last week he said: 'If you are working regular hours then you should get a regular contract.' Zerohours contracts allow a company to vary the number of hours staff can work each week or month between full-time and none at all. Labour has insisted it is not 'exploiting' workers and the casual contracts were typically of those used to take on interns part-time. But the revelation is an embarrassment for Mr Miliband, who has vowed to tackle the 'epidemic' of zero-hours contracts if Labour wins power. Last year, Mr Miliband slammed the high street giant Sports Direct, owned by Newcastle United chief Mike Ashley. He said: 'Sports Direct has predictable turnover, it is a modern company with stores on many high streets and, judging by its success, where many people shop,' he will say. 'But for too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work. This is not about exceptional use of zero-hours contracts for short-term or seasonal work … This is the way Sports Direct employs the vast majority of its workforce. These Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century.' Last year Mr Miliband hit out at the high street chain Sports Direct for employing its staff on zero hours contracts . Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley has come under fire from politicians and union bosses for employing thousands of workers on zero-hours contracts . Last year it emerged even the shadow chancellor Ed Balls employed four staff on zero-hours contracts. Several Labour-run councils also employ staff on zero hours, including Doncaster Council, the authority in Mr Miliband's constituency which admitted employing 300 people on the contracts. Freedom of Information inquiries show that in 2013, Derby Council employed 1,333 people on the contracts, Gateshead 1,285 and Bury 3,418. All are run by Labour. Conservative MP Julian Smith MP told MailOnline the figures exposed the 'same old do-as-we-say-not-as-we-do hypocrisy from the Labour Party'. He said: ‘Ed Miliband might say he’s against zero hours contracts but his MPs ignore him and use them anyway. They are in chaos. ‘They have no long-term economic plan and can’t be trusted to keep any of their promises.’","36 Labour MPs employed staff on casual contracts last year, figures show .

"A Nova Scotia man who nearly took his own life as a teen has reconnected with the random stranger who pulled him from the brink 12 years ago. Mark Henick took, now 27, to social media in late January to search for his rescuer. Just one day later, he connected with youth care worker Mike Richey--the man who happened to be driving on the Cape Breton overpass where Henick nearly threw his life away in 2002. Now, Henick--who has since become a mental health advocate--has shared the first letter he received from his rescuer in a touching YouTube video he hopes will serve to inspire others who've lost hope. Saved by a stranger: Mark Henick was 15 when he nearly threw himself off a Nova Scotia overpass before a random stranger passing by decided to help pull him from the brink . 'This is the first time I've had any contact with this person since [that night],' Henick says in his video, which he posted January 30. In Richey's letter, he reveals to Henick that he just a happened have been starting his career helping at-risk youths. As he drove to a late shift, Richey saw 15-year-old Henick on the overpass. 'I remember there were no other cars on the road or anyone else around,' his letter reads. 'I could see what appeared to be a person on the opposite side of the railing, looking down.' Richey quickly told a gas station attendant to call the cops, then returned to Henick. So as not to startle the troubled teen, Henick 'kept things light.' 'I just wanted him to know that I was there...I wasn’t there to try to fix things for him or anything like that, I wanted him to know that no matter what, I’m not going anywhere. I’m right behind you.' A crowd gathered as the two talked. Someone among the crowd told Henick to jump. He soon let go. Saved Henick: In 2002, Mike Richey was heading to his job as an at-risk youth care worker when he noticed then 15-year-old Henick standing at the edge of an overpass. He stopped the car and starting talking to the teen . 'As [Henick] leaned forward into nothing, I reached out and put my arm around his chest,' writes Richey. With the help of a police officer who'd showed up, they pulled Henick to safety. And Richey says his long arduous road to recovery began that day. Weeks before reaching out on social media to find his rescuer, Henick--who now works for the Ontario division of the Canadian Mental Health Association, reports the Toronto Star--he'd given a TED Talk in which he described the night in 2002. Richey, by coincidence, had seen the talk and had already written the letter when he realized Henick was searching for him. Now the two men have exchanged several correspondences and plan to meet sometime in the future. And Henick wants their intersecting lives to serve as a reminder that anyone can help instill hope in the hopeless. 'I felt so alone, so isolated and secluded on that bridge, that the most powerful thing for me was that complete stranger reaching out — and I realized I can be that stranger, too, just by telling my story and just by saying that I’ve been there,' Henick says. Emotional: Henick and Richey have recently reconnected and Henick shared the heartwrenching letter Richey wrote him in a YouTube via posted January 30 .","Mark Henick was 15 when he nearly plunged off a Nova Scotia overpass after making the decision to take his own life .

"The full extent of 'bin blight' was exposed last night after a report found that the average family now has to leave four waste containers outside their home. As Britain increases its recycling of domestic waste, a survey found that nearly two-thirds of councils require households to have four or more bins and other waste containers. One council – Newcastle-under-Lyme – even requires families to have nine, meaning they often litter the streets and cause obstructions for pedestrians and drivers. As Britain increases its recycling of domestic waste, a survey found that nearly two-thirds of councils require households to have four or more bins and other waste containers . Residents of the Staffordshire borough have to sort their waste into general waste, food, cardboard, plastics, paper, glass, cans, textiles and garden waste. The survey was carried out by the National House Building Council Foundation (NHBC) as part of a report into how bins should be stored on housing developments. Neil Smith, the think tank's head of research and innovation, said: 'It sometimes seems as if insufficient attention is given to how bins are accommodated on new developments. 'Designers need to find practical ways to hide numerous wheelie bins and other containers. Alternatively, the time may have come to consider more radical solutions to solve the bin blight problem – such as shared facilities on street corners or underground bin storage.' Mr Smith said the era he remembered from his youth – when the 'bin man' would go round to the back of the house to empty a steel dustbin – were long gone. 'Hardly a feeling of nostalgia, but maybe a reminder of a simpler time when the terms 'wheelie bin' and 'bin blight' had not yet been coined,' he said. 'For my household, change started in the early Nineties when the dustbin was replaced with the black wheelie bin. Over the years, we have since amassed a green one and a blue one as well as a box for paper and a small bin for food waste. 'On the plus side, it's great that all the stuff we chuck out no longer goes to landfill; on the minus, Britain's streets are now littered with bins and containers.' Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said yesterday the Government was committed to tackling 'the scourge of bin blight' The NHBC's survey of 325 authorities found that two required one bin, 18 required two and 93 required three. Four bins was the rule in 105 authorities, five in 69, six in 33 and seven in four council areas. Newcastle-under-Lyme was out on its own. The report said: 'The widespread adoption of wheelie bins alongside the introduction of a variety of additional bins, boxes and bags for storing waste for recycling has not been without its problems. Uppermost amongst these are the difficulties households face in accommodating all these bins and containers. 'Terraced houses are particularly affected where there can be restricted access or no access to the rear of the property. 'The narrow frontage and limited front garden space can also impose further constraints.' Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said yesterday the Government was committed to tackling 'the scourge of bin blight'. 'Far too many of our streets are still dominated by the ugly clutter of unsightly bins,' he said. 'This common sense guide, backed up by revised planning rules and building regulations, will help ensure that the housing industry raises their game when building new homes.'","Nearly two-thirds of councils require households to have four or more bins .

"RAF jets were caught in a near-miss above a busy city centre when pilots commanding the flights became 'startled' by two other aircraft flying above them. Two Hawk fighter jets were performing a training flight in July when two Tornados some 500ft beneath them began their climb. Pilots were forced to divert from their path to avoid collision above Sunderland, a report into the incident revealed. The Tornados were flying above Sunderland when they became 'startled' by two Hawk fighter jets flying 500ft above them, a report has found. Above, two Tornado GR4s on a combat mission to northern Iraq . Pilots were forced to divert from their original path to avoid collision over Sunderland in the July incident . The mishap occurred after the Tornados completed a training exercise at RAF Spadeadam in Cumbria. Above Newcastle, the Hawks came into pilots' sight, with just two to three nautical miles separating the two formations, the Airprox Board report found. While the Tornado pilots knew the Hawks had been flying in the same airspace, they were told by air traffic controllers that the aircraft had begun their own climb. 'The pilot reported that having been told that the Hawks were climbing, he had expected the separation between them to increase,' the report concluded. 'He noted that under a Traffic Service the controllers were not required to achieve deconfliction minima and that separation was the pilots’ responsibility, and that in this case, had he not elected to level off they would have climbed straight through the Hawk’s level. 'Although 500ft vertical separation would be considered sufficient in many circumstances, the Board considered that because the Tornado crew were not expecting to see the Hawks only 500ft above them, they were probably startled by their proximity.' The report concluded the mishap may have been the result of information being given to pilots via air traffic in a different format than is usual. Above, two Hawk jets of the 100 Squadron . The confusion, it was said, could have been the result of air traffic information being given in an unfamiliar BRRA format. An RAF spokesperson said the Ministry of Defence could not comment about individual employees, but said: 'Safety is of paramount importance to us and safety considerations continue to be at the core of all our aviation activity. 'We welcome the recommendations made in the report and will use the lessons learnt from this incident to do whatever we can to prevent it from happening again.' In September 2013 a Hawk jet overshot the runway at Anglesy during a training flight after crashing into a stray goose. Last October an American F-15 crashed in the Lincolnshire countryside during another practice exercise. It is not known what caused the incident that is now being investigated by aviation authorities.","RAF Tornados and Hawks were flying in airspace above Sunderland .

"With a fresh wave of tension over the threat of Russian Bear bombers, it's easy to forget how closely the RAF has watched our skies for decades. A reminder is these rarely-seen images from the height of the Cold War, taken by specialist Air Ministry photographers and showing bombers, defensive missiles and the strangely beautiful forms they strike in our skies. The full-colour photographs were painstakingly collated from the Imperial War Museum archives by aviation historian Ian Proctor, who wanted to document a time when the world hung on the brink of nuclear war. Scroll down for video . Ever-ready: These full-colour photographs collated by historian Ian Proctor show the activities of the RAF at the height of the Cold War - when the threat from Russia was ever-present. Pictured, two Lightning F3s in flight over St Andrews in 1964 .

As most readers can probably tell, the image is staged for the cameras . The 160 photographs revealed publicly for the first time in his book, The Royal Air Force in the Cold War, 1950-1970, are part of a collection of 10,000 colour photographs taken by a small number of government photographers. Mr Proctor has shared the images to show the threat of Russian incursion is nothing new. David Cameron said Moscow appeared to be trying to make 'some sort of a point' which should not be dignified with  a large-scale response after two long-range Tu-95s, known as Bears, had to be accompanied off the coast of Cornwall yesterday. 'I think what this episode demonstrates is that we do have the fast jets, the pilots, the systems in place to protect the United Kingdom,' he said. Mr Proctor said: 'For the past 65 years, the RAF has maintained aircraft on a heightened alert state 24/7, 365 days a year, ready to intercept any unidentified military or civilian aircraft around the UK. 'Though there are now certainly fewer frontline squadrons and aircraft, experience gained during the Cold War along with increasingly advanced aircraft, mean the RAF's current air defences are as capable of responding to a potential threat as they had been in the 1950s and 1960s. Beauty: A Vulcan B2 XH561 of 50 Squadron, RAF Cottesmore, leads four Lightning F6s during a celebratory flight over fields in April 1968 . Formation: Javelins of 46 Squadron lined up neatly on the hard surface of RAF Odiham in July 1956. 'Even at the height of the Cold War, the armed forces were not immune to cuts,' Mr Proctor said. 'A number of defence reviews were undertaken during the period' 'Though the Cold War is over, the RAF still maintains QRA at two air stations. QRA (North) is held at RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, while QRA (South) is undertaken at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire.' Mr Proctor said although some might fear cuts are hitting Britain's capability to respond to threats, cuts have always been a reality for peacetime armed forces. 'Even at the height of the Cold War, the armed forces were not immune to cuts,' he said. 'A number of defence reviews were undertaken during the period, each ultimately reducing the number of operational aircraft or front-line squadrons, as priorities changed or technology advanced. 'In 1956 Fighter Command had no more than 600 aircraft within 35 squadrons each with 18 operational aircraft. By 1962, this had reduced to 150 aircraft in 11 squadrons. Today there are approximately 100 Typhoons in the air defence role, within five front line squadrons and one reserve, each operating an estimated 12 aircraft.' Russian sorties towards the UK have been a reality ever since Churchill announced an Iron Curtain had descended over Europe. Ian said: 'For the past few years, QRA aircraft have been scrambled on just over one day a month on average. Of these approximately only a third are in response to Russian military aircraft. Alarm: A 'Thor' missile, which could have been launched within just 15 minutes, in 1961 (left) and sunset at RAF Marham in 1969 (right) Secrecy: This eerie photo shows a nuclear Thor missile countdown exercise at night at RAF Feltwell, Norfolk, in November 1958 . 'As far as I am aware there has been no significant increase in the number of these flight over the years following the end of the Cold War. 'For Soviet aircraft to fly within British airspace during the Cold War, would have been a dangerous and provocative act, risking a response which could trigger a nuclear war. Instead they were usually flown on a course close to but outside British airspace.' 'Sorties undertaken by the TU-95 Bears along with those of the TU-16 Badgers and M-4 Bison, which together made up the Soviet Union's Cold War Strategic Bomber and Reconnaissance Force, had a number of purposes. 'Some flights were for reconnaissance, to take high and medium altitude photographs of British ports, bases, cities and coastline. 'However, the majority of flights then, as they are now, were to both test RAF air defences and train their own crews. 'By flying these sorties, irregularly and with different numbers of aircraft the Soviet Union could monitor RAF's capability to respond, the number of interceptors launched, when and where from. 'Essentially it was intelligence gathering rather than an aggressive act. Quite often the pilots of the aircraft would wave or communicate with each other during these intercepts, often to the chagrin of KGB officers on board the Soviet aircraft.

'Though publicly available information is limited, it would be naïve to believe that RAF operations did not include similar intelligence gathering flights by its bomber force. 'Certainly until the introduction of the American U2 in the early 1960s, much of NATO's reconnaissance of the Soviet Union was undertaken by RAF Canberra PR.7 aircraft. 'Similarly, modified bombers from the iconic V Force were flown to collect air samples from around the Soviet Union in order to monitor and analyse any nuclear tests undertaken.' The collection of pictures can be seen in an online archive and at the Imperial War Museum. The historian added: 'They record the aircraft daily activities of the men and women of the RAF during that dynamic period. 'A small number were used by the Air Ministry and RAF in recruitment brochures, and contemporary periodicals and newspaper supplements, but largely these are unknown and have never been seen before.

'Together the photographs portray the air force as it adapted to the combined threats of the Cold War and the frequent defence cuts of the 1950s and 1960s. 'As recruitment aids, they encouraged boys to become aircrew or skilled RAF tradesmen, both of which had seen a decline during the late 1950s. 'As a public relations tool, they promoted to the public and politicians the similarities between the RAF's vital Cold War role in defending Britain and its successes of the Second World War, then still in strong popular memory.' Mr Proctor said many of the images are still being investigated to understand their subject and context. More than 1,000 can be seen on IWM's online collection search database and more are released all the time. Figures from the MOD show the number of QRA launches in response to Russian aircraft so far have not been higher this year than previous years.

"A pilot and his wife used quick-thinking and modern technology to safely land their plane at night after the electrical systems failed. By using their iPads, they were able to navigate through nearly 80 miles in the dark before successfully bringing down the single-engine propeller plane onto a runway at Rapid City Regional Airport in South Dakota - without using landing gear. The pair, whose names have not been released, were flying the Piper PA 24-250 Comanche from Wyoming to Wisconsin when their plane had a full electrical-system failure last Friday night. A pilot and his wife used their iPads to fly nearly 80 miles in the dark after electrical systems failed on their plane . The couple, whose names have not been released, were flying from Wyoming to Wisconsin last Friday night on their single-engine propeller plane. As a result of an electrical system breakdown, the pilot and his wife used their iPads to navigate to the airport . The electrical failure caused all of the on-board computers to shut down and made the pilot unable to extend landing gear onto the runway, according to KEVN Black Hills Fox. The only cockpit instruments he and his wife had available to them were airspeed and altitude indicators. As they were also unable to alert traffic controllers that they were entering Rapid City airspace, they had to abruptly crash-land the plane onto the runway. Tower employees reported seeing sparks beneath the bottom of the plane as it skidded to a stop, according to KDLT. They were also unable to alert traffic controllers that they were entering Rapid City airspace, and without landing gear, the pilot landed the plane on its belly on a runway used for smaller planes . Thanks to their Apple devices, the couple landed safely at the Rapid City Regional Airport (above) in South Dakota . 'He had to be a super good pilot,' said Department Battalion Chief Tim Daly. A firefighter and Aircraft Rescue specialist Jerry Lueras made contact with the pilot and his wife following their landing. The couple was able to exit the plane without any injuries and were given a brief medical examination. Officials have to investigate the impromptu landing, and said it will likely take time before the plane is flown again. 'We're glad for the support of the Rapid City Fire Department, as well as the support of our operations and maintenance crews at the airport,' said Toni Broom, Deputy Airport Director for Finance and Administration. 'This was a great example of our teamwork, and we're happy that there were no injuries from these incidents.'","Couple, whose names have not been released, were flying from Wyoming to Wisconsin on their single-engine propeller plane .

"The Islamic State is experiencing a shortage of suicide bombers after dozens of fighters deserted the terror group or defected to rival militias. Reports from inside the ISIS-stronghold of Raqqa claim that a rebellion among a 'martyrs battalion' is a severe blow to the ISIS leadership who recruit foreign fighters for their suicide operations. According to the respected anti-ISIS activists, Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently, ISIS has seen dozens of militants earmarked for suicide operations flee the battlefield or defect to other groups. The news comes after ISIS was forced to admit defeat in the key battle for the northern Syrian town of Kobane, where it deployed many suicide bombers in what turned out to be a lost cause. Recent Coalition air strikes have also decimated ISIS's leadership leaving its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi short of experienced commanders. Scroll down for videos . Terrorists: Reports from inside the ISIS-stronghold of Raqqa claim that a rebellion among a 'martyrs battalion' is a severe blow to the IS leadership who recruit foreign fighters for their suicide operations . Loss: News of the defections comes just weeks after ISIS was forced to pull out of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane (pictured) after it became little more than a vortex of death for the terror group . A source from inside Raqqa, the capital of the Islamic State in Syria, told Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently that ISIS has set up road blocks and imposed strict security checks to stop suicide bombers abandoning their missions. RIBSS's Abu Mohammed said: 'There is great tension in Raqqa city, where IS group suffered many defections in the past few days, a source from within IS has confirmed that most of defections are from suicide bombers, where these defections are considered a painful blow to the group.' He claims anyone caught deserting their position faces summary execution. He said the constant aerial bombardment and fierce fighting in Kobane, the border town on the Turkish border, has caused many foreign fighters and members of the suicide units to desert. ISIS leaders select foreign jihadists for suicide missions because they usually arrive in Syria with little or no battlefield experience and so have no military value. According to one ISIS insider who fled the group, special training camps have been set up inside Syria which filter out foreigners with no military experience and prepare them for suicide operations. ISIS militants are seen being hit by an American airstrike on a hill just outside Kobane. The group have since ended their siege of the city after suffering significant losses . A security source who works with British Muslim communities on combating extremism told MailOnline that he had been made aware of a number of British fighters who had been unprepared for the reality of Syria: . 'The problem is that young British Muslims who go over to Syria thinking they will be treated like equal brothers by IS find out very quickly that they are being told to strap on suicide vets and prepare for Jannah [heaven]....it's hardly surprising that they have cold feet about these missions.' News of the defections comes just weeks after ISIS was forced to pull out of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane after it became little more than a vortex of death for the terror group in the face of a brave resistance from thousands of Kurdish men and women. Last month a senior U.S. official said ISIS militants had started defying their commanders orders to venture inside the city, such was their fear of dying at the hands of Kurdish fighters. This reluctance to continue the fight to capture Kobane eventually led to the terrorists withdrawing to villages in the suburbs, before Kurdish troops eventually forced them to pull back even further towards their strongholds elsewhere in northern Syria. Experts believe that ISIS' frequent displays of increasing savagery - including the recent burning alive of Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh - is simply the terror group attempting to distract from its territorial losses and present itself as a united front still capable of monstrous acts and oppression. Abandoned: Last month a senior U.S. official said ISIS militants had started defying their commanders orders to venture inside Kobane (pictured), such was their fear of dying at the hands of Kurdish fighters . Last October ISIS militants were seen raising their black flag on a hill close to Kobane and the Turkish border while Turkish soldiers stood helpless in the foreground. Kurdish resistance troops have since torn down the flag and recaptured the hill in a symbolic victory . Compounding the problems, ISIS has lost a number of high ranking commanders to sustained airstrikes from Western and Arab warplanes in recent months. Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. His death and that of as many as nine others on ISIS' 18-man leadership council have forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists becomes increasingly small. Speaking to MailOnline, Charlie Winter from counter-extremism think tank Quilliam said: 'Obviously ISIS do get through quite a few suicide bombers but I think there's always a risk that people will run off at the last minute.' 'I do think a lot of the talk of Islamic State being in decline is to an extent wishful thinking but it certainly is having a tougher time of things now,' he said. '[However] there's still a broad base of support in  Iraq and Syria.It is seen as the lesser of two evils by a significant amount of people who wouldn't want to return to the status quo,' he added. 'Kobane was a great loss for Islamic State, it was a big symbolic loss. But losing Kobane doesn't mean that Islamic State is going to keep on losing everywhere. In its essence it is a nebulous entity - where it loses in one area, it can expand it another,' Mr Winter went on to say. 'For example, as it has been rolled back in Iraq, it has taken more territory in Syria. That said it's not storming across the country as it had been a few months ago and it is under much greater financial pressure now, given the price of oil,' he added. Blew himself up: At least three British jidhadists are known to have taken part in ISIS suicide missions. Abu Hajar al-Britani carried out the attack in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji last November . First British suicide bomber: Abdul Waheed Majid (pictured), aka the 'Crawley bomber', was the first British militant to carry out a so-called 'martyrdom operation' in Syria last February. Abu Hajar killed eight Iraqi policemen in a suicide mission last November . At least three British jidhadists are known to have taken part in  ISIS suicide missions. Britain's first suicide bomber in Syria was Abdul Waheed Majeed - a 41-year-old father-of-three from Crawley in West Sussex - who blew himself up in February when he drove a lorry laden with explosives into a jail in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Video of a Majeed driving a Mad Max-style truck towards the jail before a spectacular explosion appeared on YouTube video released by the terror extremists. Relatives said the father of three was a former lorry driver who had worked for the Highways Agency but gave up his job in 2013 to join a convoy running aid into Syria. Photographs also emerged showing Majeed in a refugee camp before the bombing, sporting Micky Mouse ears while posing with local children. In one picture, Majeed is seen wearing pink Minnie Mouse-style ears while he cuddles a child. In another, he is pictured kneeling surrounded by children as they give the peace sign. Shortly after the bombing mission extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed desribed Majeed was 'a very dear brother'. He claimed Majeed had been an active student and valued member of the banned extremist Al-Muhajiroun organisation between 1996 and 2004 and had wanted to further the 'Muslim cause'. Comments: Shortly after the suicide bombing mission extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed desribed Majeed was 'a very dear brother . Bakri said Majeed would organise his sermons in Crawley and record the lectures and distribute them, adding: 'He was a good brother. He was someone who was always at hand to help people. 'He wanted to study Islam and wanted to know what it was to be a good Muslim. He was also very interested in the issue of how we could establish an Islamic state.' In November Kabir Ahmed, from Derby, took part in a suicide bomb attack in the town of Beiji, north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Shortly before the attack Ahmed had appeared on Panorama, where he said that foreign fighters were volunteering for suicide missions and asking local commanders to be pushed up the list to become a suicide bomber. Later that month Abu Hajar al-Britani carried out the attack in the strategic Iraqi town of Baiji, reportedly destroying a significant number of tanks and artillery equipment. A photo was released by ISIS' media branch for the province of Salahuddin, showing Abu Hajar al-Britani in full military uniform before his attack.","Dozens of would-be suicide bombers left ISIS before carrying out missions .

"Police officers saved fish from a broken tank while a vulnerable man suffocated and died in front of them, an inquest has heard. PCs Maurice Leigh and Neil Bowdery, of Kent Police, were sent to the home of escaped psychiatric patient Colin Holt when he started behaving aggressively, and during the struggle one of them was thrown against a fish tank which broke across the floor. The officers restrained Mr Holt, 52, by holding him down on an armchair with his face to one side, while three other officers arrived as back up - PCs Lynda Edwicker, Glen Rickersey and Neil Bowdery. Police officers saved fish from a broken tank while psychiatric patient Colin Holt suffocated and died in front of them, an inquest has heard . PCs Edwicker and Rickersey said they both recalled PC Leigh say Mr Holt was 'out cold', an inquest in Maidstone has heard. But despite his condition PC Edwicker was said to have desperately tried to save the fish and not the man. PC Leigh, giving evidence at the inquest, said he heard her say: 'I've saved the fish, I've saved the fish.' David Bentley QC, representing Mr Holt's family, told Pc Leigh: 'Others were looking after the fish, you were looking after Mr Holt. 'There were some quite active efforts of people trying to save the lives of some fish but in the meantime there were no efforts to tend to Mr Holt.' Mr Bentley went on to suggest that Mr Holt was indeed 'out cold' at that point but PC Leigh responded: 'Mr Holt was never out cold.' PCs Maurice Leigh (right) and Neil Bowdery (left), of Kent Police, were sent to the home of escaped psychiatric patient Colin Holt when he started behaving aggressively, and during the struggle one of them was thrown against a fish tank which broke across the floor . The inquest heard that Mr Holt later died of positional asphyxia, which occurs when a person's position prevents them from breathing while being detained. It has taken nearly five years to hold the inquest, which is before a jury in Maidstone, Kent. The inquest was told Mr Holt had escaped from the psychiatric ward in Medway Hospital before being found in his flat in Twydall, Kent. Officers were sent to his home as Mr Holt, who was a paranoid schizophrenic, was wanted on a Mental Health Act order. He began acting strangely, claiming 'that's not me, I'm Alfred Marx', before becoming agitated and aggressive towards the police officers. When the other officers arrived following the struggle, PC Reeves left to get treatment leaving PC Leigh to look after him, the jury was told. An ambulance was called and paramedics tried to revive him for 20 minutes. Despite the post-mortem proving he died of suffocation PC Leigh insisted Mr Holt remained conscious all the time he was restraining him. The inquest was told Mr Holt had escaped from the psychiatric ward in Medway Hospital before being found in his flat in Twydall, Kent (pictured) He said: 'When I left the premises he was alive, his eyes were open.' Mr Bentley challenged his account and suggested he was losing consciousness. He said: 'He's out of breath, he's breathing heavily, he's becoming quieter and more tranquil. 'Looking back at what was going on, this man must have been suffocating at the time you were monitoring him.' Mr Bentley said the officers had been worried that water from the fish tank could cause an electrical fault and quoted a statement from PC Edwicker. He said: 'I heard PC Rickersey say ""Colin, tell us where the electricity box is"". I heard PC Leigh say ""don't waste your breath Glen, he's out cold."" PC Leigh refuted that too, saying: 'I did not say it. I did not say those comments.' PC Leigh and PC Neil Bowdery were cleared of misconduct in public office at a trial at Maidstone Crown Court in May 2013. The inquest, expected to last up to four weeks, continues.

"A disgraced politician accused of defrauding $200million of government funds used some of the money to buy cars, homes and luxuries for a prostitute with whom he had a son, it is claimed. Mario Zelaya, 46, the former head of the national health service in Honduras, became infatuated with Natalia Ciuffardi, 28, after he met her at a strip club-cum-brothel in Chile. He showered her with gifts and promised to help her leave the Platinum Club brothel in the capital Santiago de Chile, where she was working as a high-class prostitute charging £300 an hour. The Chilean Geisha: Natalia Ciuffardi, 28, was the mistress of Honduran health chief Mario Zelaya, who is alleged to have used money from a $200million fraud to buy her homes and cars . Secret affair: Ciuffardi pictured with Zelaya, former director of the Honduran national health service, who showered her with valuable gifts and eventually fathered a son with her . In custody: Ciuffardi is now facing potential extradition to Honduras after she was implicated in the scam . Eventually Ciuffardi fell pregnant and Zelaya, already a married father-of-three, bought her homes and cars as well as sending her thousands of dollars a month to look after their son. But she is now facing extradition to Honduras after she was implicated in the $200million fraud allegedly orchestrated by Zelaya over the four years he spent in charge of his country's public health system. She maintains her innocence. 'He was very charming and I had no reason to suspect that the money he was giving me was not his own. How am I supposed to know that he had been stealing it?' she was quoted as saying by Central European News. 'I fell in love with him and when I became pregnant it was logical for me to leave and start a new life with the man who I thought I knew.' Chile's courts are due to make a decision this week on whether to extradite Ciuffardi. According to her statements about to the court about her relationship with Zelaya, she first met him while working as a prostitute in 2011. On that first night, she said, he had appeared at the Platinum Club in a group and spotted her when she sat down where he would be able to see her. He soon asked a waiter how he could be with her, she said, and she had sex with him after he agreed to pay about $230. They began an affair, with the wealthy politician treating Ciuffardi to beach holidays and beseeching her to give up her work as a prostitute. She said he would spend one week in every month with her, and that he had apparently been telling his wife, Michelle Alejandra Flores Borjas, 42, and their three children that he was in Chile on business. Police said she continued working as a stripper and prostitute but stopped when she got pregnant, after which Zelaya maintained her with monthly payments of up to $5,000 a month. His generosity did not stop there. As their relationship continued, Cuffiardi is said to have received gifts including two apartments, a house on the beach, two SUV cars, expensive perfumes, watches, clothes and purses. Pro-business: Zelaya got his job at the head of the Honduran health service after a military coup ousted the country's left-wing president Manuel Zelaya - no relation - in 2009 . High-class prostitute: Ciuffardi and Zelaya met while she was working as a hooker at the Platinium club in Santiago de Chile. They began an affair after he paid her about $230 for sex . But in early 2014 it all came to an end when a Honduran court ordered Zelaya arrested on charges of fraud, bribery, abuse of public funds and money laundering. Zelaya fled, but not before warning his girlfriend he may never see her again. 'The first I knew that anything was wrong was when he called me and asked me to forgive him. He said I'll understand him one day,' she said. 'He asked me to always say good things about him to our son. And that he felt sorry for what happened, but we are never ever going to meet again.' Last September Zelaya was finally captured in the southern state of El Paraiso, which borders Nicaragua. Prosecutors discovered more than $7 million worth of assets including mansions, apartments, land and vehicles under Zelaya's control. It was a dramatic fall from grace for Zelaya, who had been a respected doctor and also served for several years in the Honduran army. His rise to power began in 2009 when Honduras's left-wing former president Manuel Zelaya - who is of no relation - was ousted in a coup backed by the U.S. The country's new president, Porfirio Lobo, appointed Zelaya to the top post on the IHSS. Dana Frank, a Honduras specialist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, said that under Lobo crime and corruption mushroomed. 'They just threw the rule of law out the door,' she told the New Orleans Advocate, adding that since the coup the country's leaders have clamped down on civil liberties, including freedom of speech. The wife: Michelle Alejandra Flores Borjas, who is also implicated in Zelaya's alleged embezzlements . Soon after his appointment, Zelaya is alleged to have begun accepting $2million in bribes from a Honduran consulting company, said to be the beginning of a campaign of fraud and embezzlement which took in unjustified purchases, exorbitant contracts, airline tickets, travel and hotel stays. Zelaya left the IHSS, which covers 1.6 million Hondurans, in precarious financial shape after allegedly overpaying companies, some formed by his former IHSS subordinates, according to Honduras's National Anti-Corruption Board. Now Ciuffardi is part of the corruption probe as well. She said the fact that officials in Honduras had not even realised the money was stolen for so long meant that it was also impossible for her to know. She said: 'He told me he would change my life. He promised he would help me leave my job and we would build a home together. I believed him and I fell in love with him.'","Natalia Ciuffardi, 28, met Manuel Zelaya at a brothel in Santiago de Chile .

"A meteor streaking though the night sky above the English Channel has been captured on camera. The fireball, which was filmed off the coast of Dawlish in Devon by a webcam, appears to burn up in the sky before disappearing. The footage was spotted by the operators of a live webcam set up beside a section of railway line in Dawlish. The blazing fireball footage was captured at around 1am last Wednesday. It flares brightly above Lyme Bay, just off the caost of Devon, for a few seconds before vanishing close to the horizon. Lyrids - Apr 18-25 . eTA Aquarids - Apr 19-May 28 . June BoötidS - Jun 22-Jul 2 . Delta Aquarids - Jul 15-Aug 20 . Alpha Capricornids - Jul 15-Aug 15 . Perseids - Jul 17-Aug 24 . Kappa Cygnids - Aug 3-25 . Alpha Aurigids - Aug 25-Sep 10 .

December Leo Minorids - Dec 5-Feb 4 . Coma Berenicids - Dec 12-23 . Ursids - Dec 17-25 . Simon Dean, one of the operators of the webcam at Dawlish Beach Camera, said he had been watching the live camera footage when he saw the fireball. He said that he often checks the camera to watch night-time repairs being carried out on the railway track after it was damaged in storms last year. Mr Dean, who lives in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, said: 'The camera has a night time mode and I just happened to be looking at it when I saw this bright light move across the sky. 'I wasn't really sure what I saw so I asked Neil Salter who runs the camera to send me the footage so I could have another look. 'We are not really sure what it is, but it looks like it could be a meteor.' After the footage was posted on the webcam's Facebook page, other residents in Devon began reporting seeing similar things. Steve Wilson said that his mother in law and daughter saw the fireball from Braunton in North Devon. Karen Corbett from Torquay also said she saw the meteor. Officials at the UK Meteor Observation Network said they had not received any reports of meteor sightings in the area. The nearby Norman Lockyer Observatory in Sidmouth said it was currently looking through its sensors to see if it had detected the meteor. The camera overlooking Dawlish Beach, Devon captured the fireball in the sky on the right of the image above . The daytime view from the webcam above shows that the meteor appeared somewhere above the Channel . Experts have said the fireball is likely to be a meteor a few inches across that broke apart in the atmosphere . Some have suggested the fireball may have been a sunlight flare reflected from the panels of an Iridium satellite. However, as the course of these satellites is well known, such flares can be reliably predicted and none were expected to occur above the UK on that date. Dr Marek Kukula, public astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said: 'It certainly looks like a meteor to me – it brightens erratically and seems to expand and contract in the close-up shots as if it’s breaking apart. 'A ‘flare’ of reflected sunlight from an Iridium satellite would brighten smoothly and look more symmetrical. 'The other possibility I considered was a ship’s distress flare, but the speed and trajectory seem wrong for that. 'This kind of bright meteor or ""fireball"" is not particularly rare but, as the video shows, they’re quite brief and so often go unnoticed. 'To me it looks like the object either disappears behind a bank of clouds near the horizon or just disintegrates in mid-air. The erratic flaring of the fireball above as it traveled across the sky makes it likely that it was a meteor . The fireball flares up brightly for a few seconds before disappearing close to the horizon over Lyme Bay . 'A meteor this bright is probably a few centimetres to a few tens of centimetres across. 'From the video it’s hard to say whether any of it survived to fall into the sea or whether it just burnt up completely in the atmosphere.' The day before the video, residents in York also reported seeing a fireball in the sky. Last June a large green fireball was spotted passing over the UK and was caught on camera by the Norman Lockyer Observatory in Devon. On that occasion the bolide meteor was reported to have broken into several pieces as it entered the Earth's atmosphere. Dr Kukula added: 'The spread of cheap CCTV recording in recent years means that many more of them are now being picked up - which is useful for scientists, both because they can get a better idea of their actual frequency and because the meteor’s trajectory and apparent speed can give valuable information about where it came from. ' The weekend was also due to be the peak for the Alpha Centaurid meteor shower, although these are supposed to be only visible in the southern hemisphere. The next major meteor shower due to be visible in the Northern Hemisphere will be the Lyrids that will peak on 22 April shortly before dawn.","Dawlish Beach Webcam filmed the fireball as it broke apart in atmosphere .

"Skin taken from the dead could soon be used to treat wounds in the living. Researchers have found that skin taken from cadavers that is stripped of its cells is effective in healing acute wounds, such as burns, as well as painful ulcers. They believe the new treatment could be used to treat wounds that do not easily heal by themselves, which cost the US alone more than $25 billion (£17 billion) a year. Researchers have found that skin taken from cadavers (a stock image is pictured) that is stripped of cells, is effective in healing burns as well as painful ulcers . For decades, scientists have developed increasingly effective skin substitutes to help treat wounds, which aim to mimic the body’s extracellular matrix – the scaffolding of proteins and compounds that bind cells together, LiveScience reported. They are now focusing on using real skin. A team of researchers led by Ardeshir Bayat, a bioengineer at the University of Manchester, used human skin from cadavers, which they decontaminated with antibiotics. They then used a combination of detergents, enzymes and other chemicals to remove cells from the skin, so that the recipient’s immune system is less likely to react and cause a person’s body to reject the organ. The experts stripped out the skin’s inner layer – the dermis – which contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles and sweat glands, to leave behind its matrix of proteins. Scientists have already developed skin substitutes (stock image shown left) to help treat wounds, which aim to mimic the body’s extracellular matrix – the scaffolding of proteins and compounds that bind cells together. Now they have shown that cadaver skin can be used to treat acute wounds as well as ulcers (illustrated right) Artificial skin which could replace animals in drug and cosmetics testing was grown in a laboratory for the first time in April 2014. Scientists in the UK and US were able to produce one centimetre-wide fragments of epidermis - the outermost skin layer - from stem cells with the same properties as real skin. Scientists believe that in the future, lab-grown skin could be used for testing medicinal lotions and creams or cosmetics without causing suffering to animals. It could also provide a model for investigating skin conditions such as eczema. Dr Dusko Ilic, who led the British team from King's College London, said: 'Our new method can be used to grow much greater quantities of lab-grown human epidermal equivalents, and thus could be scaled up for commercial testing of drugs and cosmetics. 'Human epidermal equivalents representing different types of skin could also be grown, depending on the source of the stem cells used, and could thus be tailored to study a range of skin conditions and sensitivities in different populations.' Dr Bayat likened this to an empty shell of a house without furniture that is easier to populate then building a house from scratch. ‘In the same way, decellularised dermis provides a scaffold that the body can try to populate with its own cells.’ The team discovered that ‘decellulised’ skin can be used to treat acute wounds, such as burns. They removed four disks of skin, each measuring 0.2 inches (five millimetres) from 50 healthy volunteers, according to the study published in the journal Plos One. One of the wounds was left to heal naturally, another had the disk of removed skin, re-attached, the third was treated with a man-made skin substitute and the fourth, was decellulised skin from a cadaver. They found that the skin from the cadaver was the best at triggering growth of new blood vessels and was a strong as the volunteer’s own skin. It could also rebuild scar tissue. The advantage of using it over artificial skin is that the body is familiar with its structure. Dr Bayat plans on testing the ‘decelluarised’ skin on more patients as well as adding electrical stimulation to see if this accelerates the healing process. The team has previously proved that skin from cadavers can be used to treat chronic wounds that have not healed in six to eight weeks, or in some cases, years. Dr Bayat said that he had a patient who was 92 years old who had suffered with a skin ulcer for 20 years. ‘After we treated her with decellularised dermis, she healed within four weeks,’ he said. The number of people with ulcers is expected to rise in line with ageing populations. This is because conditions linked to skin wounds, such as diabetes and obesity become more common. The experts stripped out the skin’s inner layer – the demis, shown in this diagram – which contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles and sweat glands, to leave behind its extracellular matrix .","University of Manchester researchers  found that skin taken from cadavers can acute wounds, such as burns, as well as painful ulcers .

"The planned unveiling of a statue of Margaret Thatcher on the Falkland Islands has sparked a furious new row between Britain and Argentina. The bronze sculpture of the Prime Minister whose forces freed the islanders after the 1982 invasion will be unveiled in the capital Stanley next month. But Argentina's ambassador to London, Alicia Castro, has condemned the statue 'in our Malvinas Islands' as a provocative move, saying: 'What the UK is doing is celebrating war.' Costing £40,000, it stands 8ft high on a stone plinth and bears a brass plaque with a quote from Baroness Thatcher from April 1982 . Her anger was echoed by veterans' leader Mario Volpe in Buenos Aires. He said: 'The statue is not a symbol of democracy. It's her fault so many died.' He said Mrs Thatcher 'could have avoided the war and the deaths'. The memorial, to be unveiled by her son, Sir Mark Thatcher, at a ceremony on January 10, is seen for the first time in our exclusive photograph. Costing £40,000, it stands 8ft high on a stone plinth and bears a brass plaque with a quote from Baroness Thatcher on April 3, 1982: 'They are few in number, but they have the right to live in peace, to choose their own way of life and determine their own allegiance.' The bust is at the end of Thatcher Drive, next to the Liberation Monument, which honours 255 UK servicemen and three Falklands civilians who died in the conflict. About 650 Argentine personnel also died. CCTV will provide 24-hour surveillance around the 'Iron Lady' to prevent it being defaced by those who contest UK sovereignty. The bust is at the end of Thatcher Drive (pictured), next to the Liberation Monument, which honours 255 UK servicemen and three Falklands civilians who died in the conflict . The bronze sculpture of the Prime Minister whose forces freed the islanders after the 1982 invasion will be unveiled in the capital Stanley next month - she is pictured here in 1992, ten years after the Falklands War . Artist Stephen Massam said: 'The bust is not meant as a provocation, it is meant to honour the role Mrs Thatcher played in liberating the islands, which are British to their core. We're delighted to welcome her home.' Mr Massam believes the bust will become a tourist attraction, adding: 'She is an integral part of the islands' history and it is entirely appropriate that her image will gaze down on visitors and that she will remain in the Falklands for ever.' And last night, the Chief Executive of the Falklands Veterans Foundation, Derek 'Smokie' Cole, gave the statue his backing. Mr Cole, 58, a Royal Navy officer on the assault ship HMS Intrepid in the war, said: 'She was very determined to recover the Falklands. It is not up to the Argentinians to decide whether or not the statue should be unveiled.' The row is the latest in a recent series of flare-ups between Argentina and Britain. Earlier this year, Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina. A mob hurled rocks as they filmed the show's Christmas special, shown last night.","Bronze sculpture will be unveiled in the capital Stanley next month .

"Dead: Authorities said 27-year-old Sawyer Flache fired multiple rounds at a police helicopter in Austin before a police officer shot and killed him . A gunman was shot dead after repeatedly firing at a police helicopter dispatched to investigate reports of someone shooting out streetlights. Sawyer Flache, 27, fired multiple rounds at a police helicopter in a Southwest Austin neighborhood before a police officer on the ground shot and killed him in the early hours of Sunday. Neighbours called 911 after seeing a heavily-armed man, later identified as Flache, shooting at street lighting at about 10.30pm on Saturday. The helicopter was dispatched along with officers on the ground and a SWAT team. Police say officers on the ground took cover for about an hour a half while Flache kept shooting from his driveway. He was armed with pistols, rifles and other high-powered weapons. Flache began firing at the helicopter just after midnight, and continued firing multiple rounds for about the next 30 minutes, according to authorities. At least one of the bullets hit the aircraft's rotor blades. Police Chief Art Acevedo said the sniper shot and killed him as Flache continued to fire at the helicopter. He died at the scene. Flache's family have since paid tribute to the 'loving father'. 'Sawyer Flache was a loving father to two beautiful daughters,' the statement read. 'He lived his life to provide for his girls, and made many wonderful memories that will be cherished. 'The outpouring of support and love from his friends and family is a testament to his true spirit. He will be greatly missed.' Austin Police Department said three reverse 911 calls went out to 41 neighbors near SWAT standoff location. The chopper took at least one bullet to its blades, but safely returned to the station near Austin Bergstrom-International Airport.

"She may have found fame on The Only Way Is Essex but Lauren Pope, 32, is proving to be a serious force to be reckoned with in the fashion industry. The TOWIE star has seen her clothing line go from strength to strength, landed herself a modelling contract and was even voted more fashionable that the Duchess of Cambridge. Now, the DJ and entrepreneur has unveiled a new accessories range for Accessoryo.com - and poses in a slick, high fashion shoot to showcase her designs. Scroll down for video . Lauren Pope, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has seen her clothing line go from strength to strength and now she's ventured into designing an accessories range for Accessoryo.com . Speaking to FEMAIL about her new range of sunglasses and statement totes, which are all priced under £60, Lauren said: 'I tend to look to street style photography online and stalk fashion bloggers like Chiara Ferragni, Shea Maria, Kristina Bazan and Vanessa Hong for ideas. 'Celebrity-wise I look to Nicole Richie, Kate Bosworth and Jamie Chung. I took elements of all these styles when working on the collection and hopefully you will see all of these elements in the range.' Lauren, a self-confessed Olsen twin fan, looked to Mary-Kate and Ashley when garnering inspiration for the collection. In fact, the large circular 70s style pair of sunglasses, which she says will be a summer staple of hers, were inspired by the fashionable twins.

Lauren, 32, proves she's got bags of style as she models her new range of totes and sunglasses . The star, who also has her own hair extension range with countless celebrity fans, thinks her style has matured naturally over the years. She said: 'I think it evolved as I headed towards my thirties. My interest in style and fashion started to grow and from there I started to take a genuine interest in what I wore and how I wore it.' Her foray into fashion has paid off - she was snapped up by Elite Models last year and says having an established agency who want to work with her towards long-term goals is a 'great confidence boost'. Speaking candidly about her insecurities growing up, she said: 'In my twenties I was very insecure about the way I looked and silly trolls on social media would tell me I was ugly and wasn't as attractive as the other TOWIE girls. 'To be able to finally embrace the way I look has has been very liberating.' The star thinks her style has matured naturally and admits she was once very insecure when she started out on the reality TV show that sky-rocketed her to fame . With a successful brand to her name and the respect of the fashion world, it seems the future is bright for Lauren. Over the next few years she plans on channeling 'empowered, positive women who are the boss of their own business empire and running things on their own terms' like Natalie Massenet, Michelle Mone and Elle Macpherson.

"A principal who works at an elementary school where only 12 percent of students can pass math exams diverted school funds towards a personal gym, it has been claimed. Principal Jazmine Santiago of PS 269 in Flatbush, Brooklyn allegedly bought gym equipment, including a bench press, pull-up bar, treadmill, elliptical machine and thigh exerciser. One source told the New York Post. told said that when confronted by other staff at the school, Santiago claimed the workout machines were shared with older students. Diversion: Staff at Brooklyn school PS 269 say Principal Jazmine Santiago (pictured) diverted funds to build out a private gym . With the oldest at the school only in fifth grade, much of the equipment would be too big to be suitable for students. 'Their bodies are not ready for a treadmill,' one teacher said. Teachers said that the workout machines were kept out of sight in a third-floor room that Santiago, who earns $124,319 a year, kept locked and off limits to both students and staff. 'She comes in early, she goes to the gym,' another teacher said. 'Even when class is in session, she’s still in the gym.' 'The kids have their own gym,' the teacher added. 'Her gym is on the third floor and it’s her own personal gym.' The room was converted from a storage room to be used as a gym in June 2014 without discussion with other faculty at the school, sources told the Post.

"Elite Army snipers are receiving security training from the SAS amid fears that they and their families will be targeted by Islamic terrorists following a series of blunders. Defence chiefs published online and in official reports the names and photographs of sharpshooters – a move the snipers say could endanger their lives. At least 50 troops, including those belonging to elite Parachute Regiment and Royal Marine units, and some who have since left the Army, have attended briefings as concerns increase for their safety. The identity of snipers must be protected because jihadis consider them to be high-value targets . On the courses at SAS headquarters in Hereford, the snipers are being advised how to escape and evade capture if jihadis strike at their homes or when they are going about their everyday lives. They are also warned not to carry military identification, remove their names from the electoral roll and to report suspicious activity to police. The courses include briefings on cyber-security, with the snipers being shown how to thwart attempts to hack into their mobile phones, email and Facebook pages. The extraordinary measures had to be brought in after the Ministry of Defence breached rules that state that members of Britain's Special Forces and snipers should never be identified. The rules must be strictly observed because jihadis consider snipers to be high-value targets. Their specialist role and devastating impact on the battlefield have been popularised in the Oscar-nominated film American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper as US Navy Seal Chris Kyle, who was credited with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. Last night, a former British Army sniper described the horrifying moment when he found an Army report on the internet which described how he had shot dead a Taliban fighter in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan, at a range of more than 1,000 yards. He said: 'Since then I've lived every day with the fear that I or my family members will be targeted. I can never feel entirely safe in this country after coming back from the war zone and being identified in that report. 'It is especially sickening as while I was still serving in Afghanistan, I gave my commanders explicit instructions that I didn't want to be identified or put up for any sort of recognition when we came home. 'It was a stupid mistake on their part. I only found out when a friend pointed it out. Naturally people are concerned for me, and as snipers we're aware of the threats to us.' The sniper has taken drastic measures to protect himself and his relatives, including varying his routes to and from local shops and keeping a 'crash-out bag' – a rucksack containing items he would need to evade capture by Muslim extremists. The man, whose experiences on the front line left him suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, genuinely fears he is a target. He added: 'I'm careful who I discuss my Army life with, while giving out my phone number or my home address is a complete no-no. And when I'm going somewhere for the first time, I need to work out how I could get out of there fast and without being tailed. 'I'm prepared for 'going to ground', as we snipers call it. I'd grab the crash-out bag and go. It might sound like paranoia to most people but then they're not snipers. They don't know how badly the terrorists want us dead.' He is not the first sniper to be exposed by blundering MoD officials. Four years ago, Household Cavalry Trooper Craig Harrison's cover was blown after he achieved the longest successful shots by a British soldier – killing two Taliban fighters from two miles away. On his return to Britain, Trooper Harrison agreed to be interviewed by the media after receiving assurances from MoD officials that none of his personal details would be revealed. But the officials failed to inform newspapers, leading to the publication of his name and family information. Days later he was told by police that UK-based Al Qaeda sympathisers were plotting to kidnap him. Trooper Harrison suffered acute distress and later received £100,000 compensation from the MoD. The revelation that snipers are receiving enhanced security and cyber-security training follows the brutal execution of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich in 2013, and recent intelligence from a Government agency, the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, that jihadis want to kidnap a soldier or police officer. An MoD spokesman said last night: 'Keeping our personnel and assets safe is of the utmost importance, which is why our security arrangements are kept under continual review and frequently tested. 'All personnel are given clear guidance on social media use and informed of the standards of behaviour expected of them whether offline or online, on duty or off duty.' By a British Army sniper . I was a British Army sniper who served multiple tours of southern Afghanistan. Being a civilian now is a big change and to be honest I miss being a sharpshooter every day – going to the war zone and doing my job. But then I look at my daughter and I realise I want to be at home with her. I also did my fair share [of killing], but with what is going on in the world today maybe what I did was not enough? When I was down there in Afghanistan, I had no idea that I'd face these threats at home. As an ex-sniper, I can never go public about what I did as a sharpshooter. Instead, I live a quiet life in order to protect my family – they are my priority and it is them I worry about. I'm always wary of people asking questions about my background and I don't give out my personal details. I also change my phone numbers and emails. Snipers should take these precautions, especially considering what has happened to those who've had their cover blown in the media and on the internet. They've been to hell and back since officials let slip their names, which was unforgivable. So it is good that snipers are getting extra training to protect themselves. It is very hard for people to understand what we have to deal with, because they haven't done what we've done. Sniping is a dark art. Basically we're there to kill the enemy and we're good at it. But that makes us unpopular with the enemy and their sympathisers here, so we're high-value targets. I'm not looking for understanding or sympathy. It is easy for me to come to terms with my actions, basically because it has to be. I was woken up one night in Afghanistan and told to take out a Taliban fighter. I did it and I was back in my bed asleep ten minutes later as if nothing had happened. Sometimes it is that easy mentally. I couldn't be constantly thinking or worrying about what I was doing because I would have big problems, wouldn't I? The film American Sniper is huge and it has got people thinking about how we deal with the job. Whether what a sniper does gets too personal or emotional for him to deal with depends on his mindset, his experience and his upbringing. For me, blocking thoughts like that got easier as I went back to Afghanistan and did the same thing again and again. I am sceptical when I hear figures for so-called confirmed kills for British snipers, such as the 173 reported last week for a Royal Marine. How can they be sure? People don't normally die straight away when you shoot them. It is also hard to tell from long range. The idea of sniping is that you fire from far enough away that you don't have to go down there and check. Killing more people doesn't make you a better soldier either.","Elite Army snipers are getting security training from the Special Forces .

"These fascinating pictures show how engineers in 1960s California secretly developed the SR-71 Blackbird for the US Air Force – a plane which still holds the record for being the fastest ever aircraft. The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird is a long-range, strategic reconnaissance aircraft and these once classified photos reveal how Lockheed built three types of Blackbird - A, B and C in top secret conditions in Burbank, California. The aircraft were built by American aerospace company Lockheed under a 'black project' - a highly classified military defence project unacknowledged by the government until its declassification. Since July 28 1976 the SR-71 Blackbird has held the world record for the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft with a record speed of 2,193.2mph. Scroll down for video . Scientists at Lockheed's Skunk Works in Burbank developed the plane -this picture shows their assembly line . Lockheed engineers working on the Blackbird - the dark colour acts as a camouflage . To withstand high temperatures during sustained Mach 3 flight, the Blackbird required an array of specially developed materials including high temperature fuel, sealants, lubricants, wiring and other components . Renowned American aerospace engineer Clarence 'Kelly' Johnson was responsible for many of the design's innovative concepts. During reconnaissance missions, the SR-71 operated at high speeds and altitudes to allow it to outrace threats - if a surface-to-air missile launch was detected, the standard evasive action was simply to accelerate and out fly the missile. The SR-71 was designed to have basic stealthy characteristics and served as a precursor to modern stealth aircraft. The Blackbird served with the U.S. Air Force from 1964 to 1998 and a total of 32 aircraft were built; 12 were lost in accidents, but none were ever lost to enemy action. Around 93% of the plane's frame was made of titanium alloy which allowed the aircraft to fly fast and high . An SR-71B trainer over the Sierra Nevada Mountains in 1994 - the raised second cockpit is for the instructor . Since 1976 the Blackbird has held the world record for the fastest air-breathing manned aircraft . Flying at 80,000 ft meant that crews could not use standard masks, which would not provide enough oxygen above 43,000 ft, so specialist protective pressurised suits were made. The plane's titanium skin was capable of surviving temperatures up to 482C. The SR-71 was the world's fastest and highest-flying operational manned aircraft throughout its career and is believed to be the most advanced airplane ever built in relation to the technology available at the time. These once classified pictures reveal how Lockheed built A, B and C versions of plane - this version is based on the Blackbird's precursor, the A-12 Oxcart . SR-71 was designed to have basic stealth characteristics and served as a precursor to modern stealth aircraft . Almost every aspect of its design required new approaches or breakthroughs in technology. To withstand high temperatures generated by friction in the upper atmosphere during sustained Mach 3 flight, the Blackbird required an array of specially developed materials including high temperature fuel, sealants, lubricants, wiring and other components. Around 93% of the Blackbird's airframe consisted of titanium alloy that allowed the aircraft to operate in a regime where temperatures range from 450 degrees  to 950 degrees. On July 24 1964, US President Lyndon B. Johnson publicly announced the existence of the classified Lockheed SR-71 program. The first flight was held on December 22 and operational aircraft deliveries began in 1966. An SR-71 refueling from a KC-135Q Stratotanker during a flight in 1983.

The zoo said Monday that thousands of 'hopeless' - or perhaps hapless - romantics have taken advantage of the strange sweetheart deal. The $10 goes to the Wildlife Conservation Society, which has worked in Madagascar since 1990 to help to protect its coastal, marine, and dry forests. The zoo's website features a jarring glamour shot - a two-inch-wide roach image, resplendent amid a bed of rose petals. Invasion: The Bronx Zoo has more than 58,000 Madagascar hissing cockroaches on their premises . Among the selling points: the creature's 'surprisingly high tolerance for radiation.' The headline states: 'Seal it with a hiss.' The Bronx Zoo has more than 58,000 Madagascar hissing cockroaches on its premises. The live hissing cockroaches are on display in the zoo's Madagascar! exhibit. Their hiss is 90 decibels - the equivalent to the sound made by a lawnmower or hair dryer. This species of cockroach can live two to five years with their diet consisting of  leaf litter and fallen fruit.","The Bronx Zoo in New York is offering hapless romantics the opportunity to name a Madagascar Hissing cockroach after a loved one .

"An Indian 'woman' who discovered she had mostly male DNA has given birth to twins. Doctors have called the event a 'medical miracle' and said it is akin to a man giving birth. The 32-year-old had an intersex condition, in which she had the physical appearance of a woman, but more than 95 per cent male chromosomes. In humans, gender is determined by chromosomes. Women have XX chromosomes, while men have XY chromosomes. Medical miracle: An Indian 'woman' who discovered she had 95 per cent male DNA has given birth to twins. The woman, who was treated in Meirut, looked female but had mostly male XX chromosomes. She had never gone through puberty, had no ovaries and had never menstruated - but she did have an undeveloped womb . The woman, whose chromosomes were almost entirely XY, did not undergo puberty and had never menstruated. It was discovered she had an intersex condition when she went to seek fertility treatment in order to become pregnant. 'When we investigated further we found that she had a very small vagina and an infantile uterus,' fertility specialist Dr Sunil Jindal said. An infantile uterus is an undeveloped womb. Doctors diagnosed her with XY gonadal dysgenesis, in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function, the Times of India reports. Ovaries are usually necessary for reproduction, as they create and release the eggs from which babies grow. The lady underwent more than 12 months of hormonal and other medical treatment to develop her 'infantile uterus' and allow her to eventually conceive. XY gonadal dysgenesis is a rare intersex condition in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function. It affects one in a million people. The chances of a person with this condition conceiving are very slim - and success is classed as a 'medical miracle', doctors said. There have only ever been five reported cases of such pregnancies in the world. 'It is akin to a male delivering twins,' a fertility expert said. Her husband's sperm was used to fertilise a donor egg which was then implanted in the woman's uterus, which had been developed by the fertility treatment. Once she became pregnant, doctors had to overcome another problem. 'Our biggest challenge was how to administer this pregnancy for nine months in a body not designed for it,' said Dr Anshu Jindal, medical director at Jindal Hospital, where the babies were delivered, told the Times of India. On Friday she gave birth to a boy and girl. 'This is akin to a male delivering twins,' said Dr Jindal from the hospital in Meerut city, some 70 kilometres (43 miles) northeast of New Delhi. Dr Jindal said his team of doctors discovered during their research that there had only ever been five reported cases of such pregnancies in the world. 'It's nothing short of a medical miracle. We are really happy that we could pull it off.' He said the woman was startled to learn she had the condition, but was determined to undergo the treatment to get pregnant. 'Even she did not know she had this condition and was flabbergasted when we told her about it. But the husband was very supportive and told her ""no matter what you continue to be my wife"",' he said. The babies were born through Caesarean section, weighing 2.25 kilos (4.9lb) 2.50 kilos (5.5 pounds) each. Doctors diagnosed her with condition that is medically referred to as XY gonadal dysgenesis, in which a person has external female characteristics but ovaries that don't function. A human sex chromosome is pictured under the microscope. Men have XY chromosomes, while women have XX .","Indian woman sought fertility treatment and discovered she was 95% male .

"'I'm not nagging you, I'm… making a suggestion that you go for a run.' The micro-pause as my wife Emma searches for an alternative to saying nagging is excruciating. It all boils down to the fact that in her version of events she's 'proactively caring about my health' and in my version of events she's nagging. We used to have these conversations on an almost daily basis. Scroll down for video . Better half: Andrew Shanahan and his wife Emma were both overweight at one point (left). But after she slimmed down and toned up, she was keen for him to lose weight. After much persuasion, he eventually did (right) - but she went about nagging him in the wrong way, he says . In earlier, pudgier times we had been morbidly obese together, devouring slabs of Dairy Milk and carb-orgy Chinese takeaways on the sofa, while moving so little that some days the pedometers we laughingly bought each other would stay in single digits. But as the marriage vows warn us, for richer, for poorer, for fatter, for thinner. Through a combination of smarter eating and running, my wife returned to the coveted BMI category of Extremely Slinky. She discovered a life of health and energy; while I discovered a way of separating Oreos and rebuilding them into a Super-Oreo. So, her campaign of suggestions continued. She suggested we go trainer shopping (I got comfy ones that supported my fat ankles), she suggested we join a gym (she went on the treadmill, I lazed in the jacuzzi) and gradually the cakes she baked morphed from heart-thumping chocolate Malteser cakes into seedy, joyless flapjacks. In retrospect I appreciate the difficult position that my la-la-la-I-can't-hear-you attitude created. That said, I am now 60lbs lighter than I was and run a website for men who want to lose weight, so possibly I shouldn't discount the effectiveness of Emma's nagging. And surely it's part of her wifely duties to be worried about my health, isn't it? After all, if I was sat in the lounge doing lines of coke we would expect her to intervene, why should she be expected to stay quiet if I'm in danger of overdosing on pies? Mr Shananan says: 'My wife suggested we go trainer shopping (I got comfy ones that supported my fat ankles), she suggested we join a gym (she went on the treadmill, I lazed in the jacuzzi) and gradually the cakes she baked morphed from heart-thumping chocolate Malteser cakes into seedy, joyless flapjacks' Surely we want to protect our spouses from both deviated septums and diabetes? The fact is though that she was nagging all wrong. Women like to think that they're the Jedi Knights of husbandly persuasion but the truth is that men know how to nag men best. The mistake women make is couching their concern in niceness and thinking that makes it all the more palatable. Not a bit of it. Men like to hear it straight. Take the example of chef Jamie Brooks whose incredible 21-stone weight loss was motivated by his mates texting him on a daily basis calling him 'a fat f***' and telling him that he'll 'be dead by 40' if he doesn't change his ways. And you thought the texts about your PPI claim were annoying. Slimline: He eventually lost four stone and has launched his own weight loss advice website - but says other women need to learn the best way to nag their partners . His mates kept up that campaign for an incredible six weeks, after which time Brooks said that it finally made him face up to his weight issues. Presumably, it was either that or change his number. That is quality man-on-man nagging. Compare that to the softly-softly suggestions that women prefer and you can see why the female of the species is less effective than the male. In no way am I saying that you should subject you other half to a four-letter text tirade – from a woman to a man, a different strategy is needed. If you're looking at your husband and wondering how to make some healthy suggestions of your own that he might actually listen to then this is how you successfully nag your husband to lose weight… . Nag away, but realise that change happens in a person's own time . Yes, it would be wonderful if everything we said to our other half was instantly understood and acted upon down to the exact letter, but then you've got a husband not a Tamagotchi. Of course you can rage, rant, blackmail and threaten but all that will do is make them wish to appease you or fight back, it will not light the fire inside them – that will happen according to their own timescale. That doesn't mean that you can't provide them with plenty of kindling, firelighters and matches though. In our situation, Em was at goal weight for a whole year before I finally got the message and started to get healthy. Although I had developed an immunity to the weight discussions, there's no doubt that her weight loss left me questioning my own choices, which brings me neatly to… . Lead by example, don't expect him to follow . Inspire change: There's no point nagging your partner if you're not doing anything healthy yourself, he says . If you really want to change someone's mind-set about losing weight then enjoying an exemplary healthy life is the most compelling argument of all. If your other half sees you grating and hating carrots and whinging about Zumba then don't be surprised if it doesn't tempt him to join in. Try an anonymous tip-off . How's this for a simple, effective and free way to bring up the subject of his health without starting an argument. Go to www.manvfat.com/nominate and add his email address into the form. Leave your name off if you want to go undercover and hit Submit. He'll instantly get a challenge to take the three minute Health Report. This will ask him to add various information such as his weight, height, and sleeping habits and produce a series of detailed insights into his health and suggest lots of changes he can make. Easy. Motivation: Another way to spur him on is to suggest he takes the three-minute Man V Fat health report, which takes into account factors such as weight, height and sleeping habits . Be honest, but avoid ultimatums . It would be unhealthy if you hid your feelings about you husband's weight, but make sure you examine where your motivation comes from. Do you want to get him healthier because you want what's best for him, or because you're worried about him? If so, let him know. If it's because you're embarrassed about his size or hate the way he looks then consider carefully before sharing. Never give into the temptation to set a deadline or issue an ultimatum. It might work, but it will breed resent and when he's got healthy and hot he might just consider his own ultimatum... Litter the horizon with possible goals . Men love to have a goal to work towards and that focus can often be the impetus that they need to lose weight. Whether it's a 5k race, a cycle ride or a Tough Mudder, it doesn't matter. Alternatively, it could just be about finding an opportunity to re-kindle a dormant sporting passion. Check out www.beinspireduk.org, www.parkrun.org.uk and www.joininuk.org for inspiration. Then drop it into conversation or suggest it to a group of his friends – no man likes to feel that they're in danger of missing out. Make some subtle changes . Take charge: Even simple switches like stocking the cupboards with healthier snacks and gradually reducing portion sizes at mealtimes can make a significant difference . Seventy per cent of British women in relationships are mostly responsible for the food shopping and cooking. That's a pretty shocking statistic in itself but it does demonstrate how much power the average woman wields over her partner's calorie intake. Even simple switches like stocking the cupboards with healthier snacks and gradually reducing portion sizes at mealtimes can make a huge difference. He might moan, but then that's the perfect opportunity to allow him to level up the statistic of who does the cooking and shopping.

"Prime Minster Tony Abbott stumbled over tough questions about which of his 'three' personas was the real Tony in a gruelling TV interview as it emerged up to six of the Prime Minster's most trusted lieutenants turned their back on him. Six senior Cabinet members were part of the 39 who backed a spill motion on Monday, as did nine MPs who had previously promised to give him their support and vote it down, according to reports in the Daily Telegraph. At least one was found making approaches to Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Scroll down for videos . Prime Minster Tony Abbott stumbled over tough questions about which of his 'three' personas was real . In a tense exchange with the 7.30 Report 's Leigh Sales on Monday night, Mr Abbott was accused of being unable to answer basic questions including 'Who are you?' and 'What do you stand for?' However, after the 61-39 ballot, Mr Abbott promised 'good government starts today', after surviving 'a very chastening experience.' In a tense exchange with the 7.30 Report's Leigh Sales on Monday night, Mr Abbott was accused of being unable to answer basic questions including 'Who are you?' and 'What do you stand for?'. Sales said the public had seen three different versions of Tony Abbott. 'We've had the Tony Abbott in opposition, the guy who promised no more chaos, the adults back in charge, there'd be no excuses, no broken promises,' she said. 'Then there's the Tony Abbott that we've had so far in government with the surprise policies and the broken promises and the captain's picks. Mr Abbott might well reflect on the revelations that six of his ministers turned their back on him and voted for a leadership spill on Monday . While Mr Abbott expressed contrition about his performance in recent weeks, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today revelled in the prime minister's misfortune, questioning whether he had the mandate to remain leader . 'Now you're offering us a third Tony Abbott, one that's going to change. Who are you?' The Prime Minister responded: 'Well Leigh, let's just focus for a second on the captain's picks, there have been two captain's picks.' But Sales interjected: 'Can we actually just focus on the big picture there, because there's been three different Tony Abbotts. I just want to know which one are you, who are you?' Mr Abbott then steered the conversation back to the topic of 'captain's picks' – more specifically his paid parental leave scheme and his knighthood of Prince Phillip – but Sales pressed him again. 'How about my point, though, that we're up to Tony Abbott 3.0? Do you accept that you have thoroughly confused the public about what your government is and what you stand for?' Mr Abbott replied: 'Let's look at the situation that we inherited Leigh.' Leadership murmurs: Mr Abbott was not opposed by any of his colleagues, including Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The pair are pictured sharing a moment on the floor of Parliament as it resumed in 2015 . Discussion: Mr Abbott is now formulating plans on how his team can claw back support in the polls . She responded: 'Can we just look at the big picture, about you?' The Prime Minister then said: 'No, no, I'd rather have a conversation rather than an argument Leigh.' Sales then said: 'No, no, I think it's a reasonable question and one that voters would be asking themselves and that it would be remiss of me not to put to you.' Mr Abbott then responded by talking about the budget deficit. 'And let me answer it by saying going into the last election the then government was saying the deficit would be $18 billion,' he said. 'It turned out to be $48 billion, there was a $30 billion budget black hole that the Labor Party created, should have known about, and wasn't telling us about. 'Obviously when the circumstances change, there are some things that have to change with them.' Mr Abbott continued by defending funding cuts to the ABC, to which Sales responded: . Survivor: Mr Abbott survived the threat to his leadership, but 39 of his own MPs voted against his leadership . 'But it's interesting that you're not able to answer the question to me who are you, what do you stand for? Which Tony are you?' Mr Abbott replied: . 'Well obviously we stand for a government which believes in lower taxes, smaller government, greater freedom. 'We are a government that believes in values and institutions that have stood the test of time. 'Above all else we are a pragmatic government which wants to do what works, and if we try to do something sensible one way and it doesn't work we'll try to bring about the same sensible outcome in another way. 'And there are challenges Leigh, we at least accept that there is a serious fiscal challenge, that a bit of intergenerational theft has been going on that the former government started and we are determined to fix. The victor: Prime Minister Tony Abbott walks from the party room after a majority of his backbench voted against his leadership . 'The Labor Party is in denial about all these things. Now, you can embrace a government which is not perfect but which is at least fair dinkum. 'Or you can go with the people that gave us that problem and are now trying to say that it's none of their fault and they're not even going to address it.' Analysts predict Mr Abbott will get him through to the May Budget, as long as the NSW poll is not an unlikely unmitigated disaster, along the lines of Victoria and Queensland. A majority of the Liberal backbench is thought to have voted against the PM and the vote count is considered dire for Mr Abbott, in that there was no direct challenger for his leadership. Contrast: Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting accompanied by his deputy leader, Julie Bishop and a large number of supporters. The motion to spill the leadership was lost 61-39 . On his own: Malcolm Turnbull arrived to the party room meeting without any colleagues in tow . But the most recent Newspoll suggests the electorate will take some convincing, with Mr Abbott's disapproval rating at a record 68 per cent and Labor holding a clear two-party majority 57 to 43 per cent, if an election was held now. Worse, the Newspoll figures revealed Mr Turnbull was by far the preferred Liberal Party leader, with 64 per cent voting in support of him compared to just 25 per cent backing Mr Abbott. The poor approval ratings are the most bleak ranking for a Prime Minister in more than 20 years, comparable only to Paul Keating in 1994. The PM conceded the government had been having a difficult time recently, citing the Queensland election result that delivered a massive swing against the Liberals. 'Who wouldn't be nervous after watching the result in Queensland,' he said. 'So all of us are determined to lift our game and the fundamental point I make is that the solution to all of these things is good government. 'And good government starts today.' The sweet taste of the other side's leadership dramas. Labor big-wigs Bill Shorten (centre), Tanya Plibersek and Penny Wong made sure to sweep by the assembled media after grabbing their morning coffees . Time to pray: Mr Abbott appeared with his wife, Margie, at the traditional church service prior to the beginning of the year's first sitting week of Parliament . Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting on Monday morning flanked by a large throng of supporters but tellingly, Malcolm Turnbull was not one of them, sidling into the meeting on his own. The vote was instigated by rebellious backbenchers, who revolted following his controversial decision to knight Prince Philip and the disastrous defeat of Campbell Newman's Liberal National government in Queensland two weeks ago. The most influential person to come out in favour of the spill motion was Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos, the former chief of staff to Prime Minister John Howard. Treasurer Joe Hockey said any Cabinet minister who supported the Liberal leadership spill motion should resign Six did. He said he trusted his Cabinet colleagues Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop. 'If you are going to be disloyal to someone, you should front them,' Mr Hockey said. Mr Hockey stood by the government's controversial decisions to overhaul Medicare, higher education, pensions and welfare, which have contributed to the leadership unrest. 'We have no choice,' he said of the budget changes. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull welcomed Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to Sydney on Sunday ahead of the spill motion being defeated on Monday . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is also preferred as leader when measured up against Mr Abbott . Treasurer Joe Hockey has called on any minister who backed the leadership spill to resign .","Six of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Cabinet ministers wanted his leadership tested in a party room ballot .

"The first professional shot of Marilyn Monroe, taken as a test shot in a Hollywood alleyway before she achieved global fame, has emerged for sale . The first professional photograph taken of Marilyn Monroe, hurriedly composed in an alleyway as a test shot before she began the career that was to make her a star, has emerged for sale. Renowned photographer Joseph Jasgur took test shots of Monroe before he was to photograph her on Zuma beach in California - regarded as her first official modelling shoot. When Monroe, then known by her real name Norma Jean Baker, visited Jasgur at his studio in West Hollywood for the test picture he was running short of time and decided to photograph her in a nearby alleyway. The test shot, showing a fresh faced teenage Monroe relaxed in a white wool jumper, was taken in March 1946. It has been referred to by experts as a candid picture of the young girl who went on to become a global star. And as befitting her life before international stardom, the actress and model is understood to have gone to a nearby diner for a hamburger and fries after the photo was taken. The original negative of the photo is being sold this week at auction after being acquired by a private collector. Weeks after the initial snap was taken Jasqur pictured Monroe in a number of locations, most famously on Zuma Beach in a swimsuit. Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, said: 'The image was taken on March 6, 1946 as part of some informal test shots that proceeded a formal shoot. 'This image is a true genesis as it is one of the first professional images ever taken of Marilyn. Monroe became a renowned actress, appearing in Gentlemen prefer blondes in 1953 . 'Jasgur first photographed her on a small street in West Hollywood behind Beverly Boulevard, where this image was taken. 'He didn't have time in his studio so went outside in the street. It is a very candid picture and she is looking very young with a bit of puppy fat still in her face. Monroe's first official photoshoot with Jasgur took place on Zuma beach in California when she was 19 . Monroe pictured in an iconic scene from The Seven Year Itch (left) was also a well known model (right) 'Over the next few weeks Jasgur photographed her on top of Don Lee Towers, above the Hollywood sign and at Zuma Beach. 'This photo offers a unique glimpse of the young girl who was to become the global phenomena that was Marilyn Monroe.' The negative is valued at $3,040 and will be sold on February 14.","Professional photo of Marilyn Monroe before she became a star is for sale .

"A man secretly filmed his 15-year-old stepdaughter undressing, washing and going to the toilet, a court heard today. Martyn Darlington spied on Jade Walsh using cameras he set up in her bedroom and the bathroom of the family home in Rhyl, North Wales. The 39-year-old was today jailed for 14 months at Mold Crown Court after he admitted building up a collection of indecent photographs and videos of children as young as six. Father, daughter and his partner: Martyn Darlington (left), of Rhyl, North Wales, spied on Jade Walsh (right, with mother Caroline Walsh) using cameras he set up in her bedroom and the bathroom of the family home . Karl Scholz, prosecuting, told the court that Jade was the daughter of a woman named Caroline Walsh whom Darlington lived with and had been going out with for around eight years. He said that at the age of 16 she left the family home but from being around 11, they were living at the same house. ‘She looked upon him as a father figure and trusted him implicitly,’ said Mr Scholz. The court heard that police found 38 video files of Jade, which all appeared to have been taken at a time when she was around 15 years of age. Mr Scholz said: ‘They involved the setting up of covert cameras so she was being filmed in her bedroom where she would be undressing for bed, and in the bathroom when she would be naked and using the toilet.’ On Jade’s 16th birthday, a camera which had been installed pointing towards her bed, was discovered. Her mother confronted Darlington about it, and he claimed it had been put there to ‘check she was not being sexually active with any boyfriends that might come round’. He disconnected the camera, but retained the memory card which contained videos of Jade, the court heard. Referring to a victim impact statement written by Jade, Mr Scholz said she questioned what his motives might really have been in the period of time she lived with him when she might have given him a kiss or a hug. Shocked: Caroline Walsh (pictured) confronted her partner about a camera which had been installed pointing towards Jade’s bed on her 16th birthday . She said she is now suspicious of people and no longer feels able to trust others. Mr Scholz told the court that the police were alerted to Darlington’s stash of child pornography following suspicions from his partner Ms Walsh. It was at the couple’s home in Rhyl that officers found nearly 100,000 indecent images and 365 videos of children. Jade questioned what Darlington's motives might really have been in the period of time she lived with him when she might have given him a kiss or a hug . ‘Caroline began to notice the defendant was spending an increasingly long period of time alone at his computer screen,’ he said. ‘He would always close the screen when she walked in. ‘In October 2013, her suspicions now being raised all the time as to what sort of material was found on his computer she asked two friends to come to the home when she was out to find out what files and folders were on the computer.’ The court heard how Darlington, a railway construction engineer, also subscribed to paying websites which allowed him to access images of children. This material included photographs of girls as young as six, some naked and some in bikinis and underwear, posing provocatively. Defending Darlington, Guy Dodd said: ‘He was a man of exemplary previous character. That was until he developed an extremely unhealthy interest in internet porn over four years. ‘He spent most of the week, and some of the weekends, away from home and did feel very isolated and lonely on occasions. ‘He had little or no active sex life due to the nature of his job and having to work away and this led to him looking at adult porn sites which in the end became pretty obsessive . ‘He stumbled across a site that featured a child pornographic image. He realises he should have stopped at that point and not taken it any further. ‘All this became fairly normalised in his mind. He didn’t think he was doing anything seriously wrong.’ Darlington admitted three counts of voyeurism and 14 counts of possessing indecent images of children. Judge Rhys Rowlands described his behaviour as ‘serious and disturbing’ and ordered him to sign the sex offenders register as well as making him subject to a ten-year sexual offences prevention order. Jailing Darlington, the judge said: ‘In any view this was utter depraved behaviour on your part. ‘On examination of the material from your home revealed a vast collection of photographs and videos of young children and your step daughter in her home, dressing, washing and using the toilet. ‘You treated her as your daughter and she treated you as her father. I’m dealing with a very bad breach of trust.’ Speaking after the case, Ms Walsh said: ‘I’m livid with the sentence. He should have got five to ten years. It’s definitely not long enough after everything he’s put our family through.’ Jade can be identified after she waived her right to anonymity.","Martyn Darlington spied on Jade Walsh in her bedroom and bathroom .

"They're the smallest countries in the world - and they're proud of it. A micronation is a piece of land that claims to be an independent or sovereign nation, but is not officially recognized by the governments of the world. In 2012, fascinated photographer Leó Delafontaine began documenting them, visiting six countries and three continents to capture life inside the unique mini-states. The people he met were eccentrics determined to carve out their own place in the world - and so they did exactly that. There are many reasons for the founding of the micronations, ranging from symbols of defiance, to boost tourism or solely for fun. Current reports put the number of micronations scattered around the world at approximately 400, with more being created every year. Delafontaine hoped the pictures would not only shed a light on the little-known phenomenon, but also provoke 'the need to think about the geopolitical, national, and cultural questions that micronations generate'.

"Sacre bleu! French has lost its place as the language of love – to English. A British accent was chosen as the most attractive by 26.7 per cent of people answering a global survey of 11,000 people in 24 cities - followed by American, Irish and Australian accents. French was chosen as the sexiest accent by just 7.7 per cent of respondents to Time Out’s Global Dating Survey, coming in at fifth place. Language of love: British accents have been voted the sexiest in an international survey (file photo) And Parisians answering the survey were among the respondents most likely to fall for someone with a British accent, along with those from New York and Sydney. But Gallic aficionados could still take some cheer from the survey. Paris was ranked as the city with the best dating scene, followed by Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Chicago – with London coming in at a lowly sixth. The study concluded that Sydney has the happiest singletons, with 31 per cent ‘proudly single’ while the opposite was true in New York, where 45 per cent of respondents declared themselves ‘sad to be single’. Meanwhile, 53 per cent of people said they kissed on the first date and one in ten believe sex on a first date is acceptable. Still a winner: Paris, featuring the love locks of the Pont des Arts (pictured), had the best dating scene . On average, couples had 3.53 dates before having sex - but still considered it acceptable to see other people until reaching six dates. Technology is also important for modern-day lovers, with 58 per cent admitting to checking a prospective date's credentials on social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. Answers to a question about the best and worst aspects of the local dating scene threw up some surprising results. One was how the presence of 'infinitely more men than women due to an overabundance of military and security personnel' in Kabul made it easy for women to find a potential suitor. But a respondent from Bogota, Colombia, complained: 'The guys are ugly and girls very beautiful. It's difficult'.","British accent triumphed in poll of 11,000 people's favourite in English .

"A single mom in Utah proved that one man's trash really is another man's treasure. Brooke Stewart from Salt Lake City was dumpster diving for scrap metal when she discovered envelopes with two seven-year-old diamonds worth $8,000.

"Dramatic new footage released by police shows in greater detail how a four-hour long police chase which travelled across the border between two states came to a head last Thursday.

"The Royal Navy's sailors will be waiting a little longer to don their bold new 'fashion statement' uniforms - complete with American-style baseball caps - after the first batch arrived mouldy. The new uniforms, first tested back in 2012, were supposed to begin being rolled out this month, but the first order for 1,700 'Combat Number 4 Dress' were unwearable. It is thought the uniforms had been steam cleaned, but not dried properly. The new uniform is designed to be 'easy-to-wear', with Velcro replacing buttons, zip-up boots instead of laces - and an American-style baseball cap . A Navy source told The Sun: 'There were plans to roll it out from the start of January. The first batch was completely ruined and unusable. It's all rather embarrassing really and an unwanted delay.' The uniform replaces the Navy’s traditional lighter blue outfit and is the first new uniform to be worn by our sailors on operations for more than 20 years. The new kit, which is being manufactured by a British company as part of a £250,000 deal, is designed to be more versatile and adaptable to the different weather that the Navy encounters as it carries out its worldwide operations. But when the uniforms were unveiled two years ago, traditionalists were horrified to see Royal Navy sailors would soon be wearing American-style baseball caps on operations. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said at the time the caps were 'cool and more modern'. The new uniforms also replaced buttons with Velcro, and zip-up boots with fake laces. But when the order for 1,700 uniforms arrived, they were unwearable. It is thought they had been steam cleaned but not dried properly before being packaged . The MoD went as far as to say the uniforms were a 'Daring fashion statement' - a play on words based around HMS Daring, the £1billion Type 45 destroyer where Combat Number 4 Dress was trialed. All 190 officers and crew were wearing the new uniform, with even the warship's commander Captain Gary Robinson opting to wear the baseball cap on the bridge during counter-piracy operations in the Arabian Gulf. Formal uniforms will continue to be worn, however, at official dinners and ceremonial occasions. However, this set back in the planned roll out is only a temporary, with a Royal Navy spokesman saying it was still full steam ahead. The spokesman said: 'We continue to work closely with our supplier in delivering this improved uniform, the majority of seagoing and operational units will be wearing the improved uniform by the end of July 2015.'","New easy-to-wear uniforms were supposed to be rolled out from January .

"Taylor Swift has won hundreds of awards, but she'll likely never forget her 2009 Best Female Video at the MTV Video Music Awards. Rapper Kanye West rushed the stage, stealing the microphone from the unsuspecting singer and insisting fellow nominee Beyonce had 'one of the best videos of all time.'

After it was announced that Taylor had one Best Female Video for You Belong With Me, Kanye West rushed the stage to denounce her victory over close friend Beyonce. Taylor began her acceptance speech for the coveted award, saying: 'Thank you so much! I always dreamed about what it would be like to maybe win one of these some day, but I never actually thought it would have happened. I sing country music so thank you so much for giving me a chance to win a VMA award.' However, she was quickly interrupted by Kanye, who said: 'Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé has one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time.' Surprise appearance: Kayne ran onto stage to protest Taylor's win, insisting that Beyonce's video was 'one of the best videos of all time' Shocked: The 1989 hitmaker was speechless after the rapper stole her microphone at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards ceremony . He was referencing Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It) which was also nominated in the category. However, the mortified look on Beyonce's face seemed to hint she didn't share his opinion of Taylor's win. She later invited Taylor onstage to give a proper acceptance speech when she won the award for Video of the Year. However, it appears the bad blood between the two artists is in the past, as they posed playfully at the 2015 Grammy ceremony. Working things out: Perhaps Taylor wanted to amend her issues with Kanye upon growing discussion of her feud with Katy Perry . Meeting the family: The songstress also took time to chat with Kanye's wife, reality star Kim Kardashian . Playing mediator? (L to R) Taylor's new pal Jay Z could also have played a hand in she and Kanye - pictured here with with Kim - resolving their issues . But even though he made his peace with Taylor, the rapper still showed a bit of a naughty streak as he recreated his 2009 VMA moment by running the stage following Beck's win for Album of the Year for Morning Phase. The artist beat out Beyonce's self-titled album, and for a moment it looked as if Kayne was going steal another microphone, but he quickly changed his mind and returned to his seat. At the awards show Taylor was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year - which both went to Sam Smith - and Best Pop Solo Performance - which went to Pharrell. She did take the stage to introduce pal Sam Smith's performance, as well as to present his victory in the category of Best New Artist. Kanye was nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration - which he lost to Eminem and Rihanna - and Best Rap Song - which he lost to Kendrick Lamar. He also performed at the event, returning to the Grammy stage for the first time in six years for both his single Only One, and his collaboration with Paul McCartney and Rihanna, FourFiveSeconds.

"Tracy Taylor says she is shocked that the motorist who knocked her off her bike during a Christmas Eve hit-and-run has got away 'scot-free' A hit-and-run motorist who caused a cyclist shocking injuries after  leaving her for dead in a muddy ditch will not face any criminal charges, it emerged today. Mother-of-one Tracy Taylor was flung head-first off the road after a car ploughed into her bike while she was out cycling on Christmas Eve. The 36-year-old, from Leek, Staffordshire, had stopped to take a photograph of the scenery when she was thrown nearly two metres in the air by a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction. The fitness instructor then slid through the mud, knocking herself unconscious. She also suffered a broken collar bone as well as cuts and bruises to her face. But the driver drove away from the scene, leaving Ms Taylor for dead by the roadside in the Meerbrook area of the Staffordshire Moorlands. Staffordshire Police launched an investigation and Ms Taylor released pictures of her injuries, prompting the driver to hand himself into police. But the force said today that they will not prosecute the 18-year-old driver due to a lack of evidence. Ms Taylor, who is recovering after undergoing an operation to insert metal pins into her shoulder, said she was shocked that the driver had got away 'scot-free'. She said: 'The guy handed himself in to police a week after I released the pictures but he's essentially got off scot-free. I just feel back to square one now, I'm really disappointed by the decision.' The  collision was also witnessed by Ms Taylor's friend Helen Birch-Machin, who was cycling with her at the time. The 48-year-old called an ambulance and Ms Taylor was rushed to Macclesfield Hospital where she needed nine stitches to her wounds. She is still unable to work. Ms Taylor added: 'I just feel useless. I haven't been able to work. I'm usually so fit and active and I haven't been able to run or cycle since. The 36-year-old, from Leek, Staffordshire, suffered horrific facial injuries after being thrown off her bike into the mud (pictured left and right). The driver will not face criminal charges, police say . The fitness instructor  landed on her face and was left with cuts and bruises (pictured) after the car, which was travelling in the opposite direction, ploughed into her while she was out cycling in Staffordshire . 'The police just told me there was lack of evidence and it's really difficult to prove dangerous driving. 'But just because its difficult I don't think it means they shouldn't try. They have a witness already and you can see what he did to me in the pictures. It was hard to take as the police had been really good to me.' Ms Taylor said the case had been passed over to traffic officers, meaning the driver could still be charged with a lesser offence. But she added: 'Its just a waiting game now for me to see whether I will ever be able to return to work. But mentally it has been very difficult for me too. Ms Taylor had been out with he friend Helen Birch-Machin when the pair stopped to take photographs of the scenery . 'I cannot remember Christmas or my 37th birthday, which was the following week. I have been left physically scarred for life but the mental scars are much worse. 'In the meantime, it appears the person responsible for leaving me in this state has got away with it.' Speaking at the time, Ms Taylor said she felt lucky to be alive. 'The car was approaching very fast and the next thing I knew I'd been knocked unconscious and was lying in the road,' she said. The keen cyclist also suffered cuts and bruises to her legs (left and right) but was discharged from hospital in time for Christmas with her son . She was treated at Macclesfield hospital where she had to have nine stitches for her injuries . 'My face was covered in mud and cuts, and my helmet was completely smashed to pieces. 'I kept coming in and out of consciousness and Helen called my dad because he was closer than any ambulance. 'I can't believe the driver left the scene - it was cowardly. My bike helmet saved my life. If it wasn't for my helmet I would be in a mortuary.' A police spokesman said: 'There was insufficient evidence to charge the driver. The cyclist has been updated on our decision.'","Tracy Taylor, 36, from Leek, Staffs, went for a bike ride on Christmas Eve .

"Jaguar is to live up to its ‘good to be bad’ reputation by providing a 200mph supercar for the new James Bond movie Spectre. A host of villainous-looking 4X4 Land Rovers and Range Rovers are also being supplied by British manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover for the agent 007’s latest big screen. The ‘baddy’s’ Jaguar’s C-X75 prototype will form part of a spectacular chase scene through Rome alongside 007’s already-revealed Aston Martin DB10, one of  just 10 cars being specially created for the movie. Jaguar is providing a 200mph petrol-electric hybrid supercar for the new James Bond movie Spectre . The ‘baddy’s’ C-X75 prototype will form part of a spectacular chase scene through Rome, it has emerged . The sleek C-X75 vehicles used in filming have been built in collaboration with Williams Advanced Engineering facility in Oxfordshire, England. For the movie it is likely to be fitted with fitted with Jaguar’s supercharged 5.0-litre V8 engine, instead of using its existing hybrid. The model had been due to go into full production with a near £1million price-tag but Jaguar pulled the plug because of the recession. Its appearance in the latest Bond movie may persuade bosses to reverse that decision. At the time the vehicle was unveiled, it was said to have been capable of 0-60mph in less than three seconds. It was also billed as having exceptionally low fuel consumption, with carbon dioxide emissions will be as low as those from a Toyota Prius family car. Just 250 were due to be built between 2013 and 2015 as part of a collaboration with the Williams Formula 1 team, combining race engineering with cutting-edge environmental technology. The sleek C-X75 vehicles used in filming have been built in collaboration with Williams Advanced Engineering facility in Oxfordshire, England . It had been due to go into full production with a near £1million price-tag but Jaguar pulled the plug because of the recession but its appearance in the latest Bond movie may persuade bosses to reverse that decision . The vehicles used for the film have been provided by Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations arm – the firm’s version of ‘Q-branch’ - which builds highly specialised versions of its cars including bespoke commissions, heritage products and branded goods. This includes high performance production models for both Jaguar and Land Rover, vehicle personalisation products and low volume, high value limited edition models for both brands. Some shots of blown-up, overturned and on-fire Land Rovers have already surfaced from shooting scenes in the snow in Obertilliach, Austria. In the new Spectre movie, a cryptic message from Bond’s past sends him on a trail to uncover the sinister organisation. While Bond’s boss ‘M’ battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to ‘reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre’, said movie insiders. James Bond's car in the new film will be this Aston Martin DB10, which will not be mass produced . The move is named after the fictional Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, headed by 007’s nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. A Jaguar Land Rover spokesman said: ‘Continuing Jaguar Land Rover’s successful involvement with the Bond franchise, Jaguar C-X75, Range Rover Sport SVR and Land Rover Defender Big Foot to feature in new James Bond movie, Spectre. Scenes including the heavily modified versions of Land Rover Defender & Range Rover Sport SVR have already been filmed in Austria. The Range Rover Sport SVR is the fastest and most powerful Land Rover ever. Powered by 550 horse-power 5 litre supercharged petrol engines they can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds and on to an electronically limited top speed of 162mph. The Land Rover Big Foots were constructed by Special Operations with huge 37-inch diameter off-road tyres to tackle the extreme terrain. They also feature bespoke suspension systems and enhanced body protection. Some shots of blown-up, overturned and on-fire Land Rovers have already surfaced from shooting scenes in the snow in Obertilliach, Austria . Daniel Craig turns into a gun-wielding agent on the set of the film, which is due for release in October . Managing director of Jaguar Land Rover Special Operations John Edwards, said: ‘This is an exciting partnership for Jaguar Land Rover and an opportunity to demonstrate the fantastic capabilities of the Special Operations team.’’ Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles have been involved in a succession of Bond films. Most recently in 2012 the rugged Defender 110 Double Cab Pick Up was driven by field agent Eve Moneypenny in the opening sequence to Skyfall. The movie is directed by Sam Mendes and written by John Logan, Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli and is due in cinemas in October. The new cast was only announced in December, with Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Monica Belushi, Dave Bautista and Andrew Scott lined up to star. Waltz has been widely expected to assume the role of legendary villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, head of the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, but the Oscar winning actor insists his part is more complex than speculation suggests. Asked if he would head the fictional terrorism organisation, Christoph told Collider: ‘No. No. It's more interesting than that.’ Spectre is the 24th James Bond adventure, from Albert R. Broccoli’s EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment.","The C-X75 prototype supercar will form part of chase scene through Rome .

"An 'invisible hand' of social convention is behind the mysterious rise and fall in the popularity which names parents pick for their children, according to a new study. While some had theorized that celebrity parents, or even the government, influence whether Jessica or Taylor is in for a given year, scientists have found evidence that a more subtle phenomenon is at work. According to the academics behind the study, the process of subconsciously trying to fit in with everybody else in a social group always leads to clear winners - even though it is impossible to pick who they are. Scroll down for video . Experiment: Scientists tested how trends emerged by asking subjects to name people in pictures they were shown, with a reward for choosing the same as somebody else. After a series of rounds, a set of most popular names emerged . Shifting tastes: The authors say their study disproves the notion that institutions or celebrities lead trends like baby naming - which instead happen by themselves . Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania and City University, London asked a group of people to pick names for a series of faces that flashed in front of them in an online game. Using small amounts of money, the players were rewarded for picking the same name as others in the group, and penalized for choosing a different one. Each time the results were different, players of the so-called Name Game were shown what other users picked, helping to inform their next choice. After several rounds of chaos, a few clear winners emerged, and a set of most popular names was born. Damon Centola, one of the authors, explained the process to the Washington Post. He said: 'In the very first few rounds, it was just utter failure and no one could match' 'But then you had a small, minor option that all of a sudden became explosively used by strangers - it just caught on like wildfire, and within a few rounds, was universally adopted.' Snap! In the above screenshot from the Name Game, some players chose the same name as each other, winning a reward, while others were penalized . Larger groups of people required longer for a consensus to emerge - but the overall trend was the same, according to the study, which was published in the PNAS academic journal. The trend appears to play out as explained on a much larger playing field. Baby names across all of the United States, compiled from birth records by the Social Security Administration, follow . Andrea Baronchelli, the co-author of the study, described the phenomenon as 'spontaneous emergence'. She said: 'Spontaneous emergence is like the existence of an invisible hand. 'Everybody is just trying to agree with their social circle, and spontaneously there will be the emergence of a single consensus.' Though the theory of spontaneous emergence is not new, the study marks the first time scientists have tested it on a large group - in this case around 100 people. As well as the narrow field of baby naming, the findings could can be applied to a much wider array of social conventions, such as changes in language or style. Trends: The study helps explain why baby names change in popularity. Above are the top 20 baby names in the Untied States for three different years - 1990 (left), 2000 (center) and 2013 (right). While some names, like Elizabeth, feature in all three, many have dropped away after ten or twenty years .","Recent study showed that trends like baby naming happen spontaneously .

"Brian Williams' nightly newscast on NBC was beaten soundly in the ratings by ABC's World News Tonight on Friday, two days after Williams apologized for telling a false story about being in a helicopter hit by a grenade in Iraq 12 years ago. The Nielsen company said that ABC's broadcast had 8.46 million viewers on Friday, while NBC's Nightly News had just under 8 million. Williams anchored the newscast for NBC. While it's not unusual for ABC to win some individual days in the ratings, NBC has been consistently winning on a week-to-week basis. Scroll down for video . Brian Williams' nightly newscast on NBC was beaten soundly in the ratings by ABC's World News Tonight on Friday, two days after Williams apologized for telling a false Iraq war story . On the previous Friday evening, ABC also won in the ratings by almost 400,000 viewers. News of Williams' Iraq tale came out on Wednesday of last week. On Saturday Williams announced that he was temporarily stepping away from the NBC Nightly News calling it 'painfully apparent' that he had become a distracting news story. In a memo to NBC News staff that was released by the network, the anchorman said that as managing editor of NBC Nightly News he is taking himself off the broadcast for several days. Weekend anchor Lester Holt will fill in, Williams said. NBC News has so far refused to comment on when or whether Williams would return and who would decide his future. Williams, however, said he would be back. 'In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions,' Williams said in his memo. 'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us,' he wrote. On the previous Friday evening, ABC's World News Tonight - hosted by David Muir - had also won in the ratings by almost 400,000 viewers . NBC News President Deborah Turness said Friday that an internal investigation had been launched after questions arose over Williams' false on-air statements that he was in a helicopter hit by a rocket-propelled grenade while in Iraq in 2003. Williams apologized for those statements Wednesday. There was no indication by Williams, who has anchored NBC Nightly News since 2004, that an absence was forthcoming during his newscast Friday. He signed off as he usually does, saying he hoped people would be back to see him Monday. Holt did mention Williams' leave in Saturday's newscast. 'A word tonight about our colleague Brian Williams, who you may know has been under scrutiny this past week over his recollection of certain stories he's covered,' Holt said before reading Williams' memo to viewers. Since Williams' apology, questions also have been raised about his claim that he saw a body or bodies in the Hurricane Katrina floodwaters that hit New Orleans in 2005. His remarks in a 2006 interview drew suspicion because there was relatively little flooding in New Orleans' French Quarter, the area where Williams was staying. A person at NBC confirmed that Williams stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, which is in an area where a news photographer and a law enforcement official said they saw bodies. Williams' troubles began last month when he broadcast an item about meeting up with war vet Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack, who the anchor had befriended in 2003 in Iraq . The effect on 'Nightly News' remains to be seen. But even if its ratings suffer for a long period, it wouldn't be enough to damage the credit profile of parent Comcast Corp., said Mike Simonton, an analyst with Fitch Ratings. 'Comcast is a large, diverse media conglomerate with meaningful financial cushion to endure weakness in any one of its smaller divisions over a period of time,' he said. Other media companies have survived departures of on-air stars, Simonton said. Paul Levinson, professor of communications and media studies at Fordham University, called Williams' time off a good idea for him and NBC News. 'It gives him a chance to catch his breath and, on a human level, it must be excruciating to get on the air and report the news and not say anything about this,' Levinson said. NBC News, he said, 'wants to be in the business of reporting on the news, and not have people thinking, 'is he telling the truth?'' Weekend anchor Lester Holt is currently filling in after Williams announced that he was temporarily stepping away from the NBC Nightly News . Rich Hanley, director of the graduate journalism program at Quinnipiac University, also lauded Williams' leave. It buys time for the network to assemble a contingency plan in the event it determines to suspend or remove him, Hanley said. A final decision may await the finding of any 'collateral impact' on another key NBC program, Today, which would be evident when the February ratings numbers come out, he said. Nightly News has reigned as the top-rated evening newscast over its competition on CBS and ABC. Williams' importance to NBC News goes beyond his anchor status, said Al Tompkins, a faculty member for broadcast and online at The Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank. 'He sets the tone of the network. It may not be as critical as when (Walter) Cronkite was CBS' anchor, in every way, but he is more than a face,' he said. Williams' absence itself is a delicate challenge, according to Tompkins. 'He can't be gone long. The timing will be critical — too short and it won't seem like he has taken himself out of the game long enough, and too long and he looks like damaged goods,' he said.","Friday night's television ratings reveal that Brian Williams' Nightly News broadcast was soundly beaten by rival ABC .

"Scientists have developed a transparent eggshell that allows the growth of an embryo to be monitored in a laboratory. While the ‘egg’ itself was artificial, the bird embryo inside is very much real - and allows the researchers a unique glimpse into how embryos develop . The method could be used to perform test drugs and techniques on embryos grown in this way, rather than performing tests on laboratory animals. Scroll down for video . Scientists in Beijing have created a see-through eggshell (shown looking at the top). They grew a real avian embryo for 17 days - three days before it hatched. The shell was made of a silicon-based organic polymer. It is the first time such an egg has been grown in a laboratory . The embryo featured in the video didn't hatch to grow into an adult bird, but scientists say their methods could allow embryos to be manipulated to understand how various biological processes work. The method could be a breakthrough in ‘lab-on-a-chip’ technologies, which can simulate a variety of organs such as the heart, kidneys or skin. Improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near '100 per cent efficiency' in trials using mice, a leading scientist warned last month. Dr Tony Perry, a geneticist at the University of Bath, said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children. The warning followed a breakthrough in April in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living, adult mice using the Crispr-Cas9 gene editing technique. Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level. Dr Perry told the BBC that it may soon find its way into fertility treatments. 'There are heritable diseases coded by mutations in DNA and some people could say, ""I don't want my children to have these mutations,'"" he said. He said it is up to society, and not just scientists, to look at the implications and decide whether the technology is worth the risk. The goal is to use stem cells to make miniature replicas of organs and see how they react to drugs and treatments. A benefit of doing this is that, rather performing tests on laboratory animals, the tests can be carried out on specific organs. Embryos, though, are particularly hard to replicate. This is the first time a so-called ‘egg-on-a-chip’ has been created in the laboratory. The two scientists, from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, part of the School of Medicine, at Tsinghua University in Beijing, published their research in the journal Science China Technological Sciences. The artificial shell matches the shape and curvature of a real eggshell, and uses a transparent layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) - a silicon-based organic polymer. It is also soft, to mimic the texture of a real shell. In experiments, carried out over the course of about two years, the scientists constructed a series of the artificial eggshells. They then cultivated avian embryos for up to 17.5 days - slightly less time than the 20 days required for it to hatch, according to Science Alert. In a video the embryo is seen moving around inside the egg, and provides an easier method of observing the evolution of an embryo over time. The method could allow embryos to be altered to observe changes in how birds grow (stock image of an egg hatching sown). And there are hopes the method could be replicated for human embryos . Previously, scientists had to rely on a method known as ‘windowing’ to get a peek into the processes going on inside an egg. This essentially involved removing part of the shell and replacing it with a transparent material. In their paper the researchers say the new method ‘promises a future strategy for “lab-on-an-egg” technology which may be important in a wide variety of either fundamental or practical areas.’ Practical applications are likely to include the injection of blood or any body fluidic specimens into this ""egg-on-a-chip"" for early diagnosis. This is because an egg has the potential to function as an amplification system. And there are also hopes that the method may be a precursor to similar laboratory experiments for human embryos. Here the process of removing the embryo from an egg and placing it in the artificial shell is shown . Inside the shell, the embryo was allowed to grow for up to 17.5 days - three days before it hatched .","Scientists in Beijing have created a see-through eggshell .

"A young girl was among four people killed yesterday when a truck ran out of control near a school. Pupils were returning home from lessons when the driver of the gravel lorry careered round a corner and crashed into vehicles and pedestrians. The dead girl is thought to have been walking with her mother and grandmother. The other victims were inside a car. At least four more people were injured in the carnage and taken to hospital, one of them by air ambulance. Floral tributes were left at the scene this morning as police continued their investigations in what caused the accident. Scroll down for video . The lorry ended up on its side after striking several cars and a number of pedestrians as it travelled down Lansdown Lane just after 4pm yesterday . A young girl was among four people killed yesterday when a truck ran out of control near a school in Bath . Pupils were returning home from lessons when the driver of the gravel lorry careered round a corner and crashed into vehicles and pedestrians . Witnesses said the truck driver appeared to be having brake trouble when he lost control on a steep hill on the northern outskirts of Bath at around 4pm. Emergency services based themselves at nearby Weston All Saints Primary School, which will be closed today, leading to fears the girl might have been a pupil there. The truck hit a number of vehicles and at least two pedestrians as it careered down Lansdown Lane in the Upper Weston area of the Somerset city. A 66-year-old woman who lives opposite the scene of the crash said: ‘My whole house shook with a terrific noise like a bomb going off. I rushed outside and it was just mayhem. ‘The lorry was on its side on top of a black car, and I was told three people in the black car had died. ‘The gravel from the lorry was all over the road and the fire brigade arrived and cut the bodies free from the wreckage. ‘The lorry had hit lots of other cars on its way down the hill, and I was told there was a grandmother, mother and daughter walking along the pavement and that the little girl had been killed when the lorry mounted the pavement.’ This morning, floral tributes were laid at the scene near where four people lost their lives yesterday afternoon . Sand which was spilled in the road when the truck crashed remained next to the smashed wall this morning . The woman added that there were injured people wherever she looked, adding: ‘The lorry seemed to have had brake failure and it came to rest on the corner. ‘It demolished the walls of all the houses on the corner and two workmen said the driver shot through the windscreen. ‘It was an accident waiting to happen. I have complained to the police before about these heavy lorries going up and down the lane. ‘It is too steep and too narrow for such big, heavy vehicles and there is supposed to be a 6ft width restriction on the lane but they just ignore it.’ Another resident said the road was unsuitable for lorries. He added: ‘It’s supposed to be no vehicles over 6ft wide but the lorries have been using it as a shortcut for years and no one has ever done anything about it. Maybe they will now, but that’s not going to help those poor people who have died.’ The wreckage of the tipper truck is taken away from the scene on the back of a trailer late last night . Wreckage of the cars destroyed as the lorry careered down the hill were removed from the scene last night . Police remain at Lansdown Lane this morning and are continuing to investigate what caused the accident . Another local said the truck driver was sounding the horn frantically and even overtook another lorry: ‘It was clear he could not stop.’ Last night none of the victims had been named by Avon and Somerset Police. Chief Superintendent Caroline Peters said: ‘We are dealing with a very tragic collision here that has had four people lose their lives. We believe a tipper has been coming downhill, it has lost control and made attempts to avert an accident. ‘However, it has made contact with two pedestrians and a number of other vehicles. ‘What is important to us now is to ascertain the actual cause of this collision and to get as much information as we possibly can. ‘We have got collision investigators working and will be working throughout the night.’ Chris Lucas saw two air ambulance helicopters landing on a playing field shortly after the crash. After the lorry and other vehicles were removed last night, workers started to clear up the debris this morning . Wreckage remained at the scene this morning. Those who arrived at the scene first described it as 'mayhem' A service is being held at the local church this morning and those who witnessed the accident are being offered counselling. Pictured: Electricity workers at the scene this morning . Mr Lucas said: ‘My children were coming home and as I opened the front door my neighbour said, “Oh my God there has been a crash”. We didn’t know at that point how bad it was. ‘One thing that is really is concerning is that road is on the school pick-up run. Weston All Saints Primary School is right next to it. ‘It is a very tight community here and one of my children goes to that school. My thoughts go out to everyone involved.’ A spokesman for Bath and North East Somerset Council confirmed that the school would be closed today at the request of police. ‘Due to the tragic accident on Lansdown Lane this evening, the police have asked that Weston All Saints Primary be closed tomorrow,’ he said last night. A spokesman for the Royal United Hospital in Bath said the three patients treated there had minor injuries. ‘As a precaution, one adult male and one adult female are being kept in overnight,’ he said. ‘The third person, an adult male, is being discharged.’ The dead girl is thought to have been walking with her mother and grandmother. There are fears she was a pupil at a nearby school which will be closed in the morning . Pictures this evening show the scene of the crash is still cordoned off as police investigate what happened . A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service Trust confirmed a woman was flown to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. The woman remains in the critical condition this morning, the trust in charge of Southmead hospital confirmed. Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, said: ‘The community is in shock, both for the families of those killed and also those who have been injured. ‘We are still waiting to get more details as to what the cause was. It is obviously devastating, tragic and awful, but until we know more we cannot speculate.’ He confirmed that the council had imposed 20mph speed restrictions on parts of Landsdown Lane road to improve safety. He said: ‘It is a road where we have put speed limits in and flashing lights because it is quite a steep hill coming down. There have been attempts by the council over the years to improve safety.’ A service of prayers will be held at All Saints Church, Weston at 10am this morning. Weston All Saints Primary School was closed today after it was used by police at the scene yesterday . Air ambulance crews land at a school near the crash site shortly after the incident yesterday afternoon . The crash is a chilling echo of the tragic accident in which a bin lorry ran out of control and killed six people in Glasgow in December. Crowds of Christmas shoppers looked on in horror as the lorry mounted a pavement and knocked down shoppers at lunchtime in one of the city centre’s busiest streets. Erin McQuade, 18, along with her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died in the incident on December 22. Miss McQuade’s mother Jacqueline, who had gone to withdraw money from a nearby cash machine, could only watch helplessly as her parents and daughter, a student at Glasgow University, were mown down. Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, and tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed. The driver of the lorry, who was later named as Harry Clarke, said that he had collapsed unconscious at the wheel before losing control of the truck. The 58-year-old, who is undergoing tests for a possible heart condition, stressed that he had no problems with his health before the crash. As an HGV driver, he had been subject to regular and thorough medical examinations, and there were no warning signs before he collapsed. He added that he thinks of the victims ‘every minute of every day’. ‘I understand a lot of people want to know what happened that day. I wish I could tell you but I can’t. I never had anything wrong with my heart until that day,’ he said. A source close to a police inquiry into the tragedy said that things happened so quickly that two workmates sitting behind Mr Clarke were left with no chance of taking the controls. The lorry crashed within seconds of his collapse.","Young girl and three adults killed as tipper truck careers down hill .

"Dressed in traditional Baianas women perform the 'Lavagem' or washing ritual that will bring luck to the centrepiece of Rio de Janeiro's Carnival celebrations, the Sambadrome, ahead of the festival's official launch on Friday. The countdown to this annual feast of music and colour is continuing apace in spite of the odds being stacked against it by financial strife in the country, water shortages caused by drought and the flow-on effect of a corruption scandal within the state oil company Petrobras. While official parades in Sao Paulo have survived the axe after intense contemplation by officials, the main event in the capital Brasilia has had to be cancelled. Scroll down for video . A woman dressed in Baianas is among the group performing the traditional 'Lavagem' to bring good luck to the Sambodrome . A dancer performs during a rehearsal at the Sambodrome on Sunday as the countdown to Rio's 2015 Carnival continues apace .

Two costumed men pose and  an elderly couple dress up for a bloco, one of the many parties held in the lead up to and during official Carnival festivities - the blocos have been hit hard by the looming recession and a lack of sponsorship this year . Perhpas the most famous city for Carnival, Rio, is of course set to go ahead, thanks in part to its popularity with both locals and tourists. An estimated 75,000 local and foreign spectators pack into the Sambadrome to take part in the spectacular ceremony that kicks off the five-day celebrations. Meanwhile other events have been scaled back as sponsors watch their pennies. Most hit have been the blocos, independently organised parties on favela streets, beaches and other venues in cities across the country as they rely heavily on outside funding. Bloco Cru, an event that usually attracts 50,000 revellers, is one of the blocos that won't take place this year after the usual backer Lu Baratz admitted she couldn't fund it this year. 'We didn't achieve sufficient sponsorship to guarantee the party's infrastructure,' she told the O Globo newspaper. 'It is important that the sponsors and council do more than pay for chemical toilets, they need to support the local spirit of carnival.' Still, more than 900,000 visitors are expected in Rio for the official opening parade on Friday and already rehearsals and preliminary parades have shown markers for what the festival is famous for.

This year's event comes after a World Cup at which Germany left the victors but the value to the host nation is said to have been minimal.

"It appears that a double life sentence isn't enough to cow 85-year-old mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger. The Boston gangster allegedly had an improper relationship last year with a female psychologist at the maximum security prison in Tucson, Arizona where he was being held - resulting in him being swiftly transferred to a Florida facility  and the woman being suspended from her job. An investigation is reportedly underway into allegations from last summer that Bulger provided the counselor, who is in her thirties, with autographed mugshots. In return, she reportedly got him moved to his own cell and lobbied to allow him to write to his jail-bird girlfriend, Catherine Greig,The Boston Globe reported on Sunday. James 'Whitey' Bulger (pictured in 2011) was suddenly moved to a prison in Florida last summer, reportedly because he was having an improper relationship with a prison psychologist who managed to get him privileges such as writing to his girlfriend (and fellow prisoner) Catherine Greig . Grieg is currently jailed at a minimum-security facility in Waseca, Minnesota for harboring a fugitive and is due to be released in 2018. In 2013, Bulger was convicted and sentenced on racketeering charges that tied him to 11 murders and other gangland crimes from the 1970s and 1980s. The Globe reported that Bulger had become something of a celebrity on arrival at the Arizona prison in January 2014. He had posed for photographs inside the prison and reportedly loved to tell stories about his violent past. A portrait of Bulger as a young man, with his inmate number during his time at Alcatraz, has even been posted to eBay reportedly signed by the notorious gangster and the artist, Josh Pietrantonio. A source close to Mr Pietrantonio told Daily Mail Online on Monday that Bulger had signed a few pieces for the artist and the pair had become good friends - 'one of his only friends' -  at the federal prison. During his time in Tucson, it also appears as if Bulger turned his charms on the prison psychologist, who has not been identified. A Justice Department investigation has been launched, according to the Boston Globe, with agents questioning Bulger and the counselor about their relationship. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from the Justice Department on Monday. Investigators were reportedly trying to find out if the prison counselor lobbied to get him placed in his own cell and have the prison warden sign off on Bulger being allowed to write to Grieg. A portrait of a young James Bulger (with his Alcatraz number and his signature) currently has a bid of $595 on eBay and was allegedly painted by a former inmate. A prison psychologist is also reportedly under investigation for taking autographed mugshots of the notorious crime boss . The investigation is also looking into whether the psychologist tried to make money selling autographed pictures of Bulger, whose life story has been the subject of numerous books, documentaries and an upcoming movie starring Johnny Depp. The female employee has denied doing anything illegal. She was barred from the prison, according to The Globe, but is still on the payroll. It was unclear whether she will be criminally charged or be disciplined by her employer. Bulger was moved to Florida in early September last year. His attorney Hank Brennan said at the time that he hadn’t been told why Bulger was moved. For policy reasons, U.S. Penitentiary Tuscon were unable to comment on the reported investigation and could not comment on Bulger's transfer for security reasons. Bulger is currently serving his sentence at Coleman II, a high-security penitentiary in Sumterville, Florida. Bulger fled Boston shortly before his 1995 indictment after being tipped off by a former FBI agent. He was one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives for 16 years until his 2011 arrest in Santa Monica, California. Bulger's case ultimately became a black eye for the FBI and the basis for recent Hollywood movies after it was revealed that corrupt federal agents had accepted bribes and protected him over the years. Following a 35-day trial, a federal jury  found Bulger guilty of 31 of 32 counts in August 2013, including racketeering, money laundering, extortion and firearms violations. The jury also found prosecutors had proved Bulger participated in 11 of the 19 murders of which he was accused. Bulger was sentenced in November 2013. USP Tucson would not confirm on Monday if they were being investigated by the Justice Department following a female counselor's relationship with Whitey Bulger .","The Boston gangster allegedly developed a bond with a female psychologist at the maximum security prison in Tucson, Arizona .

"When Callie Martin suffered an ectopic pregnancy following three miscarriages, she thought her dreams of having a baby were over. But six months after having emergency surgery to remove the embryo, she gave birth to a little girl – after doctors realised she had been carrying twins. Unbeknown to the 26-year-old and her medics, she had conceived both normally and ectopically at the same time. And at odds of just 50,000 to one, her daughter Emmie survived in the womb – despite the trauma of an invasive operation. 'When doctors told me I was still pregnant I thought they must be wrong,' the customer service adviser said. Scroll down for video . Emmie survived in the womb – despite the trauma of an invasive operation - and was delivered by caesarean section in August weighing 6lb . Callie Martin and partner Kailan Broughton with baby Emmie aged four months who beat 50,000 to one odds to be born after mum Callie had emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy . 'But when they showed me the scan and I saw her heart beating, I was just overcome with joy.' Miss Martin and her partner Kailan Broughton, 24, were 'simply devastated' when she began to miscarry at eight weeks pregnant last year. They were told their baby had begun developing in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus – a potentially fatal condition which meant Miss Martin needed urgent surgery to end the pregnancy and save her life. 'We'd already had three miscarriages,' Miss Martin said. 'It felt as if I'd never be a mother.' Yet four weeks after the operation, she felt pain in her stomach and was rushed to hospital for an ultrasound scan. It was then that astounded doctors discovered a tiny second embryo developing normally in her uterus and realised she had what's known as a heterotopic pregnancy. '[It] is so rare that although doctors said they'd heard of it, no one had ever actually seen it before,' Miss Martin added. Four weeks after the operation Miss Martin felt pain in her stomach and was rushed to hospital for scan.

Miss Martin and her partner Kailan Broughton, 24, were 'simply devastated' when she began to miscarry at eight weeks pregnant last year, but their daughter Emmie was born in August . The condition is usually associated with IVF, making Miss Martin's case even more unusual as she had conceived naturally. Knowing his partner had been to hospital, Mr Broughton rushed back to their home in Greenwich, South East London, to be with her. 'He saw me crying and was sick with worry. But I was crying with joy,' she said. After an otherwise healthy pregnancy, Emmie was delivered by caesarean section in August. She was born six weeks early and weighed 6lb. 'My consultant said the surgery usually would have killed the other embryo and induced a miscarriage,' Miss Martin added. 'So it is truly miraculous that Emmie is alive.'

"Officer Larry Tuttle, 40, was identified by police as the victim of a murder-suicide along with an unidentified woman at a Dallas apartment complex . An six-year veteran Dallas cop was pronounced dead along with an unidentified woman in a murder-suicide Saturday night. Officer Larry Tuttle, 40, was identified by police arriving to a report of gunfire at Lake Highlands Landing apartments. 'Preliminary investigation indicates that the female shot and killed Officer Tuttle prior to taking her own life,' Officer Juan Fernandez told press in a written statement. 'It's a difficult time for the department and family,' he added. A six-year old child reportedly spotted exiting the apartment was later found unharmed. 'I heard probably four or five gunshots altogether,' said neighbor Trui Mitchell. 'There was a few, and then you could hear a girl crying out, 'Oh God, oh God!' and then I heard a couple more shots.' The relationship between Tuttle and the woman has yet to be explained, or what if any connection he may have had to the child. 'Honestly, I had some tears I did shed, it's very sad,' neighbor Aaron Cano told WFAA. 'My heart goes out to her; she's too little to witness that.' Police are keeping the name of the woman out of the media until her next of kin has been notified. A six-year old child seen fleeing the scene at the apartment was reportedly unharmed . At least one neighbor told reporters Tuttle had an elementary school-aged son. '[They were] playing with different things, playing with his toys, cleaning up his house sometimes, things like that,' Jared Ingram said of spotting the pair. He called the police officer a 'good neighbor.' Residents were only allowed back into the apartment complex several hours after the shooting and undergoing questioning from police.","Officer Larry Tuttle, 40, was identified by police arriving to a report of gunfire at Lake Highlands Landing apartments .

"We've all had those stubborn blemishes - the angry red mark on your face that refuses to disappear, no matter how many ointments and cleaners you apply. Well, now help may be at hand thanks to the  technology experts at Sony. The company has launched a new product called BeautyExplorer, which analyses all of the components in your skin, including pores, moisture, melanin, grease and pigmentation. The new BeautyExplorer by Sony that is designed to analyse the quality of your skin . The small skin view camera takes close-up pictures of the skin's surface as well as skin analysing sensors that use  multiple wavelength light source controls, and skin-analyzing algorithms to work out the condition of the skin. As well as examining the surface of the skin, the sensors are also able to reach the layers just underneath, which would usually be invisible to the naked eye. The idea is that a person can then work out what toiletries will be most useful to deal with a certain problem area. A spokesperson for the company explains: 'It can tell you all you need to know about any unwanted blemishes, pores, brightness or colouring that has had the misfortune of gracing your face.' The new technology will make it easier for men and women to determine the reasons behind blemishes and spots (picture posed by model|) They continued: 'Furthermore, pigmentation on and beneath the surface of the skin can be viewed by conducting pixel-by-pixel analysis of melanin in the skin, thus enabling information to be obtained about non-visible skin, including concealed markings and blemishes. 'Alas, we can’t develop an app that will remove them just yet (we’re not that good), but surely half of the battle is knowing that they’re there.' The program will also store the data on a cloud, so the user can get a detailed graph of how their skin condition has changed over time by using different products.","Sony has launched new BeautyExplorer that maps condition of your skin .

"Andrew Hine, headteacher at Benjamin Britten High School in Lowestoft, Suffolk, has introduced 'time out' cards, allowing pupils to leave their lessons . A scheme at a troubled school where disruptive or emotional pupils can walk out of class has been branded an ‘admission of failure’. Children are issued with a ‘time out’ card that can be waved at a teacher when they feel overwhelmed by ‘complex and often confidential issues’. There is no limit on its use, allowing cardholders to leave whenever they feel like it. The school – Benjamin Britten High in Lowestoft, Suffolk – defended the scheme, saying only 4 per cent of its pupils had one of the cards. But education experts warned classmates might be encouraged to misbehave to gain the same privileges. ‘This allows children to get out of lessons as a reward for poor behaviour and will be seen as a badge of honour,’ said Chris McGovern of the Campaign for Real Education. ‘It’s a topsy-turvy approach where the children are in charge of discipline rather than the teacher, which would tend to undermine the disciplinary structure. It is an admission of failure by the school – a last, desperate measure.’ The scheme was also bad training for life, Mr McGovern added, because ‘bus drivers and bank managers can’t just walk out when they’ve had enough’. The laminated cards, which are printed with the pupil’s name, are understood to have been introduced around three years ago. The co-educational school – which has the motto ‘A fresh way of thinking’ – has about 950 children, meaning almost 40 have a card. Pupils who excuse themselves are expected to go to the ‘student office’ where they are supervised by an adult. The school was put into special measures in October following a devastating Ofsted report. Inspectors criticised weak teaching, low expectations of pupils, low-level disruption in lessons, widespread bullying and poor attendance. It has also been hit by a series of teacher strikes over pay deals and lesson monitoring. Last year only 37 per cent of GCSE students achieved five A* to C grades including English and maths, well below the national target. One parent, who declined to be named, said: ‘The scheme is wide open to abuse. Badly behaved kids only have to get one of these cards and they can get a free pass out of lessons.’ The scheme at the school in Lowestoft, Suffolk, (pictured) is designed so that other children in the class can continue with lessons, without their learning being disrupted by pupils who require the cards . The school said the cards are given to students following a ‘review of their needs, often on the recommendation of external specialists’. Use of the card ‘varies from student to student’ and frequent use will ‘trigger a review of that student’s needs’. Headteacher Andrew Hine added that the scheme was ‘tailored to a minority of students who may be dealing with a range of issues, such as managing their anger responses; bereavement and family illness; issues relating to mental health problems’. He added: ‘The way students use the cards is reviewed regularly and this is a major step in keeping students in mainstream lessons. ‘The strategy has been key in reducing classroom disruption and allowing the rest of the class to continue learning.’","Benjamin Britten High School in Suffolk has brought in card system .

"Landing in the UK by private jet is normally the preserve of the rich and famous. But then six-week old Dax is used to making unusual entrances, having arrived prematurely while his parents were on a short break in New York. Mum Katie Amos and dad Lee Johnston were overjoyed at his birth just after Christmas - but faced a £85,000 hospital bill while they waited until early March for their son to be well enough to travel. Special delivery: Katie Amos, 30, at home with baby Dax who was born 11-weeks early, whilst his parents where on holiday in New York . Their travel insurance company has now confirmed all costs will be covered, however, and flown them home in a specially equipped medical jet, complete with a doctor and nurse. 'When we were finally given the all-clear to come home I broke down in tears. We were so happy, no words could describe it,' said Miss Amos, 30. 'It was such an incredible feeling to step off the Tarmac in the UK. It was such as relief.' The couple had been told Dax, who weighed 3lb at birth, wasn't be able to travel home until his original due date of March 10 as he wouldn't be able to fly on a commercial plane. But Lenox Hill Hospital in New York gave the go-ahead on Thursday after insurers Allianz said they were providing the private jet, which has an incubator. They left on Friday and stopped briefly in Canada and Iceland before arriving East Midlands Airport the following day. Katie  and Dax's father Lee Johnston were overjoyed at his birth just after Christmas - but faced a £85,000 hospital bill while they waited until early March for their son to be well enough to travel . Dax, pictured in Pilgrim Hospital, weighed just 3lbs when he unexpectedly arrived in December last year . Parents Katie Amos and Lee Johnston, both 30, flew Dax home from New York in his own private medical jet . Katie Amos, 30, and fiancé Lee Johnston, 29, from Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, welcomed son Dax (together above) unexpectedly . Safe and sound: Dax, who now weighs 5lb 9oz, is being cared for at Pilgrim Hospital in Lincolnshire but should be able to go home in a fortnight . Dax, who now weighs 5lb 9oz, is being cared for at Pilgrim Hospital in Lincolnshire but should be able to go home in a fortnight. Miss Amos and her fiancé, also 30, flew to the U.S on Boxing Day for a last holiday together as a couple. But she unexpectedly went into labour on the second day of the four-day break while on a movie tour in Central Park. 'I was in complete denial when I went into labour. I just kept saying to the nurses I wasn't having my baby I was going home,' she said. 'It wasn't until I was being told to push that it finally started to sink in.' What should have been a joyous occasions was tarnished by the sickening realisation they might face a six-figure bill for the medical care they received if their insurers, Allianz, didn't cover the cost. 'When we arrived at the hospital one of the nurses asked Lee to sort out our medical insurance,' added Miss Amos, a fitness instructor. 'When he came back he was grey in the face. The woman he had spoken to said she wouldn't accept our insurance. It was so scary. 'There was a huge list – even the examination cost $500.' Miss Amos and son Dax (above), who was born weighing 3lbs, and told he wouldn't be able to fly until March . Dax, who was born 11 weeks early while his parents were on a four-day break in the Big Apple, was kept in an incubator during the flight . A team of doctors, nurses and pilots helped the Johnstons fly to Lincolnshire in a 'military-style operation' After a nail-biting five-day wait the couple, from Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, were given the good news that they would not have to foot the bill. But they still had to wait for doctors to approve the journey – and apply for a U.S passport. 'To get a UK passport it would have taken up to three months and we wanted to get him home as soon as we could so Dax has a U.S passport and birth certificate,' said Miss Amos. 'Just to get the photo we had to remove all of his vital tubes that helped him feed and breathe – it was really scary. 'Being born so prematurely Dax has had a few health problems but he's doing really well now.' She added: 'He has reflux which is common for premature babies as his little body has had so much to contend with. 'He's still being closely monitored as he suffers from Patent Ductus Arteriosus which means one of the main arteries from his heart isn't closed properly. It's looking positive though as doctors say this should close on its own.' It had been feared the baby wouldn't be given the all-clear to fly until March 10 - his original due date . Little Dax is now staying at Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, after flying home with a US passport . Dax is still being closely monitored as he suffers from Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) which means one of the main arteries from his heart is not closed properly . Dax flew home from Lennox Hill hospital in New York after doctors gave him the all-clear to fly on Thursday . She added: 'We have cried, laughed and felt everything in between. It's been a really tough journey and we are over the moon that it's finally over.' The couple were helped while abroad by donations of nearly £12,000 that flooded into a fundraising website and was used for clothes, food and other essentials. Mr Johnston, who is also a fitness instructor, said all donations were now going towards a charity that provided them with cheap accommodation during their stay in the Big Apple. He added: 'Being the man of the house it's my job to look after my family and take control but I was completely helpless over there. I just tried to do as much as I could for Katie and Dax. 'Luckily, we were very prepared and my dad is a painter and decorator so Dax's nursery was virtually finished before we went. We can't wait to get him home now.'","Katie Amos and fiancé Lee Johnston went to New York for four-day break .

"Andorra may be one of the cheapest places to go skiing, and ahead of the half-term holidays it may just be the best. Heavy snowfall around the Pyrenees has left skiing conditions in the European country being described as 'amazing,' and the forecast doesn't look likely to change over the next few days. In-resort costs have dropped as much as 23 per cent on last year in Andorra, with Soldeu providing the cheapest option for a ski trip, according to the latest stats from Post Office Travel Money. Heavy snowfall across the Pyrenees will be music to the ears of those planning a ski trip to the region . With much of Europe under a deluge of snow, this opens up some tricky decisions as to which ski resort will offer the best overall deal . It may be good news for skiers, but heavy snow on the Pyrenees has not being met with similar enthusiasm by townsfolk . The Andorran ski resort of Soldeu has seen the biggest slide with a 23 per cent price reduction at resort . This takes into account costs such as equipment, six-day passes, lessons and food and drink. Around six-and-a-half feet of snow was reported to have fallen in Andorra last week, with ski resorts expecting the conditions to attract a raft of tourists over the holidays. Once the falling snow ceases, visibility will improve which mean Andorra could be the place to go this ski season. Koko Sarkari, from the International Currency Exchange (ICE) told MailOnline Travel: 'When looking at the cost of a ski pass to compare relative costs in popular ski destinations across Europe, those travelling to Andorra will be paying around 45 Euros for an adult compared to 49 Euros in Courcheval in France or 50 Euros in Val d'Isere. 'Eating out isn't too expensive - in Andorra a meal for two in a mid-range restaurant can be had for around 35 Euros, whereas it's a little cheaper in Val d'sere and Courcheval at around 30 Euros**. 'So while ski pass costs are slightly cheaper and meals slightly more expensive than neighbouring ski destinations in France, the real cost benefit of going to Andorra right now is that skiers can capitalise on the weakness of the Euro, which is accepted widely in the country. 'Last February, £1 bought 1.17 Euros, this year it's around 1.30 offering a saving of around £4 on a ski pass.' And France, while generally being at the other end of the cost scale to Andorra, is also likely to be a popular destination, with five feet of snow falling in Avoriaz and Chamonix. Val d'Isère has been the big winner in France, with the Tarentaise Valley ski resort recording a depth of 5ft 7ins of snow on the upper pistes. Upper pistes in Serre Chevalier in the French Alps have over 5ft of snow. After they scrapped the Euro cap on the Swiss Franc, a rise against the Euro has even led to many cancelling prospective ski trips to Switzerland due to fears of escalating prices. But Verbier offers high thrills to the skier, with the highest pistes holding a 190cm-deep snow base. With pistes  rising to 3,100m under the Matterhorn, Zermatt is also a popular destination. And with the heavy snowfall comes the evident cold snap, temperatures around Europe have fallen well below zero, so the advice to skiers would be to wrap up at all times. While heavy snowfall in the Pyrenees is good for skiers, getting out there may prove problematic depending on how you travel . Northern Spain has also been hit byheavy snowfall, with the small towns of Roncesvalles and Burguete, in the Pyrenees, buried . A woman walks  along the road on a winter's day in the small town of El Espinal, in the Pyrenees mountains in northern Spain . Chamonix is also benefitting from heavy snowfall, with over 5ft reported in the last few days meaning joy for those on the slopes . A traffic signal is covered by the snow in the Pyrenees small town of Burguete, northern Spain, with temperatures well below freezing . Prices have plunged downhill at ski resorts, offering British winter sports enthusiasts good value for money this year. Total costs were at their lowest in Bansko in Bulgaria (£261), while other good-value resorts were Kranjska Gora in Slovenia (£300), Ellmau in Austria (£311) and Livigno in Italy (£322). Priciest of the European resorts surveyed was Zermatt in Switzerland (£687). For the best family deals, Bansko (£848) remains the cheapest skiing for a family of four. However, Kranjska Gora (£1,110) has lost its runner up position because of a significant 18 per cent price fall in both Soldeu (£982) and Ellmau (£985).","Conditions on the slopes in Andorra have been described as 'amazing' and will be top choice this half-term .
Country also benefits from being one of the cheapest to ski in Europe - appealing to families .
France and resorts such as Chamonix have reported heavy snowfall, although the Pound won't go as far ."
"A one-year-old boy born with a hole in his heart will undergo surgery to give him half a brain this week in a desperate bid to stop his daily seizures. Caleb Miller made headlines when he received a heart transplant at just four months old in July 2013 after doctors diagnosed his congenital heart defect. But while he was on the waiting list, he suffered a stroke that obliterated the key functions of the left side of his brain, leaving him with epilepsy. Now, his mother, of Springfield, Missouri, hopes an eight-hour operation to separate the left and right sides of his brain - essentially rendering one side defunct - can put an end to the daily seizures. Battle: Caleb Miller made headlines when he received a heart transplant at just four months old in July 2013 . Caleb's mother Desire Miller wrote on Facebook: 'Please pray for health for our family this week. 'We've been laying low and only getting out when necessary since we found our Caleb was having surgery. 'We're entering the final week of lockdown and I'm finding my nerves are on edge when it comes to germs. 'As much as we're dreading surgery, Caleb's seizures appear to be getting worse instead of better and we're praying there won't be any delays in getting him to the OR.' To tackle his epilepsy, Caleb will be having a functional hemispherotomy. The eight-hour procedure removes all connections between the left and right brain. It means seizures cannot spread to the other hemisphere. Horrific ordeal: While Caleb was on the waiting list, he suffered a stroke that obliterated the key functions of the left side of his brain, leaving him with epilepsy. He now has daily seizures which are getting worse . Operation: To tackle his epilepsy, Caleb will be having a functional hemispherotomy, an eight-hour procedure . Rare condition: Caleb has been in and out of the hospital on an almost weekly basis his entire life with CHD . The operation generally reduces seizures in patients by up to 75 per cent. 'One in 100 kids are born with some sort of congenital heart defect. There's over 40 defects and some have a combination, in Caleb's case he had multiple defects,' Miller told OzarksFirst.com. 'He's going to have the left half of his brain disconnected from the right half because the left half is what is triggering the seizures,' Miller said. 'They are giving us a 70 to 80 percent chance that will completely take the seizures away.' Caleb has been in and out of the hospital on an almost weekly basis his entire life. Hopes: His mother Desire Miller, of Springfield, Missouri, hopes the operation will reduce his seizures . A congenital heart defect (CHD) occurs in babies blood vessels do not fully develop around the heart before they are born. It is not known what causes CHD but genetics and the mother's diet are believed to be significant factors. Many affected children never need treatment, and many are not diagnosed until they are older. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that one in four children with CHD have a chronic form that requires surgery within months of their birth. 'In a smooth course there are tons of kids you would never know are born with any sort of heart defect,' Miller told the station. 'Two and a half years ago before Caleb was diagnosed, I had no idea what the letters 'CHD' stood for,' she said, 'It is a serious epidemic that we have, but it's extremely underfunded and not well known.'","One-year-old Caleb Miller was born with congenital heart defect .

"Dave Dowdeswell developed diabetes due to stress . The popular image of a patient with type 2 diabetes is someone who's overweight, with a couch-potato lifestyle. It's a stereotype that makes salesman Dave Dowdeswell furious. The father-of-two, now 48, developed the condition at the age of 44 when he had a 32 in waist and weighed only 12 st - almost ideal for his 5 ft 9 in height. As a keen windsurfer and diver who also walked his dog every day, he was physically fit. There was no family history of type 2 diabetes, and he doesn't even have a sweet tooth. In fact, Dave ticked none of the normal risk-factor boxes, such as being overweight or having a waist of 37 in or more. So how did he become one of almost three million people in the UK with type 2? His doctors believe the trigger was stress. In the 12 months before he began to feel unwell, he had witnessed his 19-year-old daughter Gemma being knocked over by a car and breaking her neck after a family meal out; his thriving paint-spraying business had collapsed because of falling trade and teetered on the verge of bankruptcy, and his beloved bulldog died. Then, in November 2010, Dave unexpectedly lost his 70-year-old father to cirrhosis of the liver. 'That really hit me for six. He went into hospital and never came out,' says Dave, who lives in Portsmouth. 'He went downhill so quickly and I couldn't believe it when he died. We were close and it hit me so badly.' Within a week Dave started to feel ill himself. 'I was suddenly needing to get up two or three times a night to have a pee. 'I was also drinking around two pints of orange juice in one go, and I couldn't wait to finish a meal so I could have a drink of water or orange juice as I felt so thirsty. 'We were on a scuba-diving holiday in Egypt at the time, but my wife Adriana said: ""As soon as we get home, I think you should get yourself to the doctor."" ' He dutifully did and the doctor decided to test him for diabetes. A blood test revealed that his sugar level was sky-high - 28, when it should have been 7 at most. The doctor diagnosed type 2 diabetes. 'I couldn't understand why me,' says Dave. 'I asked the doctor ""what caused this?"" and he said ""it could be the stress"". I thought about my year and realised that must be it.' Stress is a known trigger for many conditions, from skin complaints such as psoriasis to irritable bowel syndrome. But increasingly studies suggest that it may also be linked to type 2 diabetes, no matter how healthy your lifestyle. He is now having Byetta injections that increase the amount of insulin his body produces . Research published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine last September found that those under extreme pressure at work were 45 per cent more likely to develop the condition than those under minimal pressure. The results were based on a 13-year study of 5,000 men and women. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin or becomes less sensitive to its effects. Insulin acts like a key to allow sugar into cells and if, for example, someone is overweight that key works less well. One theory is that the stress hormone cortisol may also alter the body's sensitivity to insulin. 'Stress leads to a rise in cortisol, a steroid hormone, and sometimes when you give individuals steroids (drugs that resemble cortisol) at a high dose, this impedes the action of insulin,' says Naveed Sattar, professor of medicine at the University of Glasgow. 'So when we do a risk score to see how likely someone is to develop type 2 diabetes, we do ask if they are on steroids, as this can increase their risk.' While Professor Sattar is not convinced that this means stress itself is a direct cause of diabetes, other experts believe it is. Professor Andrew Steptoe, a psychologist and epidemiologist from University College London, says his research shows that people with type 2 diabetes react to stress differently - but whether this is what caused their diabetes or is a result of it, is not clear. In a study of 420 adults, his team found that those with type 2 took longer to recover from a stressful event - their blood pressure and heart rate took longer to return to normal than those without diabetes. The results were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 'Everyone responds to stress with an increase in pulse rate, blood pressure and release of stress hormones,' says Professor Steptoe. But there was a difference in the length of this response between the healthy participants and those with type 2 - 'Ninety minutes after a stress experience they still hadn't returned to normal levels, unlike the healthy participants'. Furthermore, Professor Steptoe found that the type 2 diabetics had higher levels of cortisol. 'It might be that they are more exposed to stress, or that they are in a state of high-level activation of the stress response.' Dave, with wife Adriana, has also ensured his lifestyle is as straightforward and stress-free as possible . Next he plans to follow up healthy people in the study who also showed a prolonged response to stress, to see if they develop type 2. Professor Steptoe says further research is needed, but adds that we may need to rethink the risk factors for type 2 diabetes and include stress among them. People with type 2 seem to think there is a strong correlation between stress and the onset of their condition. A survey of more than 500 patients for the online forum diabetes.co.uk found that 78 per cent believed their condition was brought on by, for example, stress in the workplace, long hours, the breakdown of a marriage or a family bereavement. Often, adopting a healthy lifestyle is the first course of action for those newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, to help get their blood sugar back into normal range. But for Dave, who had no need to lose weight or get fitter, controlling his diabetes was initially harder. 'It took a year to stabilise my blood sugar levels,' he says. 'They put me on metformin and other drugs but my blood sugar only went down a bit, so now I also have Byetta injections that increase the amount of insulin my body produces - I inject it once in the morning and once at night, and that's got my blood sugar down.' He has also ensured that his lifestyle is as straightforward and stress-free as possible. 'I am enjoying life - thankfully my daughter recovered - and trying to avoid stress where I can. I have given up my business and sell log cabins in a garden centre now - it's not a stressful job and suits me very well. 'But what really annoys me is that people think you can only get type 2 if you are really unhealthy and have a huge beer belly. They insinuate that it's somehow my fault and that I need to get off the sofa and stop eating so many doughnuts. 'If I can get type 2, anyone can.' Other conditions linked to stress . Heart disease . Studies have suggested that stress can increase the chance of heart disease and of having a heart attack, and scientists are just starting to understand why. Last year a study by Harvard Medical School that assessed 29 doctors after a busy week in intensive care found their white blood cells count was high. Other studies have suggested that white blood cells can rupture fatty deposits in the artery walls, which can lead to a heart attack. Colds . Cold symptoms are caused by the immune system's inflammatory response to the cold virus. The stress hormone cortisol temporarily dampens down this response so your cold symptoms aren't so obvious. However, if you're chronically stressed you become less sensitive to cortisol, so the inflammatory response increases and you end up with a full-on cold, according to 2012 research reported in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Stress is a known trigger for skin complaints, gut disorders and colds . Gut disorders . Stress can alter the rate at which food and waste travel through the system, and change gut secretions. It can make the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome or indigestion worse. GORD - gastro-intestinal reflux, when stomach contents rise back up the gullet - can also be triggered by stress. Skin complaints . Stress is a known trigger for skin complaints such as psoriasis, eczema and acne, as it encourages inflammation which makes these conditions worse.","Salesman Dave Dowdeswell, 48, from Portsmouth, has type 2 diabetes .

"He used his time in Jordan to speak out about the plight of Christians and meet refugees fleeing the war in Syria. Today, however, saw Prince Charles see a very different side of the Middle East as he flew into Kuwait to be met by pair of adorable flower girls. Charles, who is on a six-day tour to the Gulf states,  was all smiles as they handed him a posy at the private Amiri Terminal alongside the Gulf state's Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf. Scroll down for video . Welcome to Kuwait! Prince Charles is met by a pair of young girls clutching bouquets of flowers at the airport . Fleet: Outside the Amiri Terminal was a fleet of around 40 identical maroon Mercedes Benz cars . Charles was introduced to dozens of dignitaries in an official line-up, before standing for the British national anthem  and a brief inspection of a military guard. The heir to the throne was then whisked out of the airport and into one of around 40 gleaming maroon Mercedes Benz cars waiting for him outside. With the Crown Prince, he then travelled on for a meeting with Kuwait's ruler, His Highness The Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Sabah Al Ahmed Al Jabber Al Sabah, at the Bayan Palace. The Emir, who last met Charles during a state visit to the UK in 2012, appeared to be quite a fan of the Queen and solicitously asked about her health through his official interpreter. 'She is in remarkable form,' replied Charles, adding: 'My father will turn 94 and he has very good eyesight. He is still out shooting.' His remark prompted approving laughter from the Emir, who looked even more delighted when Charles told him: 'They remember with great affection your visit in 2012 to the UK'. Not so fast: Before he was driven away, he was introduced to local dignitaries at the airport . Greeting: He was met by Kuwaiti Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf at the private VIP terminal at the airport . Inspection: An honour guard of troops in red uniform were lined up in the arrivals hall to meet him . The Emir replied, with obvious pride: 'I will not forget the remarkable happiness and generosity of Her Majesty. I was living next door to her, I was her neighbour.' By that point, Charles may have been forgiven for thinking the formalities were over but in accordance with Arab tradition, he was then ushered into a lavish lunch attended by 150 dignitaries, each of which he was required to greet and shake hands with. Inside the dining room, the future king, a notoriously light eater who prefers to skip lunch, was offered dish after dish of fish and lobster delicacies. Later, the prince attended a sunset ceremony, dressed in his tropical whites bearing his rank of Admiral of the Fleet, on British destroyer, HMS Dauntless, which is currently on operation in the Gulf. The ship, commissioned in 2010, has been working with the US fleet in the region, as well as undertaking counter piracy and anti smuggling operations. Impressed: Charles and his Kuwaiti counterpart inspected the troops before driving off in the convoy . Meeting: Charles met the Emir of Kuwait who asked him about the health of his mother, the Queen . Charles watched as the ship's flag was symbolically lowered at the end of the day and inspected some of its 200-strong company. The prince, who was himself in the Royal Navy for five years and rose to command a minesweeper, enthusiastically took a tour of the £1 billion vessel, described as the most advanced ship Britain has ever built. Lieutenant Commander Mike Klidjian, second in command, said: 'The prince made a point of chatting to as many of the staff as possible, remembering the banter - which hasn't changed in 30 years- and wanting to know about what it was like to work on such a world class destroyer. 'It was a huge honour to welcome him.' Charles will stay overnight in Kuwait, a country he has visited on six previous occasions, before travelling onto the Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The prince is undertaking the tour at the request of the British Government, just a year after he last visited the region. Sources said it is a sign of how important Arabia is to the UK and of how significant Charles's role is in fostering good relations. Saying goodbye: Charles' arrival in Kuwait came after he made a ceremonial departure from Jordan . Royal wave: Charles waved goodbye to his Jordanian hosts from the doorway of the jet . Honour guard: As Charles departed, so did his Jordanian honour guard . Warm words: Charles met with Jordan's King Abdullah during his trip to the Middle Eastern country . She's back! The Queen returns to London after quietly marking 63 years on the throne at Sandringham . The Queen returned to London today, after spending Christmas and all of January at her Norfolk home, Sandringham. Resplendent in a lilac wool coat and, unusually, without one of her trademark hats, she was seen marching along the platform at King's Lynn station as she prepared to catch a train to the capital. With her was her team of close protection officers and a lady in waiting, all of whom followed her onto the train. On her way: The Queen prepares to board a train at King's Lynn as she returns to London . The Queen traditionally spends Christmas at Sandringham and usually marks the anniversary of her accession to the throne at the Norfolk property. It was also at Sandringham that her father, George VI, died on the 6th February 1952. The Queen herself was in Kenya at the time. The Queen, who also arrived at Sandringham by train, has spent much of her annual visit relaxing with the Duke of Edinburgh, although she has also made several official visits. As well as attending a WI meeting, an annual tradition for the Queen, last Monday visited South Lynn Fire Station. Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, the 88-year-old monarch toured the engine bay and met local firemen before officially opening the new facility. More of the same awaits on her return to Buckingham Palace this afternoon, with both the Queen and Prince Philip scheduled to complete a busy run of engagements between now and June's visit to Germany. Elegant: The Queen, who last week celebrated her 63rd year on the throne, was resplendent in lilac . Staying safe: The train was cleaned before the Queen arrived, overseen by police officers . Protection: The train and the platform were also checked for explosives ahead of the Queen's arrival .","Prince Charles has arrived in Kuwait and has met with the Emir .

"Mullah Abdul Rauf, 33, was killed by a NATO drone . A former Guantánamo Bay detainee who recently pledged allegiance to ISIS has been killed in Afghanistan. Mullah Abdul Rauf, 33, was killed by a NATO drone strike along with his son-in-law and six others as they drove through Kajaki district in the volatile southern province of Helmand, Afghan officials said. Rauf, an ex-Taliban commander, declared allegiance to Isis in January, and claimed to be recruiting fighters on behalf of the group which holds large swaths of Syria and Iraq. He was branded by the Washington Post last month as 'the shadowy figure recruiting for the Islamic State in Afghanistan.' A Pakistani militant commander said Rauf had been an important liaison between various factions which have broken away from the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban movements in recent months. His defection had caused deadly infighting and raised fears the movement was gaining footholds in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A statement from Resolute Support, the new name for the NATO mission in Afghanistan, said 'coalition forces conducted a precision strike in Helmand province today, resulting in the death of eight individuals threatening the force'. Mohammad Jan Rasulyar, the deputy governor of Helmand, said the strike hit the militants' vehicle at around 10am. Mullah Abdul Rauf, 33, was killed by a NATO drone strike along with his son-in-law and six others as they drove through Kajaki district in the volatile southern province of Helmand . Rauf was detained by the US in 2001 and spent six years in Guantánamo Bay, in Cuba (pictured) Rauf, also known as Abdul Rauf Aliza, had a long history of insurgency. He was detained by the US in 2001 and spent six years in Guantánamo, where he claimed he was nothing more than a bread delivery man for the Taliban. According to a document released by WikiLeaks, American interrogators suspected at the time Rauf had more influence than he claimed. But he was released to Afghanistan for further detention in 2007. In Kabul, he managed to escape from house arrest and in 2011 acted as the Taliban's shadow governor in Uruzgan province . Rauf then formed a splinter group of fighters after falling out with the leader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, and recently clashed with a Taliban unit in Helmand's Sangin district. Locals say Rauf's men, numbering around 300, were often in conflict with Taliban officials in Helmand. There have been fears of ISIS making inroads in Afghanistan since US-led NATO forces ended their combat mission in late December, after 13 years of fighting.","Mullah Abdul Rauf, 33, killed by NATO drone strike along with son-in-law .

"The retired Marine Corps general at the forefront of the U.S.-led coalition in the fight against ISIS told ABC News in an exclusive interview that the terror group 'is at an entirely different level than al Qaeda was.' ISIS is 'better organized than al Qaeda. It's command and control is better,' John Allen, the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, told ABC. When asked whether ISIS is a threat to the home front, Allen said 'we should take it very seriously.' On track: Retired Gen. John Allen, the White House special envoy on the Islamic State, told ABC's 'This Week' that the United States has accomplished its goal of devising a 'comprehensive plan' and striking a 'hard blow' Danger: Allen said the risk that ISIS is a threat to the United States is one that 'we should take very seriously' After ISIS appeared to burn Jordanian pilot Lt. Muath al-Kasasbeh alive in a new video, Allen said the country was helping the U.S. against ISIS more than ever. Coalition forces are going up against what General Allen believes is a more formidable enemy than even al Qaeda. Allen says that ISIS has adapted in a way that they are harder to find. 'You don't see the long convoys now with flags flying in broad daylight. But we have also adapted our targeting process, as well.' Allen said the video released last week showing the Islamic State burning a Jordanian pilot alive 'absolutely' backfired on the group, as Jordan's King Abdullah II has vowed to fight back. 'It's galvanized the coalition, united the coalition,' Allen said. General Allen acknowledges this is a generational fight but that despite setbacks, ISIS as an enemy is not going away. Positive thinking: Retired Marine Corps Gen. John Allen said burning a Jordanian pilot to death was a grave miscalculation by ISIS . Arab support: After ISIS appeared to burn Jordanian pilot Lt. Muath al-Kasasbeh alive in a new video, Allen said the Jordan was helping the U.S. against ISIS more than ever . Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, delivered a grim assessment of the group's evolution in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee. He described how the group was surfacing in North Africa. 'With affiliates in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, the group is beginning to assemble a growing international footprint that includes ungoverned and under governed areas,' Stewart testified. Defense secretary nominee Ashton Carter, who had his confirmation hearing Wednesday, also told Congress this past week he is aware of reports that ISIS may try to expand into Afghanistan. Allen got some support for his argument from Jordanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Nasser Judeh. Judeh told ABC later in the show that ISIS is 'on the run,' but that certain victory 'will not be quick.' 'They are not gone yet,' he said. 'The air campaign has degraded their capabilities on the ground. They still control territories. They still have access to Syria's cash and funds and sophisticated weaponry… . But there is no doubt we shall prevail.' Allen and Judeh's positive analysis was preceded Sunday by Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former director of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, who says the United States' overarching strategy for combating Islamic extremist groups is not working. 'The counterterrorism component works just fine to go after the high-value targets and key leaders,' he told 'Fox News Sunday.' 'But we need a much broader strategy that recognizes that we're facing not just this tactical problem of ISIS in Iraq and Syria. … I think what I'm saying is the strategy that we have is not working, and it's clearly not working.' He estimated the size of the enemy has doubled in the past 10 years and pointed to such hotspots as middle-central Asia, northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.","Allen insists the U.S. strategy to defeat the Islamic State is working .

"A mahogany boat believed to be part of a very limited series went down in the Sacramento River over the weekend. Owner Alan Helmer told Fox40 that his sunken ship is  a Hunter boat from 1954. 'There’s only two left in the world, and now there's - if this goes down, there’s only going to be one left in the world,' he said in an interview with the television station. Scroll down for video . Wrecked: Alan Helmer's boat - which he says is a Hunter boat from 1954 - is seen in the Sacramento River . Limited edition: In total, 13 1954 Hunter boats were produced . Helmer's boat sank off of Sacramento, California on Sunday. 'She was gorgeous when I got her,' Helmer recalled. According to Helmer, thirteen 1954 Hunter boats were produced in total, but now only his and one other survive. Rainfall that day led to the bilge pump being overwhelmed and also deluged the deck, Helmer told Fox40. Before the rain, the boat was using the bilge pump to stay on the water since it already had a small opening, he added. The television station reported that one of Helmer's friends helped him fasten the boat with a skidoo and rope so it wouldn't move. Sacramento resident James Jordan told Fox40 that the Sacramento River's water went up by approximately 15 feet from the storm. 'You know my buddy is a rice farmer, so this is definitely going to help them out,' he said. Rescue: Alan Helmer and a friend are seen on the skidoo in the Sacramento River. Helmer (right) has said of his vessel 'She was gorgeous when I got her' Beloved: Alan Helmer has claimed that marinas have turned his boat away from parking there . Jordan told Fox40 of the boat, 'We called 911 made sure there wasn't nobody on there, then we realized what boat it was.' Jordan also said that '[Helmer] parked it here for about a month, and we came out here and asked him is there anyway you can move it, we can’t even cast on our own dock. 'It’s irresponsible of him to leave it unattended.' 'They just don't want you there,' Helmer told Fox40. 'A lot of marinas are just saying no wooden boats. Well that's our heritage. Our heritage - we're losing our heritage.' 'I don't know, this is a time when I don't want the rain,' Helmer also stated. Helmer said he will likely get the boat out Monday with the help of scuba gear and a lift bag.","A mahogany boat believed by its owner to be part of a very limited series went down in the Sacramento River over the weekend .

"A woman who became known as 'Granny Canute' after moving into a cliff-edge caravan when her house fell into the sea has been given six months to evacuate the site. Bryony Nierop-Reading has been ordered by to vacate the mobile home she moved into when cliff erosion destroyed her three-bedroom bungalow in Happisburgh, Norfolk, in December 2013. Planning bosses at North Norfolk County Council say the caravan, which has sat in the 69-year-old's garden for 13 years, is not fit for residential purpose. After turning down a compensation offer for the land in 2009, the grandmother-of-seven may be left homeless if evicted on August 25, as threatened. Scroll down for video . Bryony Nierop-Reading has been told she must leave the caravan (above) she moved into when her home on the Norfolk coast was destroyed by erosion in 2013. The pensioner keeps the mobile home in her garden . While neighbours all accepted the £13,000 sum, Mrs Nierop-Reading couldn't bring herself to leave the house which she bought in 2008 after falling in love with its views of the North Sea. Having watched the bungalow being torn down, the pensioner says she is being  now being treated unkindly. 'I’m shocked and very angry. I can’t believe they are acting so harshly towards me,' Mrs Nierop-Reading said. 'The council is being totally unfair and unreasonable. I cannot understand why I can’t stay here until the end of next year,” she insisted. Mrs Nierop-Reading added she had hoped to remain on the land for two years. 'I hope that by then I’ll have enough money to buy a home somewhere else in the village.' Despite being offered compensation to leave the land in 2009, she claimed not enough help was offered by local authorities to residents whose homes are under threat from the environment. The 69-year-old's three-bedroom bungalow was torn down by the council after part of the property was destroyed by a huge wave in December 2013 . A huge wave pulled the foundations from beneath part of the house, leaving Mrs Nierop-Reading's bathroom and parts of her bedroom hanging over the cliff . Mrs Nierop-Reading turned down the council's offer of compensation to leave the land in 2009, instead remaining hopeful she could spend more time in the house she fell in love with for its sea views . 'The planning regulations were not framed to make allowance for people like me who lose their houses to the sea. 'But it is going to happen more and more in the future so they need to start making the planning regulations more flexible and able to take account of environmental evacuees.' Council leader Tom FitzPatrick said he had 'every sympathy' with people like Mrs Nierop-Reading who had been seriously affected by devastating erosion and dramatic storm damage. In 1996, the property was some considerable distance from the cliff-edge . But having refused to sell her bungalow to the council when approached, it would be, he said, 'not fair or consistent' to make special allowances for her case. Mrs Nierop-Reading said she will appeal the eviction notice, adding: 'I’m still convinced that it would have been immoral to have accepted a home from the council when I already had one and others were in greater need than me.' In 2008, Mrs Nierop-Reading bought the property for £25,000 while it was 20ft from the water's edge. A year later she was approached by council officials warning the house and those surrounding it would be swallowed by the sea. Her neighbours took their offer of £13,000 in compensation, but Mrs Nierop-Reading remained on the site. In 2012 she claims the erosion process was quickened by the council's removing of wooden revetment sea defences. The following year, a huge wave destroyed the ground beneath the bungalow's foundations, leaving her bathroom, pantry and part of her bedroom hanging over the cliff. Mrs Nierop-Reading, who is lives alone, was able to remove some of her possessions before the council tore down the rest of the house. Her battle against the raging sea led to her being dubbed Granny Canute after the 11th century king who claimed he had the power to hold back the sea. North Norfolk County Council did not comment on the issue this morning. In the years since she bought it for £25,000, the property was under threat from the receding cliff-edge .","Brony Nierop-Reading has been given six months to leave her caravan .

"A criminal who was arrested as a man after committing a sexual assault 10 years ago has now been convicted as a woman. Harold Seymore, 31, is intersex, meaning she was born with functioning male and female reproductive organs, but she was brought up male and kept her condition largely hidden. But last week, after revealing in custody that she wanted to start living as a woman, Seymore appeared in court in Miami-Dade, Florida wearing a dress she had borrowed from her public defender, the Miami Herald reported. She was found guilty of sexually assaulting a schoolteacher as the woman walked alone on a beach after leaving a nightclub in South Beach in October 2005. Locked up: Harold Seymore, pictured with public defender Stacy Marczak at a sentencing hearing last week, has been convicted as a woman - nearly 10 years after she was arrested for sexual battery as a man . She will now be transferred to the state prison system, and could be housed away from the general population with other at-risk inmates needing 'protective management', the Herald reported. In court, her victim testified that she had walked past Seymore on the beach and, feeling uneasy, said: 'Don't follow me.' Seymore then started punching her from behind and sexually assaulted her as she screamed for help, she told the court. Two passersby chased Seymore, who was caught by police moments later. The woman also had Seymore's DNA beneath her fingernails. Prosecutors said that while Seymore had had a difficult life as she struggled with her gender identity and mental illness, it was 'no excuse' for the attack and the pain that she had inflicted on her victim. In court, Seymore's defense team hoped to prove that she had only punched the woman and had not sexually assaulted her - but the jury didn't buy it. She was convicted of sexual battery with no great harm, battery and petty theft, and on Friday Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler sentenced her to 15 years and 10 years probation. 'Based on everything I've heard, I do believe you're a danger and you will continue to be a danger to society,' Pooler said. Struggle: Seymore, center with Marczak and public defender Matthew McElligott, was born with female and male reproductive organs and identifies as a woman. She will be kept away from the general prison population . Seymore apologized to the victim as she was sentenced. 'It wasn't my intention for this to happen,' she said. 'I honestly apologize for what happened.' Seymore, who has a lengthy criminal history, has always been housed in single-person safety cells in Miami-Dade jails so that she is kept away from the male population. This has meant that she has largely served time in isolation. 'Twenty-three hours a day in solitary,' she told the Miami Herald in an interview. 'I got the yard by myself. I have to take showers by myself.' She will now be transferred to the state prison system and will be screened for  risk of sexual victimization or sexual abusiveness twice a year, as is law. Speaking to the Herald, she called herself a 'hermaphrodite', although that word is considered outdated by LGBT advocates, who prefer the term 'intersex'. She that she grew up hiding her female sexual organs and her dreams of having children one day, explaining: 'It was safer to identify as a male.' She was first arrested at age 14 for carrying a concealed weapon to school, and later arrests included battery, petty theft, disorderly conduct and cocaine possession. Arrests: Since the age of 14, Seymore (left in 2004 and right in 2014) has been arrested multiple times and was arrested in 2005 for sexual battery. The trial was delayed due to numerous stints in psychiatric facilities . She was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was repeatedly hospitalized for psychiatric treatment between 2001 and 2006, according to the report. After her 2005 sexual battery arrest, she struggled with mental illness and was declared mentally incompetent four times by a judge and sent to state psychiatric facilities. During those stays, she revealed that she wanted to begin living as a woman and started receiving hormone pills. She said that she hopes to give herself a new name - Sofia. She told the Herald that wearing a Theory dress borrowed from her public defender Stacy Marczak to court for the trial signaled the start of her new life. 'It meant I finally committed,' she said.","Harold Seymore was convicted of sexual battery last week for attacking a woman on a Florida beach in 2005 and sentenced to 15 years behind bars .
