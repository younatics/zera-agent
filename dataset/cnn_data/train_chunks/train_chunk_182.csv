"(CNN) -- It is the life blood for tens of millions of people -- but the mighty Mekong River in southeast Asia is now facing a ""devastating"" threat from not one, but 11 proposed dams. Irrawaddy dolphins as seen in Cambodia's Mekong River in November 2007 . A group of NGOs has come together to issue the stark warning, claiming if the plans go ahead for hydroelectric projects in Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, that people, animals and the environment will all suffer irreparably. Under the banner ""Save the Mekong"" campaigners are hoping to pressure regional governments to shelve the plans, which are being put forward by private companies from Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Russia. Carl Middleton, from the environmental group International Rivers, told CNN: ""These dams, if built, would block the major fish migrations that feed the entire region"" adding ""the Mekong fisheries feed the Mekong people they provide between half and four fifths of the animal protein that people eat here and up to 90 percent of rural communities are involved in fishing activity."" ""Globally the Mekong River basin is the largest inshore fishery in the world. It contributes about 2 percent of the global fish catch."" The Mekong is almost 5,000 kilometers long stretching from the Tibetan plateau, through southern China, and then along the border of Myanmar, Laos Thailand, through Cambodia to Vietnam. ""Even one dam across of the river would be devastating because what we are talking about is 70 percent of the commercial fish catch migrates over long distances. So therefore if you build a project on the lower part of the river it doesn't matter if you build 11 or one because if you can't get past the first dam then it can't get past the second either."" The campaign launch coincides with a warning from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) which says that the endangered Irrawady dolphin, also found on a stretch of the Mekong, is at risk of extinction from pollution. The small freshwater dolphins, distinguished by their round heads and short dorsal fins, are already listed as a threatened species, the WWF said in a report. But analysis of recent dolphin deaths shows their immune systems are suffering because of contaminants in the river, which flows through Cambodia and into southern Laos. ""These pollutants are widely distributed in the environment and so the source of this pollution may involve several countries through which the Mekong River flows,"" said Verne Dove, a veterinarian with WWF Cambodia who authored the report. ""WWF Cambodia is currently investigating the source of the environmental contaminants."" The Mekong River Irrawaddy dolphin population inhabits a 190-kilometer (118-mile) stretch of the Mekong River between Cambodia and Laos, the WWF said. Since 2003, the population has suffered 88 deaths, more than 60 percent of which were calves less than 2 weeks old, the WWF said. Only an estimated 64 to 76 dolphins are in the river, the group said. The Mekong is also home to 1,200 fish species -- approximately 50 of which are caught commercially. Scientists say the river has the second highest concentration of aquatic animals in the world, after the Amazon. But governments in the region are desperate for sources of cheap, reliable power and the Mekong is attractive as a greener alternative to coal fired power stations. In 1995 Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia formed the Mekong River Commission, an intergovernmental body tasked with overseeing ""sustainable"" development along the river. China and Myanmar (formerly Burma) are ""dialogue partners"" but that hasn't stopped China already building three dams in its section of the Mekong -- a further two are also under construction. The proposed 11 new dams are China, Laos/Thai border and Cambodia and would for the first time interrupt the flow of the lower Mekong, according to campaigners. One of the eleven projects at Don Sahong in northern Cambodia could be complete perhaps as early as 2013, according to Carl Middleton, with others following after that. The ""Save the Mekong"" group has handed a petition of 16,380 signatures to the Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva calling on him and other regional leaders to act to save ""this critical source of food and income for millions of us.""","Mekong River in southeast Asia faces ""devastating"" threat from 11 proposed dams .

"FAIRHOPE/MOBILE, Ala. (CNN) -- One moment, Garrett Gilkey was standing on his big stage. The next moment, he was being plowed under it. There was a small crater in the turf where the 314-pound Gilkey tried to dig in his cleats and stop the charge of John Jenkins, a 359-pound defensive tackle from the University of Georgia. Gilkey is an offensive lineman from Chadron State, an outpost in northwest Nebraska, and NFL scouts were gathered around to see if the player from a small Division II school could block a player from a Goliath of college football, a school from the mighty Southeastern Conference. Jenkins thrust his powerful claws straight into Gilkey's chest and it was an instant mismatch. Big beat little, for the moment. It was a one-on-one drill at a practice for the Senior Bowl, a college football all-star game, which is the next step in the 2013 NFL draft process. Gilkey was shoved back by Jenkins and left standing on a white towel, which was the imaginary quarterback Gilkey was supposed to protect. This would have been a sack in a real game, the quarterback in a heap at the feet of Jenkins, and Gilkey humiliated. Gilkey, a small-college nobody, did not pick up that white towel and start waving it as a flag of surrender. He wasn't going to be defined by one stinking play. The next snap in the one-on-one drill with Jenkins, Gilkey quick-setted Jenkins, which means he hit him first. If the big guy from Georgia was going to bull rush Gilkey in a drill with a helmet and no pads where coaches want to see players work with their hands, not power, Gilkey would counter with his own shifty move. He didn't take a step back to pass protect, he attacked Jenkins with a block. ""Punched him right in the face mask,"" said Gilkey, whose long blond hair flowed out of the back of his helmet. Then he smiled. ""I'm small school, he's big school. There might have been a few moments of awe because of the stage we're on here, being here in front of a lot of scouts, but after that first hit, it's just football. You have to show something here, some competitiveness. You don't let people intimidate you because you are from a small school."" Jenkins was with Gilkey on every point. ""I encourage him and others to come on, let's go, if they feel they have to make a name for themselves against me,"" Jenkins said. ""I know he's on the big stage, but I've got to eat same as he's got to eat."" It was like that all week here at the Senior Bowl workouts. There are 700 NFL personnel studying 106 college players up close in advance of the April 25-27 draft. It is not only North vs. South in the game, but it is big school vs. small school, big name vs. no name. They will play the game at 4 p.m. ET on Saturday, but the skirmishes Monday through Friday at the practices are the real prize here for scouts and NFL draft wonks. Players like Georgia's Jenkins are on television throughout the fall. They have less of a task getting space on stage at a prestigious game like the Senior Bowl. Gilkey, who is 6-foot-5, 314 pounds, has to depend more on the keen eye of scouts. A tape of a Chadron State game was sent to Phil Savage, the Senior Bowl executive director, who is responsible for issuing invitations and making sure legitimate NFL prospects are in the game. Savage watched the tape and saw Gilkey keeping his feet during a driving snowstorm on a slick field and still protecting the quarterback. Brandon Williams, a 341-pound defensive tackle from Missouri Southern, sent a tape showing him walking on his hands displaying spectacular upper body strength. Savage invited Williams, too. It is a little gimmicky, but you do what you have to do. The Senior Bowl is a melting pot of talent. Eric Fisher, an offensive lineman from Central Michigan, is playing on the same team as Denard Robinson, the star quarterback from Michigan, who is here as a wide receiver/kick returner. Once here, small school can make plays over big school. Leon McFadden, a cornerback from San Diego State, dashed in front of the Georgia wide receiver Tavarres King to make a one-handed interception. ""When you make a play like that, you flush it, forget about it, and keep it rolling and show scouts you can do that play after play,"" McFadden said. ""Don't make one play out here and think it's enough."" McFadden thought back to his interception and smiled wide. ""Anybody from anywhere can play this game,"" he said. He's right about that. Margus Hunt is from Estonia. He is 6-foot-8, 277 pounds and is the former junior world record holder in the discus. Hunt played college football at Southern Methodist and is turning heads here with ""freakish"" athletic ability. Ezekiel Ansah is a 6-foot-5, 274-pound defensive end from Brigham Young, by way of Ghana. He played college football just 2Â½ seasons and is projected as a high-round pick in the draft. There are two scouting services for NFL teams, Blesto and National Football Scouting, who scour the outposts, those small schools, and file reports for 28 NFL teams (four teams do not subscribe to the services). NFL teams have their own scouts who endure plenty of windshield time driving to small schools spread around the country to get a peek at a player. When word of a 314-pound lineman with quick feet spread, NFL teams flocked to Chadron, Nebraska, to see Gilkey. Savage said NFL scouts will try to stay mum on a prospect from a small school to keep teams off the scent. ""I sent a questionnaire out with Gilkey's name on it, along with some other names, and asked whether these players should be invited and all the scouts said yes, yes, yes to the others and no to Gilkey,"" said Savage, a former scout and general manager. ""I knew something was up when they all said no. They were trying to sit on him. I got some tape, looked at him, and invited him."" There are some things that have nothing to do with skill that NFL scouts look for in a prospect, be they from big schools or little schools. ""I like to see if they get along,"" said Ted Thompson, the general manager of the Green Bay Packers. ""It's an indication that they like to play the game. Most of the good ones like the whole process, the time in the locker room, and the practices. ""This game is a lot more than playing Saturdays and Sundays. You look at a guy and you say 'Is he a good, old-fashioned country ballplayer, or not?' "" If Savage did his work in selecting these teams -- and most scouts think he did with the help of all his NFL contacts -- 90 to 95 of the 106 players at the Senior Bowl will be drafted in the seven rounds. The other 10 to 16 players will be part of ""college free agency."" They can sign with any team as ""undrafted free agents."" Teams have approximately $75,000 in bonus money to use to invite undrafted players to their preseason camps. As Garrett Gilkey and others will prove, the NFL welcome mat is wide and wide open. The small-school player can walk through the same door as the big-school player.","The Senior Bowl, a college football game, is a major step in the 2013 NFL draft process .

"(CNN) -- Despite their public handshake on Monday it appears there is still some way to go before Tiger Woods and Sergio Garcia bury the hatchet. A long-running spat between the two golfers resurfaced after they shared a contentious round together at The Players' Championship in May. After several verbal volleys in either direction, Garcia's joke that he would invite Woods round for ""fried chicken"" during the U.S Open led to an immediate and unreserved apology from the Spaniard, who denied it was racially motivated. A statement from the world No. 1 on social networking site Twitter called the remarks ""wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate."" Woods also said that he was sure there was ""real regret"" on the part of Garcia and that it was time to move on. Inevitably, the issue resurfaced as both players prepared to come face-to-face ahead of the second major of the year at Merion in Philadelphia. The pair greeted each other on the practice range but the world No. 1 told a press conference on Tuesday there had been no time for a formal apology. Asked if they had discussed Garcia's comments Woods replied: ""No, we didn't discuss anything. Just came up and said 'hi' and that was it."" Woods was pressed by reporters as to whether the Spaniard had offered him any form of apology but he said: ""No, we haven't had time for that. ""It's already done. We've already gone through it all. It's time for the U.S. Open and we tee it up in two days."" Garcia told a press conference he had hoped to meet Woods after their practice rounds on Monday but that the 14-time major winner had gone by the time he had finished. ""Obviously we saw each other yesterday on the range,"" Garcia said. ""I was hoping to meet him after the round, but he was gone after the round. ""And this morning I was here early. I didn't see him around. Obviously he got here later on. But I did leave him a note. A handwritten note. And hopefully he can take a look at it. ""I understand that it's difficult to meet up and stuff. So hopefully we'll be able to do it. If not, at least he has read the note and he's happy with that."" The duo have been at loggerheads since an acrimonious round during the penultimate day of The Players' Championship in May. Garcia claimed he had been disrupted during one of his shots after the gallery following Woods cheered as the 37-year-old pulled a club out of his bag that signaled his intention to go for the green despite being in the rough. The Spaniard sliced his shot and made a bogey that saw him relinquish the one-shot lead he held at the time. Woods went on to win the tournament with late errors seeing his rival slip down the leaderboard. Their row rumbled on for a few more weeks until Garcia was asked at a European Tour event whether he would be inviting Woods round for dinner during the U.S. Open. Garcia replied: ""We'll be having him round every night... and serving him fried chicken."" Fried chicken is a common food in the American South, but when used in references to African-Americans, it often implies a negative stereotype. Garcia apologized and later said in an interview with Sky Sports: ""Obviously it was an unfortunate comment from me. I didn't mean it in a bad way. Everyone knows I'm not racist at all."" It remains to be seen what reception Garcia is afforded when bumper crowds hit Merion for the start of the tournament on Thursday. Former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie, who has been targeted several times by American spectators, said Garcia could face a rough ride from the galleries. He was quoted by The Scotsman newspaper as saying: ""Yes, he could do, which is very sad for our game. Remember we're only a couple of hours from New York and it's a lively crowd and I think he could well be booed. ""You would feel for him, but the trouble is [if] you feel for him that's you condoning it. So you can't feel sorry for him because you're condoning it. So it's very difficult -- it's a very difficult situation to be in."" Garcia has been paired with Stewart Cink and Padraig Harrington -- both major winners -- for his first two rounds, while Woods plays with 2011 U.S. Open winner Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott, this year's Masters champion. This week will mark five years since Woods last won a major -- his 14th -- at Torrey Pines in 2008. He has since gone 20 without victory.","Tiger Woods says there hasn't been time for a clear-the-air talk with Sergio Garcia .

"(Mashable) -- The fabled PlayStation Phone has finally surfaced, and it is definitely packing Google's Android OS. A few months ago, rumors surfaced about the existence of a PlayStation Phone, a hybrid mobile and gaming device with a 5-megapixel camera, 1 GHz Snapdragon processor, slide-out gaming pad and the Android Gingerbread OS. While those reports contained several details concerning the device, there wasn't much in terms of proof. Now Engadget has delivered strong evidence that the device exists. The technology blog has posted a series of crisp pictures of the device, and unless someone went to extreme lengths to create a false prototype, it looks legitimate to us. Engadget reports that the PlayStation Phone sports 512 MB of RAM, 1 GB of ROM and a 1GHz Qualcomm MSM8655 Snapdragon chip. It includes a multitouch touchpad, trigger buttons and microSD card support. The device is being built by Sony Ericsson. The Android-based gaming phone is still a prototype according to the report, so it's unlikely to arrive before the holidays; we'd bet on a Q1 or Q2 2011 release. We're itching to get our hands one of of these bad boys. We want to find out if the PlayStation Phone can make Android into a gaming powerhouse on par with the iPhone, or whether the device will go the way of the N-Gage. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- When I asked CNN's readers and viewers to pick the five social-justice topics I'll cover for the rest of the year, I never expected so many of you to select the one with the Econ 101 title: ""Widest rich-poor gap."" I figured most of the country, or the world, would be sick of reading about the recession and bankers and bailouts. As a person with a job, it would be easy for me to say that's a 2008 story. Time to move on. But that's why I trust the wisdom of the crowd: You tell me when I'm wrong. America's widening gap between the rich and poor -- and this country's fast-disappearing sense of security and progress and economic stability -- is so far the top pick among the 20 subjects I presented as part of a new project called Change the List. That tells me that for many of you, it is the most pressing justice issue of our time. I wouldn't have seen that on my own, and I'm glad you did. You encouraged me to look deeper into the issue, and I'm excited that we might be delving into this story together. The vote is part of a new CNN Opinion project that focuses on bringing attention to overlooked places and issues. I'm asking you to pick stories you find most compelling or important from a list of 20 -- and I'll report on the five winners. Voting closes at 2:00 p.m. ET on Monday, so there is still plenty of time for you to influence the outcome. Here are the top five issues as of noon on Wednesday: . 1. Rich-poor gap . 2. Where rape is common . 3. Poorest kids . 4. Conflict is never-ending . 5. America's most endangered river . About 23,000 ballots have been submitted so far, and only 916 votes separate the topics in fourth and seventh places, as of this writing. That's close. (While this story was being completed, ""illegal animal trade"" jumped into fifth place, for instance). When I noticed rich-poor gap was such a crowd favorite, I was a little disappointed, to be honest. How could I stop an economy story from being dull and gray? But last night I started doing some research and started to see what many of you had already noticed: that this is a broadly important and interesting topic -- an underreported story, despite the never-ending flood of financial news headlines. (Friends at sites like CNNMoney and NPR's Planet Money have been doing a stellar job of covering the crisis; but does anyone want to read another jobs-report story? And just forget about the Dow.) Beneath all the spreadsheets and wonkery, this seems to be a story about fairness and people. Is it one about rich folks who caused the recession and got off clean? About poor folks bearing the brunt of the recession? About a return to free market ideals? They're fascinating issues, and I'm undecided on them at this point. Last night, I watched the documentary ""Park Avenue,"" which focuses on the street in New York that's home to a building it says has more billionaires than any other -- and also a section of the Bronx with a high rate of infant mortality. The stats presented in the documentary are staggering: 1 in 7 Americans is on food stamps; a college degree is needed to compete, but the cost of college has soared since the 1980s; 400 of the richest people in the United States control as much wealth as the bottom 50% of Americans. I'm glad it's a topic you highlighted for me. CNN should continue to cover the war in Syria, whether or not you would vote for that. Same goes for this NSA madness. But with Change the List, I'm trusting you to choose. You deserve to have a say in what I cover -- and in what CNN covers. Not because this is a popularity contest, but because I firmly believe that stories are more meaningful for people when they're part of them. No one wants be on the wrong end of a bullhorn. I'm excited to explore these topics -- any of these topics -- together. That's journalism in the public interest. So please vote. Think about which stories are most important, which could have the most impact and which you're willing to be a part of. Encourage others to do the same. And if you've got a few extra Econ books sitting around, send 'em my way. Vote here: http://cnn.com/changethelist. The views expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Vote on the stories you find most important and John Sutter will cover them .

"(CNN) -- In a sporting world where the big boys invariably grab all the glory, there is one competition where the romantic notion of the underdog toppling the giant sometimes becomes reality. Not often, but regularly enough to keep seemingly hopeless dreams alive. The English FA Cup is soccer's oldest knockout competition, and while it is often won by the greatest teams in the Premier League it is also the source of some of the greatest upset results. ""When you are a football club you dream of playing at Wembley, and today we saw the underdogs play with incredible bravery, incredible belief and they defied the odds again. That's the FA Cup,"" said Roberto Martinez after his Wigan Athletic team made their dream come true with a shock win against Manchester City on Saturday. It was a result that ranked with Wimbledon's 1988 victory over Liverpool and Southampton's 1976 upset of Manchester United. When Wigan lined up against City at Wembley, England's national stadium, there could not have been two more contrasting teams. City -- funded by the oil money of its Abu Dhabi oil owners, winner of the Premier League last season and the FA Cup the one before that -- up against a Wigan side in its first final, having been a top-flight club for less than a decade. Wigan's team cost Â£11 million ($17 million) in transfer fees -- City's squad had 11 players who had individually cost more than that. Even before Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan completed a reported $300 million takeover in 2008, City was already an established football name, even if its fortunes had faded since the 1960s and '70s. Neighboring Wigan, on the other hand, was a non-league club until 1978 and only started moving up the divisions when entrepreneur Dave Whelan bought it in 1995. Whelan was a former footballer who played in the FA Cup final for Blackburn in 1960, but badly broke his leg as his team lost, and never featured with a top team after that. He subsequently made his money with a chain of grocery stores and then got into the sportswear business. Now 76, he is an institution in the north-west town, having owned its rugby league team while also funding the football club's stadium -- which was first named after his business and is now known by his initials. A sometimes controversial figure -- a backer of the Conservative party, he was the only leading football figure to call for a minute's silence to honor the late former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- he has presided over a club that has battled to stay in the Premier League for the past few seasons. ""What an incredible story,"" Martinez said after an injury-time header from substitute Ben Watson earned a shock 1-0 victory over City, who had Pablo Zabaleta sent off for a second yellow card in the 85th minute. ""The chairman broke his leg in 1960 and today, finally, it's finished business for him."" Whelan was given special dispensation to lead out the team, as Wigan played its second major final -- having lost in the 2006 League Cup in Cardiff. But now, although Martinez's team is guaranteed European football next season, Wigan's chances of staying in the top division hang by a thread with just two matches to play. The Latics, as they are known, occupy the third and final relegation place and will have little time to celebrate the club's greatest day as Tuesday brings a trip to Champions League contenders Arsenal. ""We are going to get an incredible fight, incredible desire, to get the six points we've got left,"" Martinez said. ""But today is about today, today is about the FA Cup, today is about the victory and the trophy that we've won for Wigan Athletic. What an incredible story."" Martinez has been widely linked with a move to Everton following the imminent departure of David Moyes to replace Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, and was last year one of the candidates to take over at Liverpool before Brendan Rodgers got the job. He is highly rated by Whelan, who has stood by the 39-year-old despite a seemingly constant Houdini act in keeping the club in the EPL, but it remains to be seen whether City's owners will show the same patience with their manager Roberto Mancini. The Italian cut a forlorn figure at Wembley after the defeat left his side without a trophy this season, having been second best in the league as Manchester United won back the title. Ferguson's surprise announcement this week that he is retiring after more than 26 years in charge took much of the focus off the FA Cup final, but the buildup to the match came with widespread rumors that Mancini will be replaced by former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, who guided Malaga to the Champions League quarterfinals this season. Pellegrini revealed on Saturday that he and several players would be leaving the Spanish club at the end of this season due to its money problems, which have resulted in a ban from future European competition under UEFA's financial fair play rules. ""Everyone would prefer to stay but unfortunately, the circumstances we are in don't allow that,"" the Chilean said. Mancini helped City end a long wait for a trophy when he won the FA Cup in his first season in charge, but Saturday's defeat could be the end of the road for the 48-year-old after a difficult season in which he sold problematic striker Mario Balotelli -- who he had signed in 2010 from his former club Inter Milan -- and failed to make it past the group stage in the Champions League. ""This speculation is rubbish. If I said it's rubbish, it's rubbish ... speculation and rubbish,"" he angrily told UK match broadcaster ITV. Mancini said he was ""very sorry"" for the 40,000 City fans who traveled to London for the match, which was played in pouring rain. ""They scored in the last minute so for us it was difficult. But we didn't play very well -- I don't know why,"" he told ESPN. ""It was a difficult season because our target was to win the Premier League, and we didn't win it. But this can happen, it's impossible to win always. ""And after we had this chance to win another cup ... this moment is difficult."" Earlier Saturday, Frank Lampard became Chelsea's all-time leading scorer with both goals in a 2-1 victory over Aston Villa that all but ensured the London side will play in the Champions League next season. The 34-year-old England midfielder has yet to be offered a new contract by the club, but he gave owner Roman Abramovich food for thought as he passed Bobby Tambling's longstanding mark of 202. The win put third-placed Chelsea five points clear of Arsenal and six ahead of Tottenham, who both have a game in hand. Villa took the lead through Christian Benteke's 19th league goal this season but the Belgian was sent off after the halftime break. Chelsea had lost Ramires for a second booking before the break, but Lampard fired in a left-foot shot on the hour and finished from close range with nine minutes to play to take his tally to 15 this season in the EPL and 17 overall. However, defender John Terry and midfielder Eden Hazard were taken off with injuries and are battling to be fit for Wednesday's Europa League final against Benfica. Meanwhile, Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes announced on Saturday that he will be retiring for the second time. The 38-year-old quit in 2011 but was persuaded to return by Ferguson the following year. He has not played since January, but Ferguson confirmed that the former England international will make his 498th EPL appearance on Sunday at home to Swansea. ""He will collect an unbelievable but well-deserved 11th Premier League medal,"" Ferguson said ahead of his own final home match at Old Trafford.","Underdog Wigan beats big-spending Manchester City 1-0 in Saturday's FA Cup final .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- A top European Union official says there's no need for Britain to make threats to leave the union in order to reform its membership. ""In my mind it is only to the mutual benefit of Britain and Europe that Britain stays as a member of the European Union,"" EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told CNN's Richard Quest. British Prime Minister David Cameron sparked the debate in a speech Wednesday in which he promised the British people a vote on European Union membership if he wins the next general election in 2015. ""But as I was listening to the speech of Prime Minister Cameron yesterday concerning his policy agenda there are in fact many issues I can agree with and the commission is already working for those including how to increase the competency of European industry, how to complete the single market, how to pursue free trade agreements,"" Rehn said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has ruled the federal government may not deny funds from its global anti-AIDS program to organizations that refuse to actively oppose prostitution. In a 6-2 decision on Thursday, the justices determined the policy requiring fund recipients adhere to a larger message about fighting disease and its root causes was not directly related to the ""core"" mandate of the AIDS program. Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the opinion for the majority, said the 2003 law violated the First Amendment. The ruling tosses out the policy. The case was closely watched by many U.S.-based non-governmental organizations that distribute financial and other assistance overseas. The decision comes as the justices work toward wrapping up a busy term, likely next week. Among the big issues yet to be resolved: affirmative action in college admissions; federal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act; and the politically blockbuster constitutionality of same-sex marriage. The court next meets in public session to release decisions on Monday. Looking at the case decided on Thursday, the Leadership Act was designed to ""make the reduction of HIV/AIDS behavioral risks a priority of all prevention efforts."" In addition to promoting abstinence, monogamy, counseling, and the use of condoms, the law sought to use U.S. funds to ""educate men and boys about the risks of procuring sex commercially"" as well as finding ways to help ""commercial sex workers"" themselves get out of the business. Federal money came with two conditions, including the ""Policy Requirement""-- a ban on ""assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking."" Several groups objected to what they called a ""loyalty oath,"" including the U.S.-based Alliance for Open Society and Pathfinder International. Roberts said the policy could not be sustained. ""The (requirement) compels as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the government program,"" he wrote. ""In doing so, it violates the First Amendment and cannot be sustained."" Explaining further, Roberts noted in most cases ""if a party objects to a condition on receipt of federal funding, its recourse is to decline the funds."" But the ruling concluded the law improperly prevented aid recipients from disavowing the the government's wishes when spending its own money. ""The (requirement) goes beyond preventing recipients from using private funds in a way that would undermine the federal program. It requires them to pledge allegiance to the government's policy of eradicating prostitution,"" Roberts wrote. The anti-prostitution pledge in the law would still apply to organizations based outside the United States receiving U.S. funds. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissented. Justice Elena Kagan had earlier recused herself from the case, because she had supervised the government's legal response when she was the Justice Department's Solicitor General under President Obama from 2009-2010. Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and Gender Equity, said there is ""no place for discrimination"" today. ""Discriminatory policies like the anti-prostitution pledge keep us from ever getting ahead of HIV,"" Sippel said. The case is Agency for International Development v. Alliance for Open Society International (12-10).","Law aimed to make reducing HIV/AIDS behavioral risks a priority of prevention .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)   -- President Bush signed a controversial bill Sunday that temporarily revises federal electronic surveillance laws. ""This law gives our intelligence professionals this greater flexibility while closing a dangerous gap in our intelligence-gathering activities that threatened to weaken our defenses,"" Bush said in a written statement issued by the White House. The new law gives the attorney general or the director of national intelligence the authority to approve surveillance of suspected terrorists overseas. The bill went through Congress over the weekend after heavy pressure from the Bush administration, which demanded that lawmakers remain in session until it passed. Congress responded by approving the revisions for six months. The measure updates the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which governs electronic surveillance in intelligence cases.  Watch how the House was pressured to pass the bill » . ""Over the past three decades, this law has not kept pace with revolutionary changes in technology,"" Bush said. ""As a result, our intelligence professionals have told us that they are missing significant intelligence information that they need to protect the country."" Bush sought changes to FISA after a classified ruling by a court set up under the law to hear wiretap requests. That ruling concluded that FISA required a warrant for eavesdropping on communications between people overseas because so many phone calls and e-mails are sent through U.S. switching centers, U.S. officials said. The administration initially proposed to give the authority only to the attorney general, but agreed to add the director of national intelligence after Democrats objected to putting more power into the hands of embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Top Democratic and Republican senators have accused Gonzales of giving misleading testimony to Congress about a U.S. no-warrant eavesdropping program, the existence of which Bush acknowledged in 2005. Critics say the program -- which included the monitoring of communications into and out of the United States by people suspected of having links to the al Qaeda terrorist network -- violated FISA. FISA was passed in 1978 after Watergate-era abuses by intelligence and law enforcement agencies that were wiretapping within the country. Early this year, the Bush administration agreed to submit the program to the FISA court. Bush insists the program protects the civil liberties of Americans. But Democrats and the American Civil Liberties Union objected to provisions in the GOP-backed bill that grant the attorney general and the director of national intelligence the authority to approve all wiretaps -- even if one party is in the United States -- with minimal court oversight. Bush said Congress will need to pass a more comprehensive reform bill when it reconvenes in September after its August recess. Congress will be called to address what Bush called ""meaningful liability protection"" for those who took part in the eavesdropping program. The ACLU says the administration's proposals would effectively ""gut"" FISA. And Rep. Rahm Emanuel, the third most powerful Democrat in the House, said lawmakers ""are not going to leave Alberto Gonzales as the gatekeeper on American civil liberties."" ""That's the fundamental problem, and we're going to fix it when we come back,"" Emanuel told reporters Sunday. ""We had to do it. We did what we needed to do. The Democrats are united in fixing this flawed law."" E-mail to a friend .","New law gives AG right to OK surveillance of suspected terrorists overseas .

"(CNN) -- Dealing with Merion is turning out to be tough enough. But Tiger Woods is also battling an injury at the U.S. Open in Pennsylvania. Woods revealed that he hurt his left arm while winning The Players Championship last month, which would explain why he grimaced noticeably on several occasions in the first round. The world's top-ranked golfer was back in action in the second round Friday and shot a level-par 70 to complete two rounds at three-over-par 143. Asked to provide more details about injury, Woods didn't elaborate. ""Well, it is what it is,"" Woods said. Woods is bidding to win his 15th major but first since 2008 at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines. Back then he had to deal with seemingly a more serious injury -- a broken leg. He memorably beat Rocco Mediate in a playoff. Given the challenging conditions at Merion, Woods suggested his total might not be so bad heading into the final two rounds. Storms caused delays of more than four hours Thursday -- Woods had to complete his first round Friday -- and play was eventually suspended due to darkness. Windy conditions added to the degree of difficulty at Merion's shorter East Course. Woods, Rory McIlroy and Masters winner Adam Scott made for a dream pairing and while Scott struggled, Woods and McIlroy -- the second-ranked golfer -- fared better. Seen chatting amicably during the round, the duo compiled identical scores in the first two rounds. Beginning at the 11th hole, Woods birdied the 13th for a good start. Two bogeys, however, on the 14th and 18th, meant he had work to do on the first nine. He hit birdies on the second and fourth, although with a one-under-par in sight, he bogeyed the seventh. Americans Billy Horschel and Phil Mickelson, a five-time U.S. Open runner-up, co-led through two rounds with a one-under-par 139. ""I played well,"" Woods said. ""I just made a couple of mistakes out there. ""But I really played well. Maybe I could have gotten one or two more out of it, but it was a pretty good day."" McIlroy, who hasn't hit peak form in 2013, hit four birdies and four bogeys. ""I got through that tough stretch from 14 to 18 in only one over which was a pretty good effort,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I played solid. It felt like every time I made a birdie I made a bogey straight away. ""It's a course where you sort of feel like you can shoot a score but where they put the pins ... it's just tricky and tough. I'm right there for the weekend and I'm happy about that."" Scott bettered Woods and McIlroy in the first round, shooting a 72. But he came undone nearing the end of his second round, hitting four bogeys in a row from the third to the sixth hole. ""I just lost my rhythm early this morning when it was a bit cold and windy and just fought with it all day long,"" Scott said. ""The putter kind of cooled off. ""I would have liked to make some putts and then you're always happy.""","Tiger Woods said he injured his arm at the Players Championship .

"(CNN) -- There were high-profile tournaments on both the PGA and European Tours this weekend, yet the most talked about round of golf was undoubtedly shared by Tiger Woods and President Obama. But as the 14-time major winner and current world No. 2 ambled round the Floridian course in Palm Beach with the leader of the free world, resentment was starting to build among the press corps. Naturally, such a high profile two-ball was of huge interest to journalists the world over but the White House refused to sanction so much as a snap of the pair in action. Obama's love for golf is well documented and the press have been able to capture some of his previous rounds with former President Bill Clinton and Republican House Speaker John Boehner. But on this occasion reporters weren't allowed access to the well defended Floridian complex, which drew criticism from the White House Correspondents Association. It's own president, Ed Henry, said: ""I can say a broad cross section of our members from print, radio, online and TV have today expressed extreme frustration to me about having absolutely no access to the President of the United States this entire weekend. ""There is a very simple but important principle we will continue to fight for today and in the days ahead: transparency."" Very few details emerged from Woods and Obama's round, but the fact that Golf Channel reporter Tim Rosaforte appeared to be tweeting from inside the complex only added to the WHCA's ire. White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded by releasing a statement defending the secret nature of the meeting. ""The press access granted by the White House today is entirely consistent with the press access offered for previous presidential golf outings,"" it read. ""It's also consistent with the press access promised to the White House Press Corps prior to arrival in Florida on Friday evening."" On Saturday, Obama is reported to have spent time working on his swing with Woods' former coach Butch Harmon, who called it an ""honor."" The 69-year-old tweeted: ""What a great weekend. To spend it with the President and have my son Claude III by my side. It doesn't get any better than this."" Obama also played with U.S Trade Representative Ron Kirk and Jim Crane, a Democratic donor who owns the resort and the Houston Astros, according to reports. Meanwhile, John Merrick won his first ever title on the PGA Tour after edging Charlie Beljan out in a playoff at the Northern Trust Open in Santa Monica, California. The American, who attended UCLA, made par on the second extra hole, the 10th, while Beljan missed a five foot putt to prolong the playoff. ""To be able to play the tournament was a dream of mine,"" Merrick told the PGA Tour website. ""But to win? I can't describe it. It's so much fun."" Elsewhere, the draw for the first World Golf Championships tournament of the year, the Accenture Match Play, has been made, pairing world No. 1 Rory McIlroy, who lost to Hunter Mahan in the final last year, against Irishman Shane Lowry. Woods will play Charles Howell III in his opening round match while defending champion Mahan comes up against Italian teenager Matteo Manassero. Luke Donald, the 2011 champion, begins his charge against Marcel Siem of Germany. Former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa, the No. 4 seed, will play Richie Ramsay of Scotland.","President Obama enjoys a round of golf with world No. 2 Tiger Woods in Florida on Sunday .

"(CNN) -- It's hard not to notice Aziz N'Diaye. Standing at seven feet tall, the starting center for the University of Washington's basketball team is a dominant force in American college basketball. His towering height and physical power, coupled with his impressive shot-blocking and rebounding skills, make the senior a serious prospect for a professional basketball career. But the imposing center's past is just as compelling as his promising future. N'Diaye's long journey to college basketball started several years ago on the other side of the Atlantic. ""I'm originally from Dakar, which is the capital of Senegal,"" explains N'Diaye, whose introspective tone contrasts with his imposing stature. ""I was going to a smaller high school over there ... for two years and I got offered to come to the States to finish my high-school career."" Read also: NBA boss finding Africa's basketball stars . The place that jump-started N'Diaye's dream of playing in the NBA was the Sports for Education and Economic Development in Senegal (SEEDS) academy, a boarding school that gives eager young men from the West African country the opportunity to study and play basketball, with the possibility of being recruited to play on a bigger stage in the United States. Located in Thies, western Senegal, SEEDS uses sports as a vehicle to empower and support youth in the country while offering them quality education and helping them to improve their athletic skills. The academy provides up to 30 youngsters a year with a place to live, study and train, sheltering their dreams for a better future in a country where less than 20% of children make it to high school. ""As Africans, we have a responsibility to build our community,"" says Amadou Gallo Fall, who started the SEEDS foundation in 1998, before opening the boarding school in 2003. ""Those days are over where other people came, saw tremendous potential and resources that exist here and you know, exploited to their benefit or advantage. It's about empowering our youth, making them see that there's a pathway to success."" Read also: Why Africans will be basketball stars of tomorrow . Fall, who also serves as the NBA's vice president for development in Africa, is one of basketball's most prominent figures in the continent. His vision to start SEEDS and help his fellow countrymen stems from his own personal experience as one of the first Senegalese to earn an education through basketball in the United States. Back in the late 1980s, Fall played for the University of the District of Columbia after his basketball talents were discovered by a member of the Peace Corps in Senegal. ""Everything started from there,"" says Fall, who also pursued an MBA from Georgetown University while in the United States. Watch video: Shooting for the NBA . After graduation, Fall worked for the Senegalese national team and later he accepted a position as international scout for the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. Along the way, his desire to enable youth in his country to follow in his footsteps and gain a quality education grew even bigger. Fall realized that the power of sports to mobilize youth and give them a platform to fulfill their goals could be used for a bigger impact. The result was the establishment of SEEDS. ""To me, it was about how these young people could use their God-given talent to get an education, because that happened with me,"" he says. ""Most of them didn't realize that possibility existed. So really, my thing was, how do we help them identify that this opportunity exists? At some point I thought, in order to have a bigger impact, to reach more people, we wanted to really create something back in Senegal where it would be about, how do we use sports and the power of sports to contribute in the efforts of socio-economic developments in Senegal and Africa and beyond?"" Read also: Luc Mbah a Moute -- African prince of the NBA . SEEDS has so far sent more than 40 Senegalese youngsters to study in the United States, giving 25 of them the chance to play at American colleges. For youngsters like N'Diaye, the lure of a quality education coupled with a chance to pursue his dream of one day playing in the NBA were enough to make him decide to go to SEEDS. ""It was a good academic school,"" he says. ""It's like, people going there, having the opportunity, the chance of traveling with basketball and having the chance of going to some camps and have some coaches take a look at them and see where their skill is at. ""At the end of the day, I wanted to come to the States because here, sports and education, they combined it.""","Academy in Senegal gives basketball scholarships to U.S. colleges .

"Washington (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie declined an invitation to attend a major gathering of social conservatives this week in Washington, opting instead to make a high-profile appearance at a forum organized by former President Bill Clinton in Chicago. Christie's decision was hardly a bombshell: Up for re-election in November in a Democratic-leaning state, the governor can hardly afford to be seen courting Christian conservatives and sharing a stage with divisive figures like Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain. But his absence was a sore point for many conservative activists who traveled to the Faith and Freedom Coalition's ""Road to Majority"" conference to see a bumper crop of GOP stars, including would-be presidential candidates like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. In New Hampshire, early signs of the 2016 presidential race . The official line here about Christie was a polite one. ""He was invited,"" conference organizer Ralph Reed told CNN in an e-mail when asked about Christie. ""We would have been happy to have him and our hope is he can come next year."" But in conversation after conversation at the forum, attendees offered opinions of Christie that ranged from bewilderment to thinly disguised contempt. Taken together, their assessments signaled that Christie has some vital repair work to do with conservatives if he wants to pursue the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. While many here seemed unfamiliar with the details of his policy positions, most were fully aware of Christie's public embrace of President Barack Obama in the wake of Superstorm Sandy, which ravaged the New Jersey shore last October. Christie's gushing praise of the president's post-storm relief efforts rankled a number of Mitt Romney's top campaign advisers, some of whom blamed him for burnishing Obama's image just days before the presidential election. The whispered complaint among top Republicans in and out of the Romney campaign was that Christie was disloyal, more concerned with his 2013 re-election bid than with helping a Republican capture the White House. At the Faith and Freedom event, it was clear a similar perception about Christie has taken hold among party activists, many of whom said they wouldn't dare vote for him if he decides to seek the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. ""He's changed,"" said Robert Eaton, a Republican activist from Greensboro, North Carolina. ""He was a rock star at first when he first came out. He was strong. He was making good speeches and being very conservative. He went against the teacher's unions, which is a good, free enterprise issue. And he stared them down. Had his way. Now he is showing his other side."" Eaton, who said he was surprised Christie was even invited by the Faith and Freedom Coalition, paused in the middle of an interview and looked at his companion. ""Was he a Democrat before he was a Republican? That's a good question. It wouldn't surprise me."" Nancy Modlin, another North Carolinian and a self-described home-schooling mom, expressed disappointment that Christie chose to attend a forum hosted by Clinton instead of spending a day in Washington meeting with conservatives. Bill Clinton lauds Christie . ""I am disillusioned with him,"" Modlin said. ""I see too much two-facedness, trying to ride both sides of the fence for his own gain. I'm not sure what he is right now, with the way he philanders with a variety of people, Democrats like Bill Clinton. What does that tell you?"" Brandon Patterson, a 23-year old Regent University student from Virginia Beach, Virginia, said Christie ""is not very popular here."" ""Nobody is excited to support him at all,"" Patterson said. ""Nobody that I know of. He's a moderate."" Christie has riled the right in other ways beyond the drama of Sandy. His list of perceived sins, documented by right-leaning bloggers and curated online by the conservative Drudge Report, seems to expand by the week. In February, the governor complied with an expansion of Medicaid required under Obama's health care reform law, a smart political move in a blue state but a poke-in-the-eye for conservatives rabidly opposed to the provision. He has sought tougher gun laws in New Jersey. And earlier this month, after the death of New Jersey Sen. Frank Lautenberg, Christie called for an expensive taxpayer-funded special Senate election instead of appointing a Republican to serve out the remainder of the Democrat's term in Washington. Still, many of the conference-goers had only a dim awareness of Christie's record in Trenton. Their impressions seemed based on casual conversations with friends and neighbors, and rooted in the Sandy episode last year. Asked specifically what it is about Christie that turns off conservatives, Melissa Ortiz said ""the buddy buddy with Obama thing."" ""The way he buddied-up to him does not play well with true bedrock conservatives,"" said Ortiz, a communications strategist from Washington who said she personally admires Christie. Admittedly, these are the opinions of only a modest sample of the most dedicated social conservative activists, including a good number of evangelical Christians who might be more sympathetic to a candidate like former Sen. Rick Santorum, who won the 2012 Iowa caucuses with support from influential pastors, or Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the son of a Baptist minister and a practicing evangelical. But there is harder evidence that Christie has problems with Republicans outside of New Jersey. A Gallup poll released earlier this month pegged Christie's approval rating among national Republicans at just 58 percent, and almost a quarter of Republicans view him unfavorably. ""This may reflect that Republicans are paying close attention to Christie's overall political positioning, and some in the party may be displeased with Christie's high-visibility public appearances with President Barack Obama in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy at the New Jersey shore, including one just before last November's presidential election,"" Gallup pollster Frank Newport wrote about the poll. Getting a thumbs-up from nearly two-thirds of national Republicans might not seem like a problem for Christie. But politicians -- especially those who hope to survive the obstacle course of a presidential primary fight -- are generally expected to have deeper appeal within their own party's ranks. Hillary Clinton, for instance, has a 94% favorable rating among Democrats, Gallup recently found. The picture in New Jersey, where Christie is expected to cruise to victory in November over Democratic challenger Barbara Buono, differs markedly for him. Almost 90 percent of Republicans in the state view their governor favorably, according to a Rutgers-Eagleton poll released on Friday, and more than 80 percent of New Jersey voters think Christie will be re-elected. And yet not a single person among the more than two dozen conference-goers interviewed Thursday and Friday named Christie among their top choices for president in 2016. The names that most frequently surfaced were those of Paul, Rubio and Walker, who, like Christie, were absent from the gathering. Zelizer: Why 2014 is the year to watch . A number of conservatives here said flatly they would never vote for Christie. ""Sorry, can't go that way,"" said Nancy Schultz, a Republican from Orlando, Florida. ""He's not pure enough on the founding principles."" Elizabeth Creamer, a resident of Clearwater, Florida, had a similar take. ""I've heard he's in with the president and he supports what he does, and you see him walking around with Obama and you see him consorting with Obama a lot,"" Creamer said. ""I don't know where he stands."" LaDonna Ryggs, a Republican activist from South Carolina, said Christie has time to repair his image, but she doubts that he will have much appeal in her state, which holds one of the pivotal early presidential primaries every four years. ""After the election and the things that happened, I think a lot of people probably blame him for it,"" Ryggs said. ""I don't blame him. I don't think it was his fault. But you still hear it from a lot of people. The way I look at him is, he sells in New Jersey. And what you have to be there is a whole lot different than what sells in South Carolina. I don't know that he will be popular in South Carolina."" A few people here had a more pragmatic perspective. Eric Lupardus, the 25-year old Missouri native, said Republicans should be willing to support candidates who aren't down-the-line conservatives if they want to win. ""I hate the argument that if we want to win we have to pick someone who we don't necessarily agree with, but that's the world we live in,"" he said. ""So I would rather have Chris Christie and have him be my friend half the time, than have a Democrat as a president. I would certainly vote for him."" ""I don't think we should shoot for the middle,"" Lupardus said, with a pained look on his face. ""But we need someone with broad appeal, because we've lost the last two times and we need a win.""","New Jersey's Chris Christie's decision to choose Clinton over Faith and Freedom forum rankles conservatives .

"(CNN) -- Amazon is getting into the game-making game. The Seattle-based company announced its first major social-game title, ""Living Classics,"" on Monday. The free Facebook game is the first from its Amazon Game Studios, a new department at the e-commerce giant that was also unveiled Monday. ""Amazon Game Studios is exactly what it sounds like: a new team at Amazon that's focused on creating innovative, fun and well-crafted games,"" said the company in a blog post on the new games.amazon.com site. The department is currently hiring, but few other details are given. The social-gaming field is still dominated by Zynga, maker of addictive games such as Farmville and Words With Friends and their various spin-offs. But the company has been struggling since going public in December; Zynga's stock closed at $2.94 a share on Monday. Yet another social game isn't much of a threat to Zynga, but Amazon has the firepower necessary to become a legitimate competitor, thanks to its large network of customers with active accounts. Amazon can also target any games it does build to users of its popular Kindle tablets. Amazon isn't revealing much about its motivation for entering the game market, saying only, ""We know that many Amazon customers enjoy playing games -- including free-to-play social games -- and thanks to Amazon's know-how, we believe we can deliver a great, accessible gaming experience that gamers and our customers can play any time."" The first game is a simple literature-themed puzzle game. Players are presented with busy illustrations of scenes loosely based on classic books. To get points called cash and coins, they must quickly spot and click moving objects on the screen. Levels include takes on ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Wizard of Oz,"" ""King Arthur"" and more generic themes such as pirates and haunted houses. (""Classics"" could mean more than just books -- one of the illustrations on the official Living Classics Facebook fan page show two X-Files type characters.) Since this is a Facebook game, there are plenty of opportunities to play the game with friends. And since games are big business, there are options to spend real money on in-app purchases. Players can stock up on game currency -- a dollar buys you five units of ""cash"" currency, and $100 gets you 660.

"(CNN) -- Air Canada has seen quite a turnaround. A few years ago, Canada's national carrier was on the brink of declaring bankruptcy for a second time in a decade, and at the end of 2011 it reported a $60 million loss. After a year-long shakeup, however, the once-turbulent company has seen a dramatic rise in profits, and its end-of-year earnings for 2012 were $8 million (the first time the company had turned a profit in five years). Calin Rovinescu, the company's CEO, attributes the upturn to his ""Gangnam-style"" approach. In a recent issue of the airline's in-flight magazine, he wrote: . ""Full-service, established airlines like Air Canada have to be especially flexible and nimble to avoid becoming the great-uncle launching into a twist at the wedding, whilst the youngsters go 'gangnam'."" In other words, Air Canada realized it had to learn new moves, or, as Rovinescu clarifies, ""get off the dance floor."" One of the carrier's most prominent restructuring methods is adding 109 more seats to five new Boeing 777-300ERs, and introducing a new premium economy class. ""I want us to be the leading, premium airline in North America,"" says Rovinescu, who acknowledges there is stiff competition. Read more: Economy class goes gourmet . Though there's always a risk that a boosted up economy class will lure a few passengers who would have otherwise booked a more expensive business-class ticket, Rovinescu is confident the move will instead attract a new demographic of economy passengers who want a few extra creature comforts. ""People that are on the edge of being able to pay for a business class seat may well move to the premium economy, but our expectation is that it will be more than made up by economy class passengers that buy in (because they find) the pricing of a business class too high."" Another major move is that the airline has started to launch a bigger presence in the Asian market, increasing their routes between Toronto and Vancouver to Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Perhaps the most dramatic change, though, is the addition of a second, low-cost airline, called Rouge, which the company is billing as its ""leisure"" service. Rouge employs smaller planes and travels to separate, more vacation-themed destinations than the main carrier. ""We're a pretty good brand in the leisure market, though word is that we do well on the business travel-side internationally. We look at our business and say, well, we could either abandon (the leisure-side) over time, as there will always be an efficient, lower cost producer, or we could get into it in a much more meaningful way."" It's still too early to see what effect these changes will have on Air Canada's bottom line in the long run. But the company's recent profit margins bode well. ""One year does not a transformation make,"" acknowledges Rovinescu, ""but I'm really encouraged by the results of last year. I will characterize ourselves as a baseball game. We are probably in the fifth inning right now of a transformation process."" Read more: Air Canada flight finds stranded Australian yacht . The company also faced labor challenges last year with disputes with the airlines' two largest unions, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The launch of Rouge was one point of contention, with airline staff worried about the implications for the safety of their jobs. ""Some of the things (we implemented) were a little bit of a shock to the airline, a shock to the system. The contracts were all settled and everybody did a great job and went back to work,"" he says. ""Otherwise, we wouldn't be winning awards,"" he adds. The accolades he refers to include an award for best international airline in North America for three years running in the World Airline Awards.

"(CNN) -- With the weather warming up, a thrilling spring is in full swing for avid readers. There are a slew of new titles hitting shelves in May and a few recent releases you may have missed; from spies to private eyes, World War II history to werewolves and a new riff on Sherlock Holmes. For anyone looking to bury their nose in a good book at the park, pool side or on the front porch, here are five must reads for your consideration. 'A Delicate Truth' by John le Carre . To many fans of spy fiction, le Carre is king. Over the past 50 years, he's elevated the espionage genre to an art form in classics like ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,"" and ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy."" Now 81, the British-born author has written his 23rd novel, ""A Delicate Truth,"" which addresses the war on terror. The book begins with a top-secret mission, codenamed Wildfire. British and American agents are in Gibraltar to capture a jihadist arms dealer, but the covert op ends in ""an utter cock-up."" A conspiracy and attempt at a coverup soon follow. Longtime fans will already know that le Carre was a member of the British Foreign Service from 1959 to 1964, and writes with absolute authenticity about the kinds of spy tradecraft his characters employ. ""A Delicate Truth"" seems ready-made for the movies and not surprisingly, filmmakers are already working on a big screen adaptation. Le Carre himself appears in a stylized trailer for his novel that feels like a short film unto itself. Watch the trailer and read an excerpt from ""A Delicate Truth."" 'Red Moon' by Benjamin Percy . When it comes to horror fiction, vampires are so last year. The zombie craze is losing steam. Witches? Please. Werewolves are where it's at. Benjamin Percy, a contributing editor at Esquire magazine, takes lycanthropes to another literary level in his new novel, ""Red Moon,"" turning the monster mythology on its ear. The story takes place in an alternate version of reality where being a werewolf is considered a disease, spread by a mysterious virus. While doctors search for a cure, the infected live alongside the general population, only as second-class citizens. They're shunned, segregated and treated with mind-numbing drugs to keep from turning into monsters, full moon no longer needed. There's a guerrilla war being fought overseas in the ancestral home of the beasts, not unlike recent history in Iraq and Afghanistan. Percy draws a pretty direct parallel with the war on terror, which comes to a head when a werewolf terrorist unleashes a bloody attack on a passenger plane. The sole survivor of the flight becomes one of several main characters readers follow throughout the book. There's also a rebellious teen who's the daughter of hippie werewolf parents, an Oregon politician running a rabid anti-werewolf campaign and an underground network of werewolf insurgents with plans to carve out their own corner of the country. If you enjoyed Justin Cronin's apocalyptic vampire tale, ""The Passage,"" then check out ""Red Moon."" It has a similar vibe and will appeal to readers looking for a tense, thrilling tale with some good grisly fun. Read an excerpt from ""Red Moon."" 'The Baker Street Translation' by Michael Robertson . I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for a good Sherlock Holmes story. Count me among the fans of the recent resurgence in Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic detective -- Robert Downey Jr.'s Hollywood action-hero version, as well as the character's modern re-imagining in the BBC's ""Sherlock"" and CBS's ""Elementary."" That said, any Holmes fan would enjoy Michael Robertson's fresh new take on the Holmes stories in ""The Baker Street Translation,"" the latest in his series of books about the brothers of Baker Street. The concept is clever, Reggie and Nigel Heath are siblings who lease law offices at London's 221B Baker Street, where they get mail addressed to the building's best known, albeit fictional resident. There are fan letters and then a few pieces of correspondence from people who believe Holmes is real and need his help. By answering the more persuasive sounding appeals, Reggie and Nigel can't help but get pulled into their own cases, including a potential plot against a member of Britain's royal family and a mystery that would even confound the famous fictional sleuth. Robertson's characters are appealing, the story is light, fast-paced and thoroughly entertaining. For any Sherlockian, it's elementary -- this series is not to be missed. Read an excerpt from ""The Baker Street Translation."" 'Angel's Gate' by P.G. Sturges . Dick Henry, aka the Shortcut Man, is back in P.G. Sturges' latest noir novel, ""Angel's Gate,"" a romp through the seamy underside of Los Angeles. For the uninitiated, Henry is an ex-cop turned fixer. If you have an unusual, even criminal problem, and you need to cut through the red tape, fast, call Dick. His solution may not always be moral, ethical, or legal but he gets the job done. That's why he's called the Shortcut Man. Sturges is the son of Hollywood legend Preston Sturges, the moviemaker behind such classics as ""Sullivan's Travels."" Like father, son shares a love of quirky characters and screwball plots. Case in point -- in the book, Henry is hired by the sister of a young actress who disappeared years ago in Hollywood. His search for the missing girl takes him to the door of an aging and amorous movie mogul, who keeps a stable of starlets for some altogether unwholesome activity. The mystery goes even deeper with a fading movie star who has a dark secret, a missing screenplay, and a mysterious death on a yacht. There's also a running gag about a foul-smelling ficus being passed around the characters in the story. While the subject matter is definitely adult, Sturges breaks the dark mood with some welcome humor. For readers who haven't yet met him, take advantage of this entertaining introduction to the Shortcut Man. Read an excerpt from ""Angel's Gate."" 'Frozen in Time' by Mitchell Zuckoff . When it comes to riveting nonfiction, author Mitchell Zuckoff has a knack for finding fascinating but forgotten stories from World War II. His last book, ""Lost in Shangri-La,"" recounted the true-life story of a U.S. military plane crash in the rainforests of New Guinea and how a small group of survivors, caught between enemy Japanese troops and a tribe of man-eating headhunters, were able to stay alive and are eventually rescued. Now in ""Frozen in Time,"" Zuckoff takes readers to a much colder clime, Greenland's Ice Cap, the scene of another crash and another amazing rescue. There's plenty of bad luck to go around and three plane crashes in the new book. First, a U.S. Skytrooper cargo plane goes down in 1942 over Greenland, then a B-17 bomber crashes during the subsequent search and rescue mission and then a ""Duck,"" a small amphibious plane also disappears looking for the downed airmen. That's just the beginning of the story. The real struggle here is the nearly five months the crash survivors spent stranded on the ice, battling blizzards and sub-zero temperatures. Adding to the narrative, there's also a connection to the present woven into the harrowing WWII tale. Nearly 70 years after the crash, Zuckoff, members of the U.S. Coast Guard and a group of polar explorers go back to Greenland looking for one of the original crash sites and a plane still believed to be buried under the ice. In both time periods, this is a truly suspenseful and thrilling American story of perseverance with a worthwhile payoff in the final pages.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Riot police fired warning shots and tear gas Thursday outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to keep hundreds of protesters away from the building's perimeter, witnesses said. Six police officers suffered minor injuries during the clashes, said Alla Mahmoud, a spokesman for the Egyptian Interior Ministry. Some protesters received medical treatment inside ambulances. Demonstrators threw rocks and Molotov cocktails as police tried to disperse them by firing tear gas canisters from police vehicles as they drove through Tahrir Square, near the embassy. The clashes came amid heightened tensions at U.S. diplomatic missions in the region following Tuesday's attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that left Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other consular officials dead. On Tuesday, the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and tore down its U.S. flag. About 500 protesters turned out Wednesday in Cairo to demonstrate against a film that mocks Islam's prophet. Wednesday night's protest turned violent as demonstrators threw rocks and pushed through barbed wire fencing outside the embassy, according to Mahmoud. Two police trucks and a car were set afire. ""Forces were able to push them down toward Tahrir Square farther from embassy street,"" Mahmoud said, adding that some arrests had been made. Many of the protesters chanted anti-U.S. slogans. By early Thursday, protesters had been pushed 100 yards from the embassy, said journalist Ian Lee in Cairo. More than a dozen people were injured in the clashes, which continued after midnight, said Khaled Khatib of the Health Ministry. Earlier, Egypt's president spoke in the ""strongest terms"" about Tuesday's incident at the Cairo embassy -- but not against the attack. WhiIe Egypt's prime minister called Tuesday's incident ""regrettable"" and unjustified, President Mohamed Morsy condemned the anti-Muslim film that incited the protesters. Morsy made a reference to Egypt's duty to protect diplomatic missions and its opposition to unlawful protesters, but did not mention those who stormed the embassy. ""The presidency condemns in the strongest terms the attempt of a group to insult the place of the Messenger, the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) and condemns the people who have produced this radical work,"" the president said in a statement posted on his Facebook page. ""The Egyptian people, both Muslims and Christians, refuse such insults on sanctities."" The statement noted that ""the Egyptian government is responsible to protect private and public properties and diplomatic missions in addition to embassy headquarters of various countries"" and that ""it respects and protects the right of expression and the right to protest peacefully under the law and will firmly oppose any irresponsible attempt to veer off the law."" Tuesday, police and Egyptian army personnel formed defensive lines around the U.S. Embassy to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters had affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound. The flag was adorned with white characters that read, ""There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,"" a phrase often used by Islamic radicals. Warning shots were fired as a crowd gathered around the compound, although it was not clear who fired the shots. There were no reported casualties. Four protesters were arrested and were being questioned for ""going off track to what is accepted as peaceful protesting,"" said Interior Ministry spokesman Alla Mahmoud. The Cairo incident was not nearly as bad as the violence in neighboring Libya, where an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi killed four Americans, including Stevens. The Libya attack has been blamed on a pro-al Qaeda group, according to sources tracking militant groups in the region. It was unclear if the two attacks were coordinated. Protesters in both countries were upset over an online film that depicts Islam as a fraudulent religion and the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and ruthless killer. In his statement, Morsy called on Egyptian diplomats in Washington ""to take legal action against those people who seek to ruin relationships and discussions between people and countries."" The incident comes amid a delicate period in the relationship between the United States and Egypt under Morsy, the country's first leader since the overthrow last year of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, a key Western ally. Analysis: Morsy making up foreign policy as he goes along . Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt, telling them to avoid the demonstrations. Frenzied protesters could be seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans. ""This is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult,"" said Nizih El Naggary, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. ""But events like this are extremely deplorable. And we have to work to get things under control."" Egypt's Foreign Ministry pledged to protect embassies and warned of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy. Several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations, including Salafist leader Wesam Abdel-Wareth, president of Egypt's conservative Hekma television channel. Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street, where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to Mubarak. ""These protests are a bad image for Egypt,"" said Ahmed, a Cairo street vendor. ""Of course I'm against insulting Islam, but it's the undereducated, poor people who are out here causing problems."" ""All I want for Egypt is security and stability,"" he said. ""And as you can see this isn't it."" Report: Egypt's ex-PM Ahmed Shafik faces arrest, extradition order .

"(CNN) -- In his first address since returning to Pakistan from self-exile, former President Pervez Musharraf declared his intention to run for office, saying he defied risks to ""save"" the country. Musharraf landed in Karachi on Sunday after more than four years in exile. He faces criminal charges, and the Taliban have vowed to unleash a ""death squad"" to assassinate him. However, he said, he does not plan to flee again. ""I have put my life in danger and have come to Pakistan -- to you to be the savior of this country,"" he said at the airport. ""I have come to save Pakistan."" He chided people who had doubted that he would return. ""There were rumors that I would not come -- where are those people now?"" he asked. ""I am here. I have returned."" At the airport, crowds danced, waved the nation's green flag and chanted Musharraf's name. Some people carried giant posters, plastered with his face. ""Inshallah (God willing) we will be successful if I have your support,"" he said. After his statement, he was whisked away to an undisclosed location for safety reasons. Police hovered nearby, guns slung from their shoulders. Complicated return . Musharraf resigned as president of the south Asian nation five years ago and went into exile in London and Dubai. He hopes to reassert his influence and lead his party in May elections. His return comes with complications. Government officials have said he would be arrested as soon as he sets foot in the nation while the Pakistani Taliban have vowed to assassinate him. However, his party says it has taken pre-emptive measures to ward off a potential arrest. ""Musharraf has been granted bail in advance of his arrival to Pakistan. We have made sure that he is not arrested and his return home will be smooth,"" said Jawed Siddiqui, a member of the former president's party, All Pakistan Muslim League. His lawyers paid an unknown amount of bail, which means Musharraf will not be arrested for at least 15 days, but must appear in court. Fear of the unknown . Musharraf's return home comes with a lot of uncertainties. As he boarded a flight from Dubai International Airport, Musharraf said he was not nervous, but was concerned about the unknown. His wife, Sehba, had a different answer when asked if she was worried. ""Who wouldn't be?"" she said. Last year, he scuttled plans to return home after the military warned him not to. ""There were indications that they didn't want me to come, and my own colleagues told me not to come,"" Musharraf said. ""Therefore, I changed my mind."" This time, he said, he will be protected by government security and his private security agents. Musharraf landed in Karachi on a commercial airline. He said in a statement he would be accompanied by 200 expatriates from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. Arrest over Bhutto's killing . In 1999, Musharraf, then chief of Pakistan's army, became its president in a bloodless military coup. He remained in power until resigning five years ago, a period that included the U.S.-led invasion of neighboring Afghanistan. A few months before he left office, Benazir Bhutto -- who was Pakistan's first elected female prime minister -- was killed in a suicide bomb attack as she was wrapping up a campaign rally in Rawalpindi. The attack came months after she survived an assassination attempt in Karachi. Authorities want Musharraf arrested for not doing enough to protect Bhutto's life despite numerous threats. The former military ruler has denied having anything to do with the killing. A jail cell awaits . Last year, Pakistani authorities confiscated his property and froze his bank account. They have accused him of not declaring foreign bank accounts he had in his name. The Sindh province Home Ministry said last year that a jail cell awaited him in Karachi upon his return, . In Pakistan, the provincial Home Ministry, not the federal government, is responsible for such arrests. Musharraf defended his record last year, and said he did much to improve the nation's economy while he was in office. However, he has admitted to making mistakes. Disillusioned Pakistanis . Musharraf's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation's Supreme Court chief justice for ""misuse of authority."" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence the court's ruling on whether he could seek another five-year term. Although the chief justice was reinstated, the damage was done. Pakistanis were also disillusioned with Musharraf's policies that led to shortages of essential food items, power cuts and skyrocketing inflation. However, under his leadership, Pakistan attained respectable economic growth rates and established a generally favorable investment climate. Along with that came a growing middle class, more aggressive news media, and a more assertive judiciary. 'Death squad' threat . Pakistan also disapproved of the way Musharraf carried out his end of the ""war on terror"" and used it as a crutch to explain away many of his unpopular moves. After the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States, Musharraf supported the American war on terror and targeted the Taliban. The militants have accused him of pushing an American agenda in Pakistan. An opportune time . Musharraf's return comes at an opportune time. Last week, Pakistan marked the first time a democratically elected government has served a full five-year term in the country's 65-year history. While the ruling Pakistan People Party rode to power on the back of discontent with Musharraf, it had to deal with the same problems that plagued Musharraf: food shortages and power cuts. Five years is often enough time for a populace to forgive and forget. On Sunday, election officials named former chief justice Mir Hazar Khan Khoso as interim prime minister. He will head the caretaker administration through the May elections. It remains to be seen whether Pakistan, now soured by the PPP's reign, will welcome Musharraf back with open arms.

"(CNN) -- They call politics a blood sport, a battle royale, a bare-knuckle brawl. But why use bare knuckles when you can smack your presidential rival with a microphone, light saber or red, white and blue Popsicle? A new video game for iPad, iPhone and other Apple devices lets players do just that, with the help of President Barack Obama or rival Mitt Romney. ""Vote!!!"" comes from Epic Games' Chair Entertainment, best known for revolutionizing the mobile gaming space with its console-style ""Infinity Blade"" franchise. ""Infinity Blade"" games have generated nearly $50 million in revenue since launching in December 2010. ""Vote!!!"" allows political junkies (and gamers alike) to pick a stylized cartoonish version of their preferred presidential candidate and then duke it out through multiple rounds. The game focuses on arcade-style fighting and encourages players to keep on swinging for more votes. The game includes three 75-second rounds. The fight starts at a national debate and then moves to the White House lawn and concludes in the Oval Office. Before each round, players can customize their Democratic or Republican candidate with an outfit, a weapon and an accessory. In keeping with the humorous tone, everything about this game is over the top. ""We have some great outfits like an Uncle Sam costume, Apollo Creed-like boxing shorts, a super hero get-up and even '70s disco duds,"" said Donald Mustard, creative director and co-founder of Chair Entertainment. ""Weapons are also on the fun side with things like an ice cream cone, a rocket pop, a Fourth of July sparkler and a Saber of Liberty, which is the handle of the Statue of Liberty with a light saber coming out. ""My favorite is the microphone, because when you hit your opponent with it, there's a feedback sound. Accessories include things like sunglasses, an eye patch, a baseball hat, a clown nose, an old powdered wig and a big, handlebar mustache."" As political pundits know all too well, the road to the White House is a long and arduous fight. This arcade game replicates that campaign by going ""old school"" and focusing on earning high scores with these bouts. Players are fighting for points, which, in turn, unlock votes. The votes come in tiers, so players earn one vote for a score of more than 10,000 points in a round, two votes for a score of more than 75,000 points in a round, and three votes by topping 250,000 points in a round. Chair has married the gameplay with the vote counting and turned it into a globally connected experience. Using the same technology that allows thousands of players to connect in ""Infinity Blade II's"" ClashMobs multiplayer experience, ""Vote!!!"" keeps a running tally worldwide of who's collecting the most votes. ""The game becomes more than just a single-player fight between Obama and Romney,"" Mustard said. ""There's this cool metagame where millions of people around the country will be playing the game and earning votes. If you're actually voting for Obama, then you'll likely be playing as him in the game. So we'll have this running tally of who's winning the election, at least in terms of battling it out in this cool new game."" Using the same game mechanics of the ""Infinity Blade"" games, players will be able to rack up some seriously high scores through those additional weapons, accessories and costumes. During each round, players will have the ability to pull off a special move such as a back flip or kick flip to hit their opponent and literally knock a bunch of gold coins out of him. ""There's a lot of depth here as you're shifting between trying to rack up as many points as you can while not getting hit, but then collecting gold as fast as you can so that you can then get to the end of the round and can get a bunch of free hits on your rival and knock all the money out of him,"" Mustard said. In keeping with the election theme, Chair has partnered with Rock the Vote to encourage gamers to vote in the 2012 election. ""It's our way of having a fun PSA built into the game that is relevant and fits in with the subject matter,"" Mustard said. ""We want to encourage our younger voters to pay attention."" Bringing authenticity to the presidential candidates, Chair enlisted voice-alike actors to add humorous quips to the fighting game experience. Gamers who choose Obama might hear him say, ""Oh, yeah. That's what Barack is cooking!"" Upon winning a fight, Obama will do a little dance and say, ""I'm gonna Barack your socks off!"" Romney has lines such as ""It's time to believe in America!"" and ""I've got a good feeling about this one!"" ""We're keeping it all nonpartisan and safe but very funny,"" Mustard said. ""It's not too heated. We're not getting into health care or issues like that. These lines spice up the gameplay and keeps things fun."" Making an election fun is no easy task. And it's also nice to have something for free, especially during a time when Democrats and Republicans are asking everyone for donations. ""Vote!!!"" isn't your typical free app. It runs on the same game engine that's responsible for some of the biggest game franchises of all time. And it brings to life a rich cartoon-style world of politics and deep fighting mechanics, offering a gameplay experience that can be played by veteran voters, and first-timers, alike. ""Vote!!!"" is a free app and is due to be released Thursday.","Video game lets players pit President Obama against Mitt Romney in hand-to-hand combat .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Who is Amanda Knox? Is she a two-faced she-devil, angelic and compassionate to some but Satanic and Lucifer-like to others? That's what Carlo Pacelli, the lawyer for a man Knox falsely accused in the 2007 murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, called her as he summed up his case last week. Is she ""Foxy Knoxy,"" as the British tabloid press leered and sneered at her within hours of her exoneration in Kercher's murder Monday? Or is she the fresh-faced girl from Seattle she still appears to be, even after spending nearly four years behind bars before her conviction was quashed? Is Knox simply the victim of character assassination, painted falsely as a ""femme fatale"" by prosecutors and media the world over? Defense lawyer Giulia Bongiorno advanced that theory in her own closing argument. She compared Knox to Jessica Rabbit, the hourglass-shaped, husky-voiced cartoon character who insists in the movie ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" that she's not bad, she's just ""drawn that way."" Five women and three men on a jury here weighed in decisively on who Knox is Monday, throwing out the five most serious charges she was originally convicted of in connection with Kercher's death and releasing her from prison. Audible gasp in courtroom as verdict is read . The jury also freed Raffaele Sollecito, her former boyfriend who became her co-defendant. Their release came at the end of an appeal lasting just over four months and feeling much more like a re-trial than an appeal as understood in the United States or Kercher's native Britain. Lawyers battled on two fronts -- DNA evidence and Knox's character. Police scientists argued that a knife found at Sollecito's home had traces of Kercher's DNA on the blade and Knox's DNA on the handle. And they testified that a bra clasp belonging to Kercher and found in her room had Sollecito's genetic material on it. Experts appointed by the court questioned police handling of the evidence, suggesting authorities' sloppiness could make the DNA results unreliable and should make them inadmissible in court. Prosecution witnesses, meanwhile, maintained that the tests were valid -- leading to highly technical and sometimes heated courtroom arguments and prompting the prosecution to ask for new DNA tests, a request the judge rejected. No end to Knox as pop culture obsession . Knox and Sollecito do not have airtight alibis for the night of November 1, 2007, when Kercher's throat was slashed, her semi-naked body left under a bed cover. Their cell phones and Sollecito's computer were switched off at the time of the murder, depriving them of potentially exculpatory evidence. But while they cannot prove they were not at the scene of the crime, their defense team says the prosecution cannot prove that they were. There was no physical trace of them in the room where Kercher died, Knox and Sollecito's lawyers insisted. They argued that the crime was solely the work of drifter Rudy Guede, who was convicted separately and is serving 16 years. His DNA was all over the crime scene, the defense said. That may have been enough for the jury to set Knox and Sollecito free. Defense lawyer Luciano Ghirga reminded the jury repeatedly Monday morning that the prosecution needed to prove its case ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" -- a standard he made a point of saying was rooted in Italian law and was not imported from America, in a nod to the nationalistic tensions that have sometimes seemed to underpin this case. The jury must have had sufficient doubts to overturn a verdict rendered by eight of their compatriots less than two years ago. That means that either Knox and Sollecito were the victims of a miscarriage of justice then, or that Kercher is now. Only Knox and Sollecito themselves may know which it is -- because nearly four years after Kercher's death, incontrovertible evidence about whether Knox and Sollecito were involved remains maddeningly elusive. CNN's Hada Messia and Mallory Simon contributed to this report.","Knox was cleared in the 2007 death of her roommate .

"Washington (CNN) -- Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev was not on a terrorism watch list or a ""no-fly"" list when he traveled to Russia last year, a federal law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. The source, who spoke on condition of not being identified, noted the FBI found no suspicions of terrorist ties when it interviewed Tsarnaev and his family members and friends in 2011 after Russia asked U.S. authorities for information on the immigrant from the Caucasus region. Because the United States ""never deemed him a threat,"" Tsarnaev ""was not on a terror watch list or any 'no-fly' list,"" according to the official. The information added to questions over the FBI's handling of Tsarnaev, 26, the older of two brothers accused of setting off two bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the finish line of last week's Boston Marathon. Area near Boston bomb scene reopens to residents, business owners . Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzhokhar, also allegedly killed a university policeman on Thursday, three days after the bombings, to set off an unprecedented Boston-area manhunt. Tamerlan died after a shootout with police on Thursday night, and Dzhokhar was captured on Friday. Some members of Congress have questioned how someone the FBI questioned two years earlier because Russia was concerned about his shift toward Islamic extremism could have avoided closer scrutiny since then. After being briefed Tuesday by FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee said they don't believe the FBI ""dropped the ball"" in its handling of Tsarnaev. Heat is on FBI over handling of bombing suspect . However, both Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, who chairs the panel, and its top Republican, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, said potential problems revealed by the Tsarnaev case needed to be addressed. Chambliss cited an apparent lack of information-sharing between the federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, a problem he said was believed to have been remedied in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks almost 12 years ago. ""We're going to continue to look at whether or not all of the information was adequately shared,"" he told reporters. Separately, FBI Director Robert Mueller, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Matt Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, briefed House members on the Boston bombings, said Republican Rep. Peter King of New York. None of the legislators who spoke to reporters after the briefings provided details of the ongoing investigation, saying it was too soon to draw conclusions. ""Who knows what will be found tomorrow?"" Feinstein said. A focus of the briefings was Tamerlan Tsarnaev's six-month trip to Russia in 2012 that family members said included visits to Chechnya and Dagestan, regions known for radical Islamic insurgency. What was Tamerlan Tsarnaev doing in Russia? At a hearing earlier on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, some GOP panel members challenged Napolitano about reported discrepancies in the Tsarnaev case. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa cited reports that U.S. authorities were unaware Tsarnaev had left the country for Russia in January 2012 even though his name was misspelled on his airline ticket by Russian carrier Aeroflot, which would normally trigger increased scrutiny. Napolitano responded that Tsarnaev's departure did ""ping"" in the homeland security screening system, but she noted that because the FBI's investigation in 2011 found no suspicious activity, there was no reason to follow up. ""There was a missed match there"" involving the incorrect spelling of Tsarnaev's name, Napolitano said, adding that ""even with the misspelling, in our current system there are redundancies and so the system did ping when he was leaving the United States."" The federal law enforcement official told CNN that such a hit in the system doesn't prompt automatic action. In Tsarnaev's case, the Russian government knew he would be traveling to Russia and had family there, so there was nothing to follow up, the official said. Timeline: A look at Tamerlan's past . CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI official, offered a similar explanation Tuesday. ""By the time he comes back, the FBI case is closed and, again, no additional information comes back from the Russians to keep an eye on him or that he's on his way back to your country,"" Fuentes said. ""Once the FBI case is closed, there is no further monitoring by the FBI of his activity or whether he's going to these Jihadi Web sites or becoming increasingly radicalized."" However, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN on Tuesday that the episode showed that the Department of Homeland Security never notified the FBI that Tsarnaev had left the country. ""It was clear to me that the homeland security shop had information about the travel to Russia, the FBI did not, and they're not talking to each other and they're going back to the pre-9/11 problems here,"" Graham said. He also questioned why the FBI investigation of Tsarnaev in 2011 failed to bring his name up as someone to check out in the immediate aftermath of the Boston bombings. Tsarnaev and his brother were only identified three days later when authorities released photos and video footage of them at the scene of the blasts. ""I just find it really unnerving that we could have had him in FBI custody in 2011 and did a whole profile of him, and after the attack that his name not surface, that we didn't check the database or the database had him missing,"" Graham said. Tsarnaev was an immigrant from the volatile Caucasus region of southwest Russia who had legal residence in the United States and sought last year to become fully naturalized, like his brother Dzhokhar, 19. Bombing suspect's wife 'very distraught' However, the Department of Homeland Security rejected the citizenship request due to the FBI questioning before the Russia trip. An FBI statement Friday said a foreign government -- later identified by legislators as Russia -- asked for information on Tsarnaev ""based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer, and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country's region to join unspecified underground groups."" In response, the FBI said, it ""checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications, possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity, associations with other persons of interest, travel history and plans, and education history."" ""The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members,"" said the FBI statement. ""The FBI did not find any terrorism activity, domestic or foreign, and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011."" In addition, the FBI ""requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government,"" its statement said. The lengthy travel to Russia by Tsarnaev, who's ethnically Chechen but came to the United States from Kyrgyzstan, caused some legislators and analysts to speculate he may have received training during the trip. Dead Boston bomb suspect posted video of jihadist, analysis shows . Fuentes detailed how the FBI employs what amounts to ""triage"" to deal with what he said were tens of thousands of similar inquiries a year that require some level of bureau investigation. ""If you are getting this from a hot place like Afghanistan or the tribal area of Pakistan or places where we have had specific training camps and people deployed on purpose to come and attack us, then that is the highest priority,"" he said. ""And even there, many of the people that go back and forth are visiting family. I mean, they are not always going back to be trained to be terrorists or always going back for refresher courses on terrorism."" Regarding Russia, Fuentes noted the ongoing conflict with Chechen separatists that may have caused Moscow's request for information on Tsarnaev. 5 key questions in Boston bombing probe . ""That's been an ongoing fight, but it's been localized,"" he said, adding that he couldn't recall a case in which a Chechen trained at home came to attack the United States.

"(CNN) -- Sex. Witch. She-devil. Those are the sensational words that have captured mainstream headlines in the United States, Great Britain and Italy during the Amanda Knox saga. On Monday, the buzz phrase was ""judgment day."" Would the flaxen-haired, photogenic American student, convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering her British housemate Meredith Kercher in 2009, be released? Would her conviction be overturned? At about 3:50 p.m. ET, Knox was freed. Authorities quickly hustled her out of the courtroom and to the prison where she could collect her things. Italian jury clears Amanda Knox of murder . The Knox case was a pop culture obsession, and that's not going to stop now that the jury has decided to set her free. The race will be on for which media outlet interviews her first. More than 410 journalists had credentials to be at the courthouse in the tiny Umbrian hillside village of Perugia. Meanwhile, movie deals are in the works. Noted director Michael Winterbottom is interested in making a movie about Knox, with Oscar-winning actor Colin Firth starring as a journalist covering the trial, the Guardian reports. Tourism in Perugia apparently hasn't benefited from the notoriety, according to Italy's La Stampa newspaper. Several residents say they'd rather their village go back to being famous for its chocolate. On Monday, Knox's name didn't fall out of the top five trending topics on Google, a remarkable feat for today's constantly changing news cycle. Many media outlets including CNN.com are live blogging Monday, but it's impossible to keep up with specific posters on Twitter. It's better to try to get the plethora of individual tweets aggregated at http://www.twittbox.com/tag/amanda. For those who want more attention on Kercher, a roundup of tweets can be found searching the site's grid for her last name. BradSmith132 tweeted Monday afternoon, ""family: 'Meredith has been forgotten..."" 'and posted a link to the press conference in which Kercher's sister Stephanie told reporters: ""I think Meredith has been hugely forgotten in all of this."" It is social media, after all, which helped form the image of Amanda Knox as both an innocent American college student and a murdering temptress. In 2007, images on Knox's Facebook page were taken by media in the United States, Great Britain and elsewhere and used in stories. A private video which was posted on YouTube showing Knox laughing suddenly had a sinister feel, stories about the case note. The nickname Foxy Knoxy didn't come from the press; it was given to Knox by her schoolmates and was an innocent gesture made long before Kercher's death. But ""Foxy Knoxy"" repeated on the Web and in news stories, took on another meaning. It quickly began to feel synonymous with cunning and deception, with sexist overtones. In the past few years, many books have been written about Knox, including one titled ""Angel Face."" The latest book is ""The Fatal Gift of Beauty: The Trials of Amanda Knox"" by Nina Burleigh, who appeared Monday on CNN, to discuss the book. Before the ruling, Burleigh told CNN's Randi Kaye that she would be ""pretty surprised"" if Knox didn't go free because ""there isn't very much evidence"" in the case against her. Kaye asked Burleigh if Italian prosecutors had conducted a ""witch hunt"" in convicting Knox. Burleigh answered that the Italian police investigating Kercher's murder made mistakes and that heavy media attention after Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, who was also convicted, made it hard for the police to admit their mistakes and put their investigation back on a fair and correct path. The reason Knox was falsely convicted, Burleigh suggests, is because Knox is attractive. Everyone, Burleigh said, was ""riveted"" on ""this woman's face"" and not the facts of the crime or the case.","Knox's conviction is overturned; obsession with her bound to continue .

"(CNN) -- Former Super Bowl champion Brett Favre was back on the football field wearing his No. 4 jersey and throwing touchdowns in front of a cheering crowd. But while his fans from Green Bay, New York and Minnesota will be able to see him in action at 8 p.m. ET August 26 on NBC, he's not making yet another comeback to the NFL. Favre was on the field in Grant Park in downtown Chicago recently with other NFL greats such as Jerry Rice, Michael Irvin, Deion Sanders, Marcus Allen and Barry Sanders, playing in the annual EA Sports ""Madden"" Pigskin Pro Am flag football game. Favre said he was happy to be back on the gridiron in organized play. ""It's kind of exciting,"" Favre said. ""Obviously, it's different. Some of these guys I've played against and had some battles (with) over the years, but it's always nice to regroup and swap some old stories. It's always fun to play football."" Before the high-scoring affair, which included video game-style gold balls for 12-point scores and special bonuses for touchdowns thrown in certain spots in the end zone, the 11-time Pro Bowler wasn't promising a return to his glory days. ""I wouldn't expect too much, but we've got a lot of pride. No one's an athlete like Deion (Sanders); he's in a class by himself. The rest of us are just trying to show we still have a little bit of skills,"" he said. Favre was gunslinging against veteran quarterback Donovan McNabb, who's not ready for retirement yet. The annual event, which also featured celebrities such as Josh Henderson (""Dallas""), Terry Crews (""The Expendables 2""), Jesse Williams (""The Cabin in the Woods"") and singer Nick Jonas, helps drum up awareness for what gamers believe is the true start of the new NFL season -- the launch of EA Sports ""Madden NFL 13"" on August 28. ""I hope EA doesn't judge us off of today,"" Favre said jokingly. ""The kids I work with back at the high school back home, they were giving me a hard time. They said I'm real slow on Madden. I'm hoping to change that today."" Favre played video games back in the day such as Pong and Pac-man, but he says he's seen gaming come a long way since then. And he believes video games such as ""Madden"" can help aspiring quarterbacks. ""I think it's beneficial,"" Favre said. ""I also think that kids should get out and play, actually get out and do some physical stuff. I think Madden does teach them a lot about the sport. The fan base that video games have reached is amazing. The advancements that they've made are just unbelievable. I think in a lot of ways it's good, as long as the kids will get out and participate in some of the things that they're playing (onscreen)."" Favre was on the cover of ""Madden NFL 09"" back in 2008, which marked the 20th anniversary of the bestselling game franchise. Favre was originally seen in his Green Bay Packers uniform, but Electronic Arts changed subsequent cover art to reflect his New York Jets uniform after he came out of retirement to play again. ""I wasn't jinxed (being on the cover); I wouldn't say that,"" said Favre, referring to the ""Madden Curse"" that has seen more than its fair share of cover athletes suffer injuries or other mishaps the season after they appear. ""I consider it a huge honor."" Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson graces the cover of the new ""Madden NFL 13."" Electronic Arts says it has completely overhauled the game, making the most changes to the franchise in its history. One of the additions is a new online mode that allows players to take former greats all the way to the Hall of Fame. When asked what it's like to remain in the Madden franchise after retirement, Favre replied, ""It's nice to know I'm alive and kicking, let's just put it that way."" Another new feature that armchair quarterbacks will be happy with is that the new Madden game allows players to lead the receivers -- just like Favre did during his career. When it comes to technology and video games, Favre has no idea what's next for ""Madden NFL 14"" or beyond, he said. ""I don't even want to guess,"" Favre said. ""Just when you think you've seen it all, something else comes out. I think that as great as it is now, the advancements that have been made; I just think it's going to grow tremendously."" While Favre is from the original generation of arcade gamers, today's NFL players have grown up with controllers in their hands. ""They play video games all the time,"" said Hall of Famer Jerry Rice, who was also on the field with Favre. ""They play Madden more than they want to practice for the real football game. It just shows that it's a great game and that you can get consumed by it. You've got to be smart, make decisions, and do all of that stuff, but it's an unbelievable game."" One current player, and the coach of one of the two Pigskin Pro Am teams, said that he doesn't play as much any more. ""I used to be really big into Madden, but it's gotten kind of complicated now,"" the Chicago Bears' Lance Briggs said. ""When you're getting skunked by some of your friends, teammates and peers, it's not as fun as it used to be. So I watch and buy the game so that I can find out what my rating is. I'm either cursing out Madden for my rating being too low, or I'm semi-happy because they raised it up a little bit."" With real playbooks featured in Madden and constant input by John Madden himself, the 'x's and o's' of football are being taught to the next generation of gridiron greats. ""What I love about Madden is that it teaches kids like my sons Michael and Elijah how to read man in zone defenses at an early age,"" Hall of Famer Irvin said. ""I'm taking them on the field now and explaining things, and they're like, 'Yeah, I understand, Dad.' I say, 'That's right, from the video game.' It really is amazing how much the game teaches."" Technology is advancing to the point where the new Madden game on Xbox 360 will allow players to design custom calls on their tablet and import them into the game. Kinect owners will also be able to call audibles using their voice. ""In a few years, if the players in the video game aren't speaking and disagreeing with their coaches' calls and things like that, I would be really surprised,"" Super Bowl Champion Marcus Allen said. ""It has advanced that far. You can be a general manager, a coach or a player. You can do just about anything in the game."" And the Madden game still has enough pull to bring former NFL greats back to the field to play the sport they continue to love, even if these days they're only making those amazing highlight reel plays virtually.","Brett Favre will play in a ""Madden NFL 13"" Pigskin Pro Am flag football game August 26 .

"(CNN) -- Making a video game espousing the virtues of compassion, sacrifice and spirituality doesn't sound like a winner in today's battle-happy gaming environment. But 27 years ago, it was exactly the type of game that caught the imagination and spurred excitement in gamers. Developers at Bioware are hoping to catch that same virtual lightning in a bottle with ""Ultima Forever: Quest for the Avatar,"" the next chapter in the search for the Avatar of Britannia. In it, the hero must achieve the highest levels in eight virtues: Valor, Justice, Honor, Compassion, Honestly, Humility, Sacrifice and Spirituality. Through actions in the game, players strive to become a shining example of good for the population. The new title is based off ""Ultima IV,"" a computer game dating all the way to 1985. It is considered one of the most innovative games ever because of its divergence from the typical hack-and-slash approach. Lead designer Kate Flack said ""Ultima Forever"" hopes to bring back the appeal of being a good person in a video game. ""Games are a cultural artifact. They are affected by all the things around them,"" Flack said. The developers of ""Ultima IV"" ""were saying games can be about being a good person. At the time, it was in reaction to a backlash against the violence and things in video games. ""I think the parallel nowadays is that we are almost frightened of high fantasy. If it's not covered in blood, we don't believe it. I'm going to be as subversive as 'Ultima IV' was at the time."" ""Ultima Forever"" picks up 21 years after ""Ultima IV"" left off. Players can join up to three friends, as each works toward the goal of becoming the virtuous ""avatar"" of the land. While the graphics, look and feel have obviously been upgraded due to advancements in technology over the years, Flack said the concept still remains true to what it was nearly three decades ago. ""It's about mastering yourself, not mastering the world,"" she said. ""When (a non-player character) asks you a question ... you are forced to pause and ask yourself, 'What do I think is the right thing to do? Do I want to be kind, or do I want to be fair? What kind of person am I?' "" Rather than seeing how many creatures a player can kill or how much gold they can accumulate, Flack is more interested in getting inside the player's head. She says the game is almost like a personality test, giving players choices in the attempt to be a good person. How they get there is up to them. ""It's not like the game is going to grab you by the throat and make you make these choices. It is a slow drip-drip-drip. And maybe they will start to recognize these same choices in their real life and become better people,"" she said. As players progress, choices need to be made about questions that don't always have black-and-white answers. You find a bag of gold, which you know was stolen. Do you give it to the authorities (Honesty), donate it to the church (Spirituality) or hand it over to a starving family (Compassion)? Keeping it, which would be the likely choice in most of today's games, doesn't help you win this one. Bioware designer Alec Fisher-Lasky was a former Arlington County, Virginia, police officer before deciding to get into video games. He says the decisions made in ""Ultima Forever"" are similar to the types of decisions he had to make while on the force -- just at a much slower pace. ""When I found out they were working on the 'Ultima' series, I was really excited about it. It ties into what I had done as a police officer facing these kinds of moral decisions every day,"" Fisher-Lasky said. ""I wanted to give that experience to players. What do I do in this situation? What are the consequences? Why would I do this one thing over another?"" He said it was a challenge to make the player feel like their choices truly matter. If designers have done their job well, he thinks, people will care about their in-game decisions and really examine what kind of person outside of the game they are to make those choices. ""Ultima Forever"" will be released free-to-play for PCs and the iPad this year, with more character classes, content and platforms announced later. Flack said Bioware's experience with massively multiplayer online games allowed it to stuff a lot of detail into the mobile version without sacrificing its look on more powerful PCs. Fans are already reacting to the early news of a new ""Ultima"" game. Players who played ""IV"" in their youth have said on the ""Ultima Forever"" Facebook page that they are looking forward to sharing a similar experience with their kids. Diehard fans of the franchise are also very excited. ""'Ultima IV' is the game that all modern (role-playing games) flow from, but it's also kind of the impossible platonic ideal of a (computer role-playing game),"" said retro-gamer Ben Lesnick, 31, of Washington. ""It came at this incredibly special time in game development history where that kind of game could exist. Really, if 'Ultima Forever' is one-tenth as engrossing as 'Ultima IV,' then we'll have a pretty fantastic game that's worth playing on its own merits."" Flack said she tried to be respectful while working on this project. She understands the history and emotion tied into the franchise and didn't want to override people's memories of the game. ""It's not going to suit everybody,"" she said. ""And in fact, making a game that does suit everybody is going to let the fans down more, in a way. It's bland. It's insipid. It's the worst possible thing you can do with 'Ultima.' I'd rather try and make a statement than not."" Players may sign up now to be involved in the ""Ultima Forever"" beta test.","""Ultima Forever"" challenges players to gain virtue, not hack and slash .

"(CNN) -- With Sunday's release of the Nintendo 3DS XL handheld console, Nintendo is hoping that bigger is better. The new unit is essentially a big brother to the Nintendo 3DS released in the spring of 2011, but the gaming company has said it plans to continue to produce both types of consoles at least in the near future. The XL's main screen is 90% larger than its smaller counterpart, while the 3-D screen on the top half of the clamshell design is nearly the same size as the PS Vita front touch screen. In full 3-D mode, the resolution on the 3DS XL (800px x 320px) is still below the Vita's (960px x 544px). But you aren't going to be playing PS games on the 3DS XL or vice versa, so the visual appearance isn't going to be obvious. It also comes with a stronger battery (about 3.5 to 6 hours of charge using 3DS software) while not increasing the overall weight of the device. AC adapters are not included for Japanese or European versions but are included for U.S. and Australian distribution. Everything else pretty much remains the same between the XL and the regular version -- front and back cameras, 3-D screen at the top and touch screen at the bottom, circle pad and control pad on the left, buttons on the right. The pointing stylus is stored on the right hand side of the 3DS XL, rather than on the back with the 3DS. The preview 3DS XL unit I was using had a matte finish on the exterior instead of the shiny, glossy finish found on the 3DS. The larger hand-held console also comes with a 4GB SD card included, twice as big as the 2GB card with which the 3DS is outfitted. If you are thinking of going large, Nintendo has figured out a way to bring all your games with you. Data can be transferred from any DSi, DSi XL or 3DS console onto the 3DS XL system. Connection settings, photos, audio and purchased DSiWare can be shuttled to the new console using a Internet connection between the two systems. Be warned though. DSiWare save data cannot be transferred, so be prepared to play those games from scratch if you want to move them over. The larger screen and bigger controls make for easier game play, and the slightly increased weight is negligible. In fact, the hand-held device feels more stable and sturdy with its extra size. I haven't put it through an accidental ""drop test"" yet, but it seems like it could take a punch. The 3-D screen really hasn't changed, which means if it gave you a headache before, it probably will again. The longer battery life is very nice, especially for those who play on their way to school or work and have to put it away for a while once arriving. ""New Super Mario Bros. 2"" will be the featured game for the new hand-held, coming out on the same day in Japan and the United States, but not included with the console. The 3DS XL shows it off nicely with brilliant colors, fluid motion and responsive controls. It is, of course, a Mario game, which means lots of jumping and side-scrolling, but it all looks great on bigger screens. The Nintendo 3DS XL is everything you are used to in the Nintendo 3DS, but it is a larger, stronger package. The larger screens make it easier to see action and gives players a bit of finesse on the touch screen. Right now, the 3DS XL is not compatible with the Circle Pad Pro controller add-on, but Nintendo said they are planning on releasing one later this year. The Nintendo 3DS XL was released on August 19 in North America ($199.99) and will debut August 23 in Australia (A$249.95). It is available in Japan (18,900 yen) and Europe (199.99 euros). The highlight colors available at launch will be red and blue for North America; red, blue and silver for Europe and Australia; red, silver and white for Japan.","Nintendo released the bigger Nintendo 3DS XL on Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Dani Pedrosa appears set to extend his lead in the MotoGP series standings after clocking the fastest ever time at Montmelo in qualifying for the Catalunya Grand Prix. Pedrosa delighted his home fans by registering a time of one minute 40.893 seconds to claim pole position on a sweltering day near Barcelona. He was more than half-a-second quicker in his Honda than Yamaha teammates Cal Crutchlow and Jorge Lorenzo. ""It's difficult to do what I did especially when it is so hot,"" Pedrosa said. He added later: ""I have broken the record and I am very happy, although the objective was just to be on the front row. I had great feelings and I have gone out with a great lap."" Lorenzo, the reigning world champion and Pedrosa's fellow Spaniard, made up ground in the standings when he triumphed at Mugello in Italy earlier this month. Pedrosa's advantage shrunk to 12 points through five races. Despite being overtaken by Lorenzo at the first corner and not able to reclaim the lead, Pedrosa said he was happy with second place in what had been a ""difficult weekend."" His sizzling time Saturday came midway in qualifying, while Lorenzo recorded his fastest time at the end of qualifying like Crutchlow. He earlier had to switch bikes because of a clutch problem. ""We are on the first row, which is the most important thing for tomorrow,"" Lorenzo said. ""We have to keep improving, but it will be a completely different race tomorrow. ""It will be very hot and we will run slower than our best lap today."" Rookie Marc Marquez, another Spaniard, endured more disappointment when he finished sixth in his Honda. He slipped to third in the standings after a crash-filled weekend at Mugello. Valentino Rossi headed into Saturday in good spirits after leading the way in Friday's practice. But the seven-time world champion struggled in qualifying in his Yamaha, ending up more than a second behind Pedrosa in seventh.","Dani Pedrosa takes pole at Catalunya Grand Prix with fastest ever time at Montmelo .

"(CNN) -- A nurse is suing a hospital, claiming it agreed to a man's request that no African-Americans care for his baby. The lawsuit accuses managers at Hurley Medical Center in Flint of reassigning Tonya Battle, who has worked at the facility for 25 years, based on the color of her skin. The man approached Battle, while she was caring for his child in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, asking to speak to her supervisor, according to the complaint filed in January by Battle's attorney. She pointed the charge nurse in his direction. The man, who is not named in the filing, allegedly showed her a tattoo that may have been ""a swastika of some kind"" and told her that he didn't want African-Americans involved in his baby's care. The request, according to the lawsuit, made its way through management ranks, and was granted. Battle's manager called her at home to tell her she would be reassigned -- and why, the suit says. She was shocked and in disbelief, her attorney Julie Gafkay told CNN affiliate WNEM. ""She was very upset. She was very offended."" The hospital did not immediately respond late Friday to a CNN request for comment. A note made its way onto prominent spot on the baby's medical chart, according to the suit: ""Please, no African-American nurses to care for ... baby per dad's request."" The hospital's lawyer then objected to the decision, and the note was removed. The staff then told the father that they could no longer honor his request, according to the complaint. Even so, the lawsuits alleges, for more than a month no African-American nurses were assigned to care of the child. CNN's Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.","Tonya Battle worked for the hospital for 25 years .

"(CNN) -- Switching off your cellphone during a flight will soon be a thing of the past, according to aviation experts, who are tipping in-flight mobile connectivity to become a standard feature of air travel. Virgin Atlantic recently announced that passengers can make calls on their cellphones on the airline's Airbus A330 and Boeing 747 flying between London and New York. Call charges are similar to international roaming rates, and phones cannot be used during take off and landing. But Virgin Atlantic isn't alone -- more than 100 other aircraft are currently equipped to allow calls to be made in the air. The CEO of AeroMobile, which provides mobile connectivity to Emirates, Virgin Atlantic and Malaysian Airlines planes, said 1,000 aircraft would be fitted with the company's systems over the next three years. Lufthansa, Etihad, Turkish Airlines, Cathay Pacific, SAS and Gulf Air will all launch in-flight mobile offerings in coming months, he said. ""We believe this is going to be standard in most airlines,"" said Pal Bjordal, AeroMobile CEO. ""You will have connectivity in the air in the same way you have connectivity on the ground."" See also: Higher air fares, more mergers? Its rival OnAir operates on 16 airlines, and says it will extend to 24 by the end of the year. The AeroMobile system, which has been available on Emirates flights since 2008, allows for six calls to be made by passengers at any one time (soon to be upgraded to eight), and unlimited texts and data usage. For years, airlines have banned the use of cellphones citing their interference with onboard equipment. But Aeromobile's technology involves installing a small mobile base station on board to manage signal strength, and ensure calls do not interfere with flight systems. Bjordal said research suggested about 20 cellphones were inadvertently left switched on during any given flight, and claimed that the company's technology actually reduced the signal strength of those active cellphones. ""If you switch on a cellphone on board, and there's no network, it will gradually increase the power it's transmitting because it's trying to get hooked on a network which doesn't exist,"" he said. ""With our system on board, those cellphones will emit much less power."" The service is proving popular with passengers, with one passenger on Virgin Atlantic's fledgling service reportedly having sent 80 text messages during a single flight. Aviation analyst Vaughn Cordle of AirlineForecasts tipped mobile connectivity to become standard across the industry, and the price of access to drop. ""This is clearly what business travelers need. Many leisure passengers may not want to pay for it though,"" he said. ""But the technology is there, and if the airlines can get the volume up, they can most likely get the price down."" See also: Apps tackle travel expenses . But the technology will not be coming to all regions, at least in the short term. Despite being a leader in in-flight Wi-Fi, the United States bans the use of mobiles on flights, requiring that phones are switched off once they enter U.S. airspace. Mary Kirby, editor of Airline Passenger Experience magazine, said the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was currently looking into the technology, and predicted the restrictions would be lifted in a matter of years. ""Once this technology is deemed safe by the FAA, they're going to have to join the rest of the world,"" she said. ""Regulations are going to change whether people like it or not."" She said that despite the convenience of in-flight mobile connectivity, the impression she had gained from studies and social media reactions was that many Americans were opposed to calls being allowed on flights, because they were perceived as a nuisance. But in the years that in-flight calling had been allowed in other regions, she knew of no instances of air rage connected to phone use -- something she attributed to airlines establishing good protocols around call etiquette. ""You can't legislate manners from a regulatory standpoint,"" she said. ""Sooner or later, the arguments against mobile connectivity are going to fall away.""","Virgin Atlantic has introduced in-flight calls on transatlantic flights .

Today's launch is in line with speculation among aviation professionals that Airbus is planning to show off its new plane at the upcoming Paris Air Show, a rumor the company has yet to confirm. The A350 XWB is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head with rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777s. ""XWB"" means ""extra wide body."" There are three members in the A350 family: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers respectively, in three-class seating. The plane was unveiled last month at Airbus HQ in Toulouse, France. Today's flight is the latest milestone in what has been a turbulent production history for the A350 program, which was first announced in 2006.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities vowed Tuesday to use the international police agency Interpol to arrest former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in connection with the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. ""The government is moving for his (Musharraf's) red notice,"" Interior Minister Rehman Malik said, referring to the Interpol's international arrest warrant. ""We will get him through Interpol to Pakistan."" Malik made the announcement as part of a progress report of the four-year-long assassination probe that was presented to provincial lawmakers Tuesday in Bhutto's home province of Sindh. The briefing lasted several hours and was broadcast live on Pakistani TV. Bhutto was assassinated in a gun-suicide attack in December 2007, shortly after she came back to Pakistan from self imposed exile to take part in the 2008 general elections. Malik and the head of the investigation team said former Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud plotted the assassination and paid the equivalent of about $4,500 to a network of Islamist militants to carry out the killing. Using a Power Point presentation, pictures and video to outline the evidence they had gathered, authorities said Mehsud had Bhutto killed because she supported the west's war against Islamist militants. Investigators said they collected much of their evidence from the accused plotters' cell phone records before and after the killing. Last November a Pakistani court charged five alleged Islamist militants with aiding the suicide attacker and two senior police officers for failing to provide adequate security. Musharraf has also been accused of failing to protect Bhutto. In February 2011 a judge issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf after he didn't show up to court for questioning. Musharraf has been in self-imposed exile ever since he left Paksitan in 2008. Last August authorities confiscated his property in Pakistan and froze his bank account. The former military ruler has denied having anything to do with Bhutto's killing. In Tuesday's briefing Malik and investigators said Musharraf rejected Bhutto's request to use a western private security contractor for protection when she returned to Pakistan. They suggested Musharraf intentionally left Bhutto vulnerable because he felt politically threatened by her return. ""It was the duty of the government to provide the prime minister with protection,"" Malik yelled at one point. ""Why did you not give security? What was the problem?"" Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Musharraf was president when Bhutto was assassinated .

"Cologne, Germany (CNN) -- More than 270,000 gamers from throughout Europe and beyond have converged in the beautiful city of Cologne for the annual Gamescom video game festival. The show, which is more than twice as large as San Diego Comic-Con, offers attendees the first hands-on opportunities with some of the biggest games coming this fall and later. Activision is using one of the 10 massive halls at the Cologne Convention Center to allow gamers to play through four multiplayer maps from Treyarch's ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II."" Fans wait in line for hours for the chance to experience the games they likely already ordered for this Christmas. Gamescom is growing at a rapid pace. More than 600 exhibitors from 40 countries are displaying their games -- 20% more exhibitors than two years ago and 40% more countries connecting with the European gaming audience. While there are literally hundreds of games playable at the festival, the following five games made their world premieres this week and are worth checking out when they hit a console near you over the coming year. Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel (Electronic Arts/Visceral Games, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, March 2013) Electronic Arts knows that two shooters are better than one. ""Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel"" is the third game in the bestselling franchise that sends a pair of heavily armed private military operators south of the border on a deadly mission. With plenty of drug cartel henchmen to go around, this co-op game has been designed from the ground up for two players to collaborate as they navigate a serpentine plot of danger and corruption. This game introduces plenty of weapons to equip and extensive customization options for soldiers Alpha and Bravo, putting a personal stamp on the action. Visceral Games promises the experience will put players in the middle of a blockbuster Hollywood movie experience. And given the nontraditional Mexican setting, this game should serve as a nice diversion from the crowded shooter genre. Deadpool (Activision/High Moon Studios, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, 2013) Although he's appeared in video games like ""Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2"" and ""Marvel vs. Capcom 3"" before, the comic book antihero Deadpool has never stood on his own. Until now. For those not familiar with the wise-cracking ""Merc with the Mouth,"" Deadpool is about to leave a very lasting impression. High Moon Studios, which has done a great job with the original Transformers games, is delivering a Mature-rated adventure that features the brilliant voice acting of Nolan North. The game allows players to slice and dice through enemies or go in guns blazing (with some very big guns). All the while, Deadpool is in on the fact that he's starring in a game -- even breaking the fourth wall regularly. The game also highlights the character's insanity by allowing players to hear the multiple voices in his head. Which one you follow is completely up to you, but expect a funny, gory ride that's nothing like other comic book games. Puppeteer (Sony Computer Europe/Japan Studio, PlayStation 3, 2013) ""Puppeteer"" looks unlike any other game you've seen. This original action game takes place within a magical puppet theater. Rather than sending the hero, who in this case is a boy named Kutaro who's been transformed into a puppet, all of the action takes place on the same stage. In other words, the game world revolves around the character. This makes for a very unique world. Also adding to the gameplay is an assortment of special heads that Kutaro, who's headless, can pick up and use, along with his weapon, a magical pair of scissors. Although this looks like a kids' game, it's actually very challenging. This boy-turned-puppet could be the next Pinnochio. Remember Me (Capcom/Dontnod, PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, 2013) Capcom has been at the forefront of introducing gamers to strong female protagonists, which is one reason the ""Resident Evil"" franchise has succeeded both in game and movie form. The Japanese game publisher has debuted a brand new heroine, Nilin, the star of the new science-fiction action game ""Remember Me"" from Paris development studio Dontme. Nilin is not your typical action hero. Sure, she's well-trained in the martial arts, and looks good in heels. But she can also hack into people's minds and steal or alter their memories. The game opens with Nilin's own memory erased, setting her off on a quest to reclaim her identity that will ultimately change the world. And you can expect plenty of futuristic fighting action along the way. Tearaway (Sony Computer Entertainment/Media Molecule, PlayStation Vita) Media Molecule, the developer behind Sony's cross-platform franchise ""LittleBigPlanet,"" is at it again with this interactive world made completely of paper. ""Tearaway"" is a new adventure game that was designed to allow players to become part of the universe. Using the PS Vita's rear touch pad, players can see their hand enter the game world. Or they can shake the device and see the world crumble, or even turn upside down. Players take control of Iota, a messenger from a paper dimension whose envelope head contains an urgent message that he must deliver to you. Each message inside the envelope is different, providing a unique experience for the gamer, who becomes part of the experience. As the godlike player, it's up to you to help Iota get that message to you. The struggling PS Vita needs more killer apps like this, which could lure more gamers to this portable player.","More than 270,000 people are attending Gamescom in Cologne, Germany .

"(CNN) -- The next time you see a motorist obliviously straddling two lanes, don't fault bad driving, but genetics. In a study published recently in the journal Cerebral Cortex, researcher Steven Cramer found that people with a certain gene variant performed more than 30 percent worse on a driving test than people without it. The study by Cramer, a neurology professor at the University of California Irvine, might also help explain why there are so many bad drivers on U.S. highways: About 30 percent of Americans have the variant. Ordinarily, when a person performs a task, a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is secreted to the area of the brain that is associated with that activity. The protein helps facilitate communication among brain cells and helps retain memory. However in people who have the gene variation that Cramer studied, BDNF secretion is limited. ""These people make more errors from the get-go, and they forget more of what they learned after time away,"" Cramer said in a statement. Cramer and his team of researchers set out to find how the variant affected driving. They recruited 29 people to drive 15 laps on a simulated course with difficult curves and turns. Twenty-two of the participants did not have the gene variant; seven did. The researchers wanted to see how effectively the participants learned to navigate the twists and turns in each subsequent lap. Four days later, they repeated the test. The participants with the variant did worse both times. They also retained less the second go-round. ""I'd be curious to know the genetics of people who get into car crashes,"" Cramer said. ""I wonder if the accident rate is higher for drivers with the variant."" Unfortunately, a test to determine whether someone has the gene variant is not commercially available.","Study finds bad driving may have genetic basis .

"(CNN) -- How could they not have known they were asking for trouble? In the past few years, Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana had an affair with the staff member who had helped him produce a video promoting sexual abstinence. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford flew to Argentina for an extramarital tryst, instructing his staff to tell the press he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. Sen. John Edwards tried to pass off the daughter he fathered as the love child of one of his aides. And now a stockpile of sexy e-mails has simultaneously brought down the head of the CIA and delayed the nomination of the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan to head NATO. Many Americans believe these scandals reflect a precipitous decline in respect for marital fidelity. If anything, however, such respect has never been higher. In a 2006 poll by the Pew Research Center, 88% of Americans said adultery was immoral -- a higher number than for any other of 10 unsavory behaviors they were asked about. According to a 2009 Gallup Poll, only 6% of Americans believe extramarital sex is morally acceptable. Tolerance for male adultery is certainly at a new low. In letters and diaries written during the Colonial and Revolutionary eras, men routinely bragged about their extramarital conquests -- even to the brothers and fathers of their own wives! In the 1850s, it is estimated that New York City had one prostitute for every 64 men, while the mayors of Savannah, Georgia, and Norfolk, Virginia, put the numbers of prostitutes in their cities at one for every 39 and 26 men, respectively. As late as 1930, Somserset Maugham's play, ""The Constant Wife,"" was considered shocking because the heroine confronted her husband about his affair instead of simply ignoring it, as most women in polite circles did. Opinion: OK to flirt your way to the top? President Thomas Jefferson fathered a child by his mistress. So did Warren G. Harding, who also carried on an affair with the wife of a family friend. Gen. Dwight Eisenhower had a long-term relationship with the woman who was his driver in England during World War II. CIA Director Allen Dulles, according to his own sister, had ""at least a hundred"" affairs, including one with the queen of Greece. President John F. Kennedy's affairs and one-night stands may have numbered even more. But times have changed. The press and political insiders no longer turn a blind eye. So why do men continue in behaviors that now carry so much risk of exposure and punishment? Part of it is probably a sense of entitlement. Powerful men have ""people"" to take care of the mundane details of life. They are briefed on the names and backgrounds of whomever they meet, told when it's time to leave, and extricated from awkward encounters. Someone else keeps track of appointments, money and time, fetches whatever they have forgotten at home, makes excuses when they change plans, and picks up after them when they leave a room. No wonder they get careless about picking up after their indiscretions as well. But why do equally powerful women so seldom engage in such risky affairs? Some believe that the very qualities that make men successful also make them vulnerable. Powerful men are rewarded for being risk takers, a political consultant once told me, whereas women feel more need to control their emotions and impulses if they are to succeed. There is some truth to this. But I think the answer is more complex, and in some ways sadder. After all, these men don't necessarily take such risks in other areas where emotions run strong. Political leaders calibrate their positions, moral convictions and emotional impulses with a degree of calculation that would put Machiavelli to shame. Many even shove aside their most deeply held beliefs at the faintest hint that these might expose them to risk. As someone who has studied the evolution of love, sexuality, and marriage over the centuries, I believe the frequency of these sexual scandals reflects the fact that many men and women have still not fully incorporated into their daily emotional lives the new ideals about gender equity and mutuality that have emerged in the past 40 years. Opinion: Media, stop stoking Petraeus sex saga . Today many -- perhaps most -- men sincerely want to marry women who are partners rather than subordinates. And women now want careers of their own, whether paid or unpaid, rather than defining themselves entirely through a husband's achievements. Yet many of our romantic fantasies and cues for sexual arousal are still shaped by the unequal division of roles, power, resources and prescribed character traits that prevailed from the early 19th century up through the 1960s. Before industrialization moved production outside the household unit, husbands and wives were partners in home-based production, equally responsible for provisioning the household and dealing with the details of daily life. But the experiences and emotions of men and women diverged as men began to earn money outside the home while women concentrated on meeting family needs. Gradually, women came to see success, prosperity and status as only attainable through the achievements of men, while men became accustomed to receiving love and admiration for possessing skills, resources, and knowledge to which women did not have access. Women began to equate admiration with attraction; men began to equate being looked up to with being sexually potent. For 150 years, romance novels and the mass media have reinforced this confusion. Opinion: Lessons from Petraeus sex scandal . I think this pattern helps explain why so few women are tempted by the adoration of younger acolytes but often fall for superiors or mentors, while many otherwise happily married men become so intoxicated by admiration that they risk their careers and families for its temporary rush. President Bill Clinton couldn't resist the hero-worship of a White House intern. Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich carried on an affair with an admiring female aide while trying to impeach Clinton for lying about a similar indiscretion. Presidential candidate John Edwards fell for the woman who followed him around with an adoring camera as well as an adoring gaze. Rep. Anthony Wiener apparently thought any woman who admired his political views would be turned on by an unsolicited picture of his crotch. And like his CIA predecessor Allen Dulles, whose affair with journalist Mary Bancroft was based on the excitement of what she described as her ""overwhelming admiration,"" David Petraeus bonded with his own worshipful biographer. Some of the men involved in these scandals are clearly pigs. Some of the women are opportunists. But most are otherwise decent people who have not yet been able to adjust 200 years of conditioned sexual responses to our evolving emotional and intellectual preferences. The challenge facing modern couples -- not just the men and women in these scandals -- is to root out our old psychological habits and incorporate our new expectations of love and marriage into our deepest emotional core. We will know we have made progress when equality and friendship become more sexy than adoration and uncertainty. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephanie Coontz.","Stephanie Coontz: Male politicians repeatedly step into illicit sex situations. Why?
She says at one time they were encouraged. Now infidelity scorned, but old habits persist .
She says in an unequal history, men learned to expect adoration; women to admire men's power .
Coontz: Retro pattern persists, draws men to young adoring women, women to older men ."
"(Budget Travel) -- Swimming is almost beside the point at these 15 pools found at gorgeous, unexpected properties around the world. Hotel: Hotel Chocolat, Soufrière, St. Lucia . Why it's cool: The guest-only infinity pool at this five-month-old property is lined with black quartz tiles, a stroke of genius on the part of Hotel Chocolat's upscale English chocolatier owners; the resulting dark color reflects the iconic Pitons and surrounding rain forest like an overflowing mirror. Ten lounge chairs line the poolside pine deck, pretty much assuring time by the pool for every guest of the 14 cottages and cabins. From your lounge, you can request poolside service of chocolaty treats, like a Bellini infused with fresh cacao pulp from the company's nearby groves. Budget Travel: See 24 more photos of these amazing pools . Hotel: Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea, Hawaii . Why it's cool: Spectacular pools are a dime a dozen in Wailea, the southwestern shore of Maui with prime beach real estate, known for glamorous resorts. So it's saying something that the Four Seasons has one that really stands out. The $9 million infinity-edge pool, which opened in July 2009, seems to roll out into Wailea Bay 53 feet below, while underwater speakers play contemporary Hawaiian tunes. Open only to guests who are 21 plus, this 120-foot-long saltwater pool has four inlets that perpetually bubble, and its swim-up bar delivers thirst-quenching treats like vodka mojitos. In the early evening, the glass mosaic tiles on the bottom of the pool glitter in the flames cast by surrounding fire bowls and tiki torches. Hotel: Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, Cap d'Antibes, France . Why it's cool: When this hotel reopened in April 2011 on the Côte d'Azur after a $64 million renovation, it unveiled a new, guest-only outdoor pool, which had been dynamited out of the adjacent cliff face. From their perch here, 13 feet above the Mediterranean, guests swim in seawater heated to a temperate 82°F, and have a perfect view over the infinity edge of fellow visitors tying their yachts off on the hotel's private landing stage. If for some reason one tires of ordering poolside cocktails from the two roving attendants, a nearby set of trapezes hangs over the sea (near the ocean-diving boards, of course) for an adventurous dip in the Med. Budget Travel: 10 gorgeous pools you won't believe are public . Hotel: Amangiri, Canyon Point, Utah . Why it's cool: Amangiri, in Sanskrit, means ""peaceful mountain"" -- and the most peaceful of those found here may be the 80-foot-high, Jurassic-period sandstone escarpment that rises from the middle of the resort's U-shaped pool. Guests can take in panoramic views of Utah's dramatic mesas from either the 84-degree water or one of the surrounding lounges and king-size daybeds. Order a prickly-pear margarita to enhance the desert flavor during the day, or test the tranquil waters anytime of night you please: The pool is open 24 hours. Hotel: Qasr Al Sarab, Abu Dhabi . Why it's cool: No, it's not a mirage. The Qasr Al Sarab resort, which opened in November 2009, materializes in the middle of the tall, curling dunes of the Liwa Desert. It's a spectacular backdrop for the resort's amoeba-shaped pool that rivals a football field in sheer size. Guests often stand in the shallow end of the curvy oasis, next to the bar, and observe the pool butlers bringing cold towels, iced fruit popsicles, and other treats to sun-worshippers on the 140 chaise lounges that line the sandstone patio. During the day, the pool is kept at a refreshing 70°F. Linger until 9 p.m., when lights glimmer along the pool's edges and the stars come out over the date-palm trees. Hotel: Park Hyatt Tokyo . Why it's cool: Sure, Bill Murray took a dip here in ""Lost in Translation,"" but it's the view from this sleek, 47th-floor swimming pool that's truly remarkable: Floor-to-ceiling windows frame jaw-dropping vistas of Tokyo, and even venerable Mount Fuji, while the steel-and-glass pyramid-shaped ceiling floods the pool with natural light. The 65-foot-long, four-lane pool is striking at night, too, when the city's skyscrapers light up. Budget Travel: 12 restaurants with spectacular views . Hotel: San Alfonso del Mar, Algarrobo, Chile . Why it's cool: You can take small sailboats out on this saltwater pool that Guinness World Records calls the largest in the world. At two-thirds of a mile in length, the massive stretch of water has room for several man-made sand beaches. For nighttime swimming, head to the temperature-controlled beach inside the pool's centrally located glass pyramid -- the water and the sand are heated. Hotel: Hotel Caruso Belvedere, Ravello, Italy . Why it's cool: The Hotel Caruso Belvedere is set at the highest point in the sun-splashed Amalfi Coast town of Ravello, so the open-air infinity pool offers unobstructed, panoramic views of one of the world's most dramatic coastlines -- and the sea beyond. It doesn't hurt that the pool itself is flanked by 11th-century Roman ruins. Hotel: Umaid Bhawan Palace, Jodhpur, India . Why it's cool: In a massive, 347-room palace overlooking the Blue City of Jodhpur in the Indian state of Rajasthan, this serene, temperature-controlled swimming basin takes advantage of natural candlelight -- with rose petals sometimes strewn on the surface. The hotel is run by the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, which shares the property with the palace's owner, the Maharaja of Jodhpur -- who has been known to swim laps with the guests from time to time. Hotel: Viceroy Miami . Why it's cool: In a city loaded with cool pools, the pool at the Viceroy stands out. The two-acre pool deck -- with Japanese blueberry trees and swanky chaise lounges and beds -- features three types of pools: an 80-person hot tub, a wading pool, and a football-field-size swimming pool. Perhaps coolest of all, it's 15 floors above the street, with sweeping views of downtown Miami and glimpses of Biscayne Bay in the distance. Budget Travel: 26 stunning Ireland photos . Hotel: InterContinental Hong Kong . Why it's cool: Set on the third floor of the InterContinental Hong Kong, the hotel's three pools -- two hot and one cold, but all with underwater music piped in -- give the almost unnerving illusion that you're floating in Victoria Harbor. After your swim, park yourself in one of the poolside cabanas and gaze out at Hong Kong's skyline. Hotel: Golden Nugget, Las Vegas . Why it's cool: You'll swim with five species of sharks (16 sharks in all) at the Nugget's $30 million pool complex. The Tank, as it's called, houses a three-story waterslide, waterfalls, and the pool's pièce de resistance, the 200,000-gallon shark tank. You're in more danger at the Golden Nugget's roulette wheel: The sharks, stingrays, massive Queensland grouper, and silvery jack crevalle are separated from the swimming pool by a six-inch clear acrylic wall. Hotel: Quincy Hotel, Singapore . Why it's cool: This glass-enclosed pool is cantilevered from the 12th floor of the futuristic-looking Quincy Hotel, suspending swimmers high above the passing cars and pedestrians at street level. At night, special lighting effects make the pool appear to glow. Bask and swim for a bit, then retire to one of the rattan chairs at poolside for a nap. Hotel: Al Bustan Palace InterContinental Muscat, Muscat, Oman . Why it's cool: After an extensive 18-month renovation, this InterContinental property in Oman reopened with a major pool upgrade -- which the roving pool butlers (you heard us) are more than happy to tell you about, after refreshing your rose-scented spritzer. The spacious, 164-foot-long infinity pool is flanked by shady, palm-studded islands. The water is temperature controlled, so it's always an oasis-like 84 degrees. Hotel: Anantara Bophut Resort & Spa, Koh Samui, Thailand . Why it's cool: You look straight out into the Gulf of Thailand from the 98-foot-long infinity pool at this stylish resort on the island of Samui, Thailand. If the views aren't soothing enough, order a stiff drink at the swim-up bar and laugh it off with the comical, spitting monkey statues along the pool's perimeter.

"(CNN) -- An Australian man and his daughter have created a furor after going on television to admit an incestuous relationship which has produced two children. John Deaves and his daughter Jenny pictured in the 60 Minutes interview. John Deaves, 61, appeared on the 60 Minutes show with daughter Jenny, 39, and their child -- nine-month-old Celeste, Melbourne's The Age newspaper reported. Last month Judge Steven Millsteed banned the couple from having sex with each other, but released them on a three-year, $460 good behavior bond. Court transcripts also revealed their first child died in 2001 from a congenital heart disorder. The couple told 60 Minutes that they fell in love in 2000 when they ""discovered each other later in life."" Deaves had left the family home when Jenny was a baby, and did not see her again for 30 years. What do you think of the couple's relationship? However, the Age reported Deaves' former wife, Dorothy, disputed their claim that they were virtual strangers when they fell in love. ""They were in contact all the time,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- It's been arguably the biggest sports-debate question of the past month: Who would win in a head-to-head matchup between the original 1992 Olympic basketball ""Dream Team"" and the 2012 edition that just won gold in London? Larry, Magic and Michael, or Kobe, KD and LeBron? We'll never know, right? Maybe not. 2K Sports is ready to let the fans decide by including both superstar teams in their upcoming basketball video game, ""NBA 2K13."" The fantasy matchup, in which gamers can match both teams in a virtual showdown for the ages, is the result of a partnership with USA Basketball, the organization that represents the U.S. in world basketball events. The public debate over which team is better started before the London games when the Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant said he thought he and his teammates could beat the 1992 squad. ""Well, just from a basketball standpoint, they obviously have a lot more size than we do,"" Bryant told reporters after a pre-Olympics practice. ""We have just a bunch of young racehorses, guys that are eager to compete. It'd be a tough one, but I think we'd pull it out."" ""In one game, we can beat them. No question about it."" The resulting back-and-forth between members from both teams sparked an idea from ""NBA 2K13"" executive producer Jay-Z. Why not let the fans interact, play the game, and decide who is the better team? ""In 'NBA 2K13,' we're giving fans the opportunity to play as two of the best teams ever assembled in sporting history, literally putting the debate right into their hands,"" Jay-Z said in a statement. The original Dream Team is considered one of the most dynamic sports teams ever assembled. Eleven Hall of Fame players, including Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, David Robinson, Magic Johnson and Charles Barkley, came together to crush international opponents and win Olympic gold in Barcelona, Spain. This year's Olympic team featured many likely future Hall of Famers, including Bryant, LeBron James and Kevin Durant. Not surprisingly, the famously competitive Jordan believes his team would triumph over the 2012 bunch. In an interview this week, he said playing both teams in ""NBA 2K13"" is likely to start more arguments than finish them. ""When you stack all the stats, which is in some ways how the game is going to be viewed and discussed, our stats are going to be a lot better than their stats,"" Jordan said in a conference call with reporters. ""I think it's going to start debates. I don't think it's going to end any. The only way it would end is for us to lace 'em back up and play them."" Jordan thinks ""NBA 2K13"" gamers will get a good appreciation of the different styles of play over the two eras. The third-leading scorer in NBA history also offered some advice to fans playing as the Dream Team in the new video game. ""If you want to score inside, you have to throw it to Charles (Barkley) or Karl (Malone),"" Jordan said. ""If you want to throw it to the perimeter, Larry (Bird) or Chris Mullin can set up. ""Myself, I'm pretty sure I can score in any environment."" Jordan also believes the inclusion of the all-star teams will give international gamers a chance to experience American-style hoops firsthand. ""With the USA Basketball portion (of ""NBA 2K13""), you are going to have a lot of Europeans being able to play the Dream Team fantasy. ... I think that's going to be fun.""

"(CNN) -- Thousands of travelers face disruption and canceled flights Wednesday as French air traffic controllers go on strike for a second day over a European Union plan to update rules governing European airspace. About half the scheduled flights at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport have been canceled because of the strike, the airport said. There are usually about 600 flights a day from the airport at this time of year, it said. Short and medium-haul flights are those most affected for the 200 airlines that operate out of the airport. About 2,000 flights across Europe were canceled Tuesday, the first day of the strike, the air traffic agency Eurocontrol said. The strike has led to the cancellation of 27 flights Wednesday from London's Heathrow Airport -- 14 arriving and 13 departing, the airport said. Most of the flights were going either to or from Charles De Gaulle, Toulouse and Marseille airports, it said. EasyJet said 66 flights to or from the United Kingdom had been canceled Wednesday. ""These are largely contained to France and Spain although other destinations may be affected"" by the resulting delays, it said in a statement. Travelers are encouraged to check with EasyJet for updates, particularly if they are flying to or from France, Spain and Portugal. ""EasyJet is contacting customers affected by cancellations, and those passengers will be entitled to a refund or to book an alternative flight,"" the airline said. A spokeswoman for Charles de Gaulle Airport said it hopes to return to normal service Thursday when the strike is due to end. The European Transport Workers' Federation said air traffic workers in 11 European countries were taking action Wednesday to voice their opposition to plans involving a single European airspace. Air traffic controllers are on strike only in France and Hungary, however, with other action including gatherings and walkouts, said Francois Ballestero, the union's political secretary. The union's action follows the European Commission's adoption Tuesday of a new package on the ""Single European Sky,"" it said. It believes the package, known as SES2+, would jeopardize jobs and put cost savings and competitiveness ahead of safety considerations. The European Commission says EU rules on air traffic management must be updated to boost performance and improve oversight, otherwise predicted increases in air traffic will cause major delays. It said the new rules would mean lower costs for airlines and more direct routes, which would help keep ticket prices down for travelers, while helping airlines return to profit. Shorter routes and fewer delays would also mean lower greenhouse-gas emissions, it said. The Single European Sky program was first launched in 2004 to improve coordination between the 27 member states' air traffic authorities and cut delays.","NEW: European Transport Workers' Federation says plans put cost-cutting ahead of jobs .

"NEW YORK CITY (CNN) -- It's shaping up to be a good year for the Detroit Lions and they haven't even kicked off the regular season yet. Sixth-seeded wide receiver Calvin Johnson came out of nowhere to beat top-seeded Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton in the fan vote for who would grace the cover of EA Sports' ""Madden NFL '1."" On top of that, former Lions running back Barry Sanders, who appeared with Coach John Madden on the front of Madden NFL 2000, is on the cover of EA Sports ""NCAA Football 13"" this year, behind fellow Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III. Johnson appeared in a live one-hour ESPN ""SportsNation"" TV show in the streets of Manhattan, while fans voted online to make the final push. His first duty as cover athlete was to shoot the cover, which was done on location in the Big Apple right after the live broadcast in front of hundreds of NFL fans (many of whom were in town for the NFL Draft). Being a cover model isn't all that's going Johnson's way this year. The Lions signed the wide receiver to an eight-year, $132 million extension just before he was awarded the Madden cover. Johnson has also been helping Madden experience record sales since the game launched on August 28 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii and PS Vita. The game sold nearly 1 million copies in its first 24 hours and sales are up 7% over last year's game, which featured Peyton Hillis on the cover. With the Wii U version of ""Madden NFL 13"" coming this fall, Johnson took some time to talk about his own gaming background off the gridiron. CNN: What games did you play growing up? Johnson: Growing up I was a big fan of the Nintendo 64 and those games, but I always played Madden. I've always been a Madden fan, and an EA fan, period. CNN: What was the first Madden game that you recall playing? Johnson: The first one I recall playing. I can't even recall that. I don't even know who was on the cover, and this was back in early 2000s. CNN: What are your thoughts on how far the game itself has evolved over the years since you started playing? Johnson: It's pretty cool. Now the fans vote. Back in the day, EA used to pick, but to know that 20 million fans vote and that they voted for me, it's an honor. It's very humbling. CNN: What's your favorite Madden video game memory? Johnson: My favorite Madden memory would probably be taking another kick-off return to house, because I've only done that one time in the game. It's very hard to do. That's the Madden with Troy Polamalu and Larry Fitzgerald on the cover in 2010. CNN: As a player, how realistic is the game now compared to playing out there on the field? Johnson: It's pretty crazy what they're doing with the game nowadays. I heard that they now have the ability for you to traject where the ball is going to go as a quarterback, so you could put it in more specific places for your receiver to catch it and lead the receiver. It's pretty crazy how it's evolving. CNN: Do you have more control with the receiver, too, in getting the ball? Johnson: It's crazy. I heard they've got hundreds of new animations for the receivers as well. It's definitely turned into a passing league, and it's turned into a passing video game. CNN: How popular is Madden among some of the NFL players on your team? Do you guys compete against each other and go online? Johnson: I play. We play online, but definitely during camp time. Guys, when we're at camp, they have a suite at the hotel for us if we want to get in there and play, or we play it in our own facility. CNN: What kind of impact do you think that being on the cover of the game will be for your player rating? Johnson: I actually just got off the phone with somebody, and they were saying that my rating should definitely be a 99, especially since I'm on the cover. CNN: Where do you put this as far as accomplishments in the NFL, being on the cover of Madden? Johnson: When I was a kid looking up to all the greats that were on the covers coming up, and then to be one of those guys on the cover, it's surreal. Knowing that millions of fans took part in the campaign, and to be the one they selected to appear on the cover of the game they play every day is an honor. To make it this far, and to beat out guys like Cam and Aaron Rodgers, a Super Bowl-winning quarterback, it's surreal to say the least. Much love to all the fans who voted for me. CNN: When did you realize how big Madden has become, evolving from game to pop culture phenomenon? Johnson: I saw how big it was yesterday. The stage that they set up in Times Square, and what they're able to do just because of this game. The game, obviously, has this tremendous impact on the Madden community. I wanted to be in the Madden fraternity myself. Like I said, it's an honor. CNN: What are your thoughts on the ""Madden Curse"" that has impacted a lot of previous cover athletes? Johnson: Yeah, that's superstition. That's one thing about me; I'm definitely not superstitious. CNN: What kind of technology do you use nowadays? What kind of gadgets do you use and play with? Johnson: I'm definitely a gadget guy. I always have all my Mac items, so I can sync it up real fast. You've got the iCloud and the new Xbox. I'll be on Xbox Live. With all the remote controls that control everything in the house, I'm definitely a gadget guy. CNN: What games do you play now besides Madden? Johnson: Really just Madden, FIFA, and a little Call of Duty. CNN: Any online games? Johnson: Yeah, I do all that online. CNN: How often do you play video games, and what's your schedule like during the off-season versus during the season? Johnson: During the off-season I have a lot of free time on my hands, whether it be training, spending time with your family, travel, or whatever it may be. During the season, it's pretty tough. You don't really have as much time to play the games, because you're tired and you've got to work.","Calvin Johnson is the cover model for ""Madden NFL 13""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Arizona have arrested three employees of a sheriff's office known for its tough stand on illegal immigration, accusing them of aiding human traffickers and drug smugglers. A sheriff's deputy and two detention officers were among 12 people arrested in an operation Tuesday, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said. ""That a deputy sheriff would provide information and associate with these drug and human traffickers is despicable,"" Arpaio told reporters. Deputy Alfredo Navarrette, who had been a member of a unit targeting human smuggling, faces felony charges connected to human smuggling, money laundering and participating in a crime syndicate, Arpaio said. ""He admitted actually going to our command centers to obtain information to pass on to the drug traffickers and the smugglers,"" Arpaio said, noting that authorities found two illegal immigrants in Navarrette's home when they served a search warrant Tuesday morning. The two detention officers who were arrested -- Sylvia Najera and Marcella Hernandez -- are accused of money laundering and having connections with drug-trafficking organizations. Hernandez had more than $16,000 in her purse when she was taken into custody, Arpaio said. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery praised the sheriff's office for its handling of the matter and pledged to hold the officers accountable. ""This wasn't swept under the rug. The cooperation that we received from the sheriff's office was complete and forthright,"" he told reporters. ""No one's above the law, and apparently no one is beyond the reach of drug-trafficking organizations in Mexico,"" he added. Arpaio drew national attention and earned the nickname of ""America's toughest sheriff"" for his stance on illegal immigration, among other things. Many of his prisoners are housed in tents and forced to wear pink underwear, and he once boasted of feeding them on less than a dollar a day per prisoner. He faces a U.S. Justice Department investigation into whether his policies cracking down on illegal immigrants discriminate against Hispanics. Earlier this month critics called for his resignation after an audit found he used nearly $100 million designated for jail funds to pay deputies' salaries. Some activists said Tuesday's arrests are part of a public-relations ploy to clean up the sheriff's office image in the wake of such accusations. ""Now he's saying that he's cleaning out his department, but frankly, these problems have always existed inside the agency,"" human rights activist Lydia Guzman told CNN affiliate KTVW.","A deputy who was part of a unit targeting human smuggling is accused .

"(CNN) -- Protected rainforests, Maya ruins, Caribbean beaches and the longest barrier reef in the western hemisphere. Add English as the official language and the widely accepted U.S. dollar, and you can get a great vacation on easy mode in Belize. Still, with so much to do, it can become a lot of work to fit it all in. Travelzoo editor Andrew Young recommends taking on just a little bit of this country in the heart of Central America at a time, and offers this list of his five top spots to get you started. The Blue Hole . Just off the coast of Belize lies an underwater paradise for novice snorkelers and veteran divers. The Blue Hole is world-renowned as an open-water diving spot. During the Pleistocene era, the Blue Hole was a giant cave on dry land. The stalactites and stalagmites remain and are staggering sights through the crystal blue water. Ambergris Caye . Ambergris Caye is the largest island of Belize, accessible via a small airplane from the mainland of Belize. Believe it or not, the best way to tour Ambergris Caye is by golf cart. Drive around and stop to see mangrove trees, the Belize Barrier Reef that almost touches the shore and lagoons teeming with crocodiles. Maya ruins of Lamanai . Some use Belize as the entry point to Tikal, the famed ruins in Guatemala, but it is also home to several ancient Maya cities. One of the more interesting is Lamanai, which was still occupied by the Maya when the Spanish first arrived. The cultural collision is forever noted here, between the pyramids and the ruins of two Spanish churches. Caves Branch River tubing . Geologists recently stumbled across a vast subterranean network of Maya ceremonial caves. At the Nohoch Che'en Caves Branch Archeological Reserve, guides will lead you across jungle pools to the caverns filled with artifacts like sacrificial skeletons. The spiritual underwater history lesson is a must-do. Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary . Interested in the chance see a jaguar up close and personal? The Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary is the world's first jaguar sanctuary. And, it's also a campground where you can pitch your tent, go hiking, and listen to a symphony of jungle sounds.","The Blue Hole is world-renowned as an open-water diving spot .

"Washington (CNN) -- A former private school teacher and camp counselor facing child pornography charges was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list Tuesday. Eric Justin Toth, also known as David Bussone, was a third grade teacher at the National Cathedral's Beauvoir school in Washington, D.C., in 2008 when pornographic images were found on a school camera that had allegedly been in his possession. Toth went missing while the initial investigation was under way. He was later indicted in Washington for possession of child pornography and in Maryland for production of child pornography. An FBI official said Toth allegedly installed a camera in a bathroom adjacent to his classroom which was used by students. Toth, 30, is 6 feet, 3 inches tall, weighs approximately 155 pounds and has brown hair and green eyes. The FBI issued a wanted poster with several photos of the suspect. The agency described Toth as a computer expert who has above average knowledge of the Internet. He graduated from Purdue University with an education degree and the FBI poster says ""he may advertise online as a tutor or male nanny."" FBI wanted poster images of Toth . According to the FBI, since he left the Washington area, Toth is believed to have traveled to Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Minnesota. He was last seen in a homeless shelter in Phoenix in 2009. The FBI hopes adding Toth to the most wanted list and offering a reward of up to $100,000 will bring in new tips and lead to his arrest. An FBI statement notes the former teacher has eluded capture despite various media reports about the case and his being featured on the ""America's Most Wanted"" television program. The May 2011 raid by U.S. forces in Pakistan which killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden opened up the spot on the Top Ten list which Toth now fills. ""There is no comparison to be made between Toth and bin Laden,"" said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Jacqueline Maguire. ""Although Eric Toth has not murdered anyone and he is not an international terrorist, that does not mean he isn't dangerous."" ""We are very concerned that he may be in contact with other children, so we are asking for the public's assistance to help us capture him,"" Maguire added. Alleged Boston mobster James ""Whitey"" Bulger, also on the FBI Top Ten list, was arrested in California in June. He is still pictured on the list with a banner underneath his face saying ""captured."" The FBI has not yet announced who will fill Bulger's slot. Toth is the 495th person to be put on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List, which was created in 1950. The FBI says 465 of those fugitives were found, 153 of them as a result of help from the public.","Toth allegedly installed a camera in a bathroom used by students .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Amid continued nationwide outrage, Chinese authorities issued a rare public apology Thursday to a woman who was forced to have a late-term abortion, and suspended three local officials involved in the incident. ""Since the illegal actions by some officials have seriously hurt Feng Jianmei and her family, we want to offer our deep apologies to them and to the generic public,"" said a statement released by the Ankang city government in Shaanxi Province, which administers Feng's village. Two of the three officials suspended were in charge of local family planning. The city government promised further investigation and punishment for those found responsible. It added that a vice mayor had visited the family to deliver the message in person and offer concrete assistance. Feng, 22, was illegally detained on May 30 in rural Shaanxi Province and coerced to undergo the procedure three days later in the seventh month of pregnancy, her husband said. ""I'm angry and want justice,"" Deng Jiyuan told CNN over the phone earlier Thursday. ""They forced her to abort our seven-month-old child -- do they deserve to be called Communist Party officials who served the people?"" Deng, a 29-year-old farmer, said he was trying to secure a birth permit up to the last minute but could not afford to pay the fine of 40,000 yuan ($6,300) demanded by the officials. He added that his wife remained traumatized in hospital. The couple married in 2006 and Feng gave birth to a girl in 2007, local officials said in a statement. Under China's strict family planning law, which limits most married couples to only one child, Feng and Deng are ineligible to have a second child. Graphic photos taken after the abortion showing a bloody baby lying next to Feng in a hospital bed have been circulating online and shocked Chinese netizens, prompting rare domestic media coverage and public debate on one of the country's most controversial policies. After initially insisting the operation was voluntary, local officials acknowledged Thursday that the forced abortion was illegal. Previously on CNN.com: Activists allege forced abortions, sterilizations in China . ""Such action has seriously violated relevant policies and regulations set by the state and provincial family planning authorities, harmed the image of family planning work and caused extremely negative social impact,"" said a statement released by the Shaanxi Population and Family Planning Commission. On Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, the case was among the top trending topics Thursday afternoon, attracting almost a million comments. Most users appear to side with the couple and condemn the officials. ""Bring the murderers to justice"" was a commonly posted demand. Deng, the husband, has opened a Weibo account, posting developments and venting frustrations. His profile picture is one of the post-abortion photos of his wife, with the baby's image blurred, that have jolted the nation. China's ""one child"" policy was recently thrown into the international spotlight when prominent human rights activist Chen Guangcheng escaped his house arrest and moved to New York. Chen's supporters maintain his long-time legal advocacy for victims of forced abortions and sterilizations had led to his persecution. Since the government introduced the policy in the late 1970s to curb population growth in the world's most populous nation, millions of women have been forced to end their ""illegal pregnancies."" The number of ""family planning abortions"" peaked in 1983 with 14.37 million operations performed that year, according to the Health Ministry. Since 2000, such abortions have numbered about 7 million a year -- with a spike in 2008 to 9.17 million cases. The latest news on Feng has again rallied critics of Beijing's family planning policy. ""No legitimate government would commit or tolerate such an act,"" said Reggie Littlejohn, president of Women's Rights Without Frontiers, a California-based group that aims to stop forced abortions in China. ""We call on the United States government and leaders of the free world to strongly condemn forced abortion and all coercive family planning in China.""

"(CNET)  -- Net neutrality supporters say they're unhappy that the Verizon Communications and Google proposal for new net neutrality rules does not go far enough. On Monday the companies announced a joint proposal that outlines a legislative framework for consideration by lawmakers. The companies have been working together on the net neutrality issue for almost a year. In October, they issued a shared statement of principles on Net neutrality. And then, a few months later, they submitted a joint filing to the FCC. In late March, the CEOs discussed their interest in an open Internet through an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. There was almost no positive response from net neutrality supporters on the proposal. But the biggest disappointment for net neutrality supporters appears to be the fact that Google and Verizon agreed that new regulation or net neutrality laws should not apply equally to wireless networks. ""They are promising Net Neutrality only for a certain part of the Internet, one that they'll likely stop investing in,"" the SavetheInternet.com Coalition, a group that consists of several advocacy groups including MoveOn.Org Civic Action, Credo Action, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, ColorofChange.org, and Free Press said in its statement. Joel Kelsey, a political adviser for Free Press, said the proposal would lead to ""outright blocking of applications and content on increasingly popular wireless platforms."" Net neutrality supporters in Congress are also concerned about wireless being left out of the proposal. ""Today's proposal leaves out essential elements that should be a part of FCC action to ensure a free and open Internet,"" Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) said in a statement. ""The proposal does not apply its prohibition against blocking or slowing Internet traffic to wireless broadband services, for example, and it doesn't mention the need to ensure consumers' privacy online, a glaring omission as examples abound of companies tracking and targeting users' every click."" While broadband providers such as AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon Communications have always opposed regulation or new laws that would dictate how they could run their networks, they have softened their stance over the past several months, and now they accept they will have to live with some rules. That said, the nation's two biggest wireless phone companies, AT&T and Verizon, say applying the same Net neutrality rules designed for wireline networks to wireless networks is not a good idea. These companies say that wireless networks differ from wireline broadband networks because bandwidth is more limited on a wireless network. Imposing new rules on how carriers operate their wireless networks would stifle investment, they argue. Indeed, wireless networks do have capacity constraints. But consumer advocates' skepticism about the intentions of Google and Verizon may be well-founded. Google's and Verizon's interests are much more closely aligned in wireless than they are in the traditional broadband market. Google's Android operating system is on dozens of smartphones filled with specialized Google apps that are sold by wireless operators, such as Verizon Wireless. In fact, Google and Verizon Wireless, which is majority-owned by Verizon Communications, have worked closely together to bring new phones, such as the Motorola Droid and Motorola Droid X, to market using the Google Android platform. Verizon has been banking on the Google devices to lead its smartphone assault on AT&T and Apple's iPhone. But before anyone gets too worked up about this proposal, supporters and detractors need to remember this is simply a proposal. Google and Verizon do not write law nor do they impose regulations. Congressional leaders write laws. And the FCC writes regulations. Google and Verizon say they are merely making sure they are being heard in the debate. At the end of the day, policy makers will be hearing from all sides, as they have for more than three years. So far the Federal Communications Commission, which has been drafting new net neutrality regulation, has kept mum on the proposal Google and Verizon. The agency declined to comment on Monday. But FCC chairman Julius Genachowski has said previously he believes that net neutrality principles should apply to wireless networks as well as traditional wired broadband networks. Meanwhile, AT&T, which says it was not a party to the drafting of this proposal, said it will examine the document closely. ""We remain committed to achieving a consensus solution to the Net neutrality issue, either with the FCC or with the Congress,"" Claudia Jones, AT&T vice president of public affairs and media relations, said in a statement. ""In that sense, the Verizon-Google agreement demonstrates that it is possible to bridge differences on this issue."" © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- ""Great Gatsby"" director Baz Luhrmann isn't the type to be cowed by literary pedigree, not even that of F. Scott Fitzgerald. His movies, including ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,"" are like watching a three-ring circus. They revel in surface, spectacle and sensory overload. They're audaciously, passionately artificial and at the same time unabashedly romantic -- post-modern pop medleys aimed at the heart, not the brain. Perhaps Luhrmann even identifies with Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby; after all, they're both decadents. But Fitzgerald wasn't Gatsby, and Gatsby could never have written such a novel. It takes an observer like Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) to distill the finer sentiments from this sorry tale of the super-rich, and Luhrmann isn't that. He's an extrovert who wants to thrill us and immerse us in his giddy daring. The last thing he wants to do is sit back and watch. There are no two ways about it: ""The Great Gatsby"" is misconceived and misjudged, a crude burlesque on what's probably American literature's most precious jewel. Shopping Gatsby: 15 items you'll love . Warning bells go off right from the first shots of a CGI version of New York's Long Island. The camera is in a state of constant agitation, while the actors -- and they're good actors -- seem to have been instructed to vamp. Either that, or they decided it was the only way to compete with the film's garish hot deco. But let's give Luhrmann his due: The man does cut a good teaser. The idea to swap Scott Joplin for Jay-Z and ragtime for rap was a bold and brilliant choice. Casting Leonardo DiCaprio as the glamorous, elusive billionaire Gatsby and Maguire as his modest, admiring neighbor was right on. Carey Mulligan as Daisy wasn't as inspired. She gets the sadness of the character but not the flip side of her personality, and she's just not a bright enough spark to keep Gatsby's torch burning for so long. And shooting in 3-D? Look at ""Hugo"" and ""Life of Pi"": It could have worked. Yet Luhrmann seems utterly bamboozled by the technique, as if it's thrown off his rhythm. The early scenes especially are likely to induce motion sickness, and not just because Nick is getting drunk on New York's high society. We know Luhrmann can throw a wild party, but the movie doesn't build or grow; it just keeps hitting the same high notes until we go numb to the din. And if he's lost in the loud revelry, Luhrmann is completely out of his element in the more intimate scenes. The reunion between Jay and Daisy is played for laughs (and it gets a couple, too), but Luhrmann shortchanges whatever it is that pulls these lovers together. For such an elaborate display of courtship, it's a remarkably unsensual affair. Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" will endure this indignity as surely as it outlasted previous versions with Alan Ladd and Robert Redford. It's a shame, though, since the novel's depiction of a society dancing on the edge of a precipice is so timely. It's hard not to feel angry at the waste.","Baz Luhrmann is known for sensory overload with his movies .
""Gatsby"" needs an observant storyteller, which Luhrmann isn't .
The adaptation is misconceived and misjudged .

"(CNN) -- Interpol has issued an international wanted notice for a French gangster who authorities say used explosives as part of a brazen escape from a prison in Lille, France, over the weekend, the organization said Monday. Redoine Faid held five people, including four guards, at gunpoint at the detention center Saturday, officials said. He then burst his way to freedom by detonating explosives that destroyed five doors, penitentiary union spokesman Etienne Dobremetz told CNN affiliate BFMTV. Interpol announced Monday that it issued its wanted notice, known as a red notice, within hours of Faid's escape. A European arrest warrant covering 26 countries also was issued for him Saturday. Red notices alert police agencies around the world that a person is wanted, but they are not arrest warrants. Each of Interpol's 190 member countries is expected to apply its national laws and standards in determining whether to detain the wanted person. Faid's escape has raised a number of questions: How did an inmate get guns and explosives? How did he manage to use those to force his way out? And, after all that, why is he still at large? The four guards whom Faid allegedly held hostage ""are safe and sound,"" Lille prosecutor Frederic Fevre said. Still, officials from the prison guards' union pressed French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira to make prisons safer, including more thorough searches of those who enter, BFMTV reported. The escape may be due partly to a problem plaguing the prison that couldn't hold Faid: overcrowding. Built in 2005, the Lille-Sequedin penitentiary is not old, but it's not well designed to keep watch on prisoners, said Jimmy Delliste, a former associate director there. ""The construction ... makes it particularly difficult to manage detainees, who are particularly difficult to watch,"" Delliste told BFMTV. And such a prison was holding a convict who fashioned himself as a modern-day gangster. Faid, 40, thought big, getting inspiration from the movies. He wore a hockey mask, like Robert DeNiro's character in the movie ""Heat,"" and acted audaciously in attacking armored trucks among other targets. ""He lives his life like a hero from a Hollywood film,"" said Pierre Fourniaud, who edited Faid's 2010 autobiography, ""Robber: From Suburbs to Organized Crime."" Faid wanted to be a robber from the age of 6, Fourniaud said. ""He wants to be known as the greatest gangster -- public enemy No. 1, so this morning all the papers are calling him just that,"" Fourniaud said. ""I think that's his satisfaction."" In 1998, after three years on the run during which he fled to Switzerland, Faid was caught. Sentenced to 20 years, he spent time in high-security prisons around France. After more than a decade behind bars, the Frenchman insisted he'd changed. But this promise didn't last long, French authorities said. In 2011, Faid landed back behind bars. Jean-Louis Pelletier, Faid's lawyer, said he is not surprised by the breakout. Pelletier had planned to meet his client soon in preparation for an upcoming trial tied to a May 2010 attack in Villiers-sur-Marne, east of Paris, that left a 26-year-old policewoman dead. ""He is remarkably intelligent, and he is using his intellect to serve his ambitions,"" Pelletier told BFMTV. ""(And Faid) cannot stand being imprisoned any more.""","NEW: ""He wants to be known as the greatest gangster,"" escaped prisoner's former editor says .

"SHANGHAI, China (CNN) -- When Shi Rui Huan was led through the back entrance of a China Mobile store on the first day of April last year, he had no idea that he was about to be at the center of one of the most significant events in the history of telecommunications in China. Shi Rui Huan, aka, 'the 3G guy' shows off his 3G phone. Will millions of other Chinese follow his lead? And he also had no idea that he had just become the victim of the ultimate April Fool's joke. One of his friends had called the day before, told him there was an important meeting he should attend and to be sure to dress up. It turned out that Shi had been chosen to be the very first person to have the very first subscription ever given out in China for third-generation (3G) mobile phone service. His face appeared in newspapers and on television programs for weeks. Even today he's still known by many as simply ""the 3G guy."" ""It was like I was like President Hu Jintao,"" Shi said jokingly. Shi, a trendy, 31-year-old who works in advertising and can often be spotted wearing his favorite pair of black cowboy boots while smoking gold-tipped cigarettes, is exactly the type of customer China's mobile phone operators are hoping will be among the first to subscribe for 3G services. First introduced in Japan a decade ago, 3G wireless networks give subscribers faster Internet connections, which means music, movies and games can be downloaded with greater ease, e-mail can be accessed much more quickly and other multimedia applications such as instant messaging and video-conferencing are possible on a mobile phone. After a slow start, 3G is now widely used in Japan and Korea, yet has had less than stellar adoption rates across Europe and in the United States, where uptake has been stymied because of expensive handsets and pricing plans, poor network coverage and lack of consumer interest. For years, Beijing has delayed the rollout of next-generation networks largely to complete technology for its homegrown 3G standard called TD-SCDMA, which many experts say was developed to reduce China's dependence on foreign technology and spur the growth of its domestic telecom industry. Last spring, the government began testing the new standard among select customers -- Shi was the first -- in a handful of cities and last month announced it would issue 3G licenses to the country's three state-owned mobile phone carriers. China Mobile, the dominant provider by far, received the license for TD-SCDMA, while China Unicom and China Telecom were given licenses for international standards used in Europe and the United States. The carriers have announced they will collectively spend almost $60 billion over the next several years to build their respective 3G networks while the government has set targets for tens of millions of subscribers by 2011. The billion-dollar question . Now that the guessing game surrounding when China would finally issue 3G licenses has ended, many experts are wondering exactly what, if any, impact next-generation networks will have in the biggest mobile phone market in the world. ""That is a million-dollar question,"" said Benjamin Joffe, founder of the Beijing-based mobile and Internet consulting firm Plus8Star. ""Essentially if you want to know how a market with 10 years experience is doing, the simplest thing to do is to look at Japan."" While some say the success of 3G in Japan is mostly hype, the country, which has over 80 percent adoption rates, has become home to a ""thriving mobile ecosystem,"" said Joffe, noting that second-generation (2G) handsets are no longer sold there. Two of the richest mobile social networking companies in the world are based in Japan, along with a number of other highly profitable firms that have developed cool content and even cooler applications, such as mobile commerce and mobile auctions, for 3G phones. Similar businesses have begun to emerge in China and are creating mobile platforms aimed at the country's technologically savvy youth, hungry for entertainment on-the-go and turned on by flashy 3G phones. ""It is very good for us,"" said Alvin Wang Graylin, whose Shanghai-based mobile search and ad provider mInfo is positioned to directly benefit from 3G's higher data speeds. ""[Subscribers] will use more mobile Internet and more mobile data services, leading to more ad inventory,"" he said. According to Frost & Sullivan's senior industry analyst Marc Einstein, even without 3G networks Chinese telecoms already earn over 20 percent of their revenues from non-voice data usage, like text messages and ringtone downloads, which is on par with carriers in the United States where high-speed networks have been in place for years. ""I think this bodes well for future uptake in the market,"" said Einstein. ""China is leaps and bounds ahead of most other emerging markets, notably India where the figure is more like 10 percent."" However unlike 3G users in other markets, those in China have considerably less cash, which means its widespread adoption may boil down to one thing: cost. In a country where the average per capita income is only a few thousand dollars a year, next-generation wireless service may be prohibitive for a while. ""In terms of immediate impact on the market, it is going to be very limited just like it was in any other country that launched 3G -- in the first two years, nothing happened,"" said Joffe. ""There won't be miracles."" Power of the Chinese consumer . But if prices are affordable, especially on the handset side, some believe the demand for 3G may be driven by consumers in second- and third-tier cities which simply want to log onto the web. ""Pure Internet usage will be a strong driver,"" Nokia spokesman Thomas Jonsson told CNN. ""Today there is already a very high number of Internet users and the first time they enter the Internet is through their mobile phones."" And also for the first time, consumers may have more power than ever to shape the state-controlled telecommunications industry, which was restructured last year to pave the way for 3G and introduce more competition. Faced with China Mobile's unproved TD-SCDMA network that works mainly with less-than-fashionable handsets from domestic companies, many Chinese may choose to switch the other carriers that have tried-and-tested 3G standards and are compatible with brand name handsets from foreign manufacturers. ""I think consumers will ultimately be smart, and that is a challenge for China Mobile,"" Duncan Clark, chairman of consulting firm BDA China, told CNN. ""There is a good market in China,"" added Clark. ""Chinese like to adopt technologies and show them off."" Shi, who switches mobile phones at least twice a year, says he already is on the lookout for the next cool handset to flash around in front of his friends. Yet when it comes to talking about being the first-ever 3G subscriber in China, he is slightly less exuberant. ""It is not a very important thing in my life,"" he said while smoking one of his golden cigarettes and sipping tea. ""It was just a joke.""","China has restructured mobile market to make way for 3G network and phones .
3G slow to be adopted in Europe and U.S. but big in Japan .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The number of Tibetans in China who have set themselves on fire to protest Beijing's rule has reached 100, according to Tibetan advocacy groups. Lobsang Namgyal, a 37-year-old former monk, set himself on fire earlier this month in Aba prefecture, known in Tibetan as Ngaba, an ethnically Tibetan area of the Chinese province of Sichuan, according to Free Tibet, a London-based advocacy group. ""This grim milestone should be a source of shame to the Chinese authorities who are responsible and to the world leaders who have yet to show any leadership in response to the ongoing crisis in Tibet,"" said Stephanie Brigden, the director of Free Tibet. Self-immolation has become a desperate form of protest in recent years for ethnic Tibetans unhappy with Chinese rule, and it shows no sign of abating. Of the 100 Tibetans who have now set themselves on fire in China, at least 82 are believed to have died from the act, according to the International Campaign for Tibet. Lobsang Namgyal died at the scene, and his body was removed by local authorities, who cremated it and returned the ashes to his family, Free Tibet said in a statement Wednesday without specifying where it got the information. Timeline of Tibetan protests in China . The advocacy group said it had taken 10 days to confirm his self-immolation, which took place February 3, ""because Tibetans are too frightened of Chinese state reprisals to speak about protests."" Independently verifying the reported self-immolations inside China is often difficult because of restrictions on reporting from the restive areas and the reluctance of local officials to comment on the accounts provided by foreign groups such as Free Tibet. Local authorities in Aba declined to comment on the case on Thursday, and the Chinese foreign ministry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Self-immolation began as a form of protest among Tibetans in China in February 2009, when a young monk set himself on fire in Aba. In March 2011, another young monk followed in his footsteps, becoming the first to die. Scores of others have since followed suit, with the frequency of the self-immolations increasing significantly last year, according to Free Tibet. Another Tibetan sets himself on fire . Protests in other countries . Several other Tibetans have carried out self-immolations in other countries, including India. And on Wednesday, a Tibetan man set himself on fire in front of a famous Buddhist shrine in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu, police said. The man later died of his injuries while undergoing treatment in a hospital, police spokesman Keshav Adhikari said Thursday. Sandwiched between China and India, Nepal is home to thousands of Tibetan refugees. Many of the Tibetans who cross the Himalayan border from China into Nepal eventually make their way to India, where the Tibetan government in exile is based. But Tibetan refugees in Nepal have claimed the Chinese government officials are pressuring their Nepalese counterparts to make the country less hospitable to Tibetans. Beijing has taken a tough line on Tibetan self-immolators and their associates inside China, accusing the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, of fomenting unrest. Last month, a court in southwestern China gave heavy sentences to two ethnic Tibetans convicted of murder for ""inciting"" people to set themselves on fire. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising, has long denied China's assertion that he's seeking Tibetan independence. He says he wants only enough autonomy to protect its traditional Buddhist culture. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. It makes centuries-old historical claims on the region. CNN staff in Beijing and journalist Manesh Shrestha in Kathmandu contributed to this report.","NEW: The Tibetan man who set himself on fire in Nepal has died, police say .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- A Philadelphia judge threw out three of the seven first-degree murder charges against Dr. Kermit Gosnell, the abortion clinic doctor accused of performing illegal late-term abortions at a bedraggled facility. Common Pleas Court Judge Jeffery P. Minehart also tossed all five abuse of corpse charges levied against the 72-year-old physician for storing the feet of aborted fetuses in plastic containers in his defunct Women's Medical Society clinic in West Philadelphia. Minehart also dismissed one count of infanticide, the intentional killing of an infant. Gosnell originally faced eight counts of murder for the deaths of seven babies and a 41-year-old Virginia woman, Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. He has pleaded not guilty. Authorities allege that some of the infants were born viable and alive during the sixth, seventh and eighth months of pregnancy and then were killed with scissors, which were used to cut their spinal cords. In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake. Victim's daughter offers emotional testimony in trial of abortion doctor . Defense attorney Jack McMahon has maintained that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already deceased as a result of Gosnell previously administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion. ""Digoxin, fetal demise, no heartbeat,"" barked McMahon, his mouth pressed in a flat line as he stood next to his client with a hand on his hip. ""Everybody wants it to be something else, but that's the evidence."" McMahon also argued that Gosnell was saving the jars containing fetal remains for DNA testing in possible rape cases and other study, he said. Along with an examination chair with stirrups facing the jury box, a sonogram machine and other medical devices are on display in the center of the courtroom. During the afternoon session, the courtroom swelled with onlookers, including members of a law class from nearby Drexel University and anti-abortion supporters who traveled from across the eastern seaboard. After Tuesday's proceedings, a priest and other spectators offered words of encouragement to prosecutors Joanne Pescatore and Edward Cameron. Day Gardner, founder and president of the National Black Pro-Life Union, who attended several days of the trial, said she is ""disappointed"" about the tossed charges. ""The judge made his decision based on what he thinks they (prosecutors) can prove. That's the only thing we can hold onto,"" said Gardner, who traveled from Washington. ""I'm here because this man preyed on poor women in the black community. He thinks no one should care, but I do."" A grand jury investigation determined that health and licensing officials had received reports about Gosnell's practices for two decades but had taken no action, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said. When authorities searched Gosnell's office, they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building. Jars containing the severed feet of babies lined a shelf. Furniture and equipment was bloodstained, dusty and broken. The city's Chief Medical Examiner Sam Gulino told jurors this month that he had to examine the remains of 47 aborted fetuses that were stored in water jugs, pet food containers and a freezer inside the abortion clinic as part of the investigation into the charges against Gosnell. Medical examiner had to thaw fetal remains in Philly abortion doctor case . Minehart also dismissed six of the nine counts of theft by deception against Gosnell co-defendant Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at the Women's Medical Society. O'Neill, who did not have a medical license, is not charged with performing abortions but with participating in the operation of a ""corrupt organization."" Meanwhile, a gag order remains in place preventing attorneys or the jury from speaking to the media. If found guilty, Gosnell could be sentenced to death.","Dr. Kermit Gosnell accused of performing illegal abortions in Philadelphia .

"(CNN) -- A self-described anarchist who calls himself ""Cyco"" got an 11-year prison sentence Tuesday for his role in a failed attempt to blow up an Ohio bridge. Authorities say the mohawk-wearing Douglas Wright was the suspected ringleader of the plot. He and co-conspirators Brandon Baxter and Connor Stevens set their sights on the Brecksville-Northfield High Level Bridge, which spans the Cuyahoga Valley National Park and carries a four-lane highway, officials say. Baxter, a.k.a. ""Skabby,"" was sentenced to more than nine years in prison; Stevens got eight years. The sentences were announced in federal court in Akron, Ohio. After an undercover operation, the FBI arrested the men April 30 in what the agency termed an act of domestic terrorism. The men later admitted their roles in a plan to remotely detonate improvised devices containing C-4 explosives. Authorities said the defendants had considered several targets during a period of several months before settling on the bridge connecting Brecksville and Sagamore Hills in Ohio, not far from Cleveland. The men pleaded guilty in September to charges of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and use of an explosive device to destroy property used in interstate commerce. A fourth defendant is scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday.","Brandon L. Baxter, a.k.a. ""Skabby,"" was sentenced to more than 9 years in prison .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that North Korea must stop ""bucking the trend of history and common sense"" in continuing with its nuclear program and that any unilateral action by the North ""carries too great a cost"" for the world to allow it. Kerry spoke at the end of a three-day trip that focused on securing fresh commitments from South Korea, China and Japan for denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and getting Pyongyang back to the negotiating table. ""The United States remains open to authentic and credible negotiations on denuclearization, but the burden is on Pyongyang,"" Kerry said in Tokyo. ""Korea must take meaningful steps to show it will honor commitments it has already made"" and the norms of international law. Last month, North Korea scrapped the 1953 truce that effectively ended the Korean war and said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. It also recently pledged to restart its Yongbyon nuclear complex, including a uranium enrichment plant and a reactor that was shut down under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks with North Korea, the United States, and four other countries. ""The world does not need more potential for war, so we will stand together. And we welcome China's strong commitment ... to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" Kerry said. Kerry: A nuclear North Korea is unacceptable . ""The stakes are far too high and the global economy is far too fragile for anyone to allow these inherited problems to divide the region and inflame it."" A U.S. State Department official said Monday there are no plans to move toward direct talks, however, ""because North Korea has shown no willingness to move in a positive direction."" Pyongyang on Sunday rejected a different proposal for dialogue, one by South Korea last week regarding the North's suspension of activity at the manufacturing zone that the two countries jointly operate. A statement via KCNA, the state-run news agency, called the South's offer a ""crafty trick"" and ""empty words without any content."" A KCNA commentary Monday was titled, ""U.S. is to blame for escalating tension on Korean Peninsula."" Kerry's trip finishes on one of the biggest dates on the North Korean calendar: ""The Day of the Sun,"" when citizens celebrate the birthday of the country's late founder and ""eternal president,"" Kim Il Sung. This year marks his 101st birthday. Current leader Kim Jong Un paid tribute Monday to Kim Il Sung, his grandfather, as well as his late father, Kim Jong Il, visiting the halls where both men lie in state. It was believed to be Kim's first public appearance in two weeks. Amid the pageantry, patriotism and festive images being played on North Korean state television Monday, many around the world wonder whether this will also be the day North Korea decides to launch a missile, perhaps in a show of bravado after weeks of nuclear threats. Some scholars say a launch is still possible, if not Monday, then in the coming days. CNN Correspondent Kyung Lah reports from Seoul that because April 15 is the founder's birthday, North Korea would not conduct a missile launch then with the possibility of failure hanging over them. North Korean missile: Should U.S. shoot it down? Pyongyang made good on its promise to launch a long-range rocket around the time of Kim Il Sung's birthday last year; the rocket broke apart after launch and fell into the sea. North Korea has made more threats since then. It launched a rocket in December that apparently put a satellite into orbit, and in response, the U.N. Security council approved broadening sanctions against the country. Angered by those sanctions, Pyongyang announced in January it was planning a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part what it called a new phase of confrontation with the United States. It carried out an underground nuclear bomb test in February, and last month, Pyongyang threatened for the first time to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the United States and South Korea. The North also threatened to attack U.S. and South Korean bases. The North Korea we rarely see .

"(CNN) -- In this installment of ""The Big Three,"" John Avlon, Dean Obeidallah and I discuss the top news in a crowded news week. First, of course, is the Boston Marathon bombing, which shocked and captivated the country. Second, we look at the failure of universal background checks to pass the U.S. Senate despite the support of nearly 90% of Americans. And third -- on a lighter note -- we note Justin Beiber's self-absorbed understanding of Anne Frank's legacy. I was in Boston on Monday when the blasts erupted at the marathon finish line. I arrived at Logan Airport and was scheduled to participate in a panel discussion at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. As I pulled up to the Kennedy School of Public Policy, the building was being evacuated for bomb threats, and reports -- which later turned out to be false -- of another explosion at the JFK Presidential Library. Boston was, understandably, in a panic. Monday brought back memories of 9/11 for all Americans. In our podcast, we talked about the public reaction to this attack. We cite examples such as liberal radio host Dave Sirota and Rep. Steve King's polarized projections on the attack and its perpetrators, and look at how and why we've changed over the past 12 years. Four months after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, a bipartisan compromise amendment to secure universal background checks failed in Senate. John and Dean expressed a combination of fury and frustration that the Senate failed to pass a single gun control measure. While I understand their frustration and favor background checks, I'm wary of passing laws that make us feel safer but do little to actually prevent the next Newtown. On a much lighter note, we decided to take on Justin Beiber's visit to the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, inspired by an excellent column Dean wrote for CNN.com. Beiber visited the historic home and Holocaust memorial and wrote in the guest book, ""Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a Belieber."" This inane bit of Hollywood self-reference reflects the dumbing down of America, courtesy of our obsession with celebrity gossip instead of civics and history. One possible silver lining: This was a teaching moment for thousands of Beliebers who had never heard of Anne Frank. Get a real hero, folks.

"Washington (CNN) -- Upon his surrender, suspected Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was placed in the immediate custody of federal authorities and remains under guard at a Boston hospital. His wounds and limited communication are among the variables that will affect the speed of course of the criminal case. Attorney General Eric Holder announced federal charges on Monday against the Cambridge, Massachusetts, resident. In a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Tsarnaev, 19, was charged with one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction, namely an improvised explosive device, against persons and property within the United States resulting in death. He also was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. The case against him is death-penalty eligible. He could also be charged later in state courts, but for now federal authorities will lead the prosecution. This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys William Weinreb and Aloke Chakravarty from the Anti-Terrorism and National Security Unit of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, with assistance from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department's National Security Division. According to the court filing system, the charges were actually filed Sunday under seal. The Justice Department in coming weeks will decide whether to actually seek the death penalty. Attorney General Eric Holder would make the final call, but federal government sources tell CNN they expect President Barack Obama and other top White House officials to have significant input into those discussions. Federal legal sources also say they expect an outside counsel will be appointed to work with the public defender on the capital punishment aspect, since Massachusetts has no death penalty and federal officials there rarely deal with the complex legal maneuverings in such cases. One name mentioned is Judy Clarke, who has worked as a consultant in other high-profile capital cases. The San Diego-based criminal defense attorney and former federal public defender has worked with legal teams representing ""Unabomber"" Theodore Kaczynski, Atlanta bomber Eric Rudolph, and most recently, Tucson mass shooter Jared Loughner. Clarke has earned praise for leading internal negotiations with prosecutors to take the death penalty off the table in favor of the defendant pleading guilty and getting a life sentence. Some legal experts said the best legal strategy now would be ""delay, delay, delay"" as long as possible, given the public outrage at the crimes the defendant is alleged to have committed. Any criminal trial could be many months, if not years away. The defendant's lawyers are expected to waive the ""speedy trial"" requirement to give them time to prepare would could be a lengthy criminal trial, two government sources indicated. The suspect's medical condition may also delay matters if he is not able to fully assist his counsel in the initial stages. Tsarnaev made an initial appearance in his room on Monday before Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, according to a court filing of notes taken at the proceeding. He was advised of his rights as well as the charges. The government stated the maximum penalties. Tsarnaev agreed to an order of voluntary detention, the court record showed. Tsarnaev declined to answer bail questions and assented to a probable cause hearing on May 30, 2013, at 10 am. ET. The court was satisfied Tsarnaev was alert and able to respond to the charges. He was remanded from the custody of the FBI agents present to the U.S. Marshals, the court record showed. The Federal Public Defender in Boston confirmed Bill Fick from that office was in the hospital for the first appearance and confirms he will represent the defendant, at least for now. The initial appearance did not constitute an arraignment. Tsaranev has the option throughout the process to not speak with law enforcement. A magistrate will preside over the next two or three appearances, but the case will eventually be referred to a federal district judge. Federal grand juries are sitting at all times in Boston, so Tsaranev would face formal charges from an indictment. Such a preliminary hearing would be presided over by a federal judge. A number of pre-trial negotiations would then start, including possible negotiations for a plea deal. If no deal can be reached, a criminal trial would commence. That raises another potential issue: Whether to hold a trial outside of Boston because of the enormous publicity and possible community anger at the crimes. Possible trial venues could be in the western part of the state, in Worcester or Springfield, or possibly out-of-state in neighboring Rhode Island or New Hampshire.","Attorney general will make final call, but expect White House, other top-level input .

"Washington (CNN) -- A suspected child predator who was a ""most-wanted"" fugitive when captured in Nicaragua appeared in federal court on Tuesday where he confirmed his identity and was ordered held. Eric Toth, 31, a former private school teacher and camp counselor, entered no plea to charges of possession and production of child pornography. U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Kay said that Toth could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of the counts that were included in a 2008 Maryland indictment. Wearing a navy rain jacket, the bearded Toth confirmed his identity but made no other comments. He was represented by a federal public defender, Michelle Peterson. A preliminary hearing was set for May 23. He will remain in custody pending that proceeding. FBI Assistant Director Valerie Parlave said investigators looking for Toth for five years received a ""high quality"" tip on April 18 and were able to take him into custody on Saturday in the small Nicaraguan community of Esteli. Parlave said Toth had been living under an alias. She credited Nicaraguan officials as well as U.S. law enforcement agencies for helping in the investigation. The investigation of Toth began in June 2008 after pornographic images were found on a school camera that had been in his possession, authorities alleged. They said they have identified at least one child victim in Maryland. Toth was placed on the FBI's ""Ten Most Wanted"" fugitives list last April. Nicaraguan authorities said Toth first entered the Central American country on October 12, 2012, using a false identity. The director of Nicaragua's National Police described him as an expert at violating computer security systems. ""That allowed him to falsify American passports, a driver's license and credit cards from three American banks,"" Director General Aminta Granera said. Masked police presented a handcuffed Toth before reporters in Managua on Monday. As he was escorted away in a patrol car, Toth told reporters that ""the police have been very professional.""

"(CNN) -- For 12 bloody, horrific months, Syrian dissidents and many world leaders have dreamt of one outcome for the Syrian crisis: the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad. But who would take over the embattled country remains a mystery -- one that could be fueling the bloodshed that has already killed thousands. Murhaf Jouejati, a Syrian-born scholar at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said foreign leaders may be reluctant to take stronger action against the regime because no one knows who would come to power. ""I think the international community would like a scenario that would be as clear as possible: Who would they be dealing with? Do they have a vision for the future? Or will it be total chaos?"" Jouejati said. ""So this uncertainty is prolonging the life of the regime -- uncertainty both shared by Syrians sitting on the fence inside Syria and in the international community."" Exactly who would lead Syria, he said, depends on how al-Assad leaves. A military coup . As remote as it may seem, al-Assad's downfall could come in the form of an internal coup, said former U.S. ambassador to Syria Edward Djerejian. ""In many ways, this would be the best outcome because there would be regime change,"" said Djerejian, director of Rice University's James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. But staging a military coup with high-level defectors may seem like a pipe dream -- one that could have deadly consequences. ""When generals get together, there are usually other generals looking over their shoulders,"" Jouejati said, making it difficult to carry out a rebellion among top officers with unanimous support and without retaliation. In recent weeks, opposition activists have reported dozens of defected soldiers killed at the hands of the regime. Yet ""if the Assad regime collapses violently, it is most likely that elements of the Syrian National Council, along with others, take over as an interim government,"" Jouejati said. The Syrian National Council . The Syrian National Council -- an opposition coalition whose leadership resides outside of Syria -- has gained recognition from the United States, France and other countries as a legitimate representative of the Syrian opposition. Ausama Monajed, adviser to the president of the Syrian National Council, says his group already has a plan for a post-Assad era. First, a presidential council would be formed in the transition phase to handle all affairs related to sovereignty, he said. In addition, a transitional unity government would include opposition figures, representatives of revolutionary committees and ""members of the regime who have no responsibility in crimes or major corruption,"" Monajed said. That transitional government would oversee the organization of elections to designate a Constituent Assembly. The assembly would be tasked with drafting a new constitution, a political party law, and a new election law, and would oversee parliamentary and presidential elections, Monajed said. But some analysts are skeptical about the Syrian National Council acting as an interim administrator. ""There's a lack of coordination amongst the insiders, and they represent the outsiders, not the insiders,"" Djerejian said. ""It's not a coherent opposition leadership."" The current president of the council, Burhan Ghalioun, is based in Paris. Other leaders are based in the United States, London or elsewhere. And footage of some protesters in Syria shows demonstrators proclaiming, ""Ghalioun, you do not represent us."" The SNC has also taken heat from some anti-Assad activists for not pushing harder on the international stage to help arm rebel fighters. But Monajed disputes the notion that the coalition is full of expatriates. ""The Syrian National Council's majority of members are based inside Syria, but many of those names are not made public for their safety,"" he said. ""The Syrian National Council is a broad-based coalition of political, religious and ethnic blocs added to the majority of grass-roots and revolutionary members from the coordinating committees."" Yet even if the SNC becomes a facilitator while a new government is formed, it's uncertain who would lead that group at the time of an al-Assad ouster; the SNC presidency has a term of three months. A rebel military leader . Although numerous armed opposition groups emerged after the government's crackdown started, a top military defector from the rebel Higher Military Council announced last week that rebel forces have united under the leadership of the Free Syrian Army. The FSA, comprised largely of al-Assad soldiers who have defected, is led by Col. Riad al-Asaad. But Jouejati doesn't think the rebel army's commander would be a shoo-in to lead Syria. ""There is the expectation of further defectors of the army -- maybe defectors of a higher rank than Col. Riad al-Asaad,"" he said. Al-Asaad is commanding the FSA from Turkey. But Jouejati said there are no big names among rebel ranks inside Syria that are emerging as possible interim leaders. ""The Assad regime has been particularly good at exiling, arresting or even killing charismatic leaders,"" he said. ""So there isn't one obvious leader."" The vice president . Then there's the possibility of Syria's vice president taking power after an al-Assad downfall. ""The opposition, at first, talked about Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa as interim president ... but this is becoming highly unlikely"" as the carnage and anger mount in Syria, Jouejati said. ""The vice president has been left in a very weak political position. He has a very small staff, he does not control anything. He does not influence anything in Syrian decision-making,"" he said. ""If the Assad regime collapses, he will collapse."" But Djerejian says the vice president could still come into play, and the al-Assad family could still exert influence. ""If something happens to Bashar al-Assad, and the Baath party and Alawites still remain in power, a vice president might still be in power. The family would still rule,"" Djerejian said. Al-Assad's younger brother Maher commands an elite division of the Syrian army and is accused of widespread human rights abuses. His cousin Rami Makhlouf is the richest man in Syria. The al-Assad family is Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Syria's Alawite minority has long dominated the Syrian government, despite a Sunni majority in the country. But ""even if someone from the regime takes over power, there is simply no going back to business as usual,"" Jouejati said. ""This revolution has gone on too far, too long, and it has been too bloody. ... So Syria will be opening a new page."" How would al-Assad go? Getting rid of the current regime means much more than just ousting Bashar al-Assad. It means uprooting 42 years of al-Assad family rule. Ribal al-Assad, the president's cousin who is now a Syrian opposition activist in London, said Bashar al-Assad is ""too scared to step down."" ""I think he's very scared of the people around him and the different security apparatus,"" said Ribal al-Assad, founder and director of The Organisation for Democracy and Freedom in Syria. ""His father built the state. His father rose (through) the ranks of the army. He had all power in his hand,"" Ribal al-Assad said. ""Bashar is different. He inherited that system. He inherited all those people, he doesn't control them."" ""It looks like the only way to get rid of that regime,"" he said, ""is you have to pry away people around Bashar."" Another possibility, Djerejian said, is the president could go into exile. Al-Assad does have options. Tunisia -- the cradle of the Arab Spring uprisings and the first clountry last year to oust its longtime ruler -- has offered asylum to the Syrian president in an attempt to spare further bloodshed. And a cache of e-mails leaked to CNN indicates the daughter of Qatar's emir has suggested exile in Doha. But al-Assad leads a dynastic regime that shows no sign of backing down. ""I think they're living in their own world of perception, and there's an aspect of delusion,"" Djerejian said. To be objective, he said, the president still has support from the power elite, Alawites and other minorities ""that are scared to death if he leaves, there'd be sectarian war. Better to live with the devil we know then than the devil we don't."" Jouejati acknowledges that if dissidents manage to oust the al-Assad regime, ""there would be a very rapid mood change"" among those proclaiming support for al-Assad. ""(But) most of these people you are not talking about, they are simply very, very fearful of what happens next,"" he said."" They would prefer stability at any price instead of the unknown. I think when the unknown becomes the order of day, the Assad regime is past them, there will be a new mood, and they will smell the smells of freedom.""","The uncertainty over who would take over could be fueling the bloodshed, some say .

"(CNN) -- What does freedom mean for Barack Obama? If you asked Sarah Palin, a Tea Partier, or a Republican member of Congress what freedom means, each would likely have a ready answer: Freedom is individual autonomy and it is closely identified with the market. But with Obama, most Americans simply would not know his answer. In fact, the Democratic Party's leadership for decades now has been unable to articulate how its goals and policies (like universal health care) actually connect to personal liberty. This is no doubt partly to blame for last week's election results. In America today, the language of freedom has been ceded almost entirely to the political right. Unless Democrats can offer a compelling counter-narrative, they will remain on the defensive whenever they depict government as a tool for social and economic change. Part of what makes the conservative language of freedom so politically potent is that it resonates with a problem many Americans face. In the 21st century we are faced with increasingly massive and hierarchical institutions. We have big business and big government, both run by a small number of highly trained professionals. Individuals feel powerless, without meaningful voice in key institutions and subject to decisions made elsewhere -- mostly behind closed doors. The conservative response has been simple. It has been to blame government for the problem of bureaucratic growth and hierarchy. Tea Partiers hope to reverse the sense of disempowerment by dismantling state programs and deregulating the economy. They say they envision the marketplace as a site for free exchange by equals, in which commercial self-regulation enhances individual entrepreneurship. Some liberals find it difficult to understand why this vision resonates with so many of their fellow Americans, given that it ignores the pathologies of corporate power. What they might note, though, is that even if this conservative response is incomplete, it at least articulates the lack of control many people experience and presents freedom as a product of individual self-rule. For precisely this reason, conservatives have been able to harness populist sentiment and to cast liberals as out of touch elites. Tea Party talk invoking the importance of ""Main Street"" emphasizes how it seems to them that professionals -- not ordinary Americans -- are often in political charge and how liberals seem indifferent to the scale and remoteness of modern bureaucracy. Rather than yield the language of liberty to the right, the Democratic Party needs to provide a clear response -- if for no other reason than that the conservative approach is both backward looking, which is not helpful, and excludes many. Given the dominance of finance capital, the idea of the unfettered marketplace as a site for individual empowerment is largely wishful thinking. Even worse, in the hands of conservatives, that marketplace is also a space for zero-sum competition, in which many are left on the outside looking in. Some Tea Partiers, for instance, have made this circumscribed liberty even more limited by saying that only ""true"" Americans should benefit from its blessings. Under this view, freedom requires restrictive policies toward immigrants and other groups that they fear threaten economic prosperity or national security. For them, liberty is no longer a universal ideal to be practiced -- rather than just preached -- by Americans. Instead, liberty is a privilege of the few, one that goes hand in hand with exclusion. In the past, social constituencies -- such as those organized by the agrarian populists in the late 19th century, the labor movement and the civil rights movement -- articulated how freedom and inclusion could be bound together. For someone like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., liberty meant providing individuals with practical power over both corporate and state entities. But public action had a key role to play. If Democrats hope to persuade Americans of the value of government programs, they must engage with the pervasive sense of disempowerment mined so fruitfully by conservatives. They need to explain why the root cause is ultimately corporate authority, not state responses. They also must clearly explain how securing liberty rests on exerting democratic control over mammoth private companies -- by employing government to reduce the size of banks, to roll back corporate privileges and to ensure that the public has a greater say in the most important decisions. Today those social movements that articulated this vision of freedom are largely demobilized and it rests primarily with the Democratic Party leadership to carry on their aspirations. The question is whether Obama and those around him still believe in these values, let alone are willing to defend them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aziz Rana.","Aziz Rana says GOP, Tea Party, Palin clear on defining freedom: free markets, autonomy .
Dems very bad at explaining how goals, like health reform, connect to personal liberty .

"ST. POELTEN, Austria (CNN)  -- A jury in Austria has found Josef Fritzl guilty of raping and imprisoning his daughter for more than two decades and sentenced him to life in prison. Josef Fritzl arrives for sentencing at the courthouse in St. Poelten on Thursday. It was the maximum sentence for the most serious charge Fritzl faced: one count of murder, for allowing one of the babies he fathered with his daughter to die shortly after birth. The eight-member jury returned a unanimous verdict on all counts. Fritzl, dressed in a gray suit, blue shirt and dark tie, stared blankly ahead and showed no emotion as the jury delivered its verdict. The 73-year-old had pleaded guilty to all charges on Wednesday, but Austrian law requires a jury to return a verdict as well. Fritzl will soon be moved to a detention facility for mentally abnormal offenders, where psychiatrists will evaluate him and decide on therapy. Until then, he will remain in a two-person cell in St. Poelten. The man who kept his crimes a secret for 24 years until he was exposed last year made a final, emotional apology to the court Thursday morning. Read blog on how Austria was reacting before sentencing . ""I am deeply sorry with all my heart for what I have done, but I cannot go back and change it,"" Fritzl told the court at St. Poelten, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) east of Amstetten, where he and his family lived. The jury found Fritzl guilty of incest, rape, enslavement and false imprisonment of his daughter Elisabeth. It also found him guilty of two assault charges and murder in the death of the baby, one of twins, which died 66 hours after birth. Fritzl initially pleaded not guilty to murder, enslavement, and one of the assault charges, and partly guilty to rape. He surprised his own lawyer by changing his plea Wednesday. Prosecutor Christiane Burkheiser urged the jury Thursday to return a murder conviction. She called Fritzl's admission of guilt a ploy. ""This was not a confession by the accused. It was a change in strategy,"" she told the court. Elisabeth Fritzl also wanted her father to be convicted, said her lawyer, Eva Plaz. Both sides accepted Thursday's verdict and Josef Fritzl refused the option to appeal, court officials said. He could be considered for parole in 15 years, when he would be 88, said court spokesman Franz Cutka, but the Ministry of Justice will decide whether to allow it. Fritzl's lawyer revealed Thursday that Elisabeth had been in court Tuesday, the second day of the trial. Defense attorney Rudolf Mayer said the elder Fritzl noticed his daughter's presence in the final hour of viewing Elisabeth's videotaped testimony. Mayer said he was not disappointed with the verdict because it was a ""logical consequence"" of his client's admission of guilt. He said life in prison is a ""very just sentence."" ""In my eyes, no man is a monster, regardless of what he's done,"" Mayer told the BBC. ""He's always a human, regardless of what he's done."" A technical expert testified at the trial that the underground chamber in which Fritzl kept his daughter and their offspring had low ceilings -- about 1.7 meters (5.5 feet) high -- and, for the first couple of years, only minimal sanitation. The cellar had no daylight or fresh air. Prosecutors said Fritzl closeted Elisabeth in the specially designed cellar in 1984, when she was 18, telling other family members that she had run away to join a cult. He kept her there for 24 years, authorities believe, repeatedly sexually assaulting her and fathering her seven children. Fritzl took three of the children upstairs to live with him and his wife, telling the family that the missing Elisabeth had dropped them off. Elisabeth and the remaining children never saw daylight, prosecutors said, and Fritzl went away for long periods, leaving them without food. To punish them, prosecutors said, Fritzl sometimes turned off the power in the cellar for up to 10 days. In addition, they alleged, Elisabeth was often sexually assaulted in front of the children. One of the babies -- a boy named Michael -- died shortly after birth. Prosecutors charged Fritzl with murder in his death because he did not receive medical care. Fritzl admitted Wednesday that he was in the cellar when the baby was born. He noticed the child was breathing heavily, he said, but he did not think the baby would die and decided not to seek help. Fritzl told the court he was probably responsible for the child's death and pleaded guilty to his murder. He had earlier pleaded not guilty to the charge but said he changed his mind after hearing Elisabeth's videotaped testimony. The prosecution said Thursday that Michael struggled for 66 hours before dying of respiratory problems. They said Fritzl knew what was happening but was indifferent. Authorities have said that Elisabeth and her children now have new identities and are in a secret location. Asked at a news conference why other family members have not testified, officials said they did not wish to. The case came to light in April 2008, when Elisabeth's then-19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill and ended up in the hospital. Hospital staff became suspicious and alerted police, who then discovered the family's plight in the cellar. CNN's Diana Magnay and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Josef Fritzl jailed for life after he was convicted of all charges including murder .

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Zarni Aung's not sure how he contracted HIV -- it may have been from a tainted needle or a sex worker. Either way, the virus saw his weight plunge below 40 kilograms before he left his home in Aunglan Township to seek help in Myanmar's largest city, Yangon. Now 34, Zarni Aung is working for MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) -- or Doctors without Borders -- as a counselor for HIV patients too scared to expose their illness for fear of being ostracized or ignored. ""I'm no longer afraid to speak out,"" he says in halted English at MSF headquarters, occasionally stopping to sip tea and get the words straight in his head. He's a singer who, at the height of his illness, was too sick to peform, but after his treatment clinched third place in Myanmar Music Idol, the country's version of American Idol. Just over one year ago, MSF issued an urgent plea for help to treat an estimated 85,000 Burmese people with HIV. At the time only a fraction were getting vital antiretroviral therapy (ART), creating heartbreaking decisions for doctors who had to choose who was treated and who was turned away. ""Every day we are confronted with the tragic consequences of these decisions: desperately sick people and unnecessary deaths,"" the head of MSF's Myanmar mission, Peter Paul de Groote, said in a report, ""Lives in the Balance,"" released in February 2012. It wasn't a new phenomenon. Back in 2008, the medical group issued an even more desperate call for help to halt Myanmar's HIV epidemic. The situation for sufferers was critical, it warned, due to a severe lack of ART. ""Unless ART provision is rapidly scaled-up, many more people will needlessly suffer and die,"" De Groote warned in the report ""A Preventable Fate."" At the time, of 240,000 estimated to be carrying the HIV virus, 76,000 were in urgent need of ART. Of those, only 11,000 people were being treated. Fast-forward to 2013 and the numbers tell the story of a dire situation brought back from the brink. Around 125,000 people are now estimated to need ART in Myanmar but money has been pledged to retreat 85% of them, around 106,000 people, said Dr. Khin Nyein Chan, MSF's medical coordinator in Yangon. It's due to the return of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which pulled its funding in 2011 due to a lack of donations. Just over $160 million has been pledged until the end of 2016 to pay for HIV treatment and prevention programs for people most at risk of falling ill. The return of funding follows the transition of power from the military junta that ruled Myanmar for 50 years to democratically elected President Thein Sein, who took office in March 2011. Since then, international sanctions have been lifted and the country's been working with foreign governments and delegations to repair decades of neglect. While new funding for HIV treatment is flowing into the country, MSF warns that extending healthcare to 106,000 people is a slow process. So far the medication is only reaching 50,000. ""We still need to overcome a lot of challenges ahead,""said Dr. Khin Nyein Chan. ""There is a need for capacity building, decentralizing the care delivery, and the stronger engagement of partners, including the Ministry of Health."" And there's another pressing issue: Eradicating the stigma associated with having HIV in Myanmar. That's where Zarni Aung comes in. In 2006, when he was first diagnosed, he was too scared to speak out for fear of people's reactions. He started attending group sessions at MSF and soon realized that he was one of the few people he could find the strength to talk. ""Most of the patients were depressed so I disclosed my status and experience to help support them,"" he said. He tells the story of an HIV patient whose family refused to attend his funeral, and of the HIV positive eight-year-old boy who went home crying from school after his teacher told him not to play with other children. Zarni Aung now gives talks in schools and to anyone else who will listen as part of the support group Myanmar Positive. His claims of discrimination against Myanmar's HIV patients are backed by a UNAIDS report released in 2011. The ""People Living with HIV Stigma Index"" found that 31% of Burmese respondents said that they had been excluded from social gatherings, including weddings, parties, funerals, because of their HIV status. It was the highest proportion of nine Asian countries surveyed, including Thailand, Pakistan and China. One quarter said, within the last 12 months, they had felt discriminated against by their own families, 45% said they had been verbally or physically assaulted and 78% said they were aware that people were talking about them behind their backs. One quarter felt suicidal and around the same number said discrimination had forced them to quit their jobs. Zarni Aung says attitudes are beginning to change, but it will take time and a change in government policy to protect the rights of HIV patients. But he has a powerful ally in the form of Burmese opposition leader and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who last month joined 200 people for a candlelight vigil to remember those who have died from AIDS-related illnesses. ""Respect for the human rights of people living with HIV must be promoted,"" she told the crowd. ""We also need to protect the people who live on the fringes of society who struggle every day to maintain their dignity and basic human rights. ""I believe that with true compassion -- the invisible cord that binds us to other human beings regardless of race, personal status, religion and national borders -- we can get results for all people."" Han Thar Nyein contributed to this report.","New funding means more Burmese HIV patients are receiving treatment .

"(The Frisky)  -- Mobile therapy apps are on the way. Just imagine -- you might not have to pay $200 an hour to talk about your problems. You can just pop out your iPhone and a virtual therapist can offer you some perspective. Real therapists speculate that mobile mental health apps will be a great addition to ongoing in-person therapy, but not a total substitution. Some therapy apps are being designed to help patients track moods or even predict psychotic breaks. The exciting thing is that virtual therapy will be available 24/7 unlike even the best therapists. Here are three new mobile therapy apps that are in the works. All that will be missing is the couch. App name: Mobile Therapy   Developed by: Dr. Margaret Morris, a clinical psychologist working for Intel   How it works: You can map your moods, energy levels, sleep patterns, activities, and food intake on a daily basis. Based on the info, the app will offer you therapeutic exercises like guided relaxations or suggestions about how to disengage from a stressful situation. The idea is that you look at your week in moods and see a connection about what's going on in your life and how it affects your mental state. Best for: Anyone. If you have severe problems or you are just a human being living your life this app could be helpful to gain self-awareness, insight, and develop strategies for dealing with stress. App name: Mobile Mood Diary   Developed by: Alan Delahunty, a psychotherapist from Ireland, and Mark Matthews at Trinity College in Dublin . How it works: This app is a support tool for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which helps change behavior by changing thoughts. An important component of CBT is daily homework, part of which involves patients charting their daily moods, energy levels, sleep patterns, activities, and thoughts. The patients can track this information and print out the mood diary to bring to weekly therapy sessions. Best for: Teenagers. It makes CBT homework more fun and engaging for them. Kind of like glorified texting. App name: CBT MobilWork . Developed by: Judy Callan at the University of Pittsburgh and scientists at Carnegie Mellon . How it works: This app lets patients check off CBT homework as it's completed and prompts and coaches the patient on to the next step. Best for: Adults with severe depression. They are hoping to expand this app to be used to treat anxiety, phobias, eating disorders, and schizophrenia.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- ""Go home!"" she yelled at me. ""Why don't you go back home to Mexico before you ruin this country like you ruined your own!"" I was standing in a crowd at the Music Midtown festival in Atlanta, where I live. A few minutes earlier I'd met a group of five people who'd been standing in front of me -- here from Mexico City -- and I had begun speaking Spanish with them. Atlanta has a growing Latino community, and I am actively involved. Whenever I get the chance to speak to someone in Spanish here, I introduce myself. My new acquaintances and I were talking about what a great time we were having and how remarkable the city of Atlanta was for bringing back the festival to Piedmont Park. And that's when I heard the yelling woman next to me. As if ""go home"" wasn't clear enough, the woman -- a 20-something Caucasian -- repeated the words in Spanish. ""Vete!"" I froze. I didn't quite know what to say, and I didn't want to believe she was talking to me or the group of people I had just met. As a third-generation Mexican-American growing up in Los Angeles, I had never encountered such overt racism. In fact, because my family was long since assimilated, among my Latino friends I was always considered the ""pocho"" or ""white boy"" of the group. (As I write this, a part of me knows somewhere in L.A., a friend of mine will be proud to know someone actually considered me Mexican enough to yell ""go home"" at me.) My Mexican friends remind me that I am American first, Mexican second and that my English is better than my Spanish. ""Yes,"" I tell them. ""But I can never walk into a room and be white."" Evidently, to some the brown color of my skin means I'm not even American. My friends and family tell me what I experienced that night is a microcosm of what is happening to Latinos across the country. You don't have to look hard to find it. In news stories, in political discourse, on talk radio, in everyday conversation it seems it has become OK to treat Latinos in a negative and antagonistic way -- whether they are new immigrants or longtime Americans. The anti-immigration legislation sweeping across the United States has made this plain. People in my Latino networks say they've noticed the change. And now I understand what they mean. Like many Americans whose grandparents or parents came here from somewhere else, I live at the intersection of my two cultures. I eat tacos, but I love cheeseburgers. I go salsa dancing, and listen to rock n' roll. I speak Spanish and English, and depending on the crowd, sometimes Spanglish. I love my country and my cultural community. My duality is my reality, just like the 50 million other Latinos in the United States. I have been luckier than many. Before this incident, the closest I'd ever come to blatant racism was in junior high. I was in the jazz band and played first trumpet. One day our jazz band teacher invited in his predecessor, a local legend who had made Eagle Rock High School's jazz program famous in the 1980s. The visiting instructor pointed me out and asked me to play him 16 bars of music. I did, but he quickly interrupted. ""Stop, stop, stop. I don't want to hear any of that mariachi music. This is jazz."" I didn't think anything of it. Instead I felt terrible that the legend standing in front of me didn't think I was good enough. I went home that night, and like every night, at 6:30 p.m. my family sat down for dinner to talk about our day. ""How was your day, Nicky?"" my dad asked. So I told him. Outraged, the next day he went to my principal and filed a formal complaint. The legend didn't come back to visit the jazz program again. Weeks later we received a letter in the mail from him apologizing for his insensitive comments. My family saved the letter. My father was hypersensitive to ethnic identity and deeply proud of his Latino heritage. The son of a naturalized immigrant from El Salvador and a Mexican mother from Texas, he grew up in Los Angeles during a time of racial tension. When I was young he would tell me stories of the race riots in his high school, violence against people of color, and awful accounts of the struggle he had to make it as a Mexican-American teen in the 1960s. He died when I was 17 years old, but one of the phrases he implanted in my mind before he passed was a statement activist Cesar Chavez made famous: . ""Si se puede"" -- ""Yes you can."" And now, here I was, at 28, with this stranger yelling at me to ""leave."" I stood there in the middle of a damp crowd on a late Atlanta evening, not comprehending, the wind still and the vibrations of Coldplay's ""Yellow"" filling the space in the air. I didn't say a thing. I didn't have to. The crowd around us looked in amazement at this woman. Some of them spoke up to her, telling her she was wrong to talk to us like that. The group of people from Mexico City looked at her in disgust and, realizing from the look on my face that I must not be accustomed to what I was hearing, they turned toward me to offer support. One of them, a young man, grabbed my hand and raised it high in the air. ""Estamos aqui,"" he said, which translates to ""We are here."" It was the ""Si se puede"" moment. The woman continued to taunt us for some minutes, but when we did not reciprocate her hatred, she stopped. The band played a few more songs before ending the set, and the crowd dispersed across the park into the Saturday evening. As I walked away, the woman and I locked eyes. ""I don't think you understand who you said that to,"" I told her. Thinking to myself, I am as American as you are. ""What,"" she said laughing. ""Are you some kind of celebrity or something?"" No. But like the Mexicans I was standing with, I am a human being. And I am home. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nick Valencia.","Nick Valencia says a woman yelled racist words at him at a concert in Atlanta .

"New York (CNN) -- A Pennsylvania woman, jailed after a photo surfaced of her 2-year-old daughter duct taped to a chair, has been granted bail, according to Delaware County court officials. Common Pleas Court Judge Frank Hazel released Caira Ferguson, 21, on the condition that she sees her child only under the supervision of child welfare officials. She posted 10% of $25,000 bail on Tuesday and is required to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, according to a Common Pleas Court spokeswoman. Ferguson must also complete a parenting class. ""She has no prior record, no mental health issues, no anger management issues,"" said Ferguson's lawyer, Vicki Herr. ""There is really no basis for her being confined without bail."" Ferguson was arrested and charged with endangering the welfare of a child, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment on February 16 after showing police a photo of her child bound to a plastic chair with duct tape. She revealed the photo as part of her claim that someone had stolen her identity, according to Chester Township police. The photo was posted on news and gossip blog mediatakeout.com and shows Ferguson standing next to her daughter, whose mouth is also duct-taped shut. It was taken in July, police said. Ferguson will live at her mother's Chester Township home, which is across the street from the house where her daughter is living with her godmother, Herr said. Ferguson is due back in court on Monday for a preliminary hearing, court officials said.","Police: Caira Ferguson showed them a photo of her girl bound to chair with duct tape .

"(CNN) -- A German opera house forced to ditch its Holocaust-themed staging of a Wagner opera after it horrified the opening night audience said Friday that the decision to perform it only as a concert had gone down well with the public. The concert version of the production, featuring only the orchestra and singers, was performed at the Oper Am Rhein in Duesseldorf for the first time Thursday night. Scenes involving a Nazi-era firing squad and gas chamber during the Saturday premiere had left members of the audience reeling -- with some so badly affected that they needed medical help. Oper Am Rhein said Thursday that it had been aware from the outset that director Burkhard Kosminski's modern production of Richard Wagner's ""Tannhauser"" was ""absolutely likely to arouse controversy."" But, it said, the effects had gone beyond controversy, with ""some scenes, especially the firing-squad sequence, which was staged with drastically realistic force"" apparently proving an ""intolerable burden for numerous members of the audience,"" both mentally and physically. As a result ""they were subsequently obliged to undergo medical treatment,"" it said. After due consideration, the opera house said, ""we have come to the conclusion that we cannot permit ourselves to undertake further responsibility for such an extreme effect caused by our artistic endeavors."" German newspaper Der Speigel said in its English-language version that the production depicted ""the character Tannhauser as a Nazi war criminal and it even included a gas chamber on stage."" In what was a particularly shocking scene, it said, ""nude actors are lowered to the floor on a cross made of glass cubes that are slowly filled with fog to represent the gas chambers."" A spokesman for Oper Am Rhein, Daniel Senzek, told CNN Friday that many people had appreciated the decision to stage the production as a concert only. The opera house has offered refunds for any ticket holders who want their money back. Some people have requested refunds for their tickets, Senzek said, but was unable to give exact numbers. Other people bought tickets especially to see the concert version of the performance Thursday, he added. Oper Am Rhein said it had tried to negotiate with Kosminski over his staging after the disastrous premiere but he refused to modify his concept ""for artistic reasons."" It added: ""Needless to say, we are obliged to respect the director's insistence on the protection of his artistic liberty."" The production was supposed to explore Wagner's anti-Semitism and the influence the composer would have on Nazi ideology, Der Spiegel said. Tannhauser, which had its world premiere in 1845, is usually seen as a romantic work combining mythology and history.","The opera house restaged the show as a concert after opening-night complaints .

"(EW.com) -- There will be less boobs at next year's Oscars. Seth MacFarlane, whose irreverent hosting performance at the 2013 Academy Awards was controversial but a ratings hit, announced today that he wouldn't be taking the stage again next year. ""Traumatized critics exhale: I'm unable to do the Oscars again. Tried to make it work schedule-wise, but I need sleep,"" he tweeted Monday afternoon. ""However, I highly recommend the job, as Zadan and Meron are two of the most talented producers in the business. My suggestion for host is Joaquin Phoenix."" MacFarlane is currently directing and appearing in ""A Million Ways to Die in the West,"" a stud-studded Western headlined by Amanda Seyfried and Charlize Theron. MacFarlane's withdrawal will likely appease some members of the Hollywood community who didn't appreciate his humor â€” which drew criticism that his jokes ranged from juvenile to misogynistic. But despite the tsk-tsking by some, ratings for the show were up significantly, including an 11 percent jump in the demo. Joaquin Phoenix is likely not in the mix to succeed MacFarlane (unfortunately), but the Academy is now free to go in a different direction. Perhaps they could appease some of last year's critics with a female host... or two. See original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Massive flash flooding Friday killed one person and forced the rescuing of trapped motorists and the evacuation of at least two neighborhoods in Charlotte, North Carolina, authorities said. Charlotte received 3 inches of rain, with more in some places, said city fire department spokesman Capt. Robert Brisley. The department was evacuating two neighborhoods next to flooded creeks near downtown, he said. Authorities received a call Friday afternoon about people being in McMullen Creek, which is swollen because of the rains, Brisley said. One person was able to climb out, one died and another is still missing, he said. It was not immediately clear why the people were in the creek, nor how the one person died, though Brisley said the death was flood related. Authorities and responders were carrying out at least 16 rescues of people trapped in flooded vehicles, Brisley said. The city was under a flash-flood watch. Rain began to fall about lunchtime, with one gauge registering about 5 to 6 inches about mid-afternoon, said Jennifer Frost, spokeswoman for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services. In her nine years of working in the area, Frost said, she ""never seen anything like this before."" ""It came down very fast,"" she added. ""It got so dark downtown, it looked like night."" Parts of Interstate highways 77, 485 and 85 were flooded and temporarily shut down during the storm, she said. One hotel lobby interior was turned into a waterfall as heavy rain accumulated on the roof and poured through light fixtures, collapsing a desktop-size section of the ceiling, according to one hotel visitor who shared his video of the spectacle with CNN. CNN's Dave Alsup, Joe Sutton and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: One person is still missing .

"(CNN) -- Elephant seals equipped with electronic tags and robotic mini submarines using sonar were just two projects during the International Polar Year (IPY) that aimed to investigate the effects of global warming in polar regions. An elephant seal with a custom-designed electronic tag. The tags fell off when the animals molted. The fourth IPY, which began in March 2007 and actually covered two full years, ended last month, after 160 scientific projects were undertaken by researchers from over 60 countries. A joint project by the International Council for Science (ICSW) and World Meteorological Organization. (WMO), the IPY hoped to spearhead efforts to better monitor and understand the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The project had international funding of about US$ 1.2 billion over the two-year period. ""The International Polar Year 2007/2008 came at a crossroads for the planet's future,"" said Michel Jarraud, Secretary-General of WMO in a press statement. ""The new evidence resulting from polar research will strengthen the scientific basis on which we build future actions."" Researchers found that in the Arctic during the summers of 2007 and 2008, the minimum extent of year-round sea ice decreased to its lowest level since satellite records began 30 years ago. According to a report published by the IPY organizing committee in February, their research indicates that global warming is affecting Antarctica in ways not previously identified. Other evidence of climate change came from IPY research vessels that found warming waters in the Southern Ocean and an increase in melting ice that is creating fresher bottom water around the coast of Antarctica. Among efforts to study the effects of climate change on Antarctica, was aNorwegian Polar Institute project to study marine mammals. Custom-designed tags were attached to elephant seals to study the animals' habits, although researcher realized the tags could also help with field research on climate change. The electronic tags -- which fell off when the seals molted -- sent back data on temperature and salinity the oceans around Antarctica, particularly around the Fimbul Ice Shelf in east Antarctica. While ice-shelf melt has been recorded in the west of Antarctica, scientists are concerned that it could happen in the east as well. Another project to study the underside of an Antarctic glacier deployed an autonomous robot submarine. The team from the U.S. and British Antarctic Survey sent the ""Autosub"" on six missions to study the Pine Island Glacier and how changes in ocean temperature were affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Using sonar, the submarine picked its way around the glacier and sent back data that created three-dimensional maps that scientists used to determine where and how the warmth of the ocean waters was melting the glacier's base. ""If [the West Antarctic Ice Sheet] were to melt completely, global sea levels would rise by as much as 5 meters,"" said Stan Jacobs, the U.S. lead scientist on the project. ""Because so little is known about ice-sheet behavior, this research will take us a step further in understanding how ice sheets will contribute to sea-level rise.""","Scientists using robot submarines and elephant seals equipped with electronic tags .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea's bipolar swings between nuclear provocation and fawning overtures for talks now form part of a familiar pattern. As recently as March, Pyongyang was warning the United States of ""a simmering nuclear war"" and cut its hotline with South Korea. But in the past week, media reports say it has been taking down the ubiquitous anti-American billboards that line the streets of the North Korean capital, suggesting that dialogue, after all, may be possible. The well-worn formula of ratcheting up the tension and then standing back to see what concessions can be extracted from a rattled international community was a favored tactic of Kim Jong Un's father Kim Jong Il who was a master of brinkmanship. But with China and North Korea holding strategic talks in Beijing on Wednesday, analysts are asking whether this time, everything could be different. Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, project director at the International Crisis Group, says that while there are new elements to the discourse between North Korea and the international community, little of substance has changed. ""It seems to be the usual dance where we are in the charm offensive period and North Korea is reaching out for talks,"" Kleine-Ahlbrandt said, adding that North Korea was fully conscious that each party to the previous six-party talks between North Korea, South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia had been pursuing their agenda. ""I think it's plausible that North Korea is trying to see if they can divide some of the six parties because they realize that the Chinese are looking for talks primarily and I think they realize that the U.S. wants conditions for talks."" The U.S. has previously stated that concrete movement on North Korea's U.N. obligations to de-nuclearize were a pre-condition of talks. She said the feeling in Washington, however, was that the U.S. was not rushing towards talks. ""I think that China, meanwhile, wants to inflict limited pain on North Korea to get them to cease provocations and to get back to talks and to frankly stop making China lose face,"" she said. China -- which committed as many three million troops to secure North Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s -- is Pyongyang's closest ally but has grown increasingly impatient with its Stalinist neighbor, repeatedly urging it to rejoin the six-party negotiations. Kleine-Ahlbrandt said there was a sense that North Korea had overplayed its hand. ""This escalation and brinkmanship wasn't done with any of the calibration that we're used to seeing during the Kim Jong Il era, which managed to (provoke) but gave China the ability to maintain its position,"" she said. Nevertheless, she said the sense in China was that North Korea was a wayward child and had to be brought into line and part of this could be urging the United States to adopt a more flexible position on talks. ""Their (China's) anger over North Korea is very different from our anger,"" she added. ""Beijing believes that North Korea's insecurity needs to be alleviated, not intensified."" Lee Jung-Hoon, Associate Professor of International Relations at Yonsei University in Seoul, said the fact that other six-party members were talking with each other -- notably the United States and South Korea and most recently China and the United States -- was making Pyongyang apprehensive. ""They've been taken aback by this series of summit meetings,"" Lee said. ""They don't want to be pushed into a corner and I think that's what they're feeling at this juncture especially since Xi Jinping has been very adamant about the de-nuclearization of North Korea."" He said that recent rhetoric coming out of North Korea showed the regime to be increasingly desperate. ""I do believe that the regime is extremely unstable and insecure, therefore it's making all these frantic efforts,"" Lee said. ""Even them wanting to hang on to nuclear weapons is an act of desperation as well -- they believe it's the only thing that would ensure the regime's survival."" China is currently banking on its provinces bordering North Korea -- known as the Three Northeast Province -- becoming a new economic zone and is plowing billions into infrastructure development in the region. Lee said China believes that part of the reason that the zone has not been as successful as planned has been due to North Korea. ""To develop that whole region is something that China very much wants to kick-start,"" he said. ""Now there are voices within China raising the question, 'Why are we holding onto this relic regime which is going against China's national interests?'"" ""I don't' think we're looking at a major overhaul of China's North Korea policy but I think they are beginning to think of the possibility of 'what if?' and how will this play out as far as China's economic development is concerned.""","North Korea swings between provocation and negotiation .

"DAVIE, Florida (CNN) -- It's 7 p.m. Homework is done, and cheerleading practice is over. Miley Cyrus plays the popular Hannah Montana on a hit Disney Channel show. Sisters Cara and Casey Von Minden, and their cousin, Amanda Flaherty, are more than comfortable on their couch in Davie, Florida. They're doing what millions of tweens across America are doing -- they're watching, ""Hannah Montana."" ""We didn't miss, like, any episodes of her, unless something really big was happening,"" said Cara, 12. The hit Disney Channel show -- which stars 14-year-old Miley Cyrus and her country singer dad, Billy Ray Cyrus -- is about a teenage girl who's a typical high-schooler by day but has a secret pop-star alter ego by night. If you have a child between 6 and 14, there's a pretty good chance you know Hannah. Nielsen Media research says more than two-thirds of U.S. kids in that age group watched the show in the third quarter of 2007. So when Disney announced a 54-city concert tour, starting October 18 in St. Louis, Missouri, it was an obvious birthday present for Cara. But the day tickets went on sale, Cara's mom, Maureen Von Minden, found she was shut out before she got started. Ticket brokers swooped up thousands of tickets within minutes of them becoming available online and shut out legitimate Hannah followers. Desperate fans found they would have to pay brokers $350 to $2,000 for the $63 concert tickets.  Watch Billy Ray Cyrus talk about the soaring prices » . Von Minden lives in Florida -- in ""Hurricane Alley."" ""We're hurricane people,"" she said. ""It's price gouging ... price gouging at its best. It would have been my daughters' first concert for both of them, and we were looking forward as a family to going, and we can't,"" she said. Concert promoters saw the phenomenon happening all over the country. ""Absolutely every show sold out within the same amount of time,"" said Debra Rathwell of AEG Live, the company handling the concerts for Disney. ""Whether you were in Moline or Omaha or New York or Los Angeles, it sold out in minutes."" Ticket brokers use the Web to buy sports and concert tickets ahead of real fans, creating an almost $2 billion secondary market. ""Up to 80 percent of inquiries of tickets come from these brokers,"" said Gary Bongiavanni, editor-in-chief of Pollstar, a weekly media magazine that tracks concerts. ""The average fan is competing with a pro whose mission is to score these tickets. Fans are at a disadvantage,"" Bongiavanni said. The profits go to brokers, not the artists or promoters. CNN tried to contact several different ticket brokers that did not return phone calls or e-mails. But the National Association of Ticket Brokers did return calls. ""When a ticket is hot, people sell them,"" said general counsel Gary Adler. Only five states -- Michigan, North Carolina, Kentucky, Massachusetts and Rhode Island -- limit brokering, according to the National Association of Ticket Brokers. Regulations vary. For example, in Rhode Island, the cap on the amount of the increase is $3, or 10 percent above face value, whichever is greater. Ticketmaster says online some brokers cheat to beat the system and the fans. Ticketmaster has filed suit in U.S. Federal District Court in Los Angeles against a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, software company that it claims developed software for ticket brokers that illegally ""allows them to cut in line"", said Ticketmaster vice president Joe Freeman. The software company, RMG Technologies, denies that allegation. It says the company should not be held accountable because Ticketmaster is getting paid for the tickets it sells. ""This may be the only time in history ... that any seller sued its customers for paying them too much money,"" the attorney for RMG Technologies wrote in court documents. Promoters and artists have tried different methods to recoup lost revenue. For the Hannah Montana tour, AEG Live and Ticketmaster held an auction for tickets in some cities. But the auction, AEG concedes, was not for the average fan. The minimum bid for a single front-row seat at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was $2,605. ""... If the tickets go to brokers, then they pay a lot of money for them. And if the brokers are going to end up with the tickets, then the artist should get paid for them,""said Rathwell, whose company is handling the Montana tour. The Hannah Montana concert ticket debacle also has gotten the attention of law enforcement. Attorneys general in Arkansas and Missouri have filed a suit accusing ticket brokers of illegally reselling tickets to Montana's ""Best of Both Worlds Tour."" ""When you allow the hijacking of the market, it's literally the worst of both worlds. You get charged too much, and there's no access for the locals,"" said Jay Nixon, Missouri's attorney general. Experts say Disney and the Hannah Montana franchise are victims, too, but they see nothing that will hurt the Disney brand. Billy Ray Cyrus, Miley's dad, has commented on the issue. ""There is a law of supply and demand, and ... quite frankly, it's beyond our control. We put together a concert tour, and I was really excited about Miley going out and playing for the fans,"" he said. ""That's what her tour is about. It's for the kids and all the families that are watching Hannah Montana."" A Disney representative told CNN, ""It's really unfortunate, and there is nothing we can do to stop it. These inflated costs only benefit the brokers. We were very pleased to hear that various law enforcement agencies are beginning to look into these practices."" Experts say that unless ticket broker prices drop as concert dates approach, there will be sold-out arenas with empty seats. Lawsuits will not put smiles on the faces of disappointed kids and parents. But Casey, 10, said she has a suggestion on how to afford Montana tickets, and it falls on her 12-year-old sister: ""Cara needs to get a job!""

"New Delhi (CNN) -- An American woman who authorities say was gang-raped by three men after visiting a popular Hindu temple in northern India was resting in her hotel Wednesday under the protection of a police officer while investigators searched for her attackers. The 31-year-old woman was raped after leaving the Vashishth Temple site around 1 a.m. Tuesday, according to police. After failing to find a taxi to take her back to her hotel, she accepted a ride from three men who took her to a wooded area where they raped and robbed her, authorities said. The woman was examined at a hospital and released, according to police Superintendent Vinod Kumar Dhawan. She was staying at a hotel in Manali with friends, according to authorities. A police escort has been assigned to protect her, they said. The woman was unable to provide significant details about the men or the truck they were driving, making it difficult for police to make an arrest, Dhawan said. Regardless, a special investigative team had been formed and had been carrying out raids at potential hideouts, Dhawan said. Authorities had arrested three men in the case, but the woman said they were not the men who attacked her, according to police. It was unclear if the men, who had been questioned to gain possible leads, remained in custody Wednesday. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi confirmed diplomatic officials had been in touch with local authorities about the case, but declined to talk further about it. Violent rapes in India have made headlines recently. A 4-year-old girl died after being sexually assaulted by a 35-year-old man in Ghansaur in April, and a 5-year-old girl was allegedly raped two weeks earlier in New Delhi. Two men were arrested in that case. Six men are facing rape and burglary charges after the rape of a Swiss tourist in March. And a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi in December and later died of her injuries. Five men were charged in the case; one has since died in prison. That attack spurred protests across the nation, where most women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations.","NEW: Police arrest three men, but woman says they were not her attackers .

"Paris (CNN) -- Australia has been revealed as the world's happiest industrialized nation for the third year running, based on criteria including satisfaction, work-life balance, income and housing, a survey released Tuesday has found. The so-called ""lucky country"" beat Sweden and Canada to take the top spot in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Better Life Index. The country which comes out on top can be found here, if all criteria are weighted evenly. Australia has remained largely immune from the global financial crisis, with its economy growing on average 3.5% over the last 20 years to 2012, according to the CIA Factbook. The economy of the natural resource-rich nation has been buoyed by strong demand from Asia and China, while its robust financial sector has helped combat the global downturn. Such growth is in stark contrast to recessions which have gripped Europe and the U.S. since the financial crisis exploded in 2007. Read more: Opinion: Austerity is killing us . Australia's employment levels, at 73% of those aged 15 to 64, are above the OECD average of 66%. Average household disposable income sits at $28,884, more than the OECD average of $23,047 and despite Australians working an average 83 hours less a year. Life expectancy, at 82 years, is two years higher than the OECD average of 80 years and satisfaction, at 84%, is higher than the 80% global average. In its report, the OECD said Australians felt ""a strong sense of community and high levels of civic participation,"" with 94% of people feeling like they knew someone to rely on should they need help. Sweden came second in the survey, with the same life expectancy as Australia but a lower disposable income of $26,242. Employment for those aged between 15 and 64, sits at 74%, and in general, Swedes are ""more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average,"" the survey found. According to the report, 85% of people said they had more positive experiences on an average day, such as pride and enjoyment, than negatives ones such as pain or boredom. Read more: U.S.'s happiest, saddest states . Canada was ranked third, with 72% of those aged between 15 and 64 employed, and an average household disposable income of $28,194. The OECD found the country has a strong sense of community but ""only moderate levels"" of civic participation. All three top countries all had a considerable gap between the rich and the poor, however, with the top 20% of the population earning between four and six times as much as the bottom 20%. The OECD creates the list using eleven criteria, including housing, education, health, income, and civic engagement.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid put proposed gun legislation on pause Thursday, setting it aside for now after the defeat a day earlier of major provisions sought by President Barack Obama and Democrats in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre. The move emphasized the solid victory for the National Rifle Association and its conservative Republican allies in what Obama called ""round one"" of the fight for tougher gun laws. It also shifted the gun debate from details of particular proposals to political sniping by both sides in an attempt to generate public support on the divisive issue. ""The next stage is blame avoidance,"" noted Darrell West, the vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ""Each side will seek to blame the other for the failure to address this important problem."" In announcing his temporary shelving of the gun legislation, Reid criticized Republicans for orchestrating Wednesday's defeat of expanded background checks on gun buyers, a top priority of Obama and Democrats that national polls show is supported by about 90% of Americans. He said Obama agreed with him that ""the best way to keep working towards passing a background check bill is to hit pause and freeze the background check bill where it is."" ""This debate is not over,"" the Nevada Democrat declared on the Senate floor, adding that the Republican opposition to expanded background checks was ""not sustainable"" in the face of public support for the measure. On Wednesday, Obama angrily accused Senate Republicans of doing the NRA's bidding in opposing a bipartisan compromise that would expand background checks for private transactions at gun shows and all Internet sales. In unusually harsh language, he accused the NRA and its allies of spreading lies about the compromise drafted by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania as part of a campaign to defeat it. A litany of supporters of tougher gun laws also condemned Republicans on Thursday, including a group of mayors led by New York's Michael Bloomberg and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting attack. Conservative GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas responded Thursday by condemning Obama for taking ""the low road"" in the debate. Speaking on the Senate floor, Cornyn tried to position Republicans as the ones seeking new gun laws by challenging Reid and Democrats to work with them instead of putting the measure aside. He also sought to distance himself from the gun lobby, declaring he worked for the citizens of Texas rather than the NRA and insisting that ""those of us who did not agree with the president's proposals are not being intimidated."" ""It's absolutely false to say it comes down to politics,"" Cornyn said. After the Senate voted down a series of amendments Wednesday, including watered-down measures to expand background checks and ban some semi-automatic firearms, it passed two amendments Thursday to the bill Reid later shelved. One was a GOP plan to protect the privacy of gun owners while the other was a bipartisan proposal to strengthen mental health programs. The decision by Reid indicated that he wants to see if calls for increased public pressure can influence more Republicans to defy the NRA, which scores legislators on their voting records and seeks to influence election campaigns involving candidates it supports or opposes. Wednesday's votes showed the challenge Democrats face. The compromise on expanded background checks forged by Manchin and Toomey, both with A-rated voting records from the NRA, failed on a 54-46 vote. It needed 60 votes to pass under an agreement reached by Senate leaders that applied to all the amendments. Four Republicans broke from the NRA's position to support the background check plan, while four Democrats from pro-gun states offset them by opposing it. Reid also voted ""no"" in a procedural move giving him the ability to reintroduce his party's top priority for a gun package at a later date. In other votes Wednesday, Republican proposals received stronger support. For example, a proposal by Cornyn that would have made state permits to carry concealed weapons acceptable throughout the country failed on a 57-43 vote. To Erica Lafferty, the daughter of the principal of the Newtown, Connecticut, school who was killed along with 20 first-graders and five other educators in the December attack, the Senate result amounted to inaction in the face of a national tragedy. ""The next time there's a mass shooting and they're asked what they did to prevent it, they're going to have to say nothing,"" she said. On the other side, the NRA's Chris Cox called the expanded background check proposal ""misguided,"" saying it would not reduce violent crime ""or keep our kids safe in their schools."" In the House, some Democrats and Republicans are proposing a measure similar to the Manchin-Toomey compromise defeated by the Senate. While its chances appear remote, based on the chamber's GOP majority, Obama and Democrats urged people to insist that their elected leaders pass the background check measure that has strong public support. ""You need to let your representatives in Congress know that you are disappointed, and if they don't act this time, you will remember come election time,"" Obama said. Republican opponents of the new gun laws parroted the NRA position that expanding background checks would be a step toward a national gun registry and eventual federal confiscation of firearms, a claim that Obama and sponsors of the compromise called false. Some opponents argued the language of the compromise would burden law-abiding gun owners seeking to sell their guns privately over the Internet. Cornyn and others called for a more limited bill that would focus on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and people adjudicated as mentally ill, rather than seeking to expand background checks beyond current limits. Democrats responded that such an argument was contradictory, because the expanded background checks would prevent criminals and the mentally ill from obtaining firearms. ""It's inconceivable to me that someone could believe that you can keep guns away from criminals and the dangerously mentally ill without at a minimum having a background check,"" said Rep. Mike Thompson of California, who was leading the Democratic gun law effort in the House. The debate over gun laws is not going away, according to West, the Brookings analyst. ""I expect this issue to remain on the public agenda,"" he said, ""because shootings happen all the time and large numbers still favor tougher background checks.""","NEW: Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will formally nominate James Comey, a top Justice Department official during the Bush administration, to head the FBI, a White House official said on Thursday. The announcement is expected at a White House ceremony on Friday. If confirmed by the Senate, Comey would replace Robert Mueller, who is leaving in September after leading the bureau for 12 years. Comey is a former prosecutor who worked in New York and Virginia, where his caseload included terrorism, organized crime and fraud. Comey served as a deputy attorney general during the Bush administration, a role for which he has received both praise and criticism from outside groups. Comey testified to a Senate committee in 2007 that he considered resigning his high-profile position over a disagreement three years earlier about the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program. Government officials had told CNN that Comey had ""vigorously opposed"" aspects of the warrantless wiretapping program and refused to sign off on its continued use. The program was eventually reauthorized. The White House official pointed to the incident as an illustration of Comey's character. The official said in a statement that he was ""one of our nation's most skilled and respected national security and law enforcement professionals"" who has demonstrated ""toughness, integrity and principle."" The appointment comes as the Obama administration wrestles with new controversy surrounding NSA surveillance involving phone records and e-mail. Human rights groups have criticized Comey's alleged support of other controversial Bush-era national security policies such as indefinite detention and detainee treatment programs like waterboarding. CNN first confirmed in May the president's plans to nominate Comey, but at the time White House officials refused to confirm that the president had made a selection in his search for a new leader of the FBI.

"(CNN) -- World champion Jorge Lorenzo trimmed the lead of this season's MotoGP pacesetter Dani Pedrosa with his second successive race victory on Sunday, overcoming scorching hot conditions in Spain. Pedrosa had set a lap record in Saturday's qualifying for the Catalunya Grand Prix, but was upstaged from the start by his fellow Spaniard and had to settle for second place as he spent most of the race holding off his rookie Honda teammate Marc Marquez. Lorenzo followed up his victory in Italy two weeks ago as the Yamaha rider moved to within seven points of Pedrosa after his third triumph in the sixth of 18 races on the 2013 calendar. The 26-year-old from Mallorca also won at Montmelo last year, and in 2010 when he went on to clinch his first world title in motorcycling's elite class. ""To be honest I didn't expect to win,"" Lorenzo said after registering his 26th career victory, putting him seventh on the all-time list. ""I knew I had some chance, but not like in Mugello where I was more convinced we could get the victory. It was really difficult physically as it was the hottest race of the year. I kept pushing 100% all race because any mistake would have been a disaster. ""Because I was tough mentally and never gave up, I could open up a little gap in the last five laps that was enough to win."" Pedrosa, who is from the city of Sabadell in Catalonia province, has now been runner-up three times in his home race, which he won in 2008. ""I had to ride a defensive race for most of it as Marc was really attacking me,"" Pedrosa said. ""It was not a perfect race for me as I was never close enough to Jorge to pass him. It's not a good feeling from this race but still I am relieved to be in the overall lead."" Marquez, who started sixth on the grid, bounced back from his crash-ruined weekend at Mugello as he claimed his fifth podium position this season to stay third in the championship -- 30 points behind Pedrosa. Seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi returned to form with fourth place, having failed to finish his home event in Italy after finishing 12th in France the previous race. ""Race by race, apart form the unlucky times especially like Mugello, we grow up and I am able to ride the bike in a better way,"" he said. ""We still have some challenges, especially in the first part of the race where I still don't have the right setting to push to the maximum."" Germany's Stefan Bradl was fifth on a Honda ahead of Britain's Bradley Smith -- who achieved a career-best finish for Monster Yamaha Tech 3 -- and Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso. Spain's Aleix Espargaro was eighth for Aprilla while U.S. veteran Colin Edwards was ninth on a Kawasaki ahead of Italian Michele Pirro on another Ducati. Monster Yamaha Tech 3's Cal Crutchlow had started from second on the grid, but the British rider crashed out on the 10th lap along with Ducati's former world champion Nicky Hayden to be among eight retirements.","Jorge Lorenzo closes to within seven points of MotoGP leader Dani Pedrosa .

"(CNN) -- He's still missing. The seemingly never-ending search for the remains of missing Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa hit another dead end Tuesday when soil results taken from the grounds of a home in Michigan showed no evidence that human remains were buried on the property. Two soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban Detroit community of Roseville last week after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after Hoffa disappeared in 1975. The samples were taken from beneath a storage shed and sent to a lab at Michigan State University for tests to determine the presence of human remains. ""The samples submitted for examination showed no signs of human decomposition,"" a statement from Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said Tuesday. It is the latest act in the on-again, off-again search for Hoffa, whose disappearance 35 years ago captured the public imagination. Hoffa, then 62, was last seen on July 30, 1975, outside the Detroit-area Machus Red Fox restaurant. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Anthony Giacalone and Genovese crime family figure Anthony Provenzano, who was also a chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey. Giacalone died in 1982; Provenzano died in 1988 in prison. The tipster, a former gambler, once did business with a man tied to Giacalone, said Dan Moldea, author of ""The Hoffa Wars."" Moldea said he first spoke to the tipster in March and then sent him to police. Vanished Hoffa still fascinates after almost 40 years . Berlin said the ""timeline doesn't really add up"" because the tipster said he went to the house to repay a bookie -- who didn't live at that address until years after Hoffa disappeared. Still, the man said he thought he saw what could have been a body taken into the shed. Moldea said it seemed unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site, in full view of the neighborhood. And if a body had been buried there, little would remain, he said. ""This is kind of like an open wound that won't go away,"" Berlin said Monday. ""Every couple of years this happens, and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it."" Hoffa was one of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded enormous political sway. He was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971 on condition he not attempt to get back into the union movement before 1980. Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano, but Hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the FBI. Giacalone and Provenzano later told the FBI that no meeting had been scheduled. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Police and the FBI have searched for Hoffa intermittently. In September 2001, the FBI found DNA that linked Hoffa to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance. In 2004, authorities removed floorboards from a Detroit home to look for traces of blood, as former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran claimed in a biography that he had shot Hoffa. Sheeran died in 2003. Two years later, the FBI razed a horse barn in Michigan following what it called ""a fairly credible lead."" Urban lore long suggested that Hoffa was buried around the end zone at the former Giants Stadium in New Jersey. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","Test results were negative for human remains .

"(CNN) -- Susan Rice, who has been named President Barack Obama's third national security adviser, probably should have been his first. Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a former assistant secretary of state for Africa during the Clinton administration, was among the first national security figures to join the Obama campaign. She led the national security team during the campaign and the transition. Few others in the administration are as close to the president as she is. The last few months have also shown that Rice has the deep and unwavering loyalty of a president who is often seen to be too cool and aloof for his own good. After her television appearances in the wake of the Benghazi, Libya, attacks made her a lightning rod for criticism, he nonetheless drove forward in his attempt to name her secretary of state. When that didn't work -- the opposition was too heated, the timing wasn't right -- he didn't give up, but instead set in motion the events that led to her being named his top national security aide Wednesday. Of all the things on Rice's resume -- her blue-chip academic background, time at the National Security Council, the State Department, the Brookings Institution and the United Nations -- what counts the most is this relationship with the president. Obama reshapes national security team, rankles GOP . The world knows they are close, and that will immediately give her great power both inside the bureaucracy and in capitals worldwide. (I know Rice well; we both served in the Clinton administration, and she worked with a company I ran afterward. She is among the best allies a person could have and among the people you would least like to have as an enemy. She is warm, too, has a ready sense of humor and a ready command of the tools needed for the niceties of diplomacy and inter-agency schmoozing.) Nonetheless, Rice is going to face a number of major challenges. First, she will have to dial back the bravado and contentiousness that have marked her tenure at the United Nations. Her sharp elbows and quick wit often turned into sharp rebukes that left some of her diplomatic counterparts bruised. That may work when muscling policies through the U.N. Security Council, but the National Security Council is a different business. Her counterparts there, at State, Defense, the military and the intelligence community, have substantial egos and individual, not to mention institutional, agendas. If Rice appears to be muscling them or if she is seen not as an honest broker but a rival, tensions could result. The most successful national security advisers -- such as Brent Scowcroft -- have done their best work in the background. Some, like Tom Donilon, carve out important roles that take them to foreign capitals, where they speak on the president's behalf to key leaders. But even in those instances, it is important that the national security adviser be seen by colleagues as staying in his or her lane, steering clear of their functions -- for example, secretary of state as principal spokesperson on foreign affairs, and defense secretary as principal spokesperson on military issues. Even Rice's closeness to the president can be a trap. Former national security adviser Condoleezza Rice was extremely close to President George W. Bush, but that led her to devote too much of her time to the job of staffing for the president and not enough to the important NSC work of managing what was called long ago ""the policy hill."" That designation referred to the part of the job that involves tapping all the executive branch agencies to formulate policy options and recommendations for the president and then carefully ensuring the implementation of the policies ultimately chosen by those agencies. Susan Rice's new position is made more complex by the fact that today's NSC staff is more than 30 times larger than it was in the Kennedy years, almost 10 times the size of Henry Kissinger's NSC and by far the biggest in history, at almost 400 people. She will have to deal with a sprawling bureaucracy, the economic agencies that play key roles in so many national security issues today, the politics -- and being national security adviser. It will be by far the most demanding management job Rice has ever faced. But the biggest obstacles to her ensuring that Obama leaves office with a solid foreign policy record, come from the problems we face overseas. While the signature successes of killing Osama bin Laden and winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are behind this administration, deep unrest continues in those countries. It continues, too, in Libya, where Rice was instrumental in pushing U.S. intervention; across the turbulent Middle East; in Africa, where Rice brings special insights and experience; and in the complexities of managing the shifting balance of power in Asia. No matter how good the policy process she shepherds, the fact is that we live in a messy world at a time when the United States is unable or unwilling to exert force as it once did, when our allies are similarly inward looking, due to economic stresses, and our enemies are shape-shifters embracing new technologies and techniques -- and, in places such as Syria, very hard to distinguish from those we might support. Rice is the most natural choice for the NSC job, and she comes to it battle tested by her experiences at the United Nations and in the political crucible, post-Benghazi. She knows her team and all the issues. She has the president's full trust and backing. She has shown that she is not afraid to lean in, encourage risk taking, embrace the strategic use of U.S. power, amplified and validated by multilateral initiatives. And as she will soon discover, for all that, even the most powerful people in the most powerful nation in the history of the planet often find themselves at the mercy of international events beyond their control. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf: Susan Rice is a natural choice for national security adviser .

"(CNN) -- Syria is heading to an ""intolerable situation"" according to Turkey's hyperactive Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, whose country is at the forefront of global efforts to engineer the downfall of the Bashar Al-Assad leadership. Less than two years ago, relations were diametrically different. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan considered Assad a close friend and paraded Syria as the epitome of its much vaunted but now defunct ""zero problems with the neighbors"" policy to encourage rapprochement with Middle Eastern nations. Trade across their 850-kilometer border blossomed tenfold, security cooperation against the Kurdistan Workers' Party -- a militant Kurdish group conducting a violent separatist campaign in Turkey -- flourished and mutual visa restrictions were lifted. This transformation in ties should not be surprising in retrospect. For Turkey and Syria never enjoyed a strategic relationship as much as a convergence of interests triggered by the Iraq war in 2003 to stymie an independent Kurdistan in northern Iraq. Similarly, both leaderships found common cause against Israel. Their relationship was merely tactical and psychological bereft of common values. Then the eruption of the Arab awakening upended the stability in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen and eventually Syria thereby unleashing long simmering sectarian tensions to the surface. Assad's security and intelligence forces dominated by fellow minority Alawites (a syncretic and mystical offshoot of Shia Islam) confronted a largely Sunni popular revolt. Erdogan, a devout Sunni Muslim, did not hesitate to side with the anti-Assad masses. Gone are the days where Turkey defended Iranian nuclear endeavors and cooperated closely with it on Iraq. In its stead, Turkey patched once frosty relations with Washington jointly calling on Assad to resign, solidified the partnership with Gulf Arab countries and adopted a more muscular and robust approach towards Iran. Washington's cooperation with regional players such as Turkey is a good example of what U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton coined ""smart power"" in play to avoid committing scarce resources in money and soldiers as it disengages from Afghanistan and Iraq. Turkey's anti-Assad inclination stems from its sectarian sympathies with the Syrian protesters, its desire to project Turkish influence in the Middle East and to restrain the regional ambitions of rival Iran. On the other hand, the U.S. seeks to degrade the Iranian nuclear program and to guarantee the security of Israel and the Gulf Arab states. Despite the toughening rhetoric against Damascus, there is no hiding the fact that Turkey's choices are severely limited. Russia and China will thwart further U.N. initiatives, the Arab League looks exhausted, and the positions of the pro-Assad and anti-Assad alliances are entrenched. At the heart of stalemate is the future of the Assad dynasty. Turkey and its friends strongly favor regime change while Assad and his allies demand regime stability. How to square this conundrum is testing the limits of Turkish diplomacy. One possibility -- which is most favored by Turkey -- is a negotiated solution. Ankara proposed on Wednesday an international conference to end the violence in Syria. Yet, it seems highly unlikely that procedural fixes will paper over clashing objectives. Negotiations require an abundance of goodwill and a willingness to compromise, two commodities in short supply. That leaves the most risky option of a slippery slope to further escalation on the ground. Turkey is already hosting the Syrian National Council and the Free Syrian Army of breakaway Syrian military personnel. Further measures could include unifying the hopelessly fragmented Syrian opposition and providing additional logistical and other support to Syrian armed groups. Most perilous of all is Turkey unilaterally establishing a security zone or a safe haven on Syrian territory with the backing of the U.S., European powers and the Gulf Arabs but outside the U.N. purview. This would drag Turkey ever deeper into the Syrian quagmire that is descending into a sectarian civil war. After all, the turmoil in Syria can easily spill over into an ethnically and religiously diverse Turkey. Direct military intervention will also pit Turkey against an angry Russia and a hostile Iran supplying collectively two-thirds of Turkey's energy needs. Tehran is seething after Ankara agreed to host in September last year a sophisticated US early warning radar system under the NATO umbrella to neutralize the threat of long-range Iranian missiles. Turkey is undoubtedly in a precarious and unenviable spot at the mercy of unpredictable and deteriorating regional circumstances. It is not in control of events but is being controlled by events. What the ultimate outcome will be is anyone's guess.

"(CNN) -- Taking the devilish element out of one of Australia's most iconic but endangered animals could save it from extinction. Evolving to be less aggressive could be the best hope for saving Tasmanian Devils in the wild, suggest scientists from the University of Tasmania, in a new study. The species is facing extinction from Devil Facial Tumor Disease (DFTD), an infectious cancer that is spread by the animals biting each other. It is believed that the cancer has wiped out over 60% of the animals since it was first discovered in 1996. While the animals are solitary they are social and meet regularly either during mating, establishing social hierarchies, or when feeding around carcasses. On all occasions they bite each other. However, the recent study led by Rodrigo Hamede, published in the British Ecological Society's Journal of Animal Ecology, led to the surprising discovery that the less a Tasmanian Devil gets bitten the more likely it is to become infected with the cancer. ""Our results --- that devils with fewer bites are more likely to develop DFTD --- were very surprising and counter-intuitive,"" he said. ""In most infectious diseases there are so-called super-spreaders, a few individuals responsible for most of the transmission. But we found the more aggressive devils, rather than being super-spreaders are super-receivers."" Over a period of four years, Hamede and his research team studied the animal at two locations in Tasmania and discovered that most of the tumors found on Tasmanian Devils were located in their mouths. ""This means that more aggressive devils do not get bitten as often, but they bite the tumors of the less aggressive devils and become infected,"" explained Hamede. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for DFTD and once infected Tasmanian Devils do not live much longer than six months. One of the study sites -- West Pencil Pine in western Tasmania -- was less badly hit by the disease, leading Hamede to feel hopeful that further research there could aid the survival of the species. ""Firstly, we need to explore the genetic differences that might be lessening the impact of DFTD in the West Pencil Pine devil population,"" said Hamede. ""Second, we need more detailed data on devil behavior to define 'shy' or 'bold' types. We could then use this information to develop a management strategy to reduce the spread of the disease by boosting natural selection of less aggressive, and therefore more resilient, devils.""","Cancer spread through biting is threatening wild population of Tasmanian Devils .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr has extended for six months the cease-fire he imposed last summer on his Mehdi Army militia, al-Sadr's office in Baghdad said Friday. A Baghdad street is reflected in the glass over a poster of powerful Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The official said a letter was distributed to all al-Sadr offices announcing the extension of the suspension, credited by the U.S. military with helping reduce the sectarian violence that has engulfed Baghdad and other hot spots across the country. The cease-fire is ""an important commitment that can broadly contribute to further improvements in security for all Iraqi citizens,"" said a U.S. military statement delivered by Navy Cmdr. Scott Rye. ""It will also foster a better opportunity for national reconciliation and allow the coalition and Iraqi security forces to focus more intensively on al Qaeda terrorists,"" the statement said, referring to the predominantly Sunni militant group al Qaeda in Iraq. The Iraqi government on Friday welcomed the decision. ""This step will contribute to the establishment of security and support of the national unity, and push forward the efforts of rebuilding and construction,"" Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said in a statement. He called the Sadrists a ""cornerstone in the political process."" The cease-fire was announced in late August after pitched battles in Karbala and other cities between the militia and fighters aligned with its Shiite rival, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. There were questions as to whether al-Sadr would continue his cease-fire. There had been some anger in the Shiite community over operations by the U.S. and Iraqi militaries, which have been going after Shiite militants who have ignored the call the stand down. Rogue followers of al-Sadr are thought to be among the recalcitrant militants. ""Those who honor al-Sadr's pledge will be treated with respect and restraint,"" the U.S. military said. ""Those who dishonor the Sadr pledge are regrettably tarnishing both the name and the honor of the movement.""

"(CNN) -- Just when you think teen superstar Justin Bieber couldn't possibly do anything dumber, he does something that makes you do a double face palm. Bieber is truly achieving the impossible: He's making Lindsay Lohan look good. So what did Bieber do this time? Well, over the weekend he stopped at the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. This museum is dedicated to preserving the memory of Anne Frank, whose chronicle of her family's efforts to hide from the Nazis during World War II would later become ""The Diary of Anne Frank."" Bieber ended his visit by writing in the Holocaust memorial's guest book: ""Truly inspiring to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber."" For those who wonder what he's talking about, a ""belieber"" is a term used to describe one of Bieber's devoted fans. Apparently Bieber's take-away from visiting this Holocaust memorial was that he hoped that Anne Frank would've been a fan of his music. He may have just redefined the word ""narcissistic."" There is a silver lining to this. Some of his young fans tweeted that they had never heard of Anne Frank. Consequently, the controversy surrounding his comments apparently raised awareness about the horrors of the Holocaust to some young people previously unfamiliar with it. And the Anne Frank House praised Bieber's visit. It was being gracious. But Bieber really needs to stop talking for a while. And I don't say that as someone who harbors an inappropriate amount of dislike for the teen singer. In fact, last May I wrote a piece for CNN.com defending and actually sympathizing with Bieber when he had an altercation with the paparazzi. But that was almost a year ago. Since then, Bieber has become unbearable. In the last month alone, we have watched Bieber caught on tape being restrained by his bodyguards as he unleashed a stream of obscenities and threatened members of the paparazzi with physical violence. He also allegedly spit in the face of one of his neighbors and threatened him after the neighbor complained that Bieber was driving his Ferrari at 100 mph in their gated community. Then we saw Bieber storm out of his March birthday party like a spoiled child calling it the ""worst birthday."" He went on to show up almost an hour late for his concert in London. And in January, photos surfaced of Bieber smoking what the website TMZ said appeared to be weed with his friend rapper, Lil Twist. I get it. Bieber wants the world to know he isn't a kid anymore. So he has decided to go the ""bad ass"" route. But Bieber will never, ever be the tough guy he wants to be. Why? For starters, he's Canadian. When you think Canada, you think nice, often overly polite people -- not thugs. Second, Bieber is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 130 pounds. Those measurements say ""horse jockey,"" not scary guy. (Sure, actor Joe Pesci is only 5 feet 4 inches tall and known as a tough guy, but Pesci is Sicilian and was born in Newark, New Jersey, not London, Ontario.) Bieber is clearly heading down the path of many child stars desperate to make the transformation into grown-up star. But his actions are not getting him there. Instead, he is becoming a walking punch line. He has a few options. He could simply retire and enjoy his wealth. Estimates are that he is worth more than $100 million. Not bad for a 19-year-old kid -- from Canada. But it's unlikely that Bieber will take that route. The other option is to avoid the fate of past teen stars who have ended up behind bars or worse as they struggled toward adulthood. Instead, he could follow the lead of another Justin: Justin Timberlake. He, too, was a young star. First on ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" and then in the much better known boy band 'N Sync. Timberlake didn't try to be something he's not. He continued to make music and then made a successful transition into acting. Decision time is now for Justin Bieber: He can be a Timberlake or a cautionary tale that parents tell their kids who want to go into show business. What's it going to be? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah: At Anne Frank House, Bieber said he hoped she would have been ""belieber""

"(CNN) -- The fall of dictatorships does not guarantee the creation of free societies. There is often a period in which we witness the legacy of tyranny. The Arab uprisings have overthrown tyrants in Egypt and Libya, but the populations and lawmakers have yet to grasp that democracy is not only about free elections but creating free societies. When sexual harassment of women increases on the streets of Egypt, when centuries-old shrines of Muslim saints are destroyed with explosives in Libya, when screenings of films such as ""Persepolis"" trigger riots in Tunisia and Christian minorities across the Middle East feel under siege, then we must stop pretending that all is well with the Arab Spring. But all is not lost either. Arab societies are on a journey. They can easily take the wrong turn. The attacks on the American embassies in Libya, Egypt and Yemen are examples of the ongoing presence of intolerant, tyrannical actors in Arab societies. These are people who were born and raised in dictatorships. They are accustomed to thinking that a government controls its citizens -- that a film or documentary cannot be produced without government approval. For decades, this has been the reality of their lives, and they strongly believe that the Western world and its citizens have a similarly controlling relationship between individuals and government. In light of this assumption, they hold the U.S. government responsible for the tacky and distasteful film produced by a right-wing Muslimphobe. News: Who is responsible for film at the heart of protests? Little wonder, then, that Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy has called for the prosecution by the U.S government of the filmmakers, and Egypt's top cleric, Mufti Ali Goma, has called on the United Nations to forbid denigration of faiths. Morsy studied in the United States and Ali Goma regularly visits the West on the interfaith circuit, yet both men don't yet grasp that religious freedom and the freedom of expression are inextricably linked in America. It is hard for younger Arabs not born into freedom to understand how individual liberty works in real life. The freedom to proselytize also guarantees the right to apostatize. Heresy and blasphemy are essential parts of free and democratic societies. Arab activists cannot seek to emulate the West's political and social achievements by looking at the United States and Europe today, but must observe and learn from the religious battles of 17th-century Europe, the smashing of the tyranny of the Roman Catholic Church, the ending of burning witches and the forbidding of hanging heretics. It is this history of unbolting the doors of dissent that led to the conditions in which John Locke and John Stuart Mill could write and think freely and then influence Thomas Jefferson and the other U.S. Founding Fathers. There are no shortcuts to freedom, except to learn from the mistakes of the West in the past. The Arab uprisings are not over yet. They are still unfolding and shaping the future. This culture of shouting and killing those with whom Muslims disagree must end. When the Prophet Mohammed's companions shouted ""Allahu Akbar,"" (meaning ""God is Greatest,"" a popular slogan for those yelling outside embassies today) the prophet reprimanded them saying ""Our Lord is not deaf."" Bergen: Extremists and leaders incite violent protests . When a Bedouin Arab entered the most sacred mosque of the prophet in Medina and violated its sanctity by urinating in this place of divinity, the prophet cleansed the mosque himself and forbade anybody from even reprimanding the Bedouin, let alone attacking the man. This is the way of the Prophet Mohammed. Where is this spirit of mildness, forgiveness and compassion amid Islamist activists today? The millions of protestors last year in Arab capitals that chanted ""hurriyah, karamah, adala ijtima'iyya"" or ""freedom, dignity and social justice"" cannot allow for the emotions of bigots to derail their revolution. Freedom is not only about majority rule, but ensuring that women, religious minorities and intellectual dissenters are able to flourish without fear. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Husain.","Ed Husain: Arab uprisings have ousted tyrants, but citizens still don't fully grasp democracy .

"(CNN) -- Peggy Chenoweth woke up angry the first time she dreamed of herself as an amputee. She'd found a certain measure of comfort in late-night reunions with her two-legged self, but for the first time since her surgery, the reality of her altered body seeped into her sleeping hours. She felt cheated, took a moment to mourn, and went about the business of her day. Living with limb loss requires a certain toughness. The graphic images and accounts from the Boston Marathon bombing have thrown the issue of amputation into the national spotlight. As tragic and violent as the circumstances of their injuries were, the 14 people who lost arms, legs, hands or feet as a result of the attack represent a fraction of who undergo amputation in the United States on any given day -- roughly 500 people, according to figures from the Amputee Coalition, the nation's largest limb loss advocacy and support group. It is Chenoweth's mission to let every person who has lost a limb know they are not alone. Through her blog, The Tales of an Amputee Mommy, the 38-year-old writer and social media manager receives 10 to 20 e-mails a day from people newly dealing with limb difference, and feeling severed from the world as well. By 2011, Chenoweth had been dealing with her own limb loss for nearly eight years. What started as an accident at a work conference -- a computer monitor falling off a cart and crushing her foot -- spiraled into a five-year nightmare of excruciating pain, endless and ineffective surgeries and finally a legal battle to win the right to the amputation that would finally end the physical part of her suffering. (Her insurance company contended that she could live a ""happy, healthy and active lifestyle on narcotics and crutches."" She disagreed.) Frustrated that she rarely saw people like herself outside the confines of her prosthetist's office, Chenoweth declared the last Saturday of that April, which is National Limb Loss Awareness Month, to be ""Strut Your Stuff Day."" In a blog entry titled ""Starting a Movement,"" she encouraged her readers to forgo cosmetic coverings, wear shorts and other clothes that reveal prosthetics and residual limbs and ""bring the amputee community out of the shadows."" It hit a nerve. Now in its third year, Chenoweth's movement has been adopted by the Amputee Coalition and retooled as ""Show Your Mettle Day,"" with public outings and awareness events planned around the country for Saturday. There is also a Facebook contest for people to share pictures of themselves in public with the absence of their limbs evident. Winners, determined by number of Facebook ""likes"" in four categories (individual, family and friends and community, support groups and facilities, or workplace) will receive recognition in several of the organization's publications. For each photo uploaded to the page during April, prosthetic limb maker WillowWood will donate $1 to the coalition. The feedback Chenoweth has received steels her belief that this exposure, however uncomfortable it might be for both participants and onlookers, is a force for forward motion. ""I was astounded that so many people aren't living their lives out of fear of what other people are going to think,"" she says. ""This event gives people a reason to stand up and say, 'This is who I am.' Not every amputee uses a prosthetic, but every amputee in their own right has shown that they're strong and they have gumption and courage to persevere. That's the definition of (showing) your mettle."" The journey toward public exposure can be terrifying, but both experts and members of the community agree on its importance in the process of seeing one's self as whole again. ""People are afraid of what they don't know,"" says Anissa Gustafson. The 41-year-old registered dietitian lost her leg (and the family dog) four years ago in a car accident 90 miles from her home in Las Vegas. Gustafson vividly recalls her first public outing, picking up her children at day care, before she received her prothesis. ""I remember walking into my children's classroom and all the little kids tilting their heads sideways, like they were looking for the rest of my leg,"" she says. ""The looks on their faces were priceless. It was such a sweet moment, explaining to a group of 3- and 4-year-olds what happened to my leg. But somehow, explaining it to those innocent little kids was kind of healing."" Gustafson also said goodbye to an emblem of her former self in the form of a ""shoe funeral."" No longer able to wear shoes with a heel higher than two inches, she had to get rid of 40 pairs of shoes and adapt her signature style to work with her new prosthetic -- a ""realistic"" model that cost her $20,000. For her, the price was worth it. ""I don't see it as being ashamed of my leg,"" she says. ""For me it's just a matter of feeling more whole and beautiful. We all dress or style our hair a certain way as an expression of ourselves, and I felt a part of that was taken from me."" While she doesn't always care to draw attention to her prosthetic, Gustafson does always make sure the socket that fits around her residual limb has a bit of fun or sparkle to it. It's part of the process of embracing her changed physical self. Over the past two years, Strut Your Stuff has inspired people to go out in their community for the first time without a cosmetic cover, reveal to co-workers that they're living with a prosthetic, or even leave the confines of their own homes, which they hadn't done since their limb loss. Chenoweth designed an awareness ribbon that incorporates the image of a prosthetic leg, and last year received a large order for merchandise. A boy was about to return home from having his leg amputated, and his soccer team wanted to rally around him on Strut Your Stuff Day with the ribbon emblazoned on their jerseys. ""That's what it's about,"" Chenoweth says, ""getting the community's support, raising awareness and letting people know that you can be missing a limb and still be very whole and live a fulfilling life."" Chenoweth says that, like most amputees, she still has ""bad leg days."" But she says the acceptance of her limb loss came about without fanfare one day when she realized what she had been missing. ""I knew I was going to be OK when I got through my lunch and I realized I hadn't cursed out my prosthetic yet."" Artificial limbs push boundaries of art . Going out to strut your stuff? Dr. Roberta Cone is a psychologist who specializes in dealing with limb difference. (She lost her arm below the elbow in a car accident and opts not to wear a prosthetic.) Here are some of her tips for situations your might encounter, both from friends and loved ones. • If people stare at you, look back and smile. It is part of human nature to be curious, and they don't necessarily mean anything by it. • If you do get positive feedback, put that in your self esteem bank for later when you might be having a difficult time. • Do not define yourself by your lost limb. If people have a negative reaction, it is not personal toward you. • It is natural to feel repulsed upon first seeing the absence of a limb, even when it's a loved one or romantic partner. Neither one of you should feel ashamed by this, and know that it does pass. • There are tremendous resources available on the Amputee Coalition website. Educate yourself as much as possible, so you can be open to discussion if it arises. See someone showing their mettle? Peggy Chenoweth has some advice for those who may have questions for people with limb loss. • Take their lead. If a person seems open to questions, you may ask them politely. Otherwise, just leave them alone. • Don't conduct the Spanish Inquisition. Let the person share whatever they're comfortable with, but don't press. Not everyone is at the same place in their journey, and they don't owe you a story. • For goodness' sakes, don't make fun. Within the community, a good sense of humor is necessary for survival and we'll make plenty of jokes -- but that doesn't mean you are free to as well. • Don't tell them what they ""should"" be doing. Yes, Oscar Pistorius has those cool sport legs. Those cost a lot. The most basic prosthetics are almost a luxury item for most people and often aren't covered by insurance.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration may very well be right that the attack in Benghazi which claimed the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. officials was part of a pre-planned terrorist operation. It would have happened sooner or later regardless of any protests against an obscure anti-Islam film made in America. The attack apparently occurred because in recent days, the al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri posted a video online calling on Libyans to avenge the killing of al-Qaeda's second in command, Abu Yahya al-Libi. According to our own sources at Quilliam Foundation, the attack was the work of roughly 20 militants prepared for a military assault. It is rare, for example, that an RPG7 -- an anti-tank rocket-propelled grenade launcher -- would be present at a civilian protest. The attack against the consulate had two waves. The first attack led to U.S. officials being evacuated from the consulate by Libyan security forces, only for the second wave to be launched against U.S. officials after they were kept at a secure location. News: How the Benghazi attack unfolded . Jihadists will want the world to believe that the attack is just a part of the protests against an amateur film produced in the U.S., which includes crude insults regarding the Prophet Mohammed. They will want the world to think that their actions represent a popular Libyan and wider Muslim reaction; thus, reversing the perception of jihadists being outcasts from their own societies. Since there were similar protests in Egypt against the film, it is possible that more protests may erupt in Muslim-majority countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan. The jihadists may also feel that by killing U.S. citizens, they will win the support of local populations. They are wrong. This attack was committed by a small group of extremists who do not represent the Libyan population. They seek to destroy any reconstruction attempts in my mother country. As often is the case, extremists try to take advantage of the absence of security in a country that has just gotten out of a civil war. They try so hard to destabilize the peace that the majority of the population have fought so hard to establish. Ambassador Stevens himself was well known for advocating peace and stability in Libya. The recent election results in the country are testament to his conviction that Libya can achieve progress. That Libyans did not vote the radicals into office in the elections proves that Libya is not a nation of extremists. The extremists' response to their electoral defeat comes in a language they relish: Violence. Opinion: Will Egypt's leaders calm or fan the crisis? The attack on the U.S. consulate is a truly tragic event. Libya has lost one of the few foreign figures that really sought to invest time and energy into our country and believed in its future. Ambassador Stevens was one of a select number of international public figures based in Libya, who had refused to give up on Libya and its deteriorating security situation in recent months. He was an extremely successful envoy, who traveled the country to meet with all groups of Libyan society, and did not confine himself to international circles in the capital. No village or town was too far, and he was always keen to understand local customs. His death is a loss not just for Americans, but for many Libyans. I hope that the Libyan government will take this time to reflect on the security vacuum in the country, in particular around Benghazi, and rebuild the defense and security sectors in an accountable, professional and responsible manner. I also hope that Libyan authorities will look to revise their policy of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) so that the situation on the ground can be improved. Opinion: Libya killings show U.S. at risk in Arab world . We have welcomed the international community into our country, and I know that we want to continue our collaboration with the NATO community and member states, including, and especially, with the United States. These countries helped free us from the tyrannical rule of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, who was in power for 42 years. Many Libyans are forever grateful to America for its support in freeing our country from dictatorship. This attack does not reflect the attitude of the Libyan population. For the international community, withdrawal of support from Libya will only play directly into the hands of jihadists, and that is the opposite of what we should do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Noman Benotman.","U.S. consulate in Libya was attacked; some thought it was because of a video .

"(CNN) -- Federal drug agents discovered a 240-yard-long tunnel underneath the U.S.-Mexico border, and they suspect it was used to smuggle drugs into Arizona for sale in the United States, officials said Thursday. The ""sophisticated drug smuggling tunnel,"" which runs 55 feet below ground, begins in an ice plant in San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, Mexico, and ends inside a one-story, nondescript building in San Luis, Arizona, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Report: Focus on cops, not military . Investigators started watching the building in January ""after observing possible suspicious activity that indicated the site was being used as a potential stash location,"" the DEA said. Arizona police found 39 pounds of methamphetamine inside a pickup truck stopped on Interstate 95 on July 6, which led them back to the San Luis, Arizona, building, the DEA said. They got a search warrant with that information. Police in Arizona arrest 20, dismantle drug trafficking cell of Sinaloa Cartel . No drugs were found in the search of the ice plant or the building on the U.S. side, just bags and barrels of dirt, the DEA said. Three unnamed suspects have been arrested in connection with the tunnel, the DEA said. Interior Border Patrol stations closed . ""The recent discovery of this sophisticated drug smuggling tunnel is yet another reminder of how desperate these criminal organizations are and the extent they will go to further their drug dealing operations and endanger the security of our citizens,"" said Doug Coleman, the special agent in charge of the DEA's Phoenix, Arizona, office.

"(CNN) -- Consider the biggest stories in recent weeks: Three women in Cleveland end a decade's captivity. A Texas fertilizer plant explosion kills 15 people. A monster tornado strikes an Oklahoma suburb. A British soldier is savagely slain on a London street. Need an update on these important events? Welcome to CNN Reset, a new feature revisiting news that's been unforgettable. Here's the latest on video and online. Oklahoma twister . Science calls it an EF5. The people of Moore, Oklahoma, know it as the most powerful category of tornadoes. The twister's destruction was merciless: it struck the Plaza Towers Elementary School, killing seven children there. In all, 24 people perished, including 10 children. The human response to the catastrophe has been powerful too. Locals call it the ""Oklahoma standard"" -- ""persistence and a great positive attitude by the people to never give in,"" as University of Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops puts it. Cleveland captivity . It was a horror worthy of Stephen King's imagination: three young women allegedly held captive in a house for roughly 10 years beginning at ages 21, 16 and 14. They were allegedly abducted off the street in a Cleveland neighborhood by the homeowner, Ariel Castro, 52, who's now facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Alleged violence and threats made the captive women afraid to seek an escape. But one of the women -- the one who bore a child by Castro -- finally shouted for help after Castro left the house and forgot to lock a big inside door. Neighbors responded. The women and a 6-year-old girl were freed. Now tourists visit the neighborhood. And as the city seeks donations to support the women, it struggles with a dark legacy. Texas explosion . The explosion of a fertilizer plant shook the Earth like an earthquake. In fact, the blast in West, Texas, registered a 2.1 on the Richter scale, and people felt it 50 miles away. The first responders experienced a scene for which no training could ever prepare them: a mushroom-cloud fireball lay waste to 37 blocks, including a nursing home, the local high and middle school, and many houses. Fifteen people -- including 12 first responders -- were killed. Volunteer firefighter Robert Payne was blown out of his boots and knocked senseless. He woke up in intensive care wondering what happened. Now recovering from several injuries, he's thankful he's alive. As the town of 2,800 rebuilds, will it want the fertilizer plant back? The mayor doubts it. Boston Marathon bombings . Among those injured in the Boston Marathon bombings were two brothers. Paul and JP Norden have shared much in life. Now they are together in recovery: Each brother lost a right leg in the attack. As hard as the limb loss was for the brothers, equally difficult was not seeing other each for weeks as they underwent 12 surgeries in all. The siblings finally saw each other about two weeks ago for the first time since the marathon. They want the public to know their uncommon brotherhood is lifting them through an arduous recuperation. London slaying . The British soldier was well-liked by many. He was even a military recruiter and played the drum outside the Royal Palaces on behalf of his regiment, the Fusiliers. But the life of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, came to a grisly end on a London street at the hands of a man with a meat cleaver and knife. What has shocked the world is how the alleged attacker -- Michael Adebolajo, 28, a British national of Nigerian descent -- made a video of the gory scene and spoke to the camera about the killing, saying it was ""an eye for an eye"" and ""because Muslims are dying daily."" A total of five men have been arrested in the slaying. Now far-right activists are calling upon Muslims to leave the country. Capital calamities . The second term of President Barack Obama was supposed to be about immigration reform, gun control and the economy. Instead, it's seemingly been one scandal after another. The Justice Department secretly collected two months of telephone records from the Associated Press. Questions resurfaced about whether the administration downplayed the role of terrorism in the attack against the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. And the IRS allegedly targeted politically conservative groups. The president says he's angry about it, too.","Residents put the 'Oklahoma standard' to work in rebuilding their lives .

"(CNN) -- Abu Yahya al-Libi, al Qaeda's No. 2 man, was killed in Pakistan on Monday, according to U.S. officials. Al-Libi's death was ""another serious blow to core al Qaeda,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Al-Libi, 49, was a well-regarded figure in jihadist circles and had emerged as one of the terrorist network's most important clerics and propagandists, appearing in countless videos in recent years. He was killed by a CIA drone strike, according to U.S. officials. Drone strikes remain a highly contentious issue between the United States and Pakistan. Who is Abu Yahya al-Libi? By most accounts, al-Libi was effectively al Qaeda's deputy leader. A Libyan citizen and an Islamic scholar, al-Libi bolstered his credibility within jihad groups after escaping from U.S. custody in Afghanistan in 2005. He became the public face of al Qaeda and used his religious training to justify the organization's actions. As one of the group's chief ideologues and propagandists, al-Libi appeared in numerous recruitment videos in which he cast himself as a sheikh with the legitimacy to issue fatwas. Other than his appearances in propaganda videos, it's unclear which plots against the West al-Libi was involved in. A wanted ad from the U.S. State Department described him as a ""key motivator in the global jihadi movement,"" and said that ""his messages convey a clear threat to U.S. persons or property worldwide."" What does his death mean for al Qaeda? This is a ""very serious blow"" to al Qaeda, according to Noman Benotman, a former senior member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group who spent significant time with al-Libi in the 1990s. No one else within the group rivals his legitimacy as a religious scholar nor has the credibility in the Arab world to provide Islamic justifications for al Qaeda's global campaign of terrorism, he said. ""There is no one who even comes close in terms of replacing the expertise [al Qaeda] has just lost,"" said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri may be the only leader of consequence left, wrote Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst. However, he said al Qaeda's regional affiliates remained a threat. For a complete list of terrorists sought by the United States, check out this list on CNN's Security Clearance blog. What are drone strikes? In drone strikes, unmanned aerial vehicles, often equipped with hellfire missiles, are used to target suspected terrorists in remote locations. These attacks have been used in Pakistan, despite opposition from the country. This issue has strained relations between Pakistan and the United States. The strike on Monday that killed al-Libi is believed to be the 21st U.S. drone strike in the country this year. Critics of such attacks say the drone strikes have killed innocent civilians and that the U.S. has not provided evidence that the missiles have reached their intended targets. U.S. officials rarely discuss the CIA's drone program in Pakistan, though privately they have said the covert strikes are legal and an effective tactic in the fight against extremists. What's the reaction in Pakistan? There has neither been widespread reaction in Pakistan nor any uproar or outrage over al-Libi's death. It's likely that many Pakistanis do not know who al-Libi was, according to Reza Sayah, CNN's Pakistan-based correspondent. Are drone strikes legal? Critics say that drone attacks are not a democratic strategy and that the practice violates international laws and national sovereignty. President Barack Obama's administration has justified its use of drones overseas. In a rare public statement recently, John Brennan, the president's top counterterrorism adviser, said the strikes are conducted ""in full accordance with the law."" Brennan said the United States ""respects national sovereignty and international law"" and is guided by the laws of war in ordering those attacks. CNN's Paul Cruickshank, Peter Bergen, Reza Sayah and the CNN Wire contributed to this report.","Abu Yahya al-Libi, al Qaeda's deputy leader, was killed by a drone strike, U.S. says .
His death was a ""very serious blow"" to al Qaeda, White House says .

"(CNN) -- It was a meeting apparently straight off the TV screen: Bart Simpson called before Mr. Burns after allegedly causing trouble. But the encounter did not play out in cartoon form, but rather at Warwick Crown Court in the English Midlands. Barton Simpson, known as Bart, appeared Monday before the judge, Mr. Recorder Burns, to face charges of possession of a firearm and possession of a dangerous article on board an aircraft. He pleaded guilty to the latter charge and was ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work in the community and to pay a fine of 800 pounds ($1,200) to the court. He had previously denied possession of a firearm. The gun was seized and destroyed. Simpson's cartoon namesake is the star of the long-running U.S. TV series ""The Simpsons,"" which also features a Mr. Burns -- who runs the local nuclear power plant and is Bart's father's boss -- as a nemesis.","Defendant named Bart Simpson appears before a judge named Mr. Burns .

"(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down. I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election. Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago. Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention. In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline. Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before. But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008. Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000. All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file. The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date. The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee. But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line. ""Reluctantly Romney"" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012. You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout. But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates. Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election. The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.

"(CNN) -- Here's a look at the timeline of events in the shooting of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, and the ensuing uproar. February 26 . About 7 p.m.: George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch captain, calls 911 to report ""a suspicious person"" in the gated community called the Retreat at Twin Lakes. Zimmerman says he is following Martin after the teen had started to run, after which the dispatcher tells him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman pursues Martin anyway, before losing sight of him. About 7:10 p.m.: Phone records show Martin was on the phone with his girlfriend around the time he spotted Zimmerman while returning from a convenience store to his father's fiancÃ©e's home. At a March 20 news conference, Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump says the girl hears someone ask Martin what he was doing and Martin asking why the person was following him. The girl gets the impression that there is an altercation in which the earpiece falls out of Martin's ear and the connection goes dead, according to Crump. According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman tells authorities that after briefly losing track of Martin, the teen approached him. After exchanging words, Zimmerman says, he reached for his cell phone, and then Martin punched him in the nose. Zimmerman says Martin pinned him to the ground and began slamming his head into a sidewalk. About 7:25 p.m.: Martin is shot and killed. The weather is rainy. At the time of his death, the teenager is unarmed and carrying a small amount of cash, a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea. Several neighbors of the gated community called about the incident, with authorities eventually releasing the contents of seven such 911 calls. In one, a man whispers, ""Hurry, please. ... There's someone screaming outside. There's a gunshot. Hurry up. ... There's someone screaming. I just heard a gunshot."" Another neighbor says, ""There were gunshots right outside my house. There's someone screaming. I just heard a guy shot. Hurry up, they are right outside my house."" In another call, a woman begs the dispatchers to send help, saying someone is ""screaming and hollering"" for help. Moments later, she describes a light at the scene of the shooting. ""Oh, my God,"" she says. ""There's still somebody out there walking with a flashlight."" About 7:30 p.m.: Zimmerman tells police he shot Martin in self-defense. In a police report, Officer Timothy Smith writes that Zimmerman is bleeding from the nose and back of the head. What witnesses say in the Trayvon Martin case . March 8: Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy Martin, family members and attorneys hold a news conference calling attention to the case. March 13: Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee says Zimmerman has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his story of the events. Divided town struggles with stigma . March 14: CNN's David Mattingly reports that police have concluded their investigation and turned the file over to the state attorney, who would have to decide on charges. Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, create a petition on the website Change.org calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Within a week, it is the second most-popular petition in the website's history with 877,110 signatures. The NAACP asks the Justice Department to get involved in the investigation. March 15: In a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, George Zimmerman's father writes that his son has been unfairly portrayed as a racist. Robert Zimmerman writes that his son is Hispanic and grew up in a multiracial family. March 16: Authorities release seven calls to police from the night of the shooting. In one of the 911 recordings, Zimmerman follows Martin. Also in one of the recordings, a voice screams ""Help, help!"" in the background, followed by the sound of a gunshot. March 19: The Justice Department announces that it has launched an investigation into Martin's death. Florida Gov. Rick Scott asks state officials to assist in the investigation. March 20: Florida Rep. Dennis Baxley, who sponsored the ""stand your ground"" law in 2005, says nothing in it allows people to ""pursue and confront."" The law allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves anywhere they feel a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. The Justice Department sends representation to Sanford to investigate and ""to address tension in the community."" Shooting renews debate over 'stand your ground' laws . March 21: CNN analyzes one of the tapes of Zimmerman's call to dispatch in which he is purported to have used a racial slur. The results are inconclusive. March 22: Lee announces that he will step down temporarily as head of the department, which has been criticized for its handling of the fatal shooting. Scott announces that he is appointing State's Attorney Angela Corey of the 4th Judicial Circuit as special prosecutor, replacing Norman Wolfinger. As the petition calling for Zimmerman's arrest reaches 1 million signatures, according to Change.org, civil rights activists, politicos, family and supporters converge on Fort Mellon Park in Sanford to rally for swift judicial action, including Zimmerman's arrest. March 23: President Barack Obama speaks publicly for the first time on the growing controversy, saying the incident requires national ""soul-searching."" Saturday: A handful of members from the New Black Panther Party offer a $10,000 reward for the ""capture"" of George Zimmerman. Monday: Exactly one month after Martin's death, rallies across the country call for Zimmerman's arrest. In Sanford, the City Commission holds a town hall meeting on the incident and its aftermath. Open Story: Trayvon Martin shooting . Wednesday: Zimmerman's father, Robert, appears on television and says Martin threatened to kill Zimmerman and then beat him so badly, Zimmerman was forced to shoot. Thursday: Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., appears on CNN and says medical records will prove that his brother was attacked and his nose was broken by Martin before he fatally shot the teen. CNN's Chris Lett and Diane Laposta and the CNN Library staff contributed to this report.","Teenager Trayvon Martin was shot and killed on February 26 .

"(CNN) -- Islam is a religion of compassion and mercy, considering that the two adjectives most used in the Quran to describe God are the ""compassionate"" and the ""merciful."" It is also a religion of justice. Throughout Islamic history, many non-Muslims would take their disputes to Sharia courts, over their own religious courts, because of the firm injunctions in the Quran and Sharia law to adhere to high standards of justice. It is for this reason that, as an imam, I am deeply distressed to hear that a young Christian girl in Pakistan was accused by her angry Muslim neighbors of burning text from the Quran, Islam's holy book, in violation of the country's blasphemy laws. Reportedly, the girl is mentally challenged and used the pages for fuel. Some say that she may also be illiterate. After several hundred emotionally charged people surrounded her house to demand punishment, the police arrested her as a way to protect her. There is neither justice, compassion nor mercy in what has happened to the girl. Pakistan must champion Islam as a religion of peace and not allow a handful of extremists to define it for all Muslims; such extremists confuse ordinary Muslims into thinking that Sharia law is about punishment rather than about promoting harmony and human flourishing. The Muslims in Pakistan must display the highest expression of Islamic values and principles. They must manifest the mercy and wisdom of one of the early Islamic leaders, Caliph Umar bin al-Khattab, who suspended the punishment for theft during a time of famine so as to best fulfill the intention of God's law. I call upon Muslims in Pakistan to reject the accusations against the girl and live up to the highest ethical standards set forth by God and his messenger. It is not right to be angry and to want to punish a young girl for unknowingly burning words from the Quran. According to Islamic tradition, ""Works are rendered efficacious only by their intention."" In other words, the intention to commit a crime is a primary consideration in Islamic law. It was not the girl's intention to blaspheme against the Quran, as she is mentally challenged and could not have understood the content of the pages. As a minor, the girl cannot legally incur punishment. In the Islamic school of law practiced in Pakistan, one must demonstrate competence in making socially responsible judgments. This girl could not have demonstrated competence in her judgment. Furthermore, burning the physical book of the Quran is not an act of blasphemy. It has always been an acceptable means of disposing of an old copy of the Quran. In Islamic theology, the Quran is not a book but rather, as the name means in Arabic, the recitation of God's word. Muslims use the printed copies as a memory aid in reciting this word, a word which can never be defiled. And lastly, to prevent this kind of incident from repeating in the future, we must turn to the help of the state. According to the objectives (maqasid) of Islamic law, the government must try to eradicate the poverty that drove the girl to scrounge for paper for fuel, as an obligation to provide sustenance in ""promoting wealth."" The government must actively work toward creating harmony between Pakistan's various faith communities, a key aspect of fulfilling the objective of ""preserving religion."" And it has the responsibility to provide schooling for all citizens so that they can read as part of ""preserving the mind."" Muslims must be characterized by loving humanity, by upholding justice and by showing kindness toward their neighbors, even to the extent that should someone offer you a deadly poison, give him the choicest honey in exchange. Within Islamic history, the Muslim community has been known for such qualities. It is time again to take up that mantle and act always in the name of God, the most compassionate, the merciful -- b-ism Allahi al-raHmÄ .","A young Christian girl in Pakistan was accused of burning text from the Quran .

"Roseville, Michigan (CNN) -- Police found no ""discernible remains"" in their search Friday for long-missing labor strongman Jimmy Hoffa, police Chief James Berlin said. Two soil samples taken from beneath a storage shed outside a suburban Detroit home will nevertheless go to a lab at Michigan State University for testing. Officials are expected to announce by Monday night if they've found evidence bearing out a tipster's claim that he saw what appeared to be a body being buried at the site the day after the former Teamsters chief disappeared in 1975. Even if they do, Berlin said he doubts any remains would be those of Hoffa. ""It would be great if it was, because I would like to bring closure to his family and the tens of thousands of Teamsters that idolize this man, and just the southeast of Michigan,"" said Berlin, of the Roseville Police Department. ""This is kind of like an open wound that won't go away. Every couple of years this happens, and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it."" Police broke through a concrete floor beneath a storage shed on the site, then drew two soil samples from the ground as deep as 6 feet down, Berlin said. The results didn't turn up bones, body parts or other evidence, he said. He described the samples as merely ""murky."" While police searched, reporters and curious onlookers milled about on the street outside the home, which reportedly once housed a gambling operation tied to Detroit's notorious organized crime community. Police began their inquiry after a tipster came forward in August to say that he believed he'd witnessed a body being buried at the home. The tipster did not come forward sooner out of fear, Berlin said. A search using ground-penetrating radar last month showed some sort of anomaly in the ground beneath the storage shed's concrete floor, according to police. 2010: Digging into the Hoffa legend? The lab tests being conducted on the soil samples will be able to determine if human remains were buried at the site, but will not identify them, Berlin said. If human remains are discovered, investigators would have to return for a more complete excavation, he said. Dan Moldea, author of ""The Hoffa Wars,"" first spoke to the tipster in March, and sent him to police. The tipster, a former gambler, once did business with a man tied to Anthony Giacalone, an organized crime figure who was supposed to meet Hoffa the day he disappeared, Moldea said. Despite those links, Moldea said it seems unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site, in full view of the neighborhood. And if a body had been buried there, little would remain, he said. ""I am very skeptical,"" Moldea said of the search. Berlin is too, but he's not ruling anything out. ""The timeline doesn't really add up,"" he said. ""But stranger things have happened, so it's possible."" Hoffa's presumed death has vexed investigators for almost four decades. One of the most powerful union leaders at a time that unions wielded a great deal of sway over elections -- and were notoriously tied to organized crime -- Hoffa was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971 on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980. Two weeks before Hoffa's disappearance, federal investigators discovered hundreds of millions of dollars had been stolen from the Teamsters' largest pension fund, Time magazine points out in its list of the top 10 most famous disappearances. Hoffa, then 62, was last seen on July 30, 1975, at suburban Detroit restaurant. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Giacalone and Anthony Provenzano, chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey, who was later convicted in a murder case. Both men have since died. Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano, but Hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the FBI. Giacalone and Provenzano later told the FBI that no meeting had been scheduled. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and to the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Police and the FBI have searched for Hoffa intermittently ever since. In September 2001, the FBI found DNA that linked Hoffa to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance. In 2004, authorities removed floorboards from a Detroit home to look for traces of blood, as former Teamsters official Frank Sheeran claimed in a biography that he had shot Hoffa. Sheeran had died in 2003. Investigators ruled that blood found in the house was not Hoffa's. The FBI has a sample of his DNA from a hairbrush. Two years later, the FBI razed a horse barn in Michigan following what it called ""a fairly credible lead."" But the disappearance remains unsolved. Urban lore long suggested that Hoffa was buried around the end zone at the former Giants Stadium in New Jersey. As TruTV puts it, the mystery surrounding Hoffa is not simply a ""whodunnit."" ""The likely suspects are all known, and their motives are well documented. The question is: Where? What exactly did they do to Jimmy Hoffa, and where did they dispose of his body?"" But over the years, numerous theories have been floated. In 1987, Joe Franco -- a former Hoffa strong-arm -- and a New York Times reporter published ""Hoffa's Man,"" which Fortune described as ""the hair-raising inside story of Jimmy Hoffa."" ""Rather than being kidnapped by rival union forces as law enforcement authorities have long speculated, Franco says Hoffa was abducted by two federal agents,"" Fortune reported. ""He thinks they drove Hoffa to a nearby airport, took off in a small plane, and pushed him out over one of the Great Lakes. Franco says he did not tell federal investigators this bizarre, and unverifiable, story because they would not grant him immunity."" Hoffa's son, James P. Hoffa, is the current president of the Teamsters. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Stephanie Gallman contributed to this report.","NEW: Drilling doesn't turn up bones, body parts or other evidence, police chief says .

"(CNN) -- The Lonely Island isn't quite so lonely these days. Even though its members -- Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer -- are often apart because they live on different coasts, they're still united in the studio as well as a series of Wack Wednesday videos -- seriously, how many artists drop a video for just about every song on the album anymore? They also have a bevy of guest stars to keep them company on the tracks, in the clips, and in televised performances (check out Alanis Morissette covering Solange's part on ""Semicolon"" -- which is, as they say, ironic). The band's latest release, ""The Wack Album,"" out this week, features not only Robyn (""Go Kindergarten,"" with Paul Rudd and Diddy weighing in on the video) and Pharrell (""Hugs""), but also Hugh Jackman and Kristen Wiig (""You Got the Look"") and Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong (""I Run NYC""). And that's not counting the guest stars who turned out for the video of ""Spring Break Anthem,"" in which Zack Galifanakis, James Franco, and Ed Norton gamely step up and make a gay marriage statement with their Lonely Island lovers. And yet, the guys still lament not being able to fit more friends in. But as Samberg said, laughing, ""There's only so many spots on one fake rap album!"" And there was one icon he really wanted. ""Sheila E. would be the s**t,"" he enthused. ""I saw her at the Forum, and she was awesome. She's on the wish list."" The group's previous albums, ""Incredibad"" and ""Turtleneck & Chain,"" were enriched by access to ""Saturday Night Live"" guest stars. These days, scheduling is a bit trickier. ""When we made albums in the past,"" Samberg said, ""it wasn't always because someone was on the show when we asked them, but in their minds, they were like, 'There's a chance this is for the show.' People came to 'SNL,' and we plugged them into songs."" ""They just walked into our office,"" Schaffer said, ""and it was easier to get everything done. Now we may get a yes just as fast, but there's logistics to consider: 'OK, but where are you?'"" So for the new album, some participants were recorded in New York (such as Solange and Kendrick Lamar, who guests on ""YOLO"" with Adam Levine), some in Los Angeles (Pharrell and Too Short, who guests on ""The Compliments""), and some on Skype. Jackman, who was in the middle of doing press for a film, accommodated the guys during his promotional junket. ""We rented a room adjacent to the hotel room he was doing it in, and we had an engineer there, and I was on Skype,"" Samberg said. ""He just walked in, and I watched him record for a good 45 minutes to an hour. He did a bunch of great takes, and then he asked if there was anything else I needed -- and there was not. It was great. It was Jean Valjean meets Cameo."" How comfortable the guests get with being raunchy or silly also plays a part in the recording, Schaffer said. ""We're very conscious of the different personalities, if someone doesn't want to curse as much, or if someone doesn't want to play with their image too much,"" he said. ""Hugh Jackman was very comfortable, but sometimes people will be like, 'Yeah, I'm not that comfortable.' It helps to be given parameters."" Sometimes a guest's point of view may shift a bit. Michael Bolton, for instance, at first asked the group to give him something ""even crazier"" than what they originally came up with for ""Jack Sparrow."" Then he passed on that version, deciding it had become ""too filthy."" But later, he added his own F-words to a separate digital short. ""We were like, 'Dude! Totally!'"" Taccone said. ""And now there's a Michael Bolton character that only exists in the world of our videos,"" Samberg said. To make it easier on some guests, Samberg will sing a temp vocal track, doing both the highs and the lows, ""so they can hear an almost finished version,"" Samberg said. ""Then, somebody like Solange, she did her own countermelodies,"" Taccone added. ""They come in with harmonies, and the talent,"" Samberg said. With rappers, however, the Lonely Island guys are less likely to write a verse until they know who will be doing the part, and even then, they invite them to rewrite it. ""For rappers,"" Schaffer said, ""we'll leave open which bars of music they're going to do, and give them bullet points of joke ideas that they can put into their own words. We want the rapper to feel like himself, and not like he's doing someone else's lyric."" ""It has to be in their voice,"" Samberg said. ""The style is so specific."" Soon the guys will start to juggle their nonmusical projects with the idea of a Lonely Island tour. Taccone, who co-wrote and directed the film ""MacGruber,"" will be locking himself in a room with Will Forte and writing partner John Solomon to get to work on a script for ""MacGruber 2."" And Samberg will soon be decamping to Los Angeles to start shooting his new television comedy, ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine."" ""Other than 'Girls' and '30 Rock,'"" he noted, ""I defy you to name a show set in New York that doesn't shoot in LA! I wish we could have shot it in Brooklyn -- I still love New York. But the irony of television production knoweth no bounds."" Speaking of ""Girls,"" will Taccone -- who played Marnie's lover Booth Jonathan -- be back for another round, since the HBO comedy is shooting its third season this summer in Brooklyn? ""Dude, if you talk to Lena (Dunham), tell her I'm totally down!"" Taccone pleaded. ""Maybe they can squeeze me in. But I don't know what more you can see of me on that show -- except for the front part, and nobody wants to see that.""","'SNL' star Andy Samberg and two friends started The Lonely Island .

"(CNN) -- Moments after a Florida A&M drum major's parents asked that their son's death due to hazing not be in vain, a Florida judge doled out punishment Friday to his roommate for his role in the death -- a sentence that doesn't include time in prison. Rikki Wills is subject to a year of community control -- a form of house arrest -- and five years of probation, Ninth Judicial Circuit Court Judge Donald Myers, Jr., ruled. The sentence came just over a month after Wills reached a plea deal with prosecutors, days before his trial was scheduled to start. He pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, to a felony charge of hazing resulting in death and first-degree hazing, which is a misdemeanor. Shortly before Myers ruled, the 25-year-old Wills addressed Robert Champion's parents. ""I just want to say to the family that I am very sorry for the loss of your son,"" he said. At his lawyer's advice, Wills' comments were brief. But minutes earlier, both Pam and Robert Champion Sr. elaborated on their feelings after their son was beaten on a bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando, Florida, as part of a band hazing ritual. The 26-year-old died ""within an hour"" afterward, medical examiners reported. ""What if we could turn back the hand of time?"" Pam Champion told the court Friday. ""... What if one individual said, we can make them stop?"" She criticized those involved in the incident, who didn't step up in its immediate aftermath. ""Instead of speaking up ... they kept silent to protect themselves,"" the victim's mother said. The Champions, who live near Atlanta, have become outspoken advocates against hazing since their son's death. This sentiment -- so more families don't suffer like they have -- was the focus of Robert Champion Sr.'s courtroom remarks Friday. ""We're losing too many young men,"" he said. ""...Enough is enough."" Florida A&M's band, known as the Marching 100, is one of the top university marching bands in the United States, famed for its elaborate dance formations and innovative style incorporating popular music. But Champion's death, and other reports of hazing, sullied its reputation. The university was put on a one-year probation in December for its handling of the incident, and the famed band was suspended for the 2012-13 school year. The school has said it is making reforms to address the problem of hazing both on and off campus, including requiring students to sign an anti-hazing pledge. Wills is not the only person charged in Champion's death, nor the first to be sentenced. Twelve former students face manslaughter charges, attorneys familiar with the case said in March. Bryan Jones pleaded no contest in October 2012 to a charge of felony hazing resulting in death. He was sentenced to six months of community control, two years of supervised probation and 200 hours of community service.","Rikki Wills, 25, is sentenced to 1 year of community control, 5 years probation .

"Washington (CNN) -- MF Global declared bankruptcy Monday and has ceased trading. While most people would have never heard of MF Global, its bankruptcy may be seen as the first shoe dropping in the European financial crisis and as a clear indicator that the regulatory infrastructure of 2011 may not be sufficiently more solid than the structure that failed so miserably in 2008. MF Global was one of 22 primary dealers authorized to trade U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As a market maker in U.S. government paper, it was an insider's insider. Only those entities believed to be of bulletproof financial security are selected as primary dealers. Jon Corzine, former CEO of Goldman Sachs as well as former New Jersey governor and U.S. senator, had been the high-profile CEO of MF Global since April 2010. Under Corzine, MF Global expanded from its brokerage base and made a big move into proprietary trading, which is what spelled its downfall. MF Global's Company Overview and Financial Overview, both dated October 2011, tell a story quite different from that of a company about to plunge into insolvency. At the end of September, it touted $41.05 billion in net assets, $3.7 billion in available liquidity and $2.5 billion in total capital. It was able to sell $325 million in unsecured notes in August. It claimed ""solid risk management,"" a ""strong capital position,"" ""strong liquidity"" and an ""extremely liquid and high quality balance sheet."" Although $41 billion sounds like a lot, MF Global was a small player compared with Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns. MF Global is small enough to fail, and while capital markets are unlikely to seize up, investors, lenders and counterparties are likely to lose a good deal of money. These days, investors in companies such as MF Global are not just rich individuals and entities; they are often pension funds and other entities that pool the funds of small investors. So what happened? Last week, MF Global disclosed that it had $6.3 billion exposure to the shakiest of European sovereign debt. Its balance sheet was huge but terribly fragile. While it had lots of assets on its books, it also had a huge amount of borrowing. For every dollar of its own capital on its books, it had borrowed $40, a leverage even greater than that of Lehman Brothers at the time of its collapse. Why is that a problem in a time when near-zero interest rates extend as far as the eye can see? Because leverage is always treacherous and 40-to-1 leverage is madness. Even when interest rates are low, lenders demand security. When the value of that security goes down, the demand for margin -- additional collateral to secure the debt -- goes up. The plunge in the price of European sovereign debt meant that MF Global had to stump up more cash or easily marketable securities to its lenders so that they would have adequate security for their loans. A well capitalized, reasonably leveraged firm should be able to handle margin demands and survive. But with only 2.5% or so of its assets representing capital rather than borrowed money, MF Capital could not find enough of its own cash to satisfy its lenders. On Tuesday, we learned that $700 million in customer funds were intermingled and unaccounted for, suggesting that client accounts may have been used to meet margin calls and stay afloat. It is the same lesson that hit funds such as Carlyle Capital. Leverage can amplify returns but is reckless in volatile markets as relatively small price movements will send apparently asset-rich companies into bankruptcy. So what happens now? Well, it remains to be seen how deeply in a hole MF Global drove itself. Many will view the demise of MF Capital as just another bit of the ""creative destruction"" of capitalism. The Republican candidates complain that Dodd-Frank, last year's financial reform bill passed in response to the credit crisis, is stifling healthy risk-taking. The reality is that Dodd-Frank does not do enough to prevent financial institutions from taking excessive risks with investors' money. While it imposes leverage requirements on banks, those requirements are still quite limited, and institutions not regulated by federal banking agencies are not restricted in their risk-taking in any meaningful way. If their huge bets on European debts had paid off, Corzine and his colleagues would have added to their immense wealth. All of their incentives were to borrow as much money as possible so that small price movements in their direction would make them rich and large price movements in their direction would make them unimaginably rich. Their debts did not pay off; they are still rich, but there are many others who will be much poorer. Leverage is the steroid of modern finance that creates the hazardous incentives to bet big, keep the winnings and dump the losses onto others. What MF Global shows is that the problem is not too much regulation but too little. Without meaningful leverage restrictions on borrowers and meaningful lending restrictions on those who are willing to underwrite this steroidal debt expansion, MF Global is likely to be the tip of yet another iceberg. And we have yet to recover from the last financial Titanic. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Lewis.","Eric Lewis: MF Global's demise shows regulation today no more effective than in 2008 .

"(CNN) -- A total solar eclipse occurred over the northeastern Australian coast early in the morning of November 14 local time. Clueless about this spectacular astronomical event? No worries, we've got you covered. We're here to explain what causes this remarkable act of nature, what skygazers see and how those outside of Australia can join in the experience. What exactly is a total solar eclipse? A solar eclipse happens when the moon, as it orbits Earth, passes directly in front of the sun, obscuring its rays and casting a shadow on Earth's surface. Sometimes referred to as a ""happy accident of nature,"" a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon is perfectly aligned with both the sun and Earth, so it appears from our perspective that the sun is completely blocked. When is this happening and who can see it? The total solar eclipse became visible in the far north of Australia about an hour after sunrise local time on November 14 (afternoon of November 13 in the United States and evening of November 13 in Europe). A total eclipse of the sun can only be seen from within what's known as the path of totality, a narrow path the moon's inner shadow travels as it glides across the Earth. The most populated areas within that path are in the Cairns and Great Barrier Reef region. It estimated to take about three hours for the moon's shadow to travel the entire path of totality. What time total darkness occurred, and how long it lasted, depended on location. Totality was expected to begin in Cairns at 0638 local time and was to last nearly two minutes. By contrast, totality was estimated to only last just about 20 seconds in the small town of Innisfail. What's all the fuss about? Don't these happen frequently? According to NASA, a full solar eclipse happens, on average, every 18 months. The last one happened in July 2010, crossing Chile's Easter Island, and one will occur over equatorial Africa in November 2014. But for any given region, a total solar eclipse only happens, on average, once every 375 years. Solar eclipses were shrouded in superstition in ancient times -- in China, for example, viewing total solar eclipses was important for divining the future success of an emperor. However, as scientific knowledge deepened, these events became opportunities for conducting important experiments. It was during a total solar eclipse in 1919 that Einstein's theory of general relativity was tested and confirmed for the first time. Quiz: Can you see the light? What's it like to experience a solar eclipse and what do you see? A solar eclipse is often described as one of nature's most awe-inspiring events. Some people are so moved by the experience of watching an eclipse that they travel around the world chasing them. About an hour leading up to totality, all sorts of things begin to happen. There are changes in the color of the sky, the temperature drops, birds and animals behave in a peculiar manner and shadows sharpen, according to Rick Brown, an eclipse chaser from New York who is viewing his 14th total solar eclipse. ""I never really expected to be moved the way I was. It's a phenomenal thing to see,"" he said, recalling his first experience. As the moon's shadow sweeps across the Earth, the sun turns into a crescent in the sky. Just before totality, so-called Baily's beads â€” bright spots of sunlight shining through the moon's craggy surface â€” can appear around the moon. Then the moon completely blots out the sun, leaving only a halo of light visible. After the brief period of darkness, Baily's beads might appear again as the sun comes back into view. I missed it. Where can I see this eclipse? You can watch the video here on CNN. On Twitter, there was a tweet-up devoted to the event and you can always get first-hand accounts of the event on iReport, where we asked people to share their solar eclipse photos and experiences. Do I need special glasses to watch a solar eclipse? Yes! Permanent eye damage can occur if you look directly at the sun. That means when viewing any partial phase of a total eclipse, you need to wear proper solar eclipse glasses. Regular sunglasses won't offer enough protection, and forget about using telescopes or binoculars unless you've attached special filters to them. Only during totality can you remove filters and glasses. If you're feeling crafty, you can create your own pinhole projector. Any tips for first-time viewers? If you're keen to capture some good photos, you need to be prepared. Eclipse Chasers, a website devoted to solar eclipses, has several pointers for photographers. Among them: . -- Leave your flash attachment at home . -- Don't forget to remove your filter during totality . -- Use a telescope or telephoto lens with a focal length of 400 millimetres or more . -- Opt for manually focusing over auto focus . -- Keep your setup as portable, light and easy to assemble as possible in case you need to relocate in a hurry to escape clouds. Veteran eclipse watchers all had the same advice for first-timers: don't waste time fiddling with cameras and telescopes that you miss soaking up that fleeting moment of complete darkness.","A total solar eclipse was visible over Australia's Northern Territories on November 14 .

"New York (CNN) -- A Bronx woman accused of a charity scam after the Connecticut school shooting was indicted Tuesday on charges of scheming to defraud and identity theft, according to prosecutors. Nouel Alba, 37, is accused of falsely claiming to be an aunt of Noah Pozner, one of the 20 schoolchildren killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December, the Bronx District Attorney's Office said in a news release. On a Facebook page, she posted photos of Noah and solicited donations to pay for his funeral, the statement said. Donors sent $240 to a PayPal account between December 14 and 20, the statement said. Alba was arrested at her home and was arraigned by Judge Martin Marcus, who set bail at $10,000, the district attorney's office said. Alba's attorney, Justine Olderman, was not immediately available for comment Tuesday. The charges of scheming to defraud and identity theft carry sentences of up to four years in prison after conviction. Alba was indicted and charged on December 27 with one count of making false statements to federal agents. That charge carries a maximum term of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, prosecutors said. Alba denied being involved in a scam during an appearance on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 in December. ""This says -- this has your e-mail on it. Right there,"" said CNN investigative producer David Fitzpatrick. ""This is about Noah Pozner's funeral."" ""I never sent that,"" Alba replied. Later in the interview, Alba identified one of her e-mail accounts presented by Fitzpatrick. ""Yeah, that's one of my Gmails. ...Yeah, my personal account,"" she said during the interview. ""But I never set up any funds for anybody."" CNN reports spurred the Bronx district attorney's investigation, its news release said. Noah, 6, 19 other children and six adults were shot to death at the Newtown school on December 14. The gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, killed himself after the rampage.","Bronx woman posed as aunt of Sandy Hook victim, district attorney says .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's called ""plucking the bird,"" a strategy based on the analogy of pulling one feather at a time so the bird doesn't notice until it realizes it can't fly. That appears to be how the National Rifle Association and its allies in Congress are trying to overcome what would seem to be overwhelming public support for stronger gun legislation in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre. A sophisticated campaign led by the influential gun lobby shifts the focus of the battle among various provisions, raises new arguments to old issues and proposes solutions that would expand weapons use and training instead of increasing regulation. ""The NRA's modus operandi has always been to try and weaken and take down as many of these laws as possible,"" noted Lanae Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way, a moderate Democratic think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues. To NRA officials, its efforts are all in defense of constitutional rights intended to preserve personal freedom against any kind of government encroachment, especially laws they say will hinder and harass gun owners. ""If you aren't free to protect yourself -- when government puts its thumb on that freedom -- then you aren't free at all,'' the group's CEO and executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said last month. The NRA exerts its political clout through a rating system that identifies friends and foes of its positions in Congress, as well as substantial contributions to political campaigns it favors or opponents of candidates it dislikes. On the other side, President Barack Obama has been waging a public pressure campaign for tougher gun laws, an effort he continued Wednesday in Colorado, the site of two of the nation's most notorious mass shootings. Obama on background checks: 'Practical progress' on gun violence . Legislators in the state, where guns and hunting are popular, recently passed stricter firearms laws similar to what Obama seeks at the federal level. ""There doesn't have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our Second Amendment rights,"" Obama said, calling Colorado a model for that kind of solution. Obama didn't refer to the NRA by name, but he noted that opponents of tougher gun laws were ""well-organized"" and ""well-connected."" He called for an honest debate, saying ""we've got to get past some of the rhetoric that gets perpetuated that breaks down trust."" The president will make a similar appearance on Monday in Connecticut, less than four months after the Newtown attack by a lone gunman firing a semi-automatic rifle that would be prohibited under legislation under consideration in the U.S. Senate. Polls show the American public backs the president's position. A new survey Wednesday by MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" and Marist College found that 60% of respondents want stricter laws governing the sale of firearms. In particular, it showed 87% of respondents support expanded background checks, with strong backing from Democrats, independents and Republicans. Obama complained in his speech that Senate opponents who are certain to filibuster any legislation will do ""everything they can to avoid even allowing a vote on a proposal the overwhelming majority of the American people support."" ""They're saying your opinion doesn't matter,"" Obama said. It remained unclear whether a package of new gun laws recently passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee can overcome a certain filibuster by Senate Republicans that would block it from debate and a floor vote. The package includes expanding background checks to all firearms sales, tougher laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, and studying ways to improve school safety. A fourth proposal that would reinstate a ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault rifles already has been dropped due to opposition by the NRA, all Republicans and some Democrats, though Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid promises a floor vote on it as an amendment. Background checks opposed . Now the push for expanded background checks also could fall under assault from the NRA, which once backed the change. The proposal would add most private firearms sales to the current system in which licensed gun sellers check if a potential buyer has a criminal record or other prohibiting factor. The NRA contends record-keeping as part of an expanded background check system would serve as the first step toward a national gun registry that it considers a violation of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Gun vote unlikely to happen next week . It also says the change would fail to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms while imposing new burdens on law-abiding gun owners by including private weapons sales at gun shows and between friends in the background check system, from which they are currently exempt. ""This idea of private individuals transferring their weapons and having to go through a background check makes no sense,"" conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. Instead, Graham and the NRA advocate adding more information on people who are mentally ill to the existing system to prevent them from obtaining firearms. Supporters of tougher gun laws deny that expanded background checks would lead to a national gun registry, and they argue that the current law's exemption of private sales amounts to a loophole for straw purchasers obtaining guns for others ineligible to buy them on their own, including the mentally ill. ""We're not proposing gun registration; we're proposing background checks for criminals,"" Obama declared Wednesday. While Reid said he wanted a vote on the gun law package next week when the Senate returns from its spring break, two Democratic sources said that was unlikely because of the hangup over background checks. Erickson Hatalsky of Third Way said negotiations under way between Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York would determine if a compromise on the background check provision was possible. If so, the backing of Coburn, who gets an ""A"" rating from the NRA for his record on gun rights, would cause enough other Senate Republicans to join him in voting with Democrats to overcome a filibuster, she said. A compromise backed by Senate Republicans also would have more traction in the GOP-led House. Straw purchases provision challenged . The NRA and Republicans also are challenging another provision of the Senate legislation intended to crack down on straw purchases, arguing the current language is too broad and could penalize the original seller of a weapon that passes through several hands. Proposed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat Leahy, D-Vermont, the measure was the one in the bill that had been given the best chance of winning eventual congressional approval. The NRA's influence was on display Tuesday when former GOP Rep. Asa Hutchinson indicated to CNN that he differed with the NRA, then later clarified that he joined the organization in opposing the kind of expansion proposed by the Senate legislation. ""I'm open to expanding background checks,"" Hutchinson said initially in an interview about a panel he headed that was set up by the NRA to examine school safety following the Newtown attack. Such expanded checks must be done ""in a way that does not infringe upon an individual and make it hard for an individual to transfer to a friend or a neighbor or somebody,"" he added. After the remarks, an NRA spokesman told CNN that Hutchinson was ""not speaking"" for the group. Hutchinson later affirmed that he was not speaking for the NRA, and put his remarks in line with the group's position of including only more information on people with mental illness in the existing National Instant Check System. ""I have been focused on school safety and the interview surprised me by almost exclusively asking about the ongoing gun control debate,"" Hutchinson said in an e-mail to CNN. ""On background checks, my recollection is that I noted there is insufficient data in the NICS and that needs to be fixed and expanded. I am certainly 'open' to legislation that addresses expansion of data in the NICS."" Hutchinson's task force called Tuesday for training and arming adults in schools to reduce the response time in the event of an attack like the one in Newtown. Connecticut assembly to vote on gun law overhaul . ""Our mandate was to deal with the issue of inside the four walls of the classroom, the school property, for safety, because you can have your background checks, you can have all kinds of side issues or gun control,"" Hutchinson said. But those ""will not make a difference for the safety in the classroom because you've always got vulnerability there.""

"(CNN) -- Residents in parts of southern Yemen experienced a ""human rights catastrophe"" when an al-Qaeda affiliate took control of the country's Abyan province for 14 months, according to Amnesty International. In a new report entitled ""Conflict in Yemen: Abyan's Darkest Hour"", the rights group catalogs ""a raft of gross and deeply disturbing"" punishments carried out by Ansar al-Sharia, including crucifixions, public executions, amputations and floggings. Read more: Al Qaeda figure comes back to life in Yemen . ""They committed horrific abuses,"" said Cilina Nasser, of Amnesty International. ""They set up courts, their own courts and claimed to apply Islamic law."" One man, accused of spying for the U.S., was killed and then had his remains crucified. A video obtained by the rights group shows the rotting body, which had been left out in the open for days -- a warning to anyone who might consider doing the same. In another video, a prisoner, bound and blindfolded, is led to a public square. The man, convicted of spying on al-Qaeda for Saudi Arabia, is then readied for execution. Read more: Security official for U.S. Embassy in Yemen killed . For the U.S. and Yemen, who for years have been attempting to vanquish a resurgent and emboldened al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the news couldn't have been more dire. ""As the United States and as Saudi Arabia have been very, very concerned about al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula being able to sort of plot, plan and launch attacks from their hideouts in Yemen, the Saudis and Americans have worked together to create these undercover agents,"" Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen expert who has written a book on the nation. But the militants were not only going after alleged spies. Read more: Huge death toll doubles in Yemen 'slaughter' According to Amnesty International, one woman was beheaded for the crime of sorcery. In an extremely disturbing video, her severed head can be seen as it is paraded through the streets. And one young man, accused of theft, had his hand publicly amputated. ""They detained me in a room for five days,"" the young man later told the rights group. ""They kept beating me hard ... After five days, they gave me an injection and I slept ...When I woke up my hand was not there."" A chilling video shows him lying unconscious -- his left arm stretched out as one man begins cutting through the wrist. Once done, a spectator takes the severed hand and raises it for the gathered crowd to see. Cries of ""God is great"" can then be heard. ""In 2011, the Yemeni military essentially split during the uprising that eventually overthrew the long serving president Ali Abdullah Saleh,"" explained Yemen expert Gregory Johnsen. ""They were fighting amongst themselves and what this did is it opened up a lot of space for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and their affiliate Ansar Al-Shaira to take over villages and towns in Southern Yemen, particularly in Abyan and in Shabwa."" Between February 2011 and June 2012, after seizing those areas, they began imposing and practicing a very draconian interpretation of Islamic law. Read more: Huge suicide blast kills more than 100 troops in Yemen . But in that time, they were also able to provide services a weak central government had not. ""They established their own police system, their own court system,"" Johnsen said. ""They started to dig water wells, string electrical lines in villages that had never had these before, that had essentially been ignored by the Yemeni government for decades."" ""On one hand,"" added Johnsen, ""they were welcomed in the fact that they were able to impose law and security. But the longer they stayed, the more unpopular they became."" According to Amnesty International, in the end, the people of Abyan weren't just subjected to repression by Ansar al-Sharia, they were also subjected to additional violations by the Yemeni government forces. ""When the situation evolved into an armed conflict between Ansar al-Sharia and the Yemeni government,"" explained Nasser, ""both sides committed violations of international humanitarian law."" Amnesty's report states how Ansar al-Sharia used residential areas as its base, ""recklessly exposing civilian residents to harm."" The righs group also details how it says the Yemeni military's intense aerial bombardment as well as the use of inappropriate battlefield weapons in residential areas further endangered a population already in peril. ""Scores of civilians, including children, were killed,"" reads the report, ""and many more injured as a result of air strikes and artillery and mortar attacks by government forces."" The ""toxic mix of fighting and human rights abuses,"" it states, ""meant an estimated 250,000 people from the southern governorates, particularly Abyan, were displaced."" The Yemeni government said it is studying the Amnesty report. ""The Yemeni government will carefully examine the findings,"" said Mohammed Albasha, the spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington. ""Sanaa continues to welcome the international community's support of the government's efforts to promote and protect human rights."" Albasha added that Yemen's President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi had this past September ""established a committee to investigate human rights violations"" and that the country had ""officially adopted the Paris Principles, which provide guidelines on the protection of children during armed conflict."" While Ansar al-Sharia was ultimately driven out and Yemen's government ended up claiming success, continued instability in the country, a haven for Al-Qaeda, has left many wondering how long will that victory may last.","New Amnesty International report came out Tuesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- The first day of business of President Barack Obama's second term began with a prayer service Tuesday, but it will take more than spiritual guidance to change the divisive culture of Washington politics. Conservative critics of the president wasted no time ripping into an inaugural address laden with progressive themes such as climate change, gun control, gay rights and immigration reform. More specifically, they targeted the president's vigorous defense of costly but popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. ""One thing that is pretty clear from the president's speech yesterday -- the era of liberalism is back,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""An unabashedly, far left-of-center inauguration speech certainly brings back memories of the Democratic Party of ages past."" If Obama ""pursues that kind of agenda, obviously it is not designed to bring us together and certainly not designed to deal with the transcendent issue of our era, which is deficit and debt. Until we fix that problem, we can't fix America."" Obama's inaugural address ""was trying basically to throw a bone to every left-wing activist group he could,"" said Rep. Dave Schweikert, R-Arizona. Back at work, Republicans assess Obama's address . Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group that focuses on fiscal policy, labeled Obama's speech ""harshly ideological"" and akin to ""a liberal laundry list."" The group will ""be in the vanguard of the effort to oppose the president's big government policies,"" its president, Tim Phillips, said in a statement Monday. In his inaugural address, Obama insisted that programs such as Social Security and Medicare -- long targets of conservatives seeking to cut the size of government -- remain vital to the maintenance of America's safety net for the elderly, poor and disabled. Second-term priorities . ""We, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,"" Obama declared, adding that tough decisions on how to address the nation's chronic federal deficits and debt must avoid choosing between ""caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future."" While some Republicans sounded less combative, they said they were nevertheless disappointed by the president's inaugural remarks. Obama ""could have found some way to be more constructive,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told CNN. ""I think he should have done more to say there's honest disagreement"" instead of characterizing the debate as ""the voice of reason on his side"" and ""shrill cries on the other side."" King acknowledged that some on the right ""are never going to agree"" with Obama but insisted the president needs to indicate a willingness to compromise with the GOP to make progress on the major issues facing the country. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN on Monday that while ""there are plenty of areas of disagreement ... there also are some things fundamentally we agree on, and that is this country is one of opportunity."" Marine Band: Beyonce lip-synched . Differences involve ""the way we get there to help everybody,"" Cantor said, adding that ""hopefully, we can bridge those differences."" The Republican response reflected in part a continuing split between conservatives resisting concessions to the president and GOP moderates trying to buff up the party's tarnished reputation in light of a growing public perception of congressional dysfunction. A House vote set for Wednesday on suspending the federal debt ceiling for three months will provide the first test of GOP resolve. The measure represents the latest in a series of Republican concessions on spending and debt issues, with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and his leadership team proposing the debt ceiling increase without any spending cuts they had previously demanded to offset the cost. In return, they demand that the Democratic-controlled Senate pass a budget for the first time in four years, which would provide a platform for a detailed congressional debate on spending. Otherwise, the measure calls for legislators to forgo their salaries until they complete a spending plan. Granderson: Obama's rallying cry . Boehner told House Republicans in a meeting Tuesday afternoon that passing a short-term debt ceiling suspension ""buys time for the House and Senate both to pass a budget,"" according to a GOP source at the gathering. The source noted that former vice presidential nominee and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, will work with House GOP leaders to draft a budget by an April 15 deadline. The budget would place federal spending on a trajectory to eliminate the deficit within 10 years, a goal shared by the speaker. ""It's time for the Senate to act,"" Boehner told reporters after the GOP meeting. ""You can't continue to spend money you don't have."" Obama, who rejects any negotiations over the debt ceiling, has welcomed the House plan as a step forward because it prevents immediate brinksmanship over whether the government will meet its financial obligations. A political battle over raising the debt ceiling in 2011 contributed to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Four of your top second-term priorities . The White House Office of Management and Budget released a statement Tuesday afternoon noting that while ""the administration supports a long-term increase in the debt limit that would increase certainty and economic stability, ... the administration would not oppose a short-term solution to the debt limit."" The White House ""looks forward to continuing to work with both the House and the Senate to increase certainty and stability for the economy,"" the statement concluded. However, some conservative House Republicans oppose Boehner's debt ceiling measure, setting up a possible repeat of previous votes in which the speaker failed to get enough support from his GOP conference to push through a bill. What else could Washington waste four years doing? ""I think it's a terrible idea,"" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California, told Fox Business Network on Monday, arguing the plan ""gives the most spendthrift administration in this country's history literally an open credit card to borrow as much as they can."" Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, also disagreed with giving up the leverage of the debt ceiling without any guaranteed spending cuts in return. ""At some point, we have got to use the leverage we have to bring this spending down and to actually make the president do what he said in his speech,"" Gohmert told FBN. In addition, Gohmert complained that Boehner's plan essentially gives the ""millionaires club"" in the Senate the power to determine whether he and other House members who need their congressional salaries will get paid. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney called the House GOP plan ""a welcome thing"" and rejected accusations that Obama's address Monday amounted to liberal ideology. ""He focuses on the fact that we are Americans first, and I hardly thing the pursuit of equal rights, pursuit of comprehensive immigration reform, pursuit of sensible policies that deal with climate change and enhance our energy independence are ideological,"" Carney said Tuesday. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid outlined an agenda that closely conformed to the priorities of the president's inaugural address the day before. NRA chief: Obama makes 'mockery' of American freedoms . ""The last Congress was too often characterized by sharp political divides -- divides that hampered efforts to foster success for all Americans,"" the Nevada Democrat said, telling his colleagues that ""it is possible to hold fast to your principles while making the compromises necessary to move our country forward."" At the same time, Reid said Senate Democrats ""will stand strong -- strong -- for the standard of balance, and we will remain resolute -- resolute -- in the pursuit of fairness for all Americans, regardless of where they were born or the color of their skin, regardless of the size of their bank accounts, regardless of their religion or their sexual orientation."" McConnell also called for compromise but said it was Democrats who must be willing to meet in the middle. ""Over the past four years, while the president focused on re-election and too many Senate Democrats focused on avoiding tough decisions, the debt grew by more than $6 trillion,"" McConnell said. ""In short, Democrats have put off all the hard stuff until now. And our problems have only gotten worse. But that was the first term."" Saying ""a lot of Democrats are afraid of a process that exposes their priorities, particularly on spending and debt,"" McConnell made clear that Republicans reject any further increases in tax revenue after the fiscal cliff deal at the end of the last Congress that raised rates on top income earners. ""Since the revenue question has been settled,"" he said, ""I'm sure the American people are eager to see what other ideas Democrats might have to bring down our ruinous deficits.""

"(CNN) -- South Korea's first female president Park Geun Hye will take office on Monday in the shadow of two giants -- the first is the specter of a nuclear-armed North Korea and the second is the legacy of her father, former military dictator Park Chung Hee. The daughter of the assassinated strongman of South Korea, Park, 61, will be sworn into Seoul's presidential Blue House promising a conservative policy of ""trustpolitik"" with its volatile northern neighbor -- a concept that emphasizes what she has called ""mutually binding expectations"" between the two sides. The policy stands in contrast to that of former President Lee Myung-bak, who demanded an end to Pyongyang's nuclear arms program as a condition of economic aid. His hard line stance came under fire towards the end of his tenure for having achieved little, and for even having further strained relations between the two Koreas. It's hoped that Park's softer carrot-and-stick approach will tease concessions from Pyongyang at a time when relations have reached an all-time nadir. In 2010, the North shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong leaving two marines and two civilians dead. Pyongyang claimed Seoul provoked the attack by holding a military drill off their shared coast in the Yellow Sea. That same year, North Korea was also accused of sinking a South Korean warship, killing more than 40 sailors. The incidents caused widespread anger in the South. ""As one Korean proverb goes, one-handed applause is impossible. By the same token, peace between the two Koreas will not be possible without a combined effort,"" Park told Foreign Affairs magazine before winning December's elections. ""For more than half a century, North Korea has blatantly disregarded international norms. But even if Seoul must respond forcefully to Pyongyang's provocations, it must also remain open to new opportunities for improving relations between the two sides. ""Precisely because trust is at a low point these days, South Korea has a chance to rebuild it. In order to transform the Korean Peninsula from a zone of conflict into a zone of trust, South Korea should adopt a policy of 'trustpolitik,' establishing mutually binding expectations based on global norms."" Fiscally conservative and advocating tax cuts for business to boost investment and jobs, Park also has plans to restructure welfare programs and boost the country's flagging birth rate. Regarded as a cold and somewhat distant figure, the 61-year-old president-elect is no stranger to politics and personal tragedy. Although she was well-known in South Korean politics -- she was effectively the de facto first lady after North Korean agents killed her mother in 1974 -- Park only launched her political career in 1998. In the wake of the disappointments of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, she took a seat in the National Assembly on a wave of nostalgia for her father who was assassinated in 1979. Park -- one of the founders of modern Korea who assumed power in a coup d'etat -- was shot by his own intelligence chief. The memory of Park Chung Hee still divides South Korea -- some regard him as the cornerstone of South Korea's present prosperity, others as a dictator who ignored human rights and crushed dissent. While she has apologized for human rights violations during his rule, Park has been criticized for not doing enough to distance herself from his legacy. Park, who is unmarried, has won plaudits for being the first woman to win an election in a deeply patriarchal South Korea. ""I have no family to take care of and no children to pass wealth to. You, the people, are my family and your happiness is the reason that I stay in politics,"" Park told a press conference after winning the election. However, David Kang, professor of international relations and business at the University of Southern California, told CNN her long-held position as a star in the firmament of South Korean politics may have carried more weight at the polls. ""That a woman could be elected in South Korea is historic and important. At the same time, what you basically have to do is be political royalty. I think gender roles are changing in South Korea. It's a step forward, but let's also remember how unique she is as a person."" While relations with North Korea play better overseas than on the domestic stage, where many voters are now inured to the daily threats that emanate across the border, analysts say Park may be better equipped than her predecessor at coaxing concessions -- especially in its nuclear program -- from the North. Park visited Pyongyang and met with former leader Kim Jong Il in 2002. She is considered among a small coterie of South Korean insiders who have the confidence of Pyongyang, and analysts believe Park will pursue a policy of economic concessions with the North, promoting commercial ties and promoting trading zones in a bid to ease tensions.","South Korea's first female president Park Geun Hye will take office on Monday .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Two PAC 3 Patriot anti-missile batteries currently occupy what is normally a baseball pitch in the leafy grounds of Japan's Ministry of Defense. They point northwest -- in the general direction of North Korea. They were moved here to the heart of the Japanese capital in the early hours of Tuesday morning, alongside further batteries in two Tokyo suburbs. And if the intelligence is right, and North Korea has moved one, maybe two mid-range missiles to its eastern coast, any test firing it might choose to conduct could conceivably have its trajectory over Japan. Pyongyang is just 800 miles (1,287 kilometers) from Tokyo. It would take between five and 10 minutes for a missile to reach the skies over Tokyo. The concern here is not that North Korea has Japan or indeed any particular target in its sights, whatever its grandiose claims, it is that something might go wrong with a missile test. ""The North Koreans are not trying to attack Japan but to scare the Americans,"" says Narushige Michishita, director of security studies at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS) in Tokyo. ''The problem is the missile might malfunction and part of the debris might land on Japanese territory."" Residents whose homes overlook the Ministry of Defense are getting used to these military apparitions outside their bedroom windows. The Patriots have been deployed here three times since 2009, each time North Korea has announced it will launch what it claims is a satellite, but what most other countries call a missile. ""The situation is acute,"" Japan's defense minister told the unit commander on a visit to the site laid on for journalists. ""Be ready to take prompt action whenever the order is made."" It is arguable that this deployment in the heart of the capital is partly for show -- to guarantee photographers an easy front page and thus reassure nervous Tokyoites that their safety is secured. But the missile defense shield the Japanese have developed with the U.S. to safeguard this region is one of the world's most sophisticated. These latest deployments are about fine-tuning. If the previous three ""satellite"" launches are anything to go by, the Japanese government will have positioned Aegis Destroyers equipped with SM-3 missile interception systems in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. It has been widely reported that has happened -- though the government won't confirm it, unwilling to ""show its cards,"" a spokesman said, to the North Koreans. These deployments should suffice, says Michishita. ""Generally a sea-based system is more useful because it has a wider area it can defend. PAC 3 is more contained but together they are effective.'' But Kim Jong Un's belligerence has some Tokyo residents clearly worried. Junro Kato came out in search of TV crews like us armed with a map showing how far North Korea's missiles can reach. ""North Korea can hit Japan in five minutes,"" he said. ""If there are miscalculations between U.S. and North Korea, military conflict will happen."" For others though, the overriding emotion is astonishment -- astonishment at their puffed up neighbor's endless posturing.","Patriot anti-missile batteries appeared overnight this week in Japanese capital .
They are deployed in case North Korea carries out its threat to test-fire a missile .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. peacekeeping chief says Syria is now in a civil war. Some experts agree with U.N. official Herve Ladsous that the war-torn country has reached that chilling milestone. Others say the country is hurtling in that direction. The conflict began in March 2011 when a fierce Syrian government crackdown on peaceful protesters morphed into a bloody government uprising. Stephen Biddle, Roger Hertog Senior Fellow for Defense Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said popular conversation about civil war tends to be dominated by images of the U.S. Civil War, and it conjures a vague picture of a ""really bad conflict."" But the rigorously defined scholarly meaning of civil war fits Syria now, just as it applied to Iraq last decade, he said. U.N. report: Syrian children tortured, used as human shields . ""A civil war is a conflict in which at least one side is a non-state actor, with at least 1,000 total battle deaths and at least 100 on each side,"" he said. Anuradha Chakravarty, assistant professor of political science at the University of South Carolina, cites a similar threshold and notes that the estimates of 10,000 to 14,000 battle-related deaths so far in Syria fulfills the definition. She said the definition has ""little to do with the growing use recently of attack helicopters"" to wage war. ""Syria did not start out as a case of civil war because the opposition to the government mainly took the form of a popular uprising in March 2011,"" she said. ""However, later that year, the Free Syrian Army and its organization of an armed rebellion against the government (in defense of the civilian uprising) fulfilled at least the most basic criterion of a civil war -- the armed confrontation between a rebel group and the government. Thus, Syria turned into a civil war situation much earlier than recent observations by the U.N. would suggest."" Like other civil wars, she said the situation has ""notable international dimensions,"" with reports of Russian military support for the regime and reports of the United States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey backing the rebels. Syria's government on Thursday rejected the claim, saying ""Syria is not witnessing a 'civil war' but rather a struggle to uproot the plague of terrorism."" But Chakravarty said an ""important difference that the 'civil war' label makes is that the Assad regime cannot credibly claim that it is only a sectarian conflict or that this is a terrorist struggle against the people of Syria. It is squarely an armed attempt by non-state groups (who define themselves mostly in a non-sectarian manner, and claim to speak in the name of the people) to overthrow the government, and fight for territorial control."" James Fearon, a professor of political science at Stanford University, defines a civil war as ""an armed conflict within a country between organized groups who are fighting to control the central government or over control of a region."" The Syrian conflict ""has qualified as a civil war for a while now,"" he said. He cited the same academic thresholds that political scientists and sociologists use for a civil war: 1,000 killed in a conflict's duration or 1,000 killed per year, but added: ""How many is enough to qualify is matter of opinion, and this arbitrariness might be the source of some of the disagreement about whether Syria, etc, is having a civil war or not. "" It doesn't matter how much of the country is in conflict for unrest to be defined as a civil war, he said. ""For instance, we call the conflict in the U.S. in the first part of the 1860s a civil war, even though things were entirely peaceful in almost all of the North,"" he said. Syria: Battle for the cities . Two organized forces facing off against each other is also a necessary part of the definition, said Joseph Holliday, a researcher at the Institute for the Study of War. In Syria, there have been sectarian tensions between the Sunnis and the Alawites, with the opposition overwhelmingly Sunni and the pro-government Alawites, who dominate the regime of Bashar al-Assad, also an Alawite. ""When you let the sectarian genie out of the bottle, it's hard to put back in,"" Fearson said. He said the opposition fighters are becoming an organized militia force. The pro-regime Shabiha militias, dominated also by Alawites, are becoming more significant, signaling an erosion in the government's chain of command. ""I think Syria is a civil war or has all of the components to become one in the future."" Michael Weiss, a Syria expert at the Henry Jackson Society, said parts of Syria are in civil war. ""Civil war suggests the previous state that exists all but failed and collapsed,"" he said. In some regions, the government lacks control and there is a ""growing equalization"" of forces, he said. Steven Heydemann, senior adviser for Middle East initiatives at the U.S. Institute for Peace, said the regime's tactics, the escalation in violence and a growing supply of weapons to the opposition indicate the conflict is moving closer to a civil war. While there are ""some isolated areas in Syria where conditions have crossed the threshold for civil war,"" Syria has not yet ""crossed that threshold with respect to the conflict as a whole."" He used Lebanon and Libya as the model for civil war. In Lebanon during the 1980s, the state collapsed and ""we saw a proliferation of armed groups across society in multiple directions"" in a society with no controlling authority, Heydemann said. During last year's civil war in Libya, there were two competing armed forces, with the quality of weapons and the scale of the units largely comparable on each side. ""Neither of those conditions exist in Syria,"" he said. The regime commands armed forces totaling about 200,000 troops and has ample resources such as tanks and helicopters, he said. The armed opposition is basically a ""localized insurgency,"" much smaller, poorly equipped and trained and ""not integrated into any coherent command and control structure."" So while the conflict between these forces does not constitute a civil war at the moment, said Heydemann, the pace and intensity of opposition activity could change that. Jeff White, a defense fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Syria is edging toward civil war, but is not there yet. ""My definition of civil war is a situation which is characterized by conflict between two, or more, segments of society. I still see the situation in Syria as one of fundamentally an armed and unarmed insurrection against the government. That is, the people are fighting the state, not each other."" That said, the elements of civil war are taking hold. ""The regime is heavily, perhaps increasingly reliant on Alawite fighters both within the regular military and in its irregular forces. The regime has also begun using Alawite villagers in attacks on neighboring Sunni towns and villages. There are also reports of Sunni retaliation for attacks. This is the kind of activity that creates its own dynamic and can spread easily,"" he said. The tipping point could be a ""tipping period."" That would be when ""communal violence increases in scope and intensity until it dominates the situation,"" White said. ""We will know it when we see it; but things to look for would include: organized and directed violence by one sect against another (as opposed to spontaneous actions), declarations by community political and religious leaders that the enemy is the other sect (as opposed to 'Bashar's dogs/pigs' and 'terrorists'), cleansing of areas, organization of irregular forces along sectarian lines, regime arming of Alawite villages for 'defense' against Sunnis, breakdown of Syrian military forces along sectarian lines. We have bits and pieces of this now, and the bits and pieces seem to be accumulating."" The rhetoric used to describe the conflict has important meaning. The term ""civil war"" can change the dynamics of a conflict. ""In the Iraq war, the Bush administration didn't want the conflict described as a civil war because it feared that this would increase public opposition -- if it's a civil war, then it's their business and we shouldn't bother with it, or expect to be able to fix it,"" Fearon said. ""In the Syria case, it is the advocates of greater intervention (and/or greater pressure on Russia) who are saying 'It may be soon be a civil war,' by which they mean 'This is really bad and we have to do something about it,'"" he said. White said defining a conflict as a civil war has political implications. ""There is always reluctance to get involved in a civil war. So defining it so supports non-intervention. It also tends to spread the blame for violence more or less evenly across the parties. It is much easier to get behind an insurrection than take sides in a civil war."" Chakravarty said once a conflict is deemed a civil war, it can compel ""more assertive forms of actions from various international actors concerned about their interests in the country."" This could be in the form of international intervention and heightened diplomatic efforts at negotiation, she said. Heydemann said the specter of a civil war could increase pressure on policy makers to act so decisively that incremental measures to deal with the conflict might be ""left by the wayside."" Also, he said, the international community has been reluctant to support the opposition because it would contribute to instability, international spillover, the presence of jihadists, and the militarization of the opposition. Now that all of those factors have emerged, they might determine that ""some form of engaging"" would be the response to a civil war. Holliday said labeling a conflict as a civil war matters politically, but he doesn't know how much it alone would make a difference. He cited the slaughter of civilians in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, which helped prompt international involvement in that civil conflict in the 1990s. ""The instances of sectarian violence against civilians will make a difference,"" he said. ""That type of thing is the biggest factor to push toward U.S. involvement.""

"(CNN) -- Eurostar, the high-speed train company connecting London with Brussels and Paris, is undergoing a massive overhaul. Its chief executive, Nicolas Petrovic, says a new fleet of trains will be ready by 2015, and to go with it, there will be new uniforms and new products. Recently a redesigned website was launched to make it easier for passengers to book trips. But the real change over coming years will be a broadened destination network. ""We have this big program of expansion to re-energize the business, and based on that, we will be able to expand our business beyond our core routes,"" Petrovic says. London, Brussels and Paris have long been the company's main stops, with every train going through the Channel Tunnel. To extend away from these routes, Eurostar first needs the fleet, Petrovic says, but the greatest challenge is economic: ""How do we make money going to Holland, the South of France, anywhere -- the amount of money we have to pay to access the tracks?"" After existing as a partnership of three railway companies since its establishment in 1994, Eurostar only became a single corporate entity in 2010 -- the same year Petrovic became chief executive. His track record has been encouraging; in 2011, the company turned a profit for the first time in its now 18-year history. And despite a rough economic climate in Europe last year, the company's profits doubled, its business given an extra boost by an increased number of passengers after the London Olympics. Read more: China's high-speed rail dreams . The recent and upcoming changes are partly in anticipation of competition from Deutsche Bahn for train service through the Channel Tunnel, which Eurostar has monopolized until now. Deutsche Bahn has said it may start those operations in 2016. Eurostar has already begun some new routes. A direct route that goes from London to Lyon and Provence in southern France will begin operations in May, while trains to the Swiss Alps began running last year. Routes with busy air traffic, Petrovic says, offer high potential for Eurostar to grab market share. Other than journeys to Provence and the Alps, these popular flights include London to and from Holland and Germany. Also taking a cue from air travel, Eurostar may partner with other services to broaden its network of routes. Petrovic says whether to partner up -- or not -- will be determined for each market. ""But we package it for the customers so they don't see the difference, and it's to try to bring to the railway the thinking of the airlines when they started to do hubs and spoke of connections between different airlines,"" he says. Read more: Hotels aim to be offices of the future . Petrovic believes it will take years for people to think of train hubs and partnerships the same way they do for airlines, but he believes it will happen someday. ""It's a combination. You need to have the marketing right, the product right, the service right and to be a bit patient at times. But I really believe it is going to work,"" he says. Eurostar has undergone other transformations in recent years. In 2010, it introduced a whole new travel class, called standard premier, which is priced between standard and business class. One of the target markets of standard premier are business travelers whose companies have tightened finances and put the brakes on pricy business class travel. ""We've got a business product, which is fantastic actually, but for many companies, the CFOs were saying 'no business.' So we created what they were looking for, and they are happy with it,"" Petrovic says.","Eurostar, the high-speed train company, is undergoing a massive overhaul .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish and Israeli officials sat down at the negotiating table for the first time since Israel's prime minister apologized a month ago for a deadly 2010 raid on a Gaza-bound aid ship that left eight Turks and an American dead. The one-day talks were held in the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Monday. The two delegations discussed guidelines for determining how much Israel would compensate the families of the victims, according to Turkey's semi-official Anatolian News Agency. Further talks are likely, although an exact timetable has not been released. Relations between Israel and Turkey, once close military and economic partners in the region, ruptured after the botched raid of the ship Mavi Marmara nearly three years ago. Turkey withdrew its ambassador from Israel. Since then, Ankara has demanded a formal apology, compensation for victims, normalization of ties between the two countries, and that Israel lift its blockade on the Palestinian territory of Gaza. During a visit to the region last month, President Barack Obama succeeded in brokering a critical phone call between the leaders of Turkey and Israel, two key American allies in the turbulent Middle East. During the call, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accepted an apology from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""In light of Israel's investigation into the incident, which pointed out several operational mistakes, Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed Israel's apology to the Turkish people for any mistakes that might have led to loss of life or injury and agreed to conclude an agreement on compensation/non-liability,"" the Israeli government said last month. In its own official statement, Turkey said the two leaders ""agreed to work together to improve the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories."" There are still potential obstacles to a normalization of relations between the two governments. Turkey has been prosecuting four Israeli military commanders in absentia in connection to the Mavi Marmara raid. Also, families of the victims have said a compensation settlement will not stop their legal process against the soldiers until Israel ends its blockade on Gaza. ""We see the negotiations for compensation for those killed as disrespectful when no steps have been taken to ensure the rights of those oppressed in the Palestinian lands and while the siege of our Palestinian brothers continues,"" said a statement from the families. Meanwhile, Turkish President Abdullah Gul and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas met in Istanbul for talks on regional issues, according to a statement by the office of the Turkish president. Turkey became the first country to send an ambassador to Palestine last month, according to the statement. Turkey and Israel have been two pro-Western political, economic, and military linchpins in the Middle East, and their falling out over the 2010 flotilla raid has hurt initiatives to tackle problems in the region, such as the Syrian civil war and tensions relating to Iran's nuclear aspirations. The Free Gaza Movement organized the flotilla to bring goods into Gaza, and to raise awareness over what it calls Israel's ""illegal siege on Gaza."" Israeli commandos raided one of the ships, the Mavi Marmara, because it violated the Israeli-imposed blockade on the Palestinian territory. More on the flotilla raid . Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the militant group Hamas seized control of the Palestinian territory. It is designed to stop the smuggling of arms into the territory, the Israeli government says. But activists say Israel's embargo of goods into Gaza from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the Mediterranean coast.","Turkey, Israel discuss 2010 flotilla raid compensation .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan authorities have made more arrests in connection with the attack on the U.S. Consulate that left the U.S. ambassador and three others dead, the president of Libya's parliament said Sunday. Mohamed al-Magariaf, the head of Libya's General National Congress, said around 50 people have been arrested, though another senior government official said the number was not that high. The official said as many as 50 people have been brought in for questioning but not all of them were arrested. They were people who were at a protest outside the consulate but there was no indication yet that they took part in the violence, he said. Ambassador's last moments . Al-Magariaf told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that a ""few"" of those arrested are foreigners, some of them from Mali and Algeria. The others are affiliated with al Qaeda or are sympathizers, he said. Al-Magariaf said he has ""no doubt"" the fatal attack was planned and not a result of the anti-American demonstrations that began that day -- the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. ""Definitely it was planned by foreigners, by people who entered the country a few months ago, and they were planning this criminal act since their arrival,"" he said. The senior Libyan government official said there is no evidence yet that the attack was planned or that al Qaeda was involved. U.S. officials believe extremists carried out the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, but that they did it after a spontaneous protest began outside the building, said Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned,"" Rice told ""Face the Nation."" Zakaria: Protests don't tell the whole story . The FBI is investigating the attack but has yet to enter the country because of volatility there.

"(CNN) -- As investigators scramble to figure out who killed two Texas prosecutors, suspicions abound over whether the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas played a role. Authorities have not officially linked the two slayings, nor do they know whether the white supremacist group ordered the attacks. But a series of events leading up to the killings have raised questions about the group's possible involvement. Here's a primer on the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas: . What is the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas? The FBI describes the group as a ""whites only,"" prison-based gang that has been operating since at least the 1980s. ""I think the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas today is arguably the most violent white supremacist prison gang out there,"" said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center. The group has been blamed for more than 100 homicides and at least 10 kidnappings since the early 1980s. Is the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas part of the Aryan Brotherhood? No. Inmates in Texas asked the Aryan Brotherhood, a California-based prison gang, for permission to start a Texas chapter, but they were denied membership, the Southern Poverty Law Center said. It's not clear why. Nonetheless, the Texas-based group modeled itself after the California gang. What does the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas stand for? Like the Aryan Brotherhood, the Texas group's main purpose morphed from protecting white inmates to criminal activities involving drugs, extortion and murders, authorities say. It also espouses a white supremacist ideology. ""At the end of the day, these organizations are really fundamentally criminal enterprises,"" Potok said. ""That means, above all, their interest is in green. In money. Skin color comes long after that."" Its reach began to extend outside prison walls as more members finished their sentences. ABT members on parole are required not only to remain loyal to the gang, but also to recruit new members. ""Brutal beatings, fire bombings, drug trafficking and murder are all part of ABT's alleged standard operating procedures,"" said Lanny Breuer, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney General. Did the group play a role in the deaths of Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse? Authorities don't know. But McLelland's office was one of numerous agencies involved in a multi-year investigation that led to the indictment of 34 alleged members of the ABT -- including four of its senior leaders -- on racketeering charges in November. At the time, Breuer called the indictment a ""devastating blow"" to the organization. Weeks later, the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statewide warning saying it had ""credible information"" that members of the group were planning to retaliate. In an interview with The Associated Press after Hasse's death, McLelland said his deputy hadn't been involved in the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas investigation. But the district attorney nevertheless raised the possibility the group was behind the death. ""We put some real dents in the Aryan Brotherhood around here in the past year,"" McLelland told the news agency. How do members join the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas? ""It is said to be one of the gangs that live by the 'blood-in, blood-out' code, meaning that you can only get into ABT by carrying out some kind of attack,"" Potok said. ""And similarly ... you can only leave in a body bag."" CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","The Aryan Brotherhood of Texas has been blamed for more than 100 homicides .

"(Parenting) -- Dear Mr. Principal, . My son, Aden, started seventh grade today. He's the one who often sits in his guidance counselor's office because he's too nervous to go to class. Remember, the kid who got two days of suspension because he broke your ""personal space"" rule by touching another boy's necklace he thought was cool? I want a fresh start this year, so it's time you heard who Aden is. His trouble with school started early. He cried every day in kindergarten until nearly Thanksgiving. His teacher, on her last year after 36 with the district, put him at a desk alone, facing the corner. To keep us from figuring this out, she moved his desk back on open school night and parent-teacher conferences (during which she lamented his high-energy and ""incorrigible"" attitude). We found out in May, when my husband walked into the room unexpectedly with a forgotten snack. Parenting: 8 times your doctor wants you to call . The diagnosis of ADHD came as third grade started. We gave him the meds, which his teacher appreciated. Still, homework was a battle. The teacher sent us notes, full of obvious tips she must have thought we were too incompetent to have considered, like setting up a homework spot and providing a snack. These rubber-stamp homework success tips did nothing to address the elephant in the room: the fact that a kid who reads at a level several grades below the one he's in is not going to be able to do, say, the social studies homework which involves reading a textbook. Soon the medication's effects wore off. And the thing was, it was too late for any pill to make him love to learn anyway. The next three years proceeded in the same way: We spent the first half of the year being scared by threats of his being left back, predictions of his never graduating high school if he didn't read more, even becoming a ""troubled teen."" Then with spring came the state tests, which he passed, literally, by a point or two. I was mystified, considering that he flunked nearly every in-class test. I asked how this was possible, and never got a straight answer. We pleaded for him to go to summer school, and the answer was always ""He's fine! Summer school is only for the kids who don't pass the tests. See you next year."" Parenting: Top iPhone apps for kids . So we paid a tutor each summer. We knew she couldn't work a miracle, but her unspoken role was to praise his efforts, something few adults did. We gladly paid her for that. As his academic abilities floundered, though, his athletic abilities grew; he was an all-star basketball player every year, MVP twice. At practices, the other moms would drop their sons off. I stayed for the hour and a half, all alone, watching. Do you have kids, Mr. Principal? For a couple of hours a week, he wasn't a problem. He was a star. Basketball saved him...and me. On July 4, 2010, we were watching fireworks when his head started twitching. Then his arm started jerking. The tics got worse and as the first day of fifth grade approached, he started grunting, chirping, and meowing. Tourette syndrome was diagnosed. The kids that year, having known him all through elementary school, were pretty tolerant. At the end of fifth grade, I was finally able to convince the special education committee that a child who has never been able to read a single grade-level summer reading book is not ""fine."" He was put into an inclusion class as he moved into your school. Parenting: 5 secrets for a longer life . The kids in junior high, though, weren't as kind as the ones in elementary school. He was bullied on the bus, called a freak. With all due respect, your ""zero tolerance anti-bullying policy"" is crap. A kid got off the bus at Aden's stop, and then attempted to strangle him. He got two days suspension, after which he commenced taunting my son as if nothing had happened. Ironically, that was the same punishment Aden got earlier in the year for admiring that shark tooth necklace a little too closely. And then, with your ""classes come first"" policy, Aden couldn't play basketball anymore. As you know, no extracurricular activities if a kid is in danger of failing any subject. No exceptions, even for special-ed students. I lost my all-star point guard, and Aden lost the one thing that made him feel good about himself. Maybe if he had been allowed some extracurriculars, he might have perceived school to be more fun, and tried a little harder. Just a thought. Now you know the story of Number 49 on your special education roster: He looks like any other 12-year old boy: gawky, a little bedraggled, yet usually smiling, with braces. But he had a rough start and never fully recovered. He often says ""I'm stupid,"" or ""Everyone hates me,"" and sometimes, ""I don't care anymore."" Parenting: Could you be pregnant? In summer school last month, he got a 70. A pleasure to have in class, they said. So there is hope. He's not the norm in your school, but he's one of yours, still. Please make room for him, and kids like him, in your policies and your attitude. And if he's still in danger of failing something come October...can you bend your rule for basketball? If we work together, we can prove that elementary-school teacher who saw him as a future troubled teen wrong. But time grows short. Get 2 FREE YEARS of Parenting magazine - Subscribe Now!!

"(CNN) -- When Bill Clinton takes the podium at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday evening his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, will be half a world away -- literally -- meeting with the leaders of the tiny nation of East Timor. Hillary Clinton, who hasn't missed a Democratic convention in four decades, is on an 11-day swing through the Asia-Pacific region, visiting a number of counties, including China and Indonesia, and standing in for President Barack Obama at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this week in Russia. Obama bowed out because of the election campaign. Some Clinton-watchers see an ulterior motive, concluding that the secretary, who waged a hard-fought campaign against Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination in 2008, still bears a grudge. Obama and Bill: A solid relationship? But the two have worked closely since then and, what's more, there's a less adversarial explanation for her absence from the convention: legally, she can't be there. Federal law -- the Hatch Act of 1939, amended by Congress in 1993 -- specifically prohibits secretaries of state from attending political conventions, and the State Department's own ethics guidelines also rule out political activity. A senior administration official, speaking on background because the official is not authorized to speak on the record, told CNN, ""The law carved out the State Department as having a unique position in the government in that foreign policy, by its nature, must remain nonpartisan/apolitical."" See tonight's DNC Schedule . ""So State Department officials -- specifically those who are presidential appointees confirmed by the Senate (i.e. the secretary) -- are far more restricted than, say, someone who works at the Education Department."" When Condoleezza Rice was President George W. Bush's Secretary of State, she did not attend the Republican National Convention. Now that she's a private citizen, however, she did take part in last week's RNC, delivering a speech on foreign policy. Will Hillary Clinton try to tune in from East Timor to watch her husband's speech? Her staff isn't saying.

"Washington (CNN) -- Partisan tempers flared at a Senate immigration hearing on Monday as top Democrats accused opponents of comprehensive reform legislation of using last week's Boston Marathon bombings to slow or even derail the bill. ""Last week, opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston marathon bombing,"" said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. ""I urge restraint in that regard. ... Let no one be so cruel as to try to use the heinous attacks of these two young men last week to derail the dreams and futures of millions of hard-working people,"" Leahy added. He said the bill crafted by the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" would ""serve to strengthen our national security by allowing us to focus our border security and enforcement efforts against those who would do us harm."" ""A nation as strong as ours can welcome the oppressed and persecuted without making compromises in our security,"" he said. ""We are capable of vigilance in our pursuit of these values, and we have seen the tremendous work that the local law enforcement as well as the federal law enforcement have done in the Boston area, and I am so proud of them."" Boston bombings cast shadow on immigration debate . Leahy's statement, delivered at the start of the hearing, was met with a sharp response from the panel's top Republican. ""I want you to take note of the fact that when you proposed gun legislation, I didn't accuse you of using the (Newtown, Connecticut,) killings as an excuse,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. ""I don't hear any criticism ... when there (were) 14 people killed in West,Texas, and (some political activists took) advantage of that tragedy to warn about more government action to make sure that fertilizer factories are safe,"" Grassley said. ""I think we are taking advantage of an opportunity when, once in 25 years we deal with immigration, to make sure that every base is covered,"" he added. Grassley became visibly agitated later in the hearing when Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said ""those who are pointing to what happened -- the terrible tragedy in Boston -- (are looking for an) excuse for not doing a bill or delaying it many months or a year."" ""I never said that!"" Grassley yelled in response, interrupting Schumer. ""I didn't say you did, sir,"" Schumer replied. ""I didn't mean you, Mr. Grassley."" Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions then accused Schumer of ""demeaning"" anti-reform witnesses at the hearing, partly by characterizing them as representatives of narrow interests. Schumer, in turn, insisted that ""what I am saying is, if there are things that come up as a result of what happened in Boston that need improving, that require improvement, let's add them to the bill because certainly our bill tightens up things in a way that would make a Boston less likely."" Opinion: Boston bombing shouldn't derail immigration reform . ""That is all I am saying,"" Schumer concluded, ""because I have heard lots of calls from people out in the country saying delay it."" Separately, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, sent a letter Monday to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, urging a delay of any immigration legislation until more is learned about the alleged Boston bombers. ""We should not proceed until we understand the specific failures of our immigration system,"" Paul wrote. ""Why did the current system allow two individuals to immigrate to the United States from ... an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism, who then committed acts of terrorism?"" Asked about the letter, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney dismissed Paul's concern, arguing that ""comprehensive immigration reform, as anyone who has looked into it can attest, would enhance our security."" Among other things, the bill now under consideration would prevent undocumented residents from gaining legal status if they have been found guilty of felonies or more than two misdemeanors. Monday's hearing was the second by the Judiciary Committee on the nearly 900-page proposal put together by the eight senators. Over twenty witnesses were slated to testify, a schedule characterized by Sessions as part of a plan ""to rush through this massive legislation before the American people know what's in it."" Opinion: Don't blame immigration for Boston bombings . The first hearing, held last Friday, was also marked by several references to security fears raised by the recent bombings. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is scheduled to testify before the panel Tuesday. Assuming the immigration bill clears Leahy's committee, full Senate consideration of the legislation will probably occur in June, according to multiple sources. A bipartisan group of legislators in the House of Representatives is crafting its own immigration reform proposal.","Sen.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Just one day after a tense debate in Spanish parliament on how to stop political corruption, a leading newspaper published Thursday what it said were handwritten documents detailing 19 years of secretive payments to leaders of the ruling conservative Popular Party. El Pais newspaper said the alleged payments through 2009 -- off the party's normal books -- went to Mariano Rajoy, a longtime party leader and Spain's prime minister since December 2011, and to numerous other current or former top party officials. Spain in 2013: Is the worst over? The party quickly issued a statement Thursday morning, denying any ""hidden accounts"" and insisting that all payments to party leaders have been ""legal and in compliance with tax obligations."" Thursday evening, hundreds of protesters reacting to the report gathered near the ruling party's headquarters. They were kept back a distance from the building itself by riot police on two ends of a long street. The protesters called for the prime minister to resign and sarcastically chanted, ""Our taxes are your envelopes,"" a reference to the secretive cash payments reported to have occurred. The latest allegations -- making headlines across all Spanish media -- came as corruption scandals, affecting several political parties and even the royal household, have rocked the nation during its deep economic crisis, with a recession and an unemployment rate of 26%. Corruption was seen as a key problem by 17% of Spaniards in the government's main ""CIS"" survey last December, nearly double the rate of the previous month and the highest rate by far since the term ""corruption and fraud"" was included in the poll 11 years ago. Read more: Spanish duke subpoenaed in corruption case . El Pais reported that the money came into Popular Party coffers through secretive donations from construction firms and other businesses, and was used for various purposes, including tens of thousands of dollars in secretive payments to party officials. El Pais reported that the individuals and companies cited in the alleged documents have denied giving or receiving party funds in an off-the-books manner. Read more: How the indignados motivated Spain . A former Popular Party treasurer, Luis Barcenas, is under investigation for an alleged multimillion-dollar account in Switzerland. El Pais headlined its story Thursday: ""The secret papers of Barcenas."" Another newspaper, ABC, headlined its story: ""Luis Barcenas accuses the Popular Party leadership of having collected in B,"" the letter Spaniards typically mention when referring to secretive payments made in cash, with the aim of avoiding taxes. Dolores de Cospedal, the Popular Party's secretary general, was critical of the reports on Rajoy. ""The only aim of this alleged information is to hurt the Popular Party, its leaders, and certainly to hurt the prime minister,"" she said. But opposition socialists said there is a quick way to clear up any doubts. Said Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba of the Socialist Party: ""I ask that the prime minister himself makes an appearance to answer two simple questions: Did he collect these payments or not; and if so, off the books or aboveboard?"" A separate scandal is affecting Spain's royal household, where King Juan Carlos' son-in-law has been a suspect in a fraud case since last year.

Inaki Urdangarin, who was granted the title of Duke of Palma when he married the king's youngest daughter, Princess Cristina, in 1997, is under investigation for allegedly diverting public funds that were earmarked for his foundation for private use. A judge has ordered Urdangarin and a former business associate, Diego Torrres -- both of whom profess their innocence -- to deposit a joint bond of 8 million euros ($10.8 million) for potential civil damages. If not, the judge would move to embargo assets of the two men, a court spokeswoman said. And this week, the secretary of Princess Cristina and her sister, Princess Elena, was named as a suspect in the same case. The secretary, Carlos Garcia Revenga, denies any wrongdoing and has been called to testify at a preliminary hearing in late February. The Socialist Party in past years has been hit by corruption scandals involving large sums of money and top officials. Last week, the party forced out the director of a party foundation after allegations that he and his wife received payments for articles written under a pseudonym. The Socialists called on other parties to also come clean when hit by scandals. The Catalan nationalist Convergence and Union coalition, or CiU, the ruling party in the northeastern region of Catalonia, also has seen recent allegations of corruption against current or former leaders, and some of their family members. All of these allegations have also been denied.","Latest scandal involves allegations of payments to Popular Party leaders .

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron will make the call at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland for international action to curb the activities of tax havens, which campaigners say cost governments trillions in lost revenues. Journalist Simon Hooper points out what he calls the hypocrisy of the UK's position, itself sitting at the center of the world's most powerful offshore empire. Walking up London's Strand in the direction of St. Paul's Cathedral does not feel like crossing one of the major financial fault lines in the global economy. Few tourists would perhaps even notice the stone dragon stranded between buses in the middle of the road that marks the boundary of the City of London, the British capital's financial district and one of global capitalism's most dynamic engines. Yet to step into the City is to enter what has been described by Nicholas Shaxson, author of ""Treasure Islands: Tax Havens and the Men Who Stole the World,"" as ""an offshore island inside Britain."" Britain's role at the center of an empire of tax havens is under scrutiny this week, ironically, because British Prime Minister David Cameron has made tax evasion the central theme of this week's G8 meeting in Northern Ireland. ""Tax evasion and avoidance are issues whose time has come. After years of abuse people across the planet are rightly calling for action,"" says a British government briefing released ahead of the summit. Cameron's initiative has thrust the spotlight on the UK's overseas territories and crown dependencies, an odd collection of colonial offcuts including the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda and Jersey. All are considered offshore hubs, and all benefit from close ties to the UK finance industry, pouring money into the City. On Saturday, Cameron announced that 10 territories and dependencies had agreed to sign up to an existing convention on corporate transparency promoted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), saying: ""It is important we are getting our house in order."" But campaigners, such as the Tax Justice Network's John Christensen, remain skeptical whether Cameron can accomplish anything that will meaningfully challenge the power of the tax havens. He says measures such as greater transparency in company ownership, though welcome and necessary, do not go far enough in opening up other offshore structures, including trusts, to scrutiny. Britain is far from alone among G8 countries in the promotion and provision of offshore-style facilities. The U.S. provides parallel structures offering low taxes and corporate secrecy with the New York Times reporting last year on how legitimate businesses and criminal enterprises were flocking to Delaware ""in hopes of minimizing taxes, skirting regulations, plying friendly courts or, when needed, covering their tracks."" Japan and several European Union countries also featured on the last Financial Secrecy Index, published in 2011 and topped by Switzerland. Of the UK though, the index said: ""If the entire British network of secrecy jurisdictions were considered, it would easily be ranked number one."" Legal tax avoidance, which involves shifting profits to jurisdictions that do not levy corporate tax via offshore subsidiaries, and tax evasion, its criminal cousin, have long been among the perks of wealth. As Leona Helmsley, the New York hotelier and so-called ""Queen of Mean,"" is quoted as saying : ""We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes."" Helmsley, who was convicted of tax evasion, denied having said this, but the words followed her for the rest of her life. Yet the consequences of this industry are borne by those who can least afford it. Aid charity ActionAid estimated last month that almost half of all investment into developing countries was funneled through tax havens; this means the profits from that investment remain offshore, depriving the world's poorest countries of much-needed revenues. It cited one transaction alone conducted through UK-linked havens that would have netted the Indian government $2.2 billion in tax; enough to provide a lunchtime meal to every Indian primary schoolchild for a year. A report last month by Kofi Annan's Africa Progress Panel highlighted mining deals in the DR Congo which had cost the country an estimated $1.36 billion in revenues, enough to double the country's health and education budgets. Yet attempting to estimate exactly how much money is concealed offshore is largely futile, with most experts willing to venture only that the figure runs into many trillions. An investigation last year conducted for the Tax Justice Network estimated that $21 to $32 trillion was hidden offshore by super-rich individuals alone. Campaigners such as TJN's John Christensen are skeptical whether the G8 can accomplish anything that will meaningfully challenge the power of the tax havens. He says proposed measures, though welcome and necessary such as greater transparency in company ownership, do not go far enough in opening up other offshore structures, including trusts, to scrutiny. History also suggests the City of London and its allies will defend their own interests. The City's origins are lost in the distant past, with the corporation's own website describing the area as ""a prime location for trade since before Roman times."" Its tradition of self-governance predates the consolidation of the modern British state, and the City's powerbrokers have fiercely defended their ancient privileges ever since, using their role as lenders to crown and government as leverage. Should Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's head of state, feel the urge to cross the City's boundaries to visit the Starbucks on Fleet Street for a low-tax latte, ceremony dictates that she should still seek the permission of the City's Lord Mayor to do so. (Starbucks in December 2012 offered to pay additional taxes in the UK in response to public pressure there to collect more taxes from multinational companies.) And since 1571, an official known as the Remembrancer has maintained a seat in the House of Commons to protect and promote the City's interests in parliament, even as a turbo-charged 21st century financial infrastructure has been bolted onto this medieval statelet. But the use of the offshore sector has long been virtually endemic among a wealthy elite in the UK, even beyond the City's boundaries. British governments once attempted to curb the power and independence of the financial sector, hamstrung only by their borrowing dependency on the same source. Yet since the 1980s, the era of Margaret Thatcher's so-called ""Big Bang"" of markets deregulation, governments have enjoyed a cosier relationship with corporate finance, summed up by Peter Mandelson, a close ally of Tony Blair, who once said the once-socialist Labour Party was ""intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich."" The rest of that quote -- ""... as long as they pay their taxes"" -- is less well remembered. In 2011, Cameron's coalition passed legislation exempting UK-based corporations from income tax on overseas earnings; a move described by commentator George Monbiot as a ""corporate coup d'etat."" Research published by ActionAid showed that 98 out of 100 companies on the FTSE 100 index used offshore subsidiaries, with more registered in Jersey and the Cayman Islands than in India and China. And it has long been a rite of passage for newly-minted Britons, from Formula One drivers to musicians to self-made millionaires, to shift their riches to Switzerland, Monaco or Jersey with the public raising little more than an eyebrow in reproach. Research by the Guardian newspaper last year revealed how Cameron's own father had built a considerable family fortune by running a legal network of offshore investment funds. Cameron and other members of his family declined to comment on the report. Yet that situation may be changing, with campaign groups such as UK Uncut stirring up populist anger against corporate tax avoidance and politicians now scrambling to get on the bandwagon, while celebrity tax-dodging schemes have joined sex and drugs scandals as tabloid staples. Recent exposure of the legal tax avoidance strategies of Google and Amazon saw executives from both companies summoned for scrutiny by the UK's parliamentary public accounts committee where lawmaker Margaret Hodge told Google Vice President Matt Brittin: ""You are a company that says you do no evil. And I think that you do do evil."" In the U.S., meanwhile, Apple CEO Tim Cook was summoned to appear on Capitol Hill after a Senate investigation found the company paid taxes in the U.S. of 2% on worldwide income of $74 billion. Accusing the head of one of the world's biggest companies of ""exploiting an absurdity,"" committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin made the connection between tax avoidance and efforts to cut the US deficit, and delivered a message that ought to resonate with taxpayers anywhere in the world. ""Because of those cuts, children across the country won't get early education. Needy seniors will go without meals. Fighter jets sit idle on tarmacs because our military lacks the funding to keep pilots trained,"" said Levin. ""The question each of us should ask today is this: Shouldn't we close unjustified tax loopholes, and dedicate the revenue to educating our children, protecting our nation and building its future?"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Simon Hooper.","At the G8 summit, David Cameron will call for action to curb activities of tax havens .

"(CNN) -- Protests planned around Egypt -- particularly in Cairo's Tahrir Square -- on the second anniversary of the January 25 revolution are expected to be an explosion of dissent, revealing the deep divisions in the country between President Mohamed Morsy and the Egyptian people. Opposition to Morsy's authoritarianism is broader than the world recognizes. In making accommodations for Morsy's government, the United States is -- once again -- out of step with the Egyptian people. Egyptians may not know exactly what they want, but they know what they don't want. Although an effective political opposition has yet to coalesce, Egyptians from all sectors of society are united in their refusal to accept another repressive regime. Egypt is on a collision course. An ever growing, if periodically discouraged, portion of the population opposes the government and Morsy's Muslim Brotherhood, and supports the revolution's goals of social and economic justice, accountable government, and basic freedoms, including freedom of expression and protection of minorities. Yet the government is moving in exactly the opposite direction, with its authoritarian control over political, social, and religious life. The government's investigation of the wildly popular ""Egyptian Jon Stewart"" Bassem Youssef -- charged with insulting Morsy and undermining his command -- and the forced ""retirement"" of respected journalist Hani Shukrallah, editor of state-owned Al-Ahram's English-language website, are just two very public examples of the vice tightening on freedom of expression. In fact, the Arab Network for Human Rights says about 24 lawsuits for insulting Morsy have been filed against journalists and activists since his election in June. The regime is trying to put the revolution genie back in the bottle. But it is clamping down on a population that has discovered its voice. In opposition to this repression, Egyptians at all levels are increasingly engaged in politics. A Cairo cab driver -- ever the measure of popular sentiment -- recently debated the failings of the Constitution with a passenger. After reaching the destination, the driver leapt out, grabbed a dogeared copy of the Constitution he kept in the front seat, and pointed to a passage to prove his point to his passenger. The December demonstrations against President Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood-backed Constitution, which attracted an even broader segment of the population than those who stood in Tahrir Square in 2011, revealed the broadening chasm between the regime and the people in Egypt. Assembled outside the Presidential Palace were old and young, veiled and unveiled, rich and poor. Whether they arrived in chauffeur-driven cars or whether they marched from Cairo's outlying shantytowns, the hundreds of thousands joined together in their refusal to accept a state that squashed the dreams of the revolution and dictated political, social, and religious behavior. Many call the second wave of the revolution in the fall of 2012 the ""Mothers' Revolution."" Parents and grandparents went into the streets to protest the divided loyalties in their families between the Islamists (Brotherhood or Salafis) and those supporting a democratic, secular Egypt. In Egypt, secular means freedom from state control of religion, not nonreligious. The clash between these two visions of Egypt -- secular with freedom and social justice, or a religious state run by the Brotherhood with its version of Sharia law -- played out inside families and on the streets. Soldiers protecting the Presidential Palace during the December demonstrations were moved to tears when an Egyptian woman, referring to Morsy, shouted at them, ""Why are you protecting this man who is pitting Egyptians against each other?"" Mohamed El Gindy, a successful businessman who opposes Morsy and spent much of December camping in Tahrir with the young revolutionaries, has experienced this division within families firsthand. A relative who had joined the Salafis informed him that the extreme Islamist group had put El Gindy at No. 5 on its ""hit list,"" which is widely believed by Egyptians to exist. The relative was unapologetic until El Gindy told him that he might as well put El Gindy's mother on the list, too, since the octogenarian also had joined the street protests. Egypt and its families may be divided, but on one subject, all are united -- in the belief that the United States is supporting the Muslim Brotherhood-dominated government. Visible in the throngs at the December demonstrations were signs opposing Qatar and the United States -- yes, the U.S. and Qatar were lumped together as supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood regime. ""This is such a historic opportunity to restore the image of the U.S., but instead it is putting itself in the same position as Qatar. ... And this from President Obama -- so disappointing,"" Riham Bahi, a professor at American University in Cairo, said, reflecting views heard repeatedly last December in Egypt. Opposition leader and blogger Bassem Sabry was even more blunt: ""With the Constitution in play, you are subsidizing an Islamist state."" Sabry said he was always pro-U.S. ""until the revolution."" In addition, the Pentagon plans to proceed with the delivery of 20 F-16 jets to Egypt, a step that looks to Egyptians like a vote of confidence in Morsy. Unchanged since the revolution, U.S. aid policy toward Egypt still makes the military alliance its priority. Two years after the Egyptian Revolution, the U.S. government finds itself again backing an authoritarian regime against the popular will. As January 25 approaches, with massive protests planned against Morsy's government, this is a precarious position for both the U.S. and Egypt. In his second term, Obama should adopt a more agile and informed policy toward Egypt, one that matches the words often heard from the White House -- ""The United States always has stood with the Egyptian people"" -- with action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Schneider.","National protests against Morsy set for second anniversary of Egypt's revolution .

She says proponents of secular democracy think the U.S. backs Muslim Brotherhood .

"New York (CNN) -- In a recent interview, Mir Hossein Mousavi, the opposition candidate spearheading the Green Movement in Iran, said that early in the momentous revolution of 1979 the majority of Iranians were convinced that dictatorship had ended in Iran. ""I was one of those people,"" Mousavi said. ""But today I no longer believe that to be the case."" Today, he said, we can see both the signs of dictatorship and the resistance to that dictatorship. He then claimed this resistance as a legacy of the Islamic Revolution. ""It must be said that people's resistance is a heritage of the Islamic Revolution. People's discontent with deceit, deception, and corruption, which we witness today, are among the clear signs of this heritage,"" Mousavi said. But the history and the political culture of revolt against tyranny actually predate the Islamic revolution of 1977-1979. The young Iranians pouring into the streets of their homeland in recent months to demand their civil liberties are nourished and inspired by the same fountain of liberty that moved their parents in the years leading up to the 1979 revolution. It is the same hunger for freedom that the Islamic Republic, for eight crucial years under the steady hand of Mousavi himself as prime minister in the 1980s, had brutally repressed. What we are witnessing in the streets of Iran and among Iranians around the globe is the resurgence of a vibrant political culture that gave rise to the 1979 revolution, and that has been violently eclipsed under the absolutism of a militant Islamic theocracy. The history of the Islamic Republic over the last three decades has been a sad scenario of suppression and brutality. The regime has mismanaged one crisis after another, benefiting at times from the follies of neighbors and superpowers. Before the creation of the Islamic Republic, the revolution was driven by Iranians rebelling against the tyrannical monarchy of the Shah. But for the new regime in Iran, the American hostage crisis of 1979-1980 was the first opportunity to create a smoke screen to divert the world's attention while taking Iran's entire political culture hostage to their single-mindedly Islamist approach. The American hostage crisis had not ended yet when the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) started -- yet another prolonged and brutal distraction that Ayatollah Khomeini used to eliminate all his internal opposition. He did not start the war with Iraq. Saddam Hussein did, with the full support of the Reagan administration and its European and Arab allies. But Khomeini prolonged it for his own reasons. Two years into the Iran-Iraq War, the Israelis invaded Lebanon in 1982, and thereby offered the Islamic Republic the best opportunity to help create the Lebanese Hezbollah and extend its regional power base. The Iran-Iraq War was still raging when the First Intifada (1987-1993) provided the Islamic Republic with yet another opportunity to expand its influence in occupied Palestine. The Iran-Iraq war had barely ended when in 1989 Ayatollah Khomeini issued his infamous fatwa against Salman Rushdie. This provided another diversion to distract the world's attention from his having ordered a crucial revision of the constitution of the Islamic Republic that would perpetuate the absolutist reign of a Supreme Leader. Just about the same time, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, the Taliban took over Afghanistan, and the two monsters the United States and its European, regional, and Arab allies had created to control the spread of the Iranian revolution came back to haunt them all and turn against their own creators. The tragic events of September 11, 2001, plunged the United States into a deep quagmire of mismanaging one crisis after another in Afghanistan and Iraq, as the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 2006 and Gaza in 2008-2009 added fuel to the fire among Arabs and Muslims. With every turn of the screw and as the United States was bogged down in the region, the Islamic Republic did what it does best: It took advantage of one crisis after another in the region to stay afloat and disguise its fundamentally weak claim to legitimacy among its own citizens. Today the Green Movement is threatened by a number of factors and forces. A brutal suppression by the security apparatus of the Islamic Republic is only the most immediate and evident threat. Equally dangerous is to think the Green Movement is an American-inspired, or ""pro-Western"" uprising that will turn Iran into a satellite state of the United States and make it safe for neoliberal economics. It is not -- and to drive that point home, it is still good to read Mir Hossein Mousavi invoking the memory of a vast social revolution that had a fundamental commitment to social and economic justice at its heart. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.","Iran has suffered through decades of political repression, says Hamid Dabashi .
He says Iran's regime has benefited from turmoil in the Mideast .
Iran's Green Movement is a new generation following in footsteps of its parents' bid for liberty ."
"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal has admitted to feeling ""scared"" when a masked protester ran onto court brandishing a flare during Sunday's French Open final, briefly disrupting the Spaniard's bid for a record-breaking victory. Nadal, who became the first male tennis player to win one grand slam eight times, praised the contribution of security staff who quickly removed the individual late in the second set of his 6-3 6-2 6-3 success against compatriot David Ferrer. CNN affiliate BFM reported the men were part of a group called Printemps Francais, or French Spring, which is opposed to the French government's decision to make same-sex marriage legal last month. A second shirtless man was hustled away before he could make it onto the court. ""I was a little bit scared in the beginning because I didn't see, everything is very quick out there,"" the 27-year-old told CNN. ""I saw somebody coming with some fire so I was a little bit scared. These things are impossible to predict. ""I can just say thank you very much to all of the security guys, they did amazing work and I really felt safe immediately."" The incident evoked memories of when Monica Seles was stabbed in the back during the 1993 Hamburg Masters. In 2009, a spectator also ran onto the court at Roland Garros and attempted to put a red hat on Roger Federer's head during the final. Sunday's win extended Nadal's run at the clay-court grand slam to 59 wins and just one defeat, which came against Sweden's Robin Soderling in the fourth round four years ago. After clinching the title in 2012, Nadal was out of action for seven months due to a right knee injury. ""A lot of people helped me a lot and supported me a lot,"" the world 12-time grand slam winner said. ""I received hundreds of messages which gave me a lot of positive energy. Thank you very much to everybody who supported me, because of them I have this trophy."" Meanwhile, Dutch player Yannick Ebbinghaus has been banned for six months and fined $10,000 after illegally betting on matches 67 times between May 2012 and February 2013. The Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) prohibits players from directly or indirectly placing wagers on matches. Three months of the ban is suspended pending ""anti-corruption education training"" and $5,000 of Ebbinghaus' fine could be returned if the 23-year-old -- ranked 1,158th in the world -- cooperates with the TIU. Russia's world No. 806 Sergei Krotiouk, 34, last week received a lifelong ban for match-fixing.","Rafael Nadal praises security staff after protester invades tennis court .

"Washington (CNN) -- The grounds outside the U.S. Supreme Court have long been a place for protests, rallies, and other ""expressive events."" But exactly just what could be said and where the public could assert its First Amendment rights was a source of contention -- at least until Thursday. That's when court officials issued new rules. The regulations clarify a 60-year-old law blocking any demonstrations on court property, including the marble plaza that serves as the dramatic gateway to the building itself. ""The term demonstration includes demonstrations, picketing, speechmaking, marching, holding vigils or religious services and all other like forms of conduct that involve the communication or expression of views or grievances, engaged in by one or more persons, the conduct of which is reasonably likely to draw a crowd or onlookers,"" says the revised Regulation 7, which was effective Thursday. ""The term does not include casual use by visitors or tourists that is not reasonably likely to attract a crowd or onlookers."" The changes follow a federal judge's ruling on Wednesday tossing out as unconstitutional the previous anti-demonstration rules. Judge Beryl Howell said those laws were overly broad and vague, and could implicate any ""group activity"" on the grounds, including students wearing t-shirts with the name of their school, or tourists gathering on the plaza for a group photo. Federal law gives individual buildings and agencies, including courts, discretion to set their own security and access procedures. Harold Hodge, Jr., had challenged the regulations in court. The Maryland college student was arrested in February 2011 for silently carrying an anti-racism sign on the plaza, although court records show he did so peacefully. A court police officer approached Hodge and three times asked him to leave the plaza, but he refused. He was then handcuffed and taken into custody. The charges were dropped after Hodge agreed not to return to the court for six months. He later sued, claiming his free speech rights were being violated and that he had a right to protest on government property. A Virginia-based civil rights group, the Rutherford Institute, defended Hodge in his case. The group's president, John Whitehead, called the high court's new rules set by its Marshal's office ""repugnant"" to the guarantees enshrined in the Constitution. Protests, rallies, speeches, and marches in front of the court often number in the hundreds of people, and are traditionally held on the public sidewalk on First Street, NE, between the court and the Capitol. Demonstrators gathered for days during the 2000 Bush v. Gore case over the disputed outcome of the presidential election. And those on both sides of the abortion debate rally yearly in front of the court on the January anniversary of Roe v. Wade decision. The Supreme Court had no comment on the rule changes.","Court revises 60-year-old regulation after man silently holding sign challenged rules .

"(CNN) -- A fast-moving brush fire near Daytona Beach at one point forced the evacuation of 300 homes and spread to 1,000 acres Saturday, Greg Dunn of the Florida Forest Service said. By late Saturday, the blaze was 75% contained and occupants of most of the homes were allowed to return. Interstate 95 in Volusia County reopened after it was closed in both directions because of the fire and poor visibility, authorities said. Thick smoke rose from the fast-moving fire, which was being fueled by high winds and low humidity, Dunn said, adding he expects the same conditions Sunday. Firefighters from Volusia and Flagler counties, the state forest service and all city fire departments were working to fight the fire, the Volusia County government website said.

"(CNN) -- Friends and fellow sailors mourned double Olympic medalist Andrew ""Bart"" Simpson after the shocking news that he had died in San Francisco Bay while training for the America's Cup. The British sailor's death followed the capsizing Thursday of a 72-foot Artemis Racing boat during a training run. After Simpson, 36, was pulled from the water, attempts were made to revive him on a boat aiding the rescue operation and on land, but they were unsuccessful. The other 10 crew members were all accounted for, Sweden's Artemis Racing said. ""The entire Artemis Racing team is devastated by what happened,"" Artemis Racing chief executive Paul Cayard told reporters in Alameda, the city in eastern San Francisco Bay where the team is based. ""Our prayers are with Andrew Simpson's family, his wife and kids, and also the rest of my teammates. It's a shocking experience to go through, and we have a lot to deal with in the next few days in terms of assuring everybody's well being."" Cayard said the AC72 catamaran was ""under control"" but the team's first concern was for its people. Simpson won a gold medal in sailing's Star class at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and silver at last year's Olympics, when Britain was the host nation. Shirley Robertson of CNN's ""Mainsail"" show, and a good friend of Simpson, said the catamaran he was sailing Friday was ""a boat that is about as extreme as it gets"" and would have been the ""most radical"" he had sailed. ""The huge AC72 multihulls have been introduced to take the oldest trophy in sport to a new era. The America's Cup is no longer a tactical game of chess on water in relatively slow yachts; it is now a full-on physical battle with an immense machine, and the forces of nature,"" she said. ""The crews who sail them talk openly about the danger, and hard hats, body armor and personal air bottles are all part of their sailing gear."" Support boats stay close, she said, but risk cannot be eliminated from the equation with such spectacular, fast-moving boats. ""Bart was a lovely 'gentle giant' of a man who I have so many fond memories of inside the British Olympic Sailing team,"" added Robertson, herself a double Olympic gold medalist. Swedish Artemis team member Magnus Augustson told Sweden's daily newspaper Aftonbladet he was shaken by the accident and greatly saddened by the loss of a friend. ""I was the one who found him. It is the worst thing that has ever happened,"" he told the paper. ""We had been sailing for a couple of hours and everything had been going great, but then suddenly the boat tipped over. I don't really know what happened, I haven't seen any pictures since I am still very shaken by it."" The boat was built using special materials to be as lightweight and good as possible, he said. ""The whole thing was very scary. I fell off the boat, but jumped on board again. We knew how many people had been on board but we hadn't found everyone. So we started searching, lifting and looking around. But it is a very large boat and everything is so heavy, and there was a lot of wind."" Augustson told Aftonbladet it had taken ""a long while"" to find Simpson. ""We have a medic with us and he did everything he could to try and resuscitate him. But there was nothing we could do,"" he said. ""Now this makes you wonder. ... It feels a bit ridiculous to be doing sports right now. It feels unnecessary. He had a kid and a wife. And he was a good friend."" Members of Britain's Royal Yachting Association also said they were devastated by the news. ""Andrew is someone I've worked closely with since the age of 16 -- he was a great talent,"" performance director John Derbyshire said in a statement. ""He was a huge inspiration to others, both within the British Sailing Team and across the nation, and our deepest sympathies go out to his family at this terrible time."" Stephen Park, the Royal Yachting Association's Olympic manager, said Simpson was ""a fantastic sailor who got the best out of everyone he sailed with. He was much loved and will be sorely missed by everyone in our close knit team."" The America's Cup is the oldest and most prestigious trophy in sailing, dating back more than 150 years. Teams from only four nations have won it: the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland. The New York Yacht Club held the cup for well over a century. The Louis Vuitton Cup, the America's Cup Challenger Series, starts on July 7 and the America's Cup Finals begin on September 7. Artemis Racing represents the Royal Swedish Yacht Club, KSSS, Sweden's largest and oldest sailing club.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge dismissed a case of cyberstalking on Twitter ruling that even though some tweets caused emotional stress, they are still considered free speech. The case involved Alyce Zeoli, a Buddhist leader based in Maryland. Zeoli aroused the ire of William Lawrence Cassidy, a man who, according to the memorandum opinion issued in the case, befriended Zeoli in 2007 before the two had a falling out. Using various pseudonyms on Twitter and on blogs, Cassidy published more than 8,000 tweets and posts about Zeoli often wishing death upon her. (One tweet, for example, read, ""Do the world a favor and go kill yourself. P.S. Have a nice day."") Zeoli cooperated with the FBI, which had Cassidy indicted and put in jail in February on interstate stalking charges, a statute of the Violence Against Women Act. Cassidy sought to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that it violated the First Amendment. The judge in the case, Roger W. Titus, agreed with Cassidy's assertion, concluding that the First Amendment ""protects speech even when the subject or the manner of expression is uncomfortable and challenges conventional religious beliefs, political attitudes or standards of good taste."" Titus also cited the fact that Zeoli is a public figure (she was the subject of a book published in 2000) and ruled that Cassidy's remarks didn't constitute a ""true threat."" Factoring into Titus's thinking was his assessment of Twitter and blogs, which he likened to billboards. Billboards, he reasoned, do not send messages and ""does not communicate, except to those who voluntarily choose to read what is posted on it."" In reaction to the ruling, Zeoli was ""appalled and frightened,"" according to her lawyer, Shanlon Wu, who spoke to The New York Times. Chun Wright, one of Zeoli's attorneys, says it hasn't been determined yet whether an appeal to Titus's ruling will be sought. Cassidy's public defenders, meanwhile, are working on getting him released from jail, according to the report. What do you think?

"(CNN) -- Consider it a preview of a coming attraction: Reese Witherspoon stars in ""Hangover Atlanta."" The trailer, if you will, is a video of the Oscar-winning actress being delivered to the Atlanta jail by a Georgia state trooper. Atlanta police released the short security camera video Tuesday showing a trooper letting Witherspoon, 37, out of his patrol car and taking handcuffs off her before walking her into the jail early Friday. Witherspoon's disorderly conduct arrest on an Atlanta street was recorded by the trooper's dashboard camera, but you won't see that until prosecution of her case and her husband's drunken driving charge are completed, the Georgia State Patrol said. Quoted: Reese Witherspoon, is that really you? 'Hangover Atlanta' Act 1 . Based on the screenplay -- officially known as the arrest report -- the Oscar-winning actress had several memorable lines: . Witherspoon: ""Do you know my name?"" Trooper First Class James Pyland: ""No, I don't need to know your name -- right now."" Witherspoon: ""You're about to find out who I am."" Trooper Pyland: ""I am not worried about you ma'am. I already told you how things work."" In another exchange, Witherspoon questioned if Pyland was a real officer, the report authored by Pyland says. Her theatrics earned Witherspoon a pair of handcuffs and a ride to jail. ""You are going to be on national news,"" Witherspoon allegedly told the trooper. ""I advised Mrs. Witherspoon that was fine,"" Pyland said in his narration. 'Hangover Atlanta' Act 2 . Witherspoon's second act script included a sober apology, issued through a publicist Monday, three days after the arrest and a day after it became public. ""But I do want to say, I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said,"" the actress said in her statement. ""It was definitely a scary situation and I was frightened for my husband, but that is no excuse. I was disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job. I have nothing but respect for the police and I'm very sorry for my behavior."" Her husband, Hollywood agent James Toth, was driving a Ford Fusion along Atlanta's Peachtree Road early Friday when Trooper Pyland pulled him over for weaving across lanes, the arrest report said. Toth, 42, was placed under arrest after he blew a 0.139% in a breathalyzer test, well above the legal limit of 0.08% for a driving under the influence charge, the report said. 'Hangover Atlanta' Act 3 . Witherspoon's lawyer has already arranged for her to go through a pretrial intervention program to avoid getting a conviction on her record, an Atlanta Municipal Court spokesman said. The program provides ""alternative methods of resolving criminal matters other than prosecution,"" the court's website says. The judge set May 22 as the date for a hearing to check if she is complying with the program. After that, the DVD with the arrest video could be released. Witherspoon, whose earlier films include ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" won a shelf full of awards for her performance as June Carter Cash in ""Walk the Line,"" including a best actress Academy Award. She was in Atlanta working on a movie titled ""The Good Lie"" when she was arrested.","Atlanta police release video of Witherspoon walking into jail early Friday .

"(CNN) -- About one out of every four Facebook users lies on their profile, and not just to impress that guy or gal who wouldn't date them in high school. Sometimes, it's about privacy. That was one of the findings of a Consumer Reports investigation released this week. Titled ""Facebook & Your Privacy,"" the report focuses on the ways people use the social-networking site to share information, and what happens to that information after they do. In a survey of 2,000 households, 25% of users said they falsified information in their profiles to protect their identity, Consumer Reports said. That's up from 10% in a similar survey two years ago. The consumer-advocacy site attributed that rise to growing concerns about privacy. Some advocates, the report noted, want a national privacy law that holds all companies to the same privacy standards and lets consumers tell companies not to track them online. There are some limits to a person's ability to prevaricate on the site. Facebook has a real-name policy. It requires a real e-mail address (yes, you can create a dummy account that you only use to sign up for websites, but it's still yours). And you can't join certain networks -- those for college students, for example -- without the right kind of address. ""One can almost be a totally different human on Facebook than in real life,"" wrote Rebecca Greenfield for The Atlantic. ""But, one can never escape their true selves, with the few details Facebook does not allow its users to fudge."" Some users have been known to create profiles under false or incomplete names to hide from employers or job recruiters. Others list fake birthdays on the site to foil potential identity thieves. There have been several high-profile cases of fake Facebook identities. The 2010 documentary film ""Catfish"" chronicled the story of a lonely Michigan woman who created a false Facebook identity to flirt online with a New York man. Privacy, of course, isn't the only reason to skirt around the edges of the truth online. In January, ReadWriteWeb looked at some of the top reasons for faking a Facebook profile. Among them: . â€¢ People hide things about their identities that may be personally troubling or even dangerous if others knew. â€¢ In cases when a person is known professionally by a different name than his or her real one. â€¢ Just for laughs . Most folks, though, might not be fudging the facts. A 2010 study of college students in the United States and Germany revealed that they typically presented accurate versions of their personalities on Facebook and a similar German site. ""Online social networks are so popular and so likely to reveal people's actual personalities because they allow for social interactions that feel real in many ways,"" said psychologist Mitja Back of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, who published the report with colleagues in Psychological Science.","Study: About 25% of Facebook users falsified information in profiles to protect their identity .

"(CNN) -- Throughout his campaign, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has cast himself as an ardent backer of Israel -- and, either directly or indirectly, suggested that President Barack Obama hasn't been similarly supportive. The former Massachusetts governor lashed out again Monday in a speech at the Virginia Military Institute, criticizing Obama on several points. Among them was Israel, with Romney stating the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""has suffered great strains"" in recent years. ""The president explicitly stated that his goal was to put 'daylight' between the United States and Israel. And he has succeeded,"" said Romney. ""This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran."" Fact Check: Was Obama 'silent' on Iran 2009 protests? Vowing to ""reaffirm our historic ties to Israel"" and its security, Romney added, ""The world must never see any daylight between our two nations."" So is Romney's characterization of Obama's remarks, and U.S. relations with Israel, fair and accurate? The facts: . Obama's ""explicit"" statement Romney is referencing dates back to July 2009, at a closed meeting between Obama and select Jewish leaders. According to the Washington Post's account, concerns were building over the president's reasoning on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Obama sought to assure the leaders that he and his administration understood the ""nuances of the current issues."" Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, told Obama, ""If you want Israel to take risks, then its leaders must know that the United States is right next to them."" ""Look at the past eight years,"" Obama said, according to the Post. ""During those eight years, there was no space between us and Israel, and what did we get from that? When there is no daylight, Israel just sits on the sidelines, and that erodes our credibility with the Arab states."" Complete coverage of CNN Fact Checks . Following the confusion that ensued over these comments, and their resurgence in the election season, administration officials have again and again defended the president and insisted there was indeed no ""daylight"" between the two countries. Defense secretary Leon Panetta, speaking to reporters traveling with him in the Middle East in July, said that new U.N. sanctions against Iran would be ""ratcheting up to a whole new level of impact. It sends a strong message to (the Iranian leadership) that they can't continue to do what they are doing."" He emphasized that there is no disagreement between the United States and Israel about Iran. ""My view is that when I sit down with my counterpart in Israel, we are unified in our view with regards to Iran,"" Panetta said. In response to reported disagreements between Obama and Netanyahu on how specifically to handle curbing Iran's nuclear program, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told CNN's State of the Union, ""We share a grave concern about Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon.... We are determined to prevent that from happening. ""President Obama has been absolutely clear, and on this there's absolutely no daylight between the United States and Israel that we will do what it takes to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon."" Rice went on to say that the steps the United States and other countries are taking to pressure Iran are working. Speaking more generally in late July about cooperation between the two nations, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak described U.S. support for Israel's security as unparalleled. ""I should tell you honestly that this administration under President Obama is doing in regard to our security more than anything that I can remember in the past,"" Barak told CNN. Despite such assertions, some have continued to insist that U.S.-Israeli relations have deteriorated since Obama took office. They include Elliott Abrams, who told a U.S. House committee in September that he believed the political relationship and cooperation between the two nations are the worst in two decades. Notably, Abrams had top State Department and national security-related positions under Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush and his writings are featured prominently on Romney's campaign website. Conclusion: . The Obama administration has stressed repeatedly that it is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with Israel. In May 2011, Obama said, ""The bonds between the United States and Israel are unbreakable, and the commitment of the United States to the security of Israel is ironclad."" The exact context of Obama's remarks in his closed July 2009 meeting with Jewish leaders is not clear. And it hasn't been proven Obama ""explicitly stated"" then that it was ""his goal"" to put ""daylight"" between the two countries. His remarks, as reported, suggest rather that ""our credibility with the Arab states"" suffers when U.S. and Israeli policies are mirror images of each other. Fact Check: Romney's comparison of past, present Navy pointless . In fact, Obama has on occasion offered views different from those of Netanyahu, including calling on Israel to halt West Bank settlement activity early in 2009. During the 2012 campaign, Romney has sought to assure voters that he will be tougher against Iran's nuclear ambitions than Obama, although the two candidates' positions on Iran are nearly identical, according to a top Romney adviser. The Obama administration has hardly been soft against Iran. In addition to voting for U.N. Security Council sanctions against the country, in July 2010, Obama signed legislation that aimed to make it harder for the Iranian government to purchase refined petroleum and necessary materials to modernize Iran's oil and natural gas sector. The legislation also mandated that the U.S. government will no longer grant procurement contracts to businesses doing prohibited business with Iran. And the president signed an executive order pushing further sanctions against Iran in November 2011. There have been numerous reports of tensions and disagreements, and there have been times where Obama has expressed a view (as on settlement activity) not shared by his Israeli counterpart. But any blanket assessment should also take into account assertions from the likes of Barak, lauding cooperation between the two nations over the last four years. Opinion: Obama has bungled foreign policy . Fact check: Obama 'has not signed one new free-trade agreement' Colorado is 'ground zero' of election .","A report says Obama told Jewish leaders the risks of ""no daylight"" between U.S., Israel .
Romney cites that remark, and claims ""great strains"" between Obama and Netanyahu .
Context of Obama's comments is unclear, and he never said ""daylight"" was his goal ."
"(CNN) -- Click and Clack won't be making noise on ""Car Talk"" for much longer. On Friday, hosts Tom and Ray Magliozzi, known as ""Click and Clack, the Tappet brothers,"" announced that they would be retiring from the popular NPR program in October. ""We've decided that it's time to stop and smell the cappuccino,"" Ray wrote on the show's website. ""As of October, we're not going to be recording any more new shows.Â That's right, we're retiring,"" Tom added, noting that ""Car Talk"" is celebrating its 25th anniversary on NPR this year. However, fans will still be able to enjoy the show after the brothers' retirement. New ""Car Talks"" will be assembled from archival material, the brothers wrote. They'll also continue their regular website column. ""Car Talk"" debuted in 1977 on Boston radio station WBUR and was picked up by NPR 10 years later. It regularly ranks as one of public radio's most popular shows -- including the most popular weekend program -- with about 4 million listeners. The show consists of the two brothers, who own a Cambridge, Massachusetts (""our fair city,"" as they've long called their home), garage, taking calls from listeners about their automobile -- and sometimes relationship -- problems. The two regularly insult one another, make each other laugh and force listeners to re-create the sounds of their car ailments on the air.

"(CNN) -- It was during the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City that Kipchoge Keino announced his arrival on the world stage. The Kenyan athlete was one of the stars of the games as he cruised to victory in the final of the 1,500 Meters, crushing the favorite and then world record holder, America's Jim Ryun, in the process. ""The third lap I took off and opened a gap - the final lap I was forty meters ahead and they only close to twenty meters,"" he says of his now legendary victory. Keino's Olympic success saw him become a household name across the globe and a hero to people all over Africa. In a glittering career that followed, Keino won 3,000 meter gold in the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, as well as three gold medals in the Commonwealth Games. He was also the first African to run a mile in under four minutes and hold the world records for both the 3,000 and 5,000 meter events. But with his track career now well and truly behind him, the 71 year old now spends his time focusing on his other passions -- namely philanthropy and encouraging Africa's next generation of star athletes. Shaped by his own experiences as a young child, Keino decided to open an orphanage in Eldoret, Kenya in 1973. ""My mother died when I was young - 3 years old,"" he says. ""I could feel a pinch and a heart for somebody who doesn't have parents, so I started the children[s] home."" The project was small to begin with but soon expanded to encompass a primary school, a secondary school. Then in 2007, Keino opened an elite sporting academy with the aim of encouraging talented young Kenyan athletes to reach their full potential. With a lifetime of wisdom and success and behind him, Keino says he hopes his projects will enable him to pass on his experiences to the next generation of Kenyans. Most important of all however, he explains that he hopes to give those in his schools love and confidence, whilst instilling them with a sense of respect for themselves. ""Taking care of those people to be good members of society, to be able to do something, to be able to have a better life like any other children with their parents"" is what is most vital, he says.

"(CNN) -- A legal advocacy group sued the federal government Tuesday, seeking benefits for 15 gay and lesbian Massachusetts residents who wed after the state legalized same-sex marriage. A lawsuit contends the federal government is denying benefits to Massachusetts same-sex couples. Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders -- the same Boston-based group that successfully argued in 2003 for same-sex marriage rights in Massachusetts -- filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Boston on behalf of six couples and three men whose husbands have died. The suit contends the federal Defense of Marriage Act denies them protections and benefits that heterosexual couples receive, including health insurance for federal employees, the ability to file as ""married filing jointly"" on federal income taxes and Social Security spousal protections. Two other couples plan to file suit after they receive an anticipated rejection of their amended tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service, GLAD said. President Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996. It effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions by defining marriage as ""a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife"" and a spouse as ""a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife."" GLAD's suit addresses only Section 3 of the law, a portion that prevents the federal government from giving Social Security and other protections to same-sex married couples. GLAD says there are 1,138 federal laws in which marital status is a factor. Only Massachusetts and Connecticut allow same-sex marriage. Vermont, New Jersey and New Hampshire allow civil unions. One of the plaintiffs in the suit is Dean Hara, who was married to former U.S. Rep. Gerry E. Studds, the first openly gay member of Congress. The two legally married in 2004, a week after Massachusetts began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Studds, who by then had retired from politics, died in October 2006. ""Gerry was a public servant for 27 years, worked hard for our country and paid as much into the system as anyone else,"" Hara, 51, said, according to the GLAD Web site. ""But after he died, I was treated differently than other surviving spouses. Every federal employee counts on their surviving spouses having basic protections, but the federal government denies me those protections because of DOMA."" Other plaintiffs include state trooper Sgt. Mary Ritchie and her spouse, Kathy Bush. They said not being able to file federal taxes jointly denies them deductions afforded to heterosexual married couples. ""We work hard, pay taxes, volunteer and do our part for our community. But the federal government still tells us we're less of a family than other families in our neighborhood -- families Mary works to protect,"" Bush said, according to the GLAD Web site. Others named in the suit include a postal worker who hasn't been allowed to add her spouse to her health plan, a widower who hasn't been able to collect his spouse's Social Security payments and a Social Security Administration retiree who is denied health insurance for his spouse. The United States of America and several federal agencies are named as defendants.","NEW: Suit addresses section of law that prevents Social Security disbursement .

"(CNN) -- Amid fierce fighting, Syrian TV on Thursday showed video of President Bashar al-Assad, the first images broadcast of him since a deadly attack on top officials a day earlier. The development came as rebels fought government forces in Damascus and its suburbs and made significant attacks on strategic border points, officials said. Half a world away at U.N. headquarters in New York, Russia and China vetoed a new Security Council resolution aimed at halting the violence, prompting fierce criticism from the United States. The video, showing al-Assad with newly named Defense Minister Gen. Fahd Jassem al-Freij, came amid growing speculation about al-Assad's whereabouts. Some reports suggested he might have left the capital. There was nothing in the video to indicate immediately when it was taken, but Syrian TV reported that al-Freij had taken his oath in front of al-Assad. Although al-Assad has not often appeared on television or in public events during the near 17-month crisis gripping his country, it is unusual for a leader not to address a nation in the wake of a major bombing, and as violence rages in the capital. Wednesday's blast at a government building in Damascus killed three top officials, one of whom also was the president's brother-in-law. What we need to know about Syria . At least 217 people were killed Thursday, including 40 in Damascus suburbs, 70 in Deir Ezzor and 33 in Idlib, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) said. The Damascus suburb of al-Qaboun was under heavy fire Thursday, according to an opposition activist. Rebel fighters fought Thursday for control of the country's borders with Turkey and Iraq, with success reported in the latter. Two main crossing points, Albo Kamal and Al-Waleed, and seven additional security posts were in the hands of the rebels, a senior Iraqi Army official in Anbar province told CNN. Iraqi security forces have increased their military and security presence at the border in Anbar as a precautionary measure, the official said. The Free Syrian Army and other rebels were no longer in control of a compound they had seized at the Turkish border. Forces attacked three to four border crossings, according to Col. Malek al-Kurdi, deputy head of the rebel Free Syrian Army. ""There was a battle at the border crossing, Bab al-Hawa, and government forces withdrew from the new gate to an older gate, al-Kurdi said. Outnumbered rebels eventually were forced to withdraw from both gates, al-Kurdi said. Videos posted to YouTube from inside a border station at the new gate showed a rebel tearing up a poster of al-Assad, while another rebel smashed portraits of the president and his father, Hafez al-Assad, who led the country until 2000. Numerous world leaders slammed al-Assad's regime Thursday and condemned Russia and China for vetoing the Security Council resolution. Russia, China veto sanctions on Syria . Western countries were pushing for a resolution that threatened new sanctions if government forces don't stop attacks against civilians. The resolution also called for renewing the 300-member U.N. observer mission for 45 days after it was suspended because of violence. Russia and China, which have major trade deals with Syria, have said they want more balanced resolutions that call on all sides to halt the violence. Russia said Thursday's vote should never have taken place. Russia had ""very clearly and consistently explained"" that it would not accept a resolution that ""would open the path for pressure of sanctions and further to extend military involvement in Syrian domestic affairs,"" said Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations. Western diplomats ""could have done something, anything, to promote dialogue"" rather than ""fan the flames of extremists,"" Churkin said. He described the draft resolution as ""biased,"" saying it threatened sanctions exclusively at the Syrian government. Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that the United States will push other approaches to the conflict, including through the Friends of Syria Group. ""What Russia and China did today by vetoing a third resolution was really to slam the door, at least in the short term, on any effective action out of the U.N. Security Council,"" she said. She called the two countries ""isolated outliers"" on the issue. ""History will judge them as having stood by a brutal dictator at the expense of his own people and at the expense of the will of the international community and the countries in the region,"" Rice told CNN. The fate of the U.N. observer mission was unclear after the vetoes. Competing drafts, sponsored by the United Kingdom and Pakistan, are expected to be considered by the U.N. Security Council. They highlight the simmering differences among members. The UK mission said its resolution will be considered Friday morning. That draft measure extends the observer mission in Syria for a final period of 30 days. Russia, which backs Pakistan's resolution, wants observers to stay in the country and promote dialogue. Western countries are concerned about the safety of observers and want one final deployment. See the Syria crisis in photos . China's U.N. ambassador, Li Baodong, said his country is ""highly concerned"" about the violence, but Thursday's draft resolution was ""seriously problematic,"" because it intended to pressure only one side in the conflict. It would not help resolve the issue ""but derail the issue from the track of political segment,"" further aggravating turmoil, he argued. Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Jaafari, slammed the council for not issuing an official condemnation of Wednesday's bombing, although he noted that Kofi Annan, joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League, condemned it. The lack of an official condemnation by the council indicates that talk of ""supporting a peaceful solution in Syria is but a slogan,"" Jaafari argued. He rejected a ""misleading picture"" of Syria as a tyrannical regime killing its people and said a solution should be found through a ""political process that satisfies the Syrian people."" All will participate to help ""establish democracy"" and ""free elections,"" he insisted. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than 40 years. Video: Fighting rages around Damascus . Residents trying to flee the Syrian violence have nowhere to go because clashes are raging in most of Damascus province, said Omar al-Dimashki, a spokesman for the Revolution Leadership Council of Damascus. ""It is surrounded by tanks, and anything that moves is currently being shelled, and rockets are falling on the homes,"" he said. Sander van Hoorn, a journalist in Damascus with Dutch TV network NOS, a CNN affiliate, said, ""One hour it can be quiet and the next hour all hell breaks loose."" A resident of the al-Qaboun neighborhood in Damascus said he fled with his wife and two sons after an explosion shook a house next door. The man, who CNN is not identifying for security reasons, said his sister and her family joined them in Qamishli, and she described the government assault on al-Qaboun. ""There were tanks, helicopters, armored personnel carriers and gunshots fell like rain. We were terrified,"" he quoted her as saying. The Free Syrian Army warned them the neighborhood was ""going to be a war zone."" Syria, which blames the violence on ""armed terrorist groups,"" said it ""repelled"" some groups that attempted to enter Syria from Lebanon on Wednesday night. The regime said Wednesday's bombing was carried out by people ""implementing foreign plots."" The Syrian military issued a statement stressing its ""resolution to decisively eliminating the criminal and murder gangs and chasing them out of their rotten hideouts wherever they are until clearing the homeland of their evils,"" state-run news agency SANA said. Anyone who thinks that targeting leaders will ""twist Syria's arms is 'deluded,'"" the statement said, according to SANA. Video: Syria government says it will fight back . The officials killed in the blast were the defense minister; the deputy defense minister, who is the president's brother-in-law; and al-Assad's security adviser and assistant vice president, state TV reported. The FSA's al-Kurdi said the attack was coordinated by rebel brigades. But some other rebel commanders say it's unclear who was behind the attack. Since the crisis began in March 2011, the United Nations estimates, more than 10,000 people have been killed in the violence; the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria estimates that more than 16,000 have died. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of violence in the nation because the government restricts access by foreign journalists. Attack threatens Syrian president's grip on power .

"(CNN) -- Former Liberian President Charles Taylor boycotted his war crimes trial again Wednesday after judges rejected a delayed summary from his defense team, a court official said. Taylor is the first African ruler to appear before an international war crimes tribunal. He is accused of fueling a bloody civil war in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone that led to widespread murder, rapes and mutilation. The former president has pleaded not guilty to charges that include crimes against humanity and war crimes. His lawyers first walked out Tuesday after a tribunal declined to accept their trial summary because it was filed after a January 14 deadline, a court spokesman said. His defense team walked out first, then Taylor refused to return to the courtroom after a break, said Solomon Moriba, a spokesman for The Hague court in the Netherlands. ""He indicated he was deeply upset and needed to rest,"" Moriba said. Taylor did not attend the proceedings again Wednesday, and the judge has adjourned the case until Friday, the spokesman said. The boycott comes as prosecutors prepared to present their closing arguments. The verdict is expected this summer, Moriba said. Taylor is on trial at the Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague. United Nations officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up a special tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. Prosecutors allege that Taylor, who was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003, fueled the lengthy civil war, which killed tens of thousands, using riches from a diamond trade. The so-called blood diamonds are mined in war zones to support rebels and warlords. Blood diamonds have fueled bloody conflicts in Africa for more than a decade. The trial has included testimony from supermodel Naomi Campbell, who said that Taylor gave her ""dirty-looking"" uncut diamonds as a gift. Prosecutors were hoping her testimony would tie him to blood diamonds. Last year, Washington said it expedited a $4.5 million grant because the court was facing a financial crisis. The U.S. urged the international community to donate to the court before its financial resources run out. If found guilty, Taylor will be sent to a prison in Britain, the spokesman said.","Charles Taylor is the first African head of state to appear before an international war crimes tribunal .

"(CNN) -- Nestle is suspending deliveries of all its products that include beef from a German supplier because ""traces of horse DNA"" were found in the meat, the Swiss-based food giant said on its website Monday. Nestle also is recalling two chilled pasta products, Buitoni Beef Ravioli and Beef Tortellini, from store shelves in Italy and Spain, the news release said. A lasagna product sold to French catering businesses will also be recalled. ""Our tests have found traces of horse DNA in two products made from beef supplied by H.J. Schypke,"" the statement said. ""The levels found are above the one percent threshold the UK's Food Safety Agency uses to indicate likely adulteration or gross negligence."" The company said there are no food safety issues and it had notified the authorities. H.J. Schypke is a subcontractor of JBS Toledo N.V., a Belgian supplier. Opinion: Scandal shines spotlight on murky horse trade . Unauthorized horse meat has been discovered in a variety of products labeled as beef that were sold in supermarkets in countries including Britain, France, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Ireland. Also on Monday, the French government lifted a suspension tied to the production of minced meat, sausages and ready-made meals at Spanghero. The French firm will still not be allowed to stock frozen raw meat. Spanghero should have known that the meat it labeled as beef was actually horse, French Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon has said. Spanghero was the first company to label the meat as beef, the minister said, adding that 750 tons of horse meat were involved over a period of at least six months. Spanghero should have identified the meat as horse from its Romanian customs code, as well as its appearance, smell and price, he said. Horse meat concerns date to February 2012, officials say . A Spanghero representative has told CNN the company had acted in good faith. ""The company has never ordered horse meat, and we never knowingly sold horse meat,"" the representative said. The affair has been passed to the Paris prosecutor to be investigated as fraud, Hamon said. The offense is punishable by up to two years in prison and fines of up to â‚¬187,500 (about $250,000) for the companies involved. Meanwhile, UK Environment Secretary Owen Paterson met with representatives of food businesses to talk about the response to the horse meat scandal. ""I welcome the food businesses' commitment to testing their products. They all assured me that they will not rest until they have established the full picture. There is still much to be done to find out exactly how this happened and how it can be prevented from happening again, and to do everything possible to reassure consumers about the food on our shelves,"" he said in a statement after the meeting. Paterson said the representatives ""agreed to do their level best to report back as many testing results as possible"" to the Food Standards Agency by Friday. Separately, the agency told CNN that it has no information to suggest donkey meat is in the food chain. The meat industry was first thrust into the spotlight last month when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in hamburger products. The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the consumption of horse meat. First UK test reveals scope of horse meat contamination .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actress Amanda Bynes has been charged with two misdemeanor hit-and-run counts, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles city attorney's office said Wednesday. The 26-year-old star was allegedly involved in incidents on April 10 and August 4. The charges follow an April 6 incident in which Bynes was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence after her vehicle allegedly struck an officer's vehicle. She pleaded not guilty in that case, according to reports. At the time, her father, Rick Bynes, told People magazine that the actress hadn't been drinking. If convicted on the hit-and-run charges, the ""Easy A"" star faces a maximum sentence of up to six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine for each count, said city attorney spokesman Frank Mateljan. The charges were filed Tuesday. Bynes, who starred in the TV series ""What I Like About You,"" is due in Van Nuys Superior Court on September 27.

"(CNN) -- Few female Chinese artists have attained the level of international recognition that sculptor Xiang Jing enjoys. Her work has been exhibited in America and throughout Europe. She was the subject of a recent joint survey show at the Museum of Contemporary Art Shanghai. She was one of four winners of this year's Martell Artists of the Year competition and was also recently featured in Italian Vogue. Xiang first garnered attention for her sculptures of women. Working in porcelain, bronze and fiberglass, her figures are often nude, slouching, and wearing vacant or depressed expressions. ""Your Body,"" a 2.6-meter-high fiberglass sculpture made in 2005 was collected by the Saatchi Gallery. A seated, slouching and vacant-eyed nude woman with a scar on her abdomen, sagging breasts and fat rolls, critic Gao Shiming, a dean at the China Academy of Art, has described the work as an expression of ""fatigue ... emptiness and helplessness."" The effect of Xiang's work is often disquieting, even though her figures are recognizable. According to curator and critic Lilly Wei, Xiang's ""sense of social satire is anchored in the commonplace, in the daily exigencies and social exchanges of an ordinary woman's life, in the small vanities, frauds and violations."" Xiang says her work is always a kind of ongoing philosophical inquiry. ""From the day we are born, we have many, many questions -- all kinds of questions from what we see, what we experience and what we know. ""I think art is possibly one of the ways, one of the channels, to help us to find out certain truths,"" she says. Her sculptures of women, for instance, are an attempt ""to deal with everything that had to do with female existence."" But, she says, ""after a while, if you work on a deeper level, you will discover that whether male or female, you're ultimately dealing with human nature. In other words, the deeper you go, you move further away from gender but you get closer to human nature."" More than gender politics, she is interested in human relationships. ""Individuals are in fact very alien, very distant to each other. However, as we're collective animals, social animals, we all end up in a kind of a relationship ... I think we're like two neighboring islands, gradually getting close to each other."" More from Human to Hero: From builder to Pritzker-winning architect . Raised in Beijing by an editor and film studio director, Xiang studied at Beijing's Central Academy of Fine Arts, graduating in 1995. One of the first artists to make an impression on her was Tian Shixin, a sculptor from Guizhou whose work Xiang first saw when she was at high school. It was the first time she had seen sculpture that wasn't a politically-freighted monument or memorial, she says. ""He had created an emotional state of human beings."" But Xiang's process is too personal to be inspired by anyone or anything else. In fact, she rejects the notion of inspiration altogether. ""I don't think art is like design, when one can have an inspiration here or an inspiration there."" ""Art is more the expression of your points of view, or whatever you want to express in the long process of your understanding -- often it has a very long thread throughout."" Every three years, Xiang puts on a solo show containing series of works that represent a particular line of questioning, she says. Typically, she draws a rough sketch with measurements marked in, which her assistants use as the basis for creating a steel framework. Xiang then uses clay to shape a form, from which a plaster mold is created, which she then paints. The production phase is physically exhausting for Xiang. ""Every time when I work on something, I would eat very little and sleep very little and become very, very thin."" But, she says, ""the most challenging part of the whole creation is the initial thinking process,"" something she describes as ""painful,"" even ""torturing."" ""The actual work ... I can complete it within a year or a year and a half. But before that, I have to think for a long, long time ... trying hard to convince myself."" She says she doesn't use photographs or work from models: ""It all comes from my head."" Although her sculptures are strikingly lifelike, Xiang says she isn't aiming for realism. ""If you put a real person's face next to it, you will see a lot of differences. But what matters to me is ... the poignance of the expression."" ""I want my art to awaken the sensibility of each onlooker, to awaken his body, so that his body can experience the sculpture. That's why I really want people to stand right in front of my sculpture, to face (it)."" More from Human to Hero: Top designer shares secret of staying in vogue . Xiang knows she is living in an interesting period of Chinese history. ""I was born in 1968. We've gone through the Cultural Revolution, then the Reform and Opening Up period, then the recent years of rapid economic growth. ""These have been the decades when China has gone through the most dramatic, the fastest changes ever. And contemporary Chinese art has been born and developed within these last 30 years."" What that means for Xiang personally is not yet clear, though. Being thrown into the cross currents of history is, she says, ""good fortune"" on one hand, but she also says, ""I'm not very adaptable."" In fact, an artist heralded by critics and collectors as exemplary of exciting new developments in a still-developing world, says she often feels out of step. ""I feel that I'm gradually becoming more and more alien to this era, as I feel that the world has become more and more extrovert, more and more superficial. ""It's become ever so easy to know, to see and to experience too many things. The ways for us to get to know the world have become more and more diverse. There are more and more channels ... and more and more platforms. ""People have become ... more and more extroverted. However, I think there should be another part that should look inward ... into an inner world ... a world that exists within us. And this world isn't small at all. In fact, it can be enormous.""","Xiang Jing attracted international attention with her large-scale sculptures of women .
Her work is held by the Saatchi Gallery and has been exhibited throughout Europe.
Her sculptures are the result of ongoing philosophical inquiry, Xiang says.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Most musicians don't like doing interviews at their homes. It's much too private. Stevie Nicks, however, has no problem inviting journalists to her big colonial house in Pacific Palisades, half a mile above the California coastline. Fleetwood Mac is back on the road with Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, shown performing in 2004. ""It's just easier,"" she confides. Perhaps that's true. But after three decades in the public eye, she really has nothing to hide. Fans know all about her fabled history with Fleetwood Mac -- in particular, her tumultuous relationship with the band's prodigal guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham. Even hovering around age 60, they are yin and yang. Buckingham is spirited and hot -- in sharp contrast to Nicks' eternal cool. The tension that fueled such songs as ""The Chain,"" ""Dreams"" and ""Go Your Own Way"" in the late '70s is still palpable -- and they seem to return to it instinctively, like muscle memory. But these days, there's also a certain acceptance and understanding.  Watch the pair talk about life, love and the band » . Along with bandmates Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, Buckingham and Nicks are back on the road with Fleetwood Mac for their first tour in five years. It's a celebration of their greatest hits, as well as 30 years together as a group. During our interview, Buckingham and Nicks reminisced about how their rocky relationship became immortalized in their music -- while Buckingham's wife Kristen snapped photos six feet away. CNN: This is the first Fleetwood Mac tour in five years. Stevie Nicks: We don't like comebacks. We don't make comebacks. We're not making a comeback. We never went away. Lindsey Buckingham: Every time we get together, it's like a whole new group of people. CNN: Is Christine McVie still sitting this one out? (The singer/keyboardist retired from Fleetwood Mac in 1998.) Nicks: Christine would rather be skinned alive and fed to the sharks. She doesn't want to do it anymore. It's kind of like when someone breaks up with you and you see that look on their face like, ""It's really over?"" For Christine, it's really over. She doesn't want to fly. She never told us she used to get panic attacks, because she's so brave. And if you don't fly, that means the bus. So that was it for her. We cannot replace Chris. CNN: Wasn't there talk about Sheryl Crow filling in at one point? Buckingham: It was considered. I think what happened was Sheryl kind of took it upon herself to announce that she was joining Fleetwood Mac, and nothing had ever really been decided. Nicks: I would like to say something in Sheryl's defense. Sheryl had the chance. She and I are really good friends. When I told her how difficult Fleetwood Mac was -- it's like being in the army -- once you sign up for Fleetwood Mac, you have no life, you have no opinion. And I said, ""So understand what you're signing up for."" And she said, ""Are you trying to talk me out of this?"" And I said, ""No, I'm just telling you the truth about what it is to be in this band, and honey, you've got to really think about it."" And she called me back and said, ""I think you're right. I think I'm going to pass."" Buckingham: On a business level, or on a marketing level, it might have made sense to bring someone in. But when you contemplate going out there and doing some songs of Christine's that we are going to do this time, to me, there was the potential of making it a bit loungey -- having someone come in and do her songs. I think we are better served to interpret them in new ways ourselves, and in a way that resonate[s] with our own history. CNN: People have always been fascinated by the dynamic between the members of Fleetwood Mac. You guys lived together, worked together, wrote songs about each other and dated each other. Buckingham: I think if the media (paparazzi) had existed in 1977 when we were going through break-ups within the band and still moving forward on a professional level, the tabloidism that exists today would have probably eaten us alive. Nicks: Let's use Britney Spears as an example, poor little thing. In our day, I think that the audiences revered their rock stars -- and I say that with all respect -- that our audiences cared about us, and took care of us and would never have put us under that kind of danger. I would have been a very unpleasant star if people treated me the way people treat the kids that are out there now. If I had to feel that somebody was waiting for me every time I came out, I would never leave the house. I hardly leave the house, as it is! CNN: In the '70s, you guys were going through your own troubles with drugs and alcohol. Now it seems as though that always makes the front page of the tabloids, especially with young Hollywood. Buckingham: At the time that we were doing that, that subculture existed sort of across the board, I think. Generally speaking, rock-and-roll bands were conducting their personal lives in a such a way that was a reflection of what they thought they had to do in order to be creative. That was sort of a holdover from the '60s in the sense that you needed to experiment -- and that was an illusion, obviously, because it eventually hit the wall, and we all had to re-evaluate the way we were behaving and conducting our lives. And you know, in that sense, we're survivors. CNN: What do you think about, Stevie, when you are out there on stage and you hear ""Go Your Own Way?"" Does it bring back memories of what you were going through at the time -- because that song was about you, wasn't it? Nicks: I think. CNN: Lindsey? Buckingham: Indeed, it was. Yeah, completely autobiographical. You know, the funny thing was I don't think we were aware we were writing songs specifically to each other. It was really only when our audience picked up on it that it became obvious we were dealing with a completely transparent, autobiographical piece of work. Nicks: If Lindsey and I had been happy, happy, happy, there would have been no ""Go Your Own Way."" It would have just been, ""Here we are -- happy, happy."" And the audience would have been like, ""OK, well -- next couple."" So you know, we played off of it. We had fun with it. We could actually walk on stage and have our own little almost-love affair, and have the audience go, ""Oh my God! They're getting back together!"" And we'd be like, ""They're falling for it!"" You know, we would totally play it, and we did, and we do, and we always will. CNN: Why do you continue to do this? Because you could just sit in your beautiful house in England, like Christine, and not have to worry about any of this. Buckingham: That's a very interesting question. I think there are chapters yet to be written within this group. Look at Stevie and myself. We have known each other since we were in high school. Nicks: 16 and 17. Buckingham: And it's been a convoluted road, you know. It's been a great road, and often painful for both of us. We have been extremely close, we have been alienated. It's a road of contrast. But there are still things to be learned, and still things to be shared, and still a certain amount of growing up to do in the never-ending quest to become adults. CNN: You both recently completed solo projects. Lindsey, you have your solo album, ""Gift of Screws,"" and Stevie, there's an upcoming CD and DVD (""The Soundstage Sessions"" and ""Live in Chicago,"" respectively). Nicks: We've been lucky. You do Fleetwood Mac, and then you work on your own stuff, and then you do Fleetwood Mac and then you work on your own stuff. As much as I love my solo work, I'm a little bored with it, so I can put that away in its magical box and I can go straight into working with three of my favorite people in the whole world. Fleetwood Mac is bigger than anything Lindsey and I solo-wise will ever do. I never rented a 737 jet for my solo tour. So now we get to be grand, and at the end of the tour, it's kisses for everybody and goodbye. Go do your own thing, and we'll meet up again in two or three years.","Fleetwood Mac back on tour this year .

"(CNN) -- Stephen Breyer is known as one of the most active and engaging justices on the Supreme Court. He's also been known to take a painful spill, every now and then. One such fall -- from the bicycle he was riding Friday afternoon near the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington -- landed the associate justice in an ambulance, and eventually at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, the Supreme Court announced in a press release. It is the third publicly known major bike crash for Breyer in the last two decades. At the hospital, the 74-year-old was diagnosed with a proximal humerus fracture -- the humerus being the upper bone of the arm. He underwent reverse shoulder replacement surgery on Saturday morning. Unlike in a healthy shoulder, where the humerus ends in a ball shape and fits into the shoulder blade to form a shoulder, in reverse shoulder replacement surgery the anatomy is reversed. In other words, a new metal ""ball"" is attached to the shoulder blade, or scapula, and a plastic cup is put at the upper end of the humerus bone. Patients typically leave the hospital after this procedure -- first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2003 -- in two or three days, according to the American Academy of Ortophaedic Surgeons. The Supreme Court said Breyer is expected to head home early next week. It's not the first time that he's tumbled off his bike and ended up in a hospital. In 1993, he had a nasty accident when a car stuck him in Harvard Square while he was on his two-wheeler. He suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs. Then, over Memorial Day weekend in 2011, Breyer broke his right collarbone after falling off his two-wheeler in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he has a second home. He's had bad luck in other ways as well. An intruder armed with a machete robbed Breyer, two guests and his wife -- renowned pediatric psychologist Dr. Joanna Breyer -- while they were vacationing on the Caribbean island of Nevis in February 2012. Breyer robbed at machete-point during vacation . Three months later, his Washington home was burglarized.

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old California boy accused of fatally stabbing his 8-year-old sister had been suspended from his middle school this year after being accused of bringing a small pocketknife there, according to a fellow student and a school administration source. Police announced Saturday that the boy had been arrested on a homicide charge in the late April stabbing death of his sister, Leila Fowler, at their northern California home. Before Leila's death, the boy's middle school in Valley Springs suspended him for five days after he brought a small pocketknife to school, according to one of the boy's classmates. That account was backed up by a school administration source. Authorities haven't revealed what kind of knife was used in Leila's death, which happened April 27 inside the family home in Valley Springs. The death of Leila, known for her bubbly personality, shook the small town of Valley Springs, where ribbons in her favorite color of purple were tied to stop signs. Leila's brother had told police that he'd seen an intruder leaving the home.

"(CNN) -- Linda Claire Willits crossed the finish line at the Boston Marathon in a time of 3 hours and 34 minutes, setting a personal best in her 29th marathon. No matter how many races one runs, there's nothing like that euphoric moment of pushing through the pain to complete 26.2 miles. Willits soaked in the atmosphere along Boylston Street. People lining the road cleared a path when they saw she was a runner. They congratulated her and made her feel like a celebrity. She texted a friend waiting down the street at the bar at the Mandarin Oriental hotel. ""I'm on my way,"" Willits said. Her friend, Stephanie Douglas, prepared to celebrate. Then, a small explosion went off, followed seconds later by a thunderous boom that tore through the area. ""It was so strong the bar filled up with smoke and chairs tipped over,"" Douglas said. ""I saw people -- it was like they were on a trampoline literally flying through the air."" Bedlam ensued. Smoke poured into the bar. People began shouting that another bomb had been found, and everyone scrambled to escape. Outside, one man's legs were blown off, and he kept trying to stand up. Douglas fled, unable to contact Willits. Panic for her friend sunk in. Rushing to the scene . Boston.com sports producer Steve Silva was covering the much-heralded Boston Marathon. He was shooting what should have been joyous finish-line scenes when in a few seconds, everything changed. His camera kept rolling amid screams of shock and horror. ""It was just immediately (evident) there were injuries, right in the middle of the spectator crowds. I saw dismemberment, I saw blood everywhere,"" Silva said. Terrorism strikes Boston Marathon . ""I saw someone lose their leg, people are crying, people are confused."" Rescuers rushed to the victims with stretchers and wheelchairs. Ambulances quickly lined up for blocks and blocks. In between the screams of pain and panic were phone calls. ""Mom, I'm safe."" They were words Boston Globe reporter Billy Baker heard many times as he kept passing people on the scene. He posted what he heard and saw on Twitter: ""Finish line volunteers told to run. Describe fear 'like 9/11 or the tsunami.'"" He described a nervous calm energy as people either tried to figure out what was happening or had no idea where to go. Then his tweets got considerably more grim: . ""Now getting gruesome first-hand accounts of hair on fire, severed limbs, battlefield scene in front of Charlesmark Hotel."" Confusion. Bewilderment. Rumors everywhere. ""It's not safe to be here,"" said a Boston police officer evacuating Commonwealth Avenue, Baker reported. What we know about the terror attack, aftermath . Jim Bardin works in an office building between the locations of the two blasts. ""I heard the first blast and it shook the building a bit, and went to see what was going on and the second one went off a couple of seconds after,"" Bardin said. What he saw from above was harrowing. ""People were pretty panicked down there -- the crowd was trying to get away as fast as possible. From up above, it looked like mayhem."" Will Ritter was about a block away, near Copley Square. He was trying to arrange a press conference for a runner who had just finished the race. He said the blasts felt and sounded like the concussion bursts at the end of a Fourth of July fireworks show. Then he saw the white smoke billowing. Then emergency vehicles -- and pandemonium. ""Let's go, Let's go,"" shouted rescue workers. Mark Gordon had just moved to his high-rise apartment on Boylston Street a month and a half ago. He had a perfect view of the marathon from his balcony and throughout the day, he had looked out and snapped photos. It was a glorious day in Boston, the city he'd lived in for 12 years. He was doing household chores when the first bomb went off. ""I'll never look out my window the same way again even though it's been six short weeks,"" Gordon said. Brittany Smith, a physical therapy student at Northeastern University in Boston, was volunteering at Medical Tent B, two blocks away from the finish line. She was treating runners for common ailments like muscle cramps when she heard the first loud bang. ""Everyone's like, 'What's going on?' You could just sense something was wrong, that things were definitely not right,"" Smith said. ""We didn't rush to the scene, I was trying to (help) a marathoner locate her family members ... and I'm freaking out. It was really hard to focus on helping out the marathon runner. I was just panicking,"" she said. She and other volunteers were desperate for information. They turned on the news and saw the footage from helicopters whirring above. The sidewalks had turned crimson. Running for a cause . Willits was en route to meet her friend at the Mandarin Hotel when excitement from finishing the race turned into terror. ""The whole ground shook, and I knew right away it was a bomb,"" she said. Crying, she added, ""I saw people who had lost their limbs."" Douglas worried about the fate of her friend. They could not reach each other by cell phone. Douglas had come up from Virginia to cheer on her friend. She couldn't help but think of 2008 when she was in Mumbai when deadly shooting and bombing attacks broke out there. ""This is twice I've been in two cities when this kind of thing has been happening,"" she said. Douglas knew Willits was somewhere in the vicinity when the blasts went off. After all, she'd gotten the text from her. ""Everything that could go wrong was gong through my head,"" she said. Minutes seemed like hours. Finally, Willits' daughter managed to get hold of both of them by phone and coordinated their reunion. Willits waited at a street corner for nearly an hour. ""We were both already crying and just embraced each other,"" she said. Added Douglas, ""It was a meltdown."" About that time, another blast went off and they trembled again. They would later learn it was a controlled explosion by police. Strangers offered them shelter and gave them water. ""I'm kinda numb right now,"" Willits said. ""Having seen what I saw, it really breaks my heart."" She had begun running marathons a decade ago for her daughter after she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. She and Douglas had pledged Sunday to run the Twin Cities Marathon together later this year. They were even more determined now. ""This has been a traumatic event,"" Willits said between tears. ""But I just feel like we can't stop doing things that we enjoy doing, because then the terrorists win.""","Witnesses at the scene of the Boston bombings recall the horror .

"New York (CNN) -- A veteran New York police officer accused of equipping a robbery crew with state-of-the art police equipment and helping them loot drug dealers out of $1 million pleaded not guilty in federal court Thursday. Jose Tejada, 45, also is accused of allowing the robbery crew to use his Manhattan apartment for their enterprise. In court documents filed Wednesday, federal prosecutors said the crew posed as police officers and used fake warrants to arrest drug traffickers. The crew then robbed those it arrested of their money and their stashes of marijuana, heroin, ecstasy and cocaine, authorities said. In all, the group -- comprising Tejada and at least 21 others -- is responsible for more than 100 armed robberies throughout New York City since 2001, according to officials. The New York Police Department officer, arrested Wednesday, faces multiple counts of robbery, drug dealing and weapons charges. A U.S. magistrate on Thursday ordered Tejada to remain in custody. Prosecutors said they had ""overwhelming evidence"" and argued the man presented a continuing danger to the community. But the officer's court-appointed attorney, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, said his client was not a flight risk and had remained on the force while on modified duty. ""If there was a danger, what's been going on the last four years?"" Margulis-Ohnuma asked, referring to the length of the investigation. Margulis-Ohnuma said that Tejada ""adamantly denies"" the charges and said they will be ""vehemently challenging them."" It is unclear what made police begin to investigate Tejada, who started with the department in 1996. In 2006 and 2007, Tejada participated in three robberies, prosecutors say, stealing thousands of dollars while dressed in his police uniform. In one of the cases, the crew stormed a Bronx home searching for cocaine. ""The crew mistakenly believed the residents to be drug dealers,"" court documents said. ""In fact, the residents were a family of three, including a teenager, who had no involvement in drug dealing."" The crew did not find drugs but searched the home while Tejada held the family at gunpoint, prosecutors allege. Once they left, the family called 911. Tejada, a father of two, faces a minimum of 17 years in prison if convicted. His wife cried throughout the court proceedings Thursday and left without speaking to reporters. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Thursday, ""Obviously it's sad and disappointing any time a police officer is arrested, but this officer has been on modified duty for three years, so this investigation has taken a long time to come to fruition, and it's still not over. ... the officer has been arrested, suspended, and we'll see what the outcome of the trial is.""

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration wants tighter regulation of indoor tanning beds, citing concerns about equipment malfunctions that have resulted in consumers getting excess radiation. ""We're not trying to burden tanning salons,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, FDA's director for medical devices. ""But there are really concerning studies of adolescents being burned from excess UV radiation from indoor tanning."" Indoor tanning beds are currently classified as low-risk medical devices -- the same as bandages -- and not subject to review by the FDA. Under a new FDA new proposal, they would be reclassified to a midrisk category, and companies would be required to prove to the FDA that their software is up to date, their sunlamps emit the right amount of energy and all safety control measures are in place. ""This is just basic smart testing that (indoor tanning) companies should be doing already but aren't. And if they are doing it now, they are not doing it well enough,"" Shuren said. The Indoor Tanning Association released a statement following the FDA's announcement on Monday. ""The ITA represents reputable small businesses throughout the U.S. that already adhere to the highest professional standards including good manufacturing practices,"" the group said. ""We embrace any label changes that will lead to a better understanding of the potential risks of overexposure and thereby enhance our customers' safety. However we are concerned that the proposed requirements will burden our members with addition(al) unnecessary governmental costs in an already difficult economic climate."" The tanning industry often ignores safety codes and regulations, research shows. Recommended tanning exposure times are exceeded by 95% of indoor tanners, according to a report published Tuesday in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Failing to post consumer warnings and allowing underage consumers to tan without parental consent is also common, according to the paper. ""Compliance has not been enforced so I'm not surprised people don't understand the risks,"" said Meg Watson, study author and epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. ""People hear conflicting messages, and it is particularly dangerous for teens in the United States."" A 2011 CDC report found more than one-third of teen girls have used indoor tanning beds by their senior year of high school. Using indoor tanning beds before age 35 increases risk of developing melanoma -- the most deadly form of skin cancer -- by 75%, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. ""The ultraviolet rays from indoor tanning are generally stronger than the summer sun at noon,"" said Dawn Holman, a behavioral scientist who works in the CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. ""This is dangerous and people need to be warned."" The FDA proposal unveiled this week is aimed at reversing the rising cases of skin cancer for young adults. Melanoma is the second most common form of cancer for 15- to 29-year-olds, and the No. 1 cancer for 25- to 29-year-olds, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. In addition to requiring manufactures to meet safety standards, the FDA will also require tanning beds to feature warning labels prominently on the beds and brochures aimed at people under 18 that say multiple use increases the risk of cancer. The proposal is open for public comment for 90 days before the FDA issues its final recommendations. Afterward, indoor tanning manufacturers and salons will have one year to comply with any new requirements.","Indoor tanning beds are not currently subject to review by the FDA .

"Washington (CNN) -- Forced government spending cuts, known in Washington jargon as sequestration, took effect a month ago amid doomsday predictions of freed criminals, weakened borders and a crippled military. President Barack Obama and other federal officials warned that the harshest impacts would hit in April, with worker furloughs and program cuts rippling through the economy to stunt growth during a sluggish recovery. But as April dawned Monday, little evidence of widespread damage had emerged, leaving the president vulnerable to accusations that he hyped the impact for political purposes in the unending battle with Republicans over taxes and spending. The $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends September 30, were mandated by a 2011 agreement by Congress that raised the federal debt ceiling. In an attempt to motivate legislators to compromise on a deficit-reduction plan, the agreement required $1.2 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts over a decade if Congress failed to strike a deal to shrink the deficit by that amount. Obama follows up on past call to bolster U.S. infrastructure . The cuts targeted agencies and programs dear to Democrats, such as education, and also went after Republican priorities, including the military. It was a simple idea that now seems naÃ¯ve: Make the threat of forced cuts so onerous and undesirable that a deal on deficit reduction would be inevitable. Instead of instigating a bargain, sequestration became the latest deadline-driven fiscal crisis to reinforce the dysfunction of Congress in tackling what legislators and economists call the biggest challenge facing the nation -- reducing chronic federal deficits and debt. Chart: Real impact of cuts . Now, those sky-is-falling scenarios tied to the cuts seem to be in question, providing conservatives who seek to shrink government some political room to argue that it needs less money, not more, as Democrats argue. To Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis at George Mason University, both sides got some things right and others wrong. Forecasts show a rebounding economy in 2014 and 2015, with or without the cuts, he noted. ""I think both sides were gaming it,"" Fuller told CNN, noting that the long, slow recovery caused everyone to underestimate the resiliency of the economy. Senate passes first budget proposal in four years . ""Next year and the year after, I don't think people are going to care about"" the sequester, he added. One reason the impact has been less harsh than expected is that Congress and Obama agreed to change the rules for their implementation, effectively weaseling out of the penalty they previously agreed to for failing to compromise. A spending plan through September 30 that Congress passed and Obama signed last month gave the military and some agencies more leeway for absorbing cuts. Because of the change, the Pentagon has reduced furloughs of some civilian workers from an initial total of 22 days to 14, while the Justice Department has put off a decision on the furlough issue. Other departments and agencies held down furloughs by freezing hiring, curtailing overtime and improving efficiency. Federal meat inspectors avoided furloughs altogether due to additional money for the Agriculture Department. Some early steps to handle the spending cuts prompted headlines and controversy. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released more than 2,000 low-priority undocumented immigrants in order to save money, and the Federal Aviation Administration announced it would close scores of control towers at smaller airports. Overall, most Americans have yet to feel much pain. While some international travelers have faced longer lines when entering the country, the overall impact on airport security and other travel functions has been less arduous than initially feared. A CNN/ORC International survey two weeks ago found 11% of respondents were affected a ""great deal"" by the sequester and another 24% cited ""some"" impact, while 43% answered ""none at all"" and 21% said ""not much."" Fuller noted that the cuts reduce planned spending for the rest of the current fiscal year and hold down increased spending over the coming decade. Put another way, the total amount of government spending 10 years from now would be no lower than it is today if the full impact of the cuts take effect, he said. While the cuts will cause the equivalent in lost wages of 1.58 million jobs this fiscal year, the overall strength of the economy would easily overcome that hit and the effects of related austerity in coming years, Fuller said. Program recipients and some industries and businesses linked to federal workers, such as the Washington Metro system and restaurants around the corner from government offices, would experience pain now, he said, but the cuts are ""not going to shake the national economy to the core."" The issue remains a political fight in Washington. Who's in the tower? At some regional airports soon, no one . Republicans are criticizing the Obama administration for overstating the impacts in an attempt to pressure them into a deal. ""There's a lot of questions about how the White House is handling the communications on this,"" House Speaker John Boehner said shortly after the cuts took effect on March 1. In response to a recent administration request for states to reimburse some already allocated funds due to the sequester, 31 House members -- including four Democrats -- sent a letter last week calling the move ""an obvious attempt ... to make the sequester as painful as possible."" Obama argues that anything to stunt economic growth as the recovery continues to struggle should be avoided. However, he may have lost some credibility after statements in the heat of the political battle in February that now seem overzealous. ""Federal prosecutors will have to close cases and let criminals go,"" the president said on February 19. ""Air traffic controllers and airport security will see cutbacks, which means more delays at airports across the country. Thousands of teachers and educators will be laid off. Tens of thousands of parents will have to scramble to find childcare for their kids. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings."" Ten days later, with a compromise unreachable and the cuts kicking in, Obama toned down the rhetoric. ""What's important to understand is that not everyone will feel the pain of these cuts right away,"" he told a news conference, later adding that ""we will get through this. This is not going to be an apocalypse, I think as some people have said. It's just dumb. And it's going to hurt."" The bottom line, according to Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein of the Brookings Institution, is that the damage from the forced spending cuts ""will accumulate in less visible ways, as irrational reductions in public spending impede economic growth and job creation; reduce investments in education, infrastructure and scientific research; and further disrupt the routines of a modern democracy."" ""The longer the sequester remains in place,"" they recently wrote in the Washington Post, ""the more harm is inflicted."" Fuller agreed that it would take years to assess the full impact of the sequester's impact now, but said that in the end, renewed confidence would mean a growing economy and ""we'll forget about it at some point.""

"(CNN) -- The score looked close, but Spain's domination was all too apparent as the world champions began the Confederations Cup with a 2-1 victory over Uruguay on Sunday. The eight-nation tournament is a warm-up for next year's World Cup in Brazil, but on this evidence Vicente del Bosque's team will once again be favored to lift the trophy. ""It's very difficult to generate any kind of danger when you don't touch the ball,"" said Uruguay striker Luis Suarez, who scored a superb late consolation with a curling free-kick that matched the one by Italy's Andrea Pirlo against Mexico earlier in the day. ""Spain is the best side in the world. They are a candidate to win the World Cup,"" Suarez added. His team trailed after 20 minutes of the Group B opener in Recife when Pedro's volley was diverted into the net by captain Diego Lugano, completely wrongfooting goalkeeper Fernando Muslera. If that effort had a slice of luck, Spain's second in the 32nd minute was straight from the counter-attacking guidebook. Suarez lost the ball deep inside the opposing half, and seconds later it was in the Uruguay net as striker Roberto Soldado finished off a clever pass from Cesc Fabregas which beat the offside trap. With Spain in control, Uruguay's frustrations grew -- and the team which finished fourth at the 2010 World Cup and won the South American title the following year could have gone 3-0 down as Fabregas hit the inside of the post. Suarez, who has been publicly courting a transfer from Liverpool to Real Madrid, showed flashes of the brilliance which made him one of the top scorers in the English Premier League last season. His 88th-minute set-piece was too good for keeper Iker Casillas, who started the match despite being frozen out at Real in 2012-13 under the Spanish club's former coach Jose Mourinho. Italy joined hosts Brazil on three points in Group A after beating Mexico 2-1 at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro. Veteran Juventus midfielder Pirlo celebrated his 100th international appearance with the opening goal in the 27th minute, curling a superb right-foot shot past goalkeeper Jose Corona. Javier Hernandez leveled before halftime from the penalty spot after Andrea Barzagli brought down Giovani dos Santos, but striker Mario Balotelli showed great strength to hold off two defenders and fire a 78th-minute winner. However, he was booked for taking his shirt off in celebration -- earning a rebuke from coach Cesar Prandelli. ""Mario needs to stop showing off his muscles. With celebrations like that, he's only going to pick up pointless yellow cards,"" Prandelli said. ""As for Pirlo, I don't have words to describe what he did today. He's the epitome of football and an example to everyone. He deserves a big round of applause. He gave us the lead and controlled the game."" Mexico coach Manuel de la Torre said his players had hoped to play a cautious game and wear down the four-time World Cup winners. ""But we were up against a great side who were very well organized and made the most of their individual assets. That's what made the difference,"" said De la Torre, whose team suffered a first defeat since August.","Luis Suarez hails Spain after his Uruguay team is beaten 2-1 in Confederations Cup in Brazil .

"(CNN) -- A former policeman is on trial in Kansas, accused of killing his wife and setting their home on fire more than two years ago. Attorneys for Brett Seacat say his wife, Vashti, started the fire and shot herself. But prosecutors say he was upset about the dissolution of their marriage, giving him more than enough motive. On Monday, jurors heard from the Seacats' marriage counselor, CNN affiliate KWCH reported. Connie Suderman testified that Seacat called her just hours after his wife's death in April 2011. ""He said, 'I killed her, Vashti is dead and it's my fault.' That's what he said,"" Suderman said, according to KWCH. The counselor also testified that she met with Vashti Seacat shortly before her death. She purportedly told Suderman she was worried about how her husband was handling their divorce but was happier than she'd been in years. CNN affiliate KSN reported the counselor also testified about a conversation she and Vashti Seacat had about suicide. ""She couldn't do that to her boys. She elaborated by saying that she loved being a mom. She couldn't leave them. They needed her,"" Suderman said. Those sentiments were echoed Monday by Vashti Seacat's friend, Erika Head, who spoke to HLN's Nancy Grace. ""She was very happy with her life, and she knew that things were looking up,"" Head said about Seacat, saying she was ""never, ever"" suicidal. Brett Seacat and the couple's two sons were at home the night of the fire. Prosecutors and the defense differ about exactly what happened. Brett Seacat says he was sleeping downstairs and heard a noise, KWCH reported. Moments later, his wife called him on his cell phone, saying he should get their boys before they got hurt. He then purportedly heard two pops. Brett Seacat went upstairs and saw flames. He reportedly says he found his wife in their bedroom and tried to save her. But prosecutors say Brett Seacat's story doesn't makes sense. For one, he had no soot or blood on him, they say, according to KWCH, and only a small burn on his foot. He and the couple's sons escaped from the blaze unharmed. The Seacats' home in Kingman, Kansas, sits not far from the courthouse where Brett Seacat is standing trial. Despite extensive fire damage, the house still stands; a brick chimney pokes out of the charred remains. ""I'm smart enough that if I wanted to kill my wife ... I could've come up with something better than this,"" Brett Seacat told investigators about the shooting and the fire. ""This is what a crazy person does.""

"(CNN) -- If talking tough on Iran were an Olympic sport, Mitt Romney would win a gold medal after his trip to Israel this week. ""We have a solemn duty and a moral imperative to deny Iran's leaders the means to follow through on their malevolent intentions,"" the presumptive Republican nominee told a staunchly conservative crowd in Jerusalem, vowing that ""no option should be excluded"" in preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Romney's top Middle East adviser, Dan Senor -- formerly George W. Bush's spokesman in Iraq -- also turned a few heads when he appeared to say that a President Romney would give the green light for an Israeli attack on Iran. Opinion: Romney walks a wary line in Jerusalem . Noting that the United States should ""do everything we can"" to prevent the Islamic republic from getting a nuclear capability, Senor then went further. ""And if Israel has to take action on its own, in order to stop Iran from developing that capability, the governor would respect that decision,"" he said. That would represent a real departure from the last two American presidents' policy of seeking to dissuade Israel from taking matters into its own hands, a dangerous move that could set the Middle East ablaze. Was the former Massachusetts governor signaling a new approach? Evidently not. Given an opportunity to repeat Senor's comments, Romney declined -- and his campaign also issued a clarification: ""Gov. Romney believes we should employ any and all measures to dissuade the Iranian regime from its nuclear course, and it is his fervent hope that diplomatic and economic measures will do so. In the final analysis, of course, no option should be excluded. Gov. Romney recognizes Israel's right to defend itself, and that it is right for America to stand with it."" Politics: In Poland, Romney heralds economic freedom . If that sounds an awful lot like Barack Obama's position, it's because it is Obama's position. As he put it in an interview with The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg earlier this year, ""(U)ltimately, the Israeli prime minister and the defense minister and others in the government have to make their decisions about what they think is best for Israel's security, and I don't presume to tell them what is best for them."" Romney argues that Iranian leaders don't take Obama's refrain that ""all options are on the table"" seriously, a situation he apparently believes would change if Americans elected a new president. Maybe so -- Iran did blanch at first in the face of military threat when the United States forcibly ousted Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and withdrew its threat to close the Strait of Hormuz when confronted by stern warnings from top U.S. defense officials. But Obama's rhetoric has been, if more carefully calibrated, just as firm as Romney's. In that same interview with Goldberg, the president pointedly mentioned the military option, and said, ""As president of the United States, I don't bluff."" Politics: Romney aide loses cool, curses at press in Poland . Washington reporters and policy wonks have been playing the ""will they or won't they?"" game on Iran for years. And until recently, the consensus was that Israel and the United States were, in fact, bluffing -- that to get other big powers to go along with tougher sanctions, they had to persuade them that they might indeed attack. But now, that consensus seems to be shifting as Iran nears what Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak calls the ""zone of immunity"" -- when Iran has enough enrichment capability buried safely beyond the reach of Israeli bombs that its program will be impossible for the Jewish state to stop on its own. U.S. military leaders have hinted that the United States has a bit more time; American B-52s and massive bunker-busters can still do the job if it looks like Iran really is about to get the bomb. And given that the International Atomic Energy Agency, for all its doubts about Iran's intentions, has never conclusively determined that Iran wants the weapon, it may be years before we reach that point, if ever. Politics: Palestinians protest Romney statements as 'racist' Still, diplomacy and sanctions have yet to show that they can change the calculus of Iran's leaders. The Islamic republic has been isolated from the world economy for three decades. It suffered through a devastating war with Iraq in which it sent unarmed children barefoot across landmines. This is not a country that buckles easily under pressure. And at this point, given how politicized this showdown has become, it's hard to imagine a deal that both sides can accept. Here, again, the differences between Romney and Obama don't really matter -- Romney has ruled out any enrichment whatsoever, while Obama will accept some -- because neither is good enough to pass muster in Tehran. The last hope for peace may be a kind of tacit agreement: Iran does not cross any red lines, and we do not bomb. In other words, a lot like the tenuous arrangement we have now. But how long can it last? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Blake Hounshell.","Blake Hounshell: Mitt Romney talks tough about Iran, nuclear weapons on his Israel trip .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Baratunde Thurston says that, sometimes, comedy is no laughing matter. ""I met an Iranian revolutionary leader last year and he gave me a hug and thanked me for what we do,"" said Thurston, who counts the role of digital editor at news-satire site The Onion among his many comedic credits. Thurston was a keynote speaker Saturday at the South by Southwest Interactive festival here. In an (appropriately) interactive presentation that came complete with suggested Twitter hashtags, Thurston made a passionate case for humor as an important way to make sense of a sometimes confusing and overwhelming world. The near limitless power of the Web sometimes devolves into the cluttered ""Internet of crap,"" he said. At other times, he added, the fast-paced digital age can leave people feeling lost. ""With all this noise and confusion, we look to institutions for trust and they often come up short,"" he said. "" Government is trying to shut it down. Religion -- missing in action. Your parents are awkwardly texting you. And the media is busy talking about the state of the media. ""So, who's left? You've got comics, willing to speak truth to the youth and beyond."" Thurston highlighted satirical TV shows, websites and Web videos that have sprung up in places like Egypt, China and Nigeria, where more traditional media is kept under tight reins. He showed video from an ""Onion""-like satire show from Iran, then photos he said were of Iranian authorities ripping people's satellite dishes off of their roofs so they couldn't watch it. ""You can almost measure the freedom of a society by its reaction to the satirists,"" he said. ""How weak is your government when this is what you have to resort to to get things done?"" Thurston, author of the recently published satirical take on race, ""How to Be Black,"" began his presentation by telling stories about his family: His ex-slave great-grandfather who taught himself to read; his grandmother who was the first black employee at the U.S. Supreme Court building; and his mother, who, later on in the 1960s, protested outside that same building. He tied a point about technology and satire to that story, saying that humorists of today need to be intimately involved in the technology used to share their work. ""This is all about freedom,"" he said. ""This is about the new act of teaching yourself to read ... . We need this level of production and creation to make sense of the world.""","SXSW keynote speaker: Humor ""speaks truth"" in a confusing digital world .

"(CNN) -- Count by count, Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales on Wednesday admitted to gunning down 16 civilians in a 2012 rampage through two villages near his outpost in southern Afghanistan. Bales pleaded guilty to more than 30 criminal charges, including 16 premeditated murder counts, in a hearing before a military judge. He admitted to slipping away from his outpost in southern Afghanistan and going on a house-to-house killing spree in two nearby villages in March 2012, a massacre that further strained ties between American troops and their Afghan allies. The move spares the 39-year-old Bales the prospect of a death sentence in the killings. But he was unable to offer the judge, Col. Jeffery Nance, an explanation for his actions. ""I've asked that question a million times since then. There's not a good reason in the world for the horrible things I did,"" Bales replied, according to Drew Mikkelson of CNN affilliate KING, who was tweeting from the courtroom. Wednesday's hearing was held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Tacoma, Washington. Both Nance and Lt. Gen. Robert Brown, commander of the Army's I Corps, have approved the plea agreement, said Lt. Col. Gary Dangerfield, a spokesman for the installation. Bales now faces life in prison, but a jury of four officers and two enlisted personnel will decide whether he will have a chance at parole, Dangerfield said. Nance set sentencing for August 19. ""Sergeant Bales has been waiting for the day that he can accept responsibility for what he has done -- the day that he can give, hopefully, some sense of peace to the people who are the victims of this tragedy, to his own family and to the soldiers who are still serving in Afghanistan,"" defense attorney Emma Scanlan said after the hearing. ""That has been his purpose from the beginning, and that remains what he wants from this."" In addition to the murder counts, Bales pleaded guilty to six counts of attempted murder, seven of assault and the use of illicit steroids and alcohol, but pleaded not guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice. Bales is a member of the Army's 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an element of the 2nd Infantry Division. His attorneys have said the service made a mistake in assigning Bales to another combat tour despite evidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and a traumatic brain injury suffered during a combat tour in Iraq. In the penalty hearings, Scanlan said the defense also will argue that Bales' problems were also fueled by drugs and alcohol provided by Special Operations troops at his outpost before the killings. ""We know all of those things to be true, as does the government,"" Scanlan told reporters after the hearing. ""You take that with somebody on their fourth deployment and the stresses of combat, and we get in some parts of the situation we are in today."" But Scanlan added, ""There's no justification"" for the massacre. ""He doesn't have one, and neither do we."" Lawyer: Specials ops troops gave accused killer alcohol, steroids . U.S. and allied troops invaded Afghanistan in 2001 in response to the September 11 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion quickly routed Afghanstan's ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but the Taliban regrouped and have mounted a guerrilla war against the allied-backed government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai ever since. More than 2,200 Americans and nearly 1,100 allied troops have been killed since the war began in October 2001. Nearly 15,000 civilians have died since 2007, the United Nations reported in February. The United States plans to remove combat troops from the country by the end of 2014.

"(WIRED) -- The holidays are over, and the slew of smartphone debuts at the Consumer Electronics Show have come and gone. It's now safe for retailers and carriers to start dropping prices on 2011 and early 2012 smartphone inventory, and that's great news for those looking for a good deal. Since CES has ended, a number of smartphones are now available at very affordable prices. You'd be safe, nay, smart to pick up one of these options if you're looking to make the big switch from a feature phone to a smart device, or perhaps you recently bore witness to the death of your Droid in a wave of spilled beer. If you're itching to try a Windows Phone for the first time, you're in luck. The Nokia Lumia 710 went on sale January 11 for a budget-friendly $50, and is now available for only a penny from Costco, with the purchase of a T-Mobile data plan (which can be had for as cheap as $50 a month). The 3.7-inch, more spec-ed out Lumia 800 hasn't had a U.S. launch date announced yet, and the new 4.3-inch Lumia 900 will land sometime ""in the coming months,"" representatives said. Motorola dropped the price of its ultra-thin 16GB Droid Razr from $300 to $200, with contract from Verizon. The cheaper price tag dumps the 16GB microSD that previously came bundled with the phone, but if you still need that extra storage, you can pick up your own microSD for around $10. Why the price cut on a phone that just launched in November? In Motorola's case, it's time to make room for the new kid in town, the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, which will be available starting January 26. It's essentially the same phone, only the Maxx has way better battery life. The Samsung Infuse 4G, which launched this summer with a brilliant 4.5-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen, is on sale at AT&T for a mere penny through January 24. And Apple's iPhone 3GS is always just 99 cents (with contract) on AT&T. At Verizon, the Droid Pro and Droid 3 are also on sale, priced at $0 and $100, respectively. With the Sony Xperia S rumored to arrive January 30, it wouldn't be surprising if prices on 2011 Sony handset prices start dropping soon. If you're in the market for a new smartphone, and none of these models tickle your fancy, keep your eyes open: There will definitely be more smartphone steals over the next few weeks as 2012 smartphone models start landing on store shelves.

"(CNN) -- Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's controversial president, is under a European Union travel ban, but he arrived in Italy for the inauguration of Pope Francis on Monday. The much reviled leader can skirt the EU travel ban if he enters Italy on religious grounds, the Italian Foreign Ministry said Monday. Mugabe and a delegation traveled to Rome, Italy's capital, and will head to the Vatican, a separate state, for the Tuesday ceremony. The 89-year-old, in power for decades, visited the Vatican in 2011 for the beatification of the late Pope John Paul II. He attended that pope's funeral in 2005. A day of prayer, song, pomp to welcome new pope . In power for decades, he has been sharply criticized for rights abuses and turning the nation from a breadbasket into a financial basket case. The presence of a man widely regarded as a brutal dictator, juxtaposed with a pope who preaches peace, has raised eyebrows. Vincent Nichols, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Westminster, who attended the 2011 ceremony, said, according to the Daily Mail, that Mugabe's record on human rights was deplorable and ""it felt uncomfortable to be in his presence."" Controversy erupted in 2005, when Britain's Prince Charles found himself seated near Mugabe at the funeral and at one point shook his hand. A spokesman for the prince later said that was a mistake, that Charles was caught by surprise after Mugabe offered his hand. The Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said last week that the Holy See did not formally invite diplomatic missions to attend the Mass, instead simply informing countries through diplomatic channels that the event is taking place. The pope's four biggest challenges . Even countries with which the Vatican does not have diplomatic relations, such as Saudi Arabia, are informed of major events such as the installation or funeral of a pope, he said. The Vatican Press Office said it could not yet provide a full list of attendees for the ceremony. The Bernini Bristol Hotel in Rome confirms it has hotel reservations for a Zimbabwean delegation but did not provide names. Mugabe arrived amid political turmoil in Zimbabwe. Police raided an office of Zimbabwe's prime minister on Sunday. Four officials with the office are accused of impersonating police, Zimbabwe police spokeswoman Charity Charamba told reporters. The raid came a day after a national referendum to approve a new constitution that would impose presidential term limits for the first time in Zimbabwe. The results of the vote are not yet known, and it came just a few months before Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai is expected to run against Mugabe in presidential elections. The two leaders entered a power-sharing agreement in 2009 . If approved, which is highly likely, the new constitution will give more powers to the parliament and limit the president's. It also introduces a two-term limit of five years each for a president. But the limit would not apply retroactively, which means Mugabe could have 10 more years as head of state if he is re-elected.

"Washington (CNN) -- ATF Deputy Director William Hoover has resigned, just days after a congressional report on Operation Fast and Furious sharply criticized him and four other ATF officials for the botched gun-trafficking operation. Hoover officially retired from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on Tuesday, according to two senior ATF officials. Hoover and his boss, Ken Melson, who was acting director of the ATF at the time, were re-assigned last year in a shake-up ordered by Attorney General Eric Holder. Melson remains with the Justice Department. Timeline: Operation Fast and Furious scandal . Hoover was serving as an assistant to the new ATF deputy director when he submitted his retirement papers Monday, officials said. A report last week by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, laid much of the blame for the failed gun-running probe on Melson and Hoover in Washington, and three ATF officials in Arizona. A detailed investigation by the Justice inspector general is expected later this month, and Holder has vowed that he will take action, if warranted, against individuals found culpable in the investigation. The controversy over Fast and Furious erupted after two of an estimated 1,400 missing weapons lost by the ATF in Mexico, were discovered at the scene of the murder of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. The ATF's planned sting operation to track weapons illegally purchased by straw purchasers bound for a Mexico drug cartel proved disastrous when ATF agents lost track of hundreds of weapons after they crossed the Mexican border. Holder and his top lieutenants have been on the defensive over the bungled operation that was mounted by one of the Justice Department's agencies. Holder has forcefully ended the practice of allowing guns ""to walk"" in the hands of illegal purchasers with the intent of tracking weapons to cartels.","The ATF's Operation Fast and Furious lost track of hundreds of weapons in Mexico .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has launched three astronauts into orbit for the country's fifth and longest crewed mission in its burgeoning space exploration program. The Shenzhou 10 spaceship and its launcher, a Long March-2F rocket, blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert on Tuesday. It will dock with the Tiangong-1 space module and the crew will transfer supplies to the space lab, which has been in orbit since September 2011. During the 15-day mission, the crew will master the rendezvous and docking capabilities that are essential for the operation of a manned space platform. ""The functionality, performance, and coordination of all systems will be evaluated during this mission,"" Wu Ping, a spokesperson for China's Manned Space Program, told a news conference on Monday. Humans in space . She added that another main objective of the mission was to test technologies related to the construction of a space station, as China seeks to establish a long-term human presence in space. China has stepped up the pace of its space program since first sending astronaut Yang Liwei into orbit in 2003. In 2012, it conducted 18 space launches, according to the Pentagon. The most recent manned mission last year carried its first female astronaut and was the first to make a manual docking with the space module. The crew for this mission will also include a woman, Wang Yaping, and two male astronauts, Nie Haisheng and Zhang Xiaoguang. ""These longer duration missions and space dockings are essential practice for any kind of long-term, more permanent presence in space or a mission to, say, the moon,"" said Dean Cheng, a research fellow at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation. Timeline: China's race into space . Growing power . China's march into space underscores the country's growing financial and military clout and has unsettled some Western observers. A 92-page report on Chinese military development released by the Pentagon last month highlighted the advances in China's space capabilities. ""China is developing a multi-dimensional program to improve its capabilities to limit or prevent the use of space-based assets by adversaries during times of crisis or conflict,"" the report said. A spokeswoman for China's manned space missions said last year the program would cost a total of almost 40 billion yuan (US$6.27 billion). The U.S. closed its space shuttle program in 2011 and is no longer aggressively pursuing manned space exploration, leaving Russia and China as the only two countries in the world capable of independently sending humans into space. ""In some ways, they have overtaken the US, at least temporarily,"" says the Heritage Foundation's Cheng. ""Of course, the US, and even more Russia, have more experience in manned space. China is not, at this time, capable of reaching the Moon."" ""But like the tortoise and the hare, China is slowly catching up with the US."" However, Cheng says that China is not engaged in a space race with the US. Rather: ""They have a long-term plan, and they are sticking to it."" Private space ambitions . Companies like Boeing, Space X and Virgin Galactic are scrambling to develop private sector spacecraft and operate in what has previously been the exclusive preserve of sovereign nations. China is not part of the project that maintains the International Space Station (ISS), which currently orbits the Earth conducting experiments in a range of fields, from physics to astronomy. The ISS is a joint venture between NASA, Russia's RKA space agency, Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency and the Canadian CSA. China views its multi-billion dollar space program as a way to raise prestige both domestically and abroad. This is the first high-profile space launch since new leader Xi Jinping assumed the presidency in March. Public reaction to the planned mission was mixed, with some users of the Twitter-like Weibo platform wishing the astronauts well, while others said the resources were best used on the ground. ""Our country may be lagging behind in other areas, but China has great achievement in aerospace technology,"" said one user with the handle @Jiniaobieliulin. ""The government should spend more money to help those of lowest social status,"" said another user identified as @Xiaoxiaojuna. Katie Hunt wrote and reported from Hong Kong.

"Cairo (CNN) -- As questions continued to swirl about the fate of three American college students arrested in Egypt for their role in ongoing protests there, a U.S. official said that diplomats were also in contact with Egyptian authorities about an award-winning filmmaker behind bars. The three college students -- Derrik Sweeney, Gregory Porter and Luke Gates -- were ordered to be released Thursday, said Adel Saeed, the spokesman of the general prosecutor. But late in the day, they remained in custody. There was less clarity, meanwhile, about documentarian Jehane Noujaim. Film producer Karim Amer said Wednesday that the Egyptian-American woman -- whose works include ""The Control Room,"" about Al-Jazeera and the United States during the early days of the Iraq War -- was arrested while filming close to the Interior Ministry building in Cairo. On Thursday, David Lynfield -- a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Cairo -- said that U.S. diplomats are aware of ""her place in detention"" and have been ""in touch with the Egyptian authorities regarding"" her case. Meanwhile, family and friends of the three detained U.S. college students continued to ride an emotional roller coaster, days after Egyptian authorities arrested them on suspicion of throwing Molotov cocktails during a protest in Cairo. All had been attending American University in Cairo on a semester-long, study-abroad program. The prosecutor's office told CNN earlier Thursday that the trio had already been released. But late in the day, a friend of the students said they could remain in custody for a few more days. Drew Harper, a 22-year-old film student from New York who has been in Cairo for three months, said the students said they were in good spirits and cited a bureaucratic slowdown for their continuing detention. The erroneous news that they had already been freed was initially embraced by Joy Sweeney, whose son Derrik is among the three. ""We are just so blessed and so grateful right now,"" she told CNN. ""I can't wait to give him a big hug."" The students were to be taken to a physician for a medical examination, then back to the police station for paperwork to be processed, and finally to their dorm rooms, she said. The Egyptian attorney general would not appeal the trio's release, she added. The family is keen for Derrik to return home as soon as possible, for his own safety, Joy Sweeney added. Roberto Powers, the U.S. consul general in Egypt, advised that as the three students' pictures had been plastered all over the media, ""it wouldn't be safe or prudent for them to remain in the country,"" the mother said. She said her son told her Wednesday in a telephone call that ""they had done nothing wrong."" Sweeney, 19, is a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri; Porter, 19, from Glenside, Pennsylvania, attends Drexel University in Philadelphia; and Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana, goes to Indiana University. Their arrests came amid persistent protests against Egypt's ruling military council in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Security forces have clashed with the demonstrators repeatedly in recent days, though a relative calm fell over the square on Thursday. The same day, Egypt's military leaders apologized for the 38 deaths nationwide and vowed to prosecute offenders and pay the medical bills of those injured. Some 3,250 had been hurt by Thursday, said Hisham Shiha of Egypt's Health Ministry. Harper told CNN some media reports had inaccurately portrayed the detained students as irresponsible. Harper described the three as intelligent, well-informed and nonviolent. ""I don't believe for one second that those Molotov cocktails belonged to the boys,"" he said. He accused the Egyptian military of wanting to ""pin the recent violence on foreigners"" and said they had wrongly accused the three Americans. Saeed, the prosecutor's spokesman, said Wednesday that a bag filled with empty bottles, a bottle of gasoline, a towel and a camera had been found with the three American students. ""They denied the bag belonged to them and said it belonged to two of their friends,"" Saeed said. Journalists Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Ian Lee in Cairo and CNN's Devon Sayers in Atlanta contributed to this report.","Prosecutors gave to police a ""release order"" for 3 detained students, a spokesman says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States' first couple welcomed their Mexican counterparts Wednesday to the second state dinner of the Obama administration, a night of pomp and ceremony that both leaders hope will demonstrate the important relationship between the North American neighbors. President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, dressed in a flowing blue gown, welcomed Mexican President Felipe Calderon and his wife at the White House steps as a military honor guard saluted and media cameras clicked and whirred. In an unrehearsed moment, a White House aide slipped while walking out with the Obamas before their guests arrived, and both the president and first lady immediately called out, ""Don't take that picture,"" to the media gallery. The more than 200 invited guests, including diplomats, White House officials and celebrities, including actresses Whoopi Goldberg and Eva Longoria-Parker, arrived through a separate entrance for the Mexican-themed dinner and musical performances. Later, the two leaders started the dinner in the East Room by toasting the U.S.-Mexico partnership and their effort to fulfill the dreams of their nations' children. Obama laced his toast with some playful remarks, mentioning Mexico's contributions to arts and science along with ""some very good food, including the food of the gods, chocolate."" At another point, Obama prompted laughter with a joke aimed at Mexico's passion for soccer, noting the nation had, like the United States, ""a pretty good soccer team."" ""In the fight for your country's future, you have shown extraordinary courage, extraordinary bravery, and you and the Mexican people have a full and committed partner in the United States,"" Obama said. Calderon thanked his hosts, twice making special reference to the charm of the first lady, and emphasized the friendship and partnership between the two countries. ""We work with the certainty of what is good for the United States of American is good for Mexico, and if we understand this, at the same time what is good for Mexico is good for the United States,"" Calderon said. He concluded by responding to Obama's reference to Mexican poet Octavio Paz's sentiment that people must deserve their dreams. ""Both of us have dream,"" Calderon said, looking at Obama. ""Those dreams are related to our people, and we try every day to deserve those dreams and we will reach them."" The White House promised enhanced security measures to keep out the uninvited. At the first state dinner, in November, gate-crashers shook hands with the president. Wednesday night's dinner was the eighth state dinner honoring Mexico, all since 1967, reflecting the growing importance of the U.S. southern neighbor in the past half-century. Guests sat at tables for 10, some rectangular and some round. The head table with both first couples seated 20 people, including Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Tables were covered in boldly striped linens made in three hues of blue, intended to resemble ripples of water, the White House said. Floral centerpieces featured gilded handmade woven baskets, with bouquets of fuchsia flowers, including roses, orchids and prickly pear cactus. The china, from the White House collection, was from the Clinton and Eisenhower presidencies for a meal accenting both American and Mexican cuisine. Guests dined on jicama and fruit in a citrus vinaigrette and ceviche of Hawaiian opah, followed by Oregon beef in Oaxacan black mole with black bean tamalon and grilled green beans. Dessert was a chocolate cajeta tart with toasted homemade marshmallows, graham cracker crumble and goat cheese ice cream. After the meal, the diners will move into a tent erected on the South Lawn to be joined by additional guests for performances by pop star Beyonce and Mexican performers Rodrigo y Gabriela, along with the President's Own United States Marine Band. Tables in the tent were decorated in natural shades of oranges and greens, with a bouquet of marzipan and chocolate flowers: roses, the national flower of the United States, and dahlias, the national flower of Mexico. The tent also featured artistically rendered Monarch butterflies hanging in the air in a tribute to Calderon's birthplace of Michoacan, Mexico. ""The Monarch butterfly is the queen of butterflies, because every winter it flies down from Canada to Michoacan, my homeland, looking for the warmth of the Mexican people,"" Calderon said in brief remarks, again thanking his hosts. Obama paid tribute to the musical traditions of both nations and said he hoped to get Calderon and his wife out on the dance floor later in the evening.","More than 200 people to attend dinner in honor of Mexican president .

"Waco, Texas (CNN) -- A row of 12 coffins, each draped with a flag, symbolizes the human cost of an explosion that destroyed much of a small Texas town and left the residents of that town searching for answers. Hundreds of firefighters from across the nation and other first-responders joined grieving families and President Barack Obama and the first lady at the Ferrell Center in Waco, site of a memorial service Thursday for some of the people killed in a fertilizer plant explosion last week in the nearby town of West. The president told the crowd that no words adequately describe the courage displayed by those who died. ""What I can do is offer the love and support and prayers of the nation,"" Obama said. Obama told the families and friends of the those killed that they were not forgotten, saying ""our hearts have been here in your time of tribulation."" He promised them the nation will help them rebuild and reclaim their small community of about 3,000 people. Before the president and first lady Michelle Obama joined the residents of West at the service at Baylor University, the president's helicopter flew over West and circled several times over the flattened structures and scarred earth. The Obamas met privately with the families after the service. Texas Gov. Rick Perry promised the families of the first-responders who died that their loved ones would not be forgotten. ""First-responders know better than anyone that there's no such thing as a routine emergency,"" Perry told the crowd, ""but it didn't slow them down as they raced toward that burning factory."" Perry urged the families to remember that ""the spirit that drove those men we love -- they live on"" and asked the crowd to ""let their deeds serve as an inspiration"" to service of others. The families of the victims recorded emotional video tributes that were played during the service. Some were somber, some were mixed with light-hearted memories. All drew tears. ""Cyrus always hated the word 'hero,'"" said Bryce Reed, whose brother was attending a EMT class when the fire that preceded the explosion began. ""He and I shared the belief that heroes are persons (whose names) are etched in marble. And that a hero is a sacred and solemn term reserved for only those who paid the ultimate price when others would falter or run. ""My brother would disagree, but I firmly believe that all privy to this incident can attest that my brother and all those who lay with him are heroes now and forever."" Earlier, as the service began, everyone in the arena stood in complete silence as family and friends of the victims filed in. Some of the family members wept as they passed the flag-draped coffins -- 10 with American flags and two with Texas flags -- and photos in front of each one. Family members hugged one another when they arrived at their seats. The service -- which honored the 10 first-responders killed April 17 and two friends of first-responders who also answered the call -- included roll call as the name of each victim was read, followed by one toll from a bell. An officer at the foot of each coffin saluted. Then the bell rang five times, paused, rang five more times, paused again, and rang a final five times to signal the fallen had answered their final call. Each family was given a flag and a helmet in remembrance. A bagpiper played ""Amazing Grace."" In all, 14 people were killed by the blast, including two other people who died in their apartment nearby. Before Thursday's service, emotions were raw in Waco, the central Texas city about 20 miles south of the scene of the blast. Many onlookers cried as they lined the street outside as a procession of fire trucks slowly passed. One man held a large Texas flag, bowed his head and rested a cowboy hat over his heart. Hundreds of bikers from the Patriot Guard stood at attention as the rescue vehicles passed by. Before leaving Washington, Obama signed a proclamation ordering all flags in the state to be flown at half-staff for the day. City workers from Waco replaced West workers Thursday so they could attend funerals and take a break from trying to repair the city's water system and cleaning up the town. On Wednesday, an American flag was raised and a bugler played taps at a memorial service at the blast site. A few miles away, one of the victims, Kenneth ""Luckey"" Harris Jr., was laid to rest. Harris, a 52-year-old Dallas firefighter who lived in West, was one of the first-responders who died. One of the coffins at Thursday's service represented Harris. Hundreds of firefighters from Dallas and other areas surrounding West came for the funeral, the first to be held for the responders killed in the blast. Firefighters lined the sidewalk as Harris' flag-draped coffin was carried out and loaded into the back of a Dallas fire truck to be carried to the cemetery. Bagpipes played as the coffin went through the crowd. Before and after: Texas plant explosion . The investigation continues . ""Shovel by shovel,"" investigators are combing through the charred remains of the leveled fertilizer distributor after the April 17 explosion in West. Much of the landscape surrounding the West Fertilizer Co. is unrecognizable. What was once a corn silo appears to have crumpled from the blast. A blue tarp covers the shell of a rail car. A crater nearly 100 feet wide and 10 feet deep sits where a building once stood. The crater is now filled with mangled metal and crumbs of mortar. Concrete chunks, some the size of shopping carts, are strewn hundreds of yards away from the blast site. Losses from the explosion will probably top $100 million, said Mark Hanna, a spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas. But amid the devastation, forensic mappers are hoping to find clues. Hundreds of small pink flags indicate anything on the ground that crews want forensic investigators to take a closer look at. Officials face a difficult task in reconstructing the fire that preceded the deadly explosion. Still unknown: what types of chemicals and in what quantities were stored at the facility. Town devastated by explosion is guided by the West way . Putting the pieces together . One official likened the investigation to a jigsaw puzzle. ""Right now, think of that coffee table where all 100 pieces are gathered around,"" Brian Hoback, an official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told the San Antonio Express-News. ""Now, we're going to pull them together."" Robert Champion, special agent in charge of the bureau's Dallas Field Division, said that determining what started the initial fire is key. ""We feel the explosion was caused by the fire, so we've got to determine what the cause and the origin of the fire was, and that's why we're ... attempting to re-enact that fire scene,"" he said. ""A fire scene is complicated in itself. But you compound that with an explosion, and it really complicates the issue."" Investigators have ruled out the possibility that natural causes ignited the fire. CNN's Todd Sperry and John Murgatroyd contributed from Waco, Texas, and Steve Almasy and Ed Payne wrote and reported from Atlanta.","NEW: Brother of firefighter says fallen are heroes forever .

"(CNN) -- Crowds gathered at the headquarters of a Chinese newspaper on Monday, in support of a rare protest by journalists against alleged government censorship. The journalists at the Southern Weekly paper, based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, claim that an editorial calling for political reform was censored by and re-written as a tribute to Communist Party rule. Photos published by the South China Morning Post and circulated on China's most popular microblogging site Sina Weibo showed dozens of people gathering outside the paper's headquarters, some holding posters calling for press freedom. One journalist from Southern Media Group, which owns Southern Weekly, told CNN that colleagues joined the protest to express their outrage. ""We stand up now because we were pushed to the limit,"" the journalist, who asked to remain anonymous, said. Some journalists have threatened to strike. If it goes ahead, it would be the first time an editorial staff of a major Chinese newspaper has openly staged a strike in more than two decades, the South China Morning Post reported. The controversy emerged last week when a group of former Southern Weekly journalists said, in an open letter, that a local propaganda chief had dramatically altered the paper's traditional New Year message, according to a translation published by the China Media Project at Hong Kong University. While newspapers in China are often subject to censorship, the journalists wrote in the letter that the changes were excessive, and took place after editors had signed off on the final proofs. The letter also said that the official had introduced factual errors. A spokesperson from the Guangdong government declined to comment on the incident. Hundreds held in China for spreading doomsday rumors . The controversy intensified over the weekend after a second open letter signed by prominent scholars from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan called for the local propaganda official to step down. On Sunday, Southern Weekly journalists disputed a statement released by their employer. The statement from the paper told readers that the New Year greeting was written by a staff member and the online allegations that a propaganda official had interfered in the paper's editorial were false. It also apologized for the errors in the article. However, Wu Wei, the executive officer for the paper's new media department, said he had surrendered the password to the paper's official microblog account to the newspaper's management. ""I'm not responsible for the statement to be published on that account and whatever is published in the future,"" he said in a post on his personal Weibo account that was later deleted. The furor has dented hopes that China's next president, Xi Jinping, might usher in an era of greater openness for Chinese media. Doug Young, who teaches journalism at Fudan University in Shanghai, said that China's Propaganda Ministry was on guard as the country's new leadership prepares to take the reins later this year. The alleged censorship at Southern Weekly also comes as Guangdong, the province where the paper is based, gets a new leader. The previous party secretary, Wang Yang, who was promoted, was seen as being tolerant toward the media, Young said. ""Whenever you have a new person coming in the tendency is always towards conservatism,"" said Young, whose book ""The Party Line"" examines the role media plays in shaping public opinion in China. ""It's a changing of the guard both in Guangdong and in Beijing."" China blocks New York Times website . Online censors deleted all comments added to Southern Weekly's statement and searches for the four characters that make up Southern Weekly's Chinese name have been blocked from Weibo searches since Friday. However, some photos of Monday's protest outside the paper's headquarters could still be found online. The Communist Party-backed newspaper Global Times published an editorial on Monday morning that was critical of the Southern Weekly journalists. ""In the social and political environment of today's China, the so-called free media cannot exist,"" it said. ""Even in Western countries, the mainstream media will not choose to openly confront the government. To do so in China, there will certainly be losers."" To express their support for the paper's journalists, some Weibo users switched their profile photo to a black-and-white image of the newspaper's logo.

"(CNN) -- A recent CNN.com op-ed asked ""Was the Shell Oil hoax ethical?"" We at Greenpeace, along with the activist group Yes Men, are behind the Shell Oil website ArcticReady.com, which we created to call attention to the company's Arctic destruction. So we were intrigued by this question. The writer, Paul Root Wolpe, director of the Center for Ethics at Emory University, said the spoof website did not announce itself as a parody and that omission could be called misrepresentation. And that could possibly be called unethical. But we revealed our role just hours after the site went up, and the site is so over-the-top -- it has a kids' game called ""Angry Bergs"" -- that people realize very quickly that it is fake. But mispresentation is Wolpe's concern, which is why he should have addressed the ethics of Shell's multibillion-dollar international hoax perpetrated on Earth itself. A hoax the company has failed to reveal to the public. Royal Dutch Shell made $31 billion in profits last year, while its CEO took home $15 million in compensation during one of the worst economic crises in a century. The company's lobbyists in Washington, London and other global capitals work to slow the development of clean technologies and renewable energy, preferring instead a status quo that benefits their shareholders and leaves the massive costs of climate change to the 99%. And yet Shell proudly advertises itself as a corporation deeply concerned with developing clean energy and ensuring a viable energy future, even going to great lengths to organize well-branded ""eco-marathons"" completely at odds with its relentless fossil fuel extraction. In the Arctic, the oil giant is exploiting melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil causing global warming in the first place. All of this is happening despite clear evidence from the best scientists that global warming is already causing extreme weather events and it's only likely to get worse. In the past few weeks, Shell's communications team has been busy trying to spin its way out of a series of recent crises, but it can't change the facts. The Shell fleet's 14,000-ton drill ship in Alaska, the Discoverer, slipped anchor two weeks ago. The same drill ship can't meet the Clean Air Act standards the company agreed to earlier this year, and so Shell is asking the EPA to bend the rules at the 11th hour. An oil spill response barge, the Arctic Challenger, which Shell promised the U.S. Coast Guard was ""Arctic ready,"" is in Washington state, beset with technical problems. The company plays down these events and seeks to reassure investors that these major errors are par for the course, but these systematic attempts to mislead the public are clearly unethical. Shell has been relentlessly conducting its own PR campaign to distort the truth about what the company is doing in the Arctic. To get the truth out, we wanted to make a website that imagined a world in which Shell was a little less guarded about the implications of drilling for oil in Alaska. We asked ourselves: What if Shell really did ask people what they thought? What would that look like? We came up with ArcticReady.com. The response has been staggering -- nearly 4 million page views, 12,000 user-generated ads and a cascade of tweets. This reaction from the public shows Shell has serious problems in the court of public opinion, and that it ignores Arctic defenders at its peril. By using the most popular form of contemporary communication -- social media -- to bypass Shell's billions, our supporters undermined the company's social license to operate and brought global attention to its greed and willful ignorance of science.

People clearly want an opportunity to tell Shell what they think of the company's Arctic drilling program, and our site has provided them with a voice. It's also highlighted some of the major environmental issues with Arctic drilling that have been green-washed away.  For example, the U.S. granted Shell an ""incidental harassment permit"" allowing the company to work near whales and seals while drilling this summer, which could interfere with their breathing, breeding and nursing.  To put this issue forward, we created an online ""Mercy Poll"" in which users can vote for which Arctic mammal they'd like Shell to harass the least as a funny way to draw attention to these brutal facts. But Shell and its sympathizers would like people to talk about Greenpeace and the Yes Men rather than what the company is doing in the Arctic. That's fine. We welcome the discussion. As Wolpe himself says, ""Let's keep it clean, everyone -- tell us who you are, and then take your best shot.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama sought to reassure and inspire Bostonians reeling from the deadly marathon bombing, telling them that America stood with their grieving city and promised: ""We'll keep going. We will finish the race."" With Holy Cross Cathedral packed with first responders, families of victims, political luminaries past and present, and members of the public, Obama called Thursday's interfaith service a chance to ""mourn and measure our loss."" Standing at the podium, he said the bombing, being investigated as a terrorist act, was personal for millions of Americans who, in a myriad of ways, identify with the Hub. ""Every one of us stands with you,"" he said. ""Boston may be your hometown -- but we claim it, too."" Injecting the experiences of he and his wife, Michelle, as law students just across the Charles River at Harvard and as a rising political figure at the 2004 Democratic convention, Obama said Boston's spirit remains ""undaunted and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed."" The moment is something Obama, like other presidents before him, has become familiar with in the wake of national tragedy. Among disasters on Obama's watch: A tornado in Joplin, Missouri, and mass shootings at Fort Hood, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Aurora, Colorado, and last December's school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Consoler-in-chief is a role modern presidents have become accustomed to filling, said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""It's an important role for presidents,"" Zelizer said. ""Part of what the country wants is a figure who gets us through a particular crisis."" Obama's appearance at Boston's main Catholic church and visits with some of those injured at hospitals was an inflection point between the tragic chaos of three days ago and the intensifying investigation, which entered a new phase on Thursday with the release of a video by authorities showing two men they call suspects. ""We come together to pray and mourn and measure our loss,"" Obama said. ""But we also come together today to reclaim that state of grace -- to reaffirm that the spirit of this city is undaunted and the spirit of this country shall remain undimmed."" The service was attended by Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican rival in last year's election and a former Massachusetts governor and a Boston-based business executive. ""I thought the president gave a superb address to the people of this city and the state and the nation,"" Romney said. ""It was an inspiring day."" Obama's tone on Thursday was markedly different from the day before when he invoked the memory of mass shooting victims following a setback in the Senate for gun control priorities he supported. He called that legislative outcome ""a pretty shameful day in Washington."" Obama has been frustrated many times on the legislative front since taking office in 2009, but it has never hampered his ability to communicate to the public that he is in control, Zelizer said. ""There's a little bit of a preacher in him and that's something that has always drawn some people to him,"" Zelizer said. ""It gets more powerful and poignant as the speech goes forward."" And as he has on previous occasions when tasked with rallying mourners, Obama vowed that the nation's spirit remains undaunted. ""Of that I have no doubt, you will run again,"" Obama said to applause in Boston as he projected optimism. ""You will run again, because that's what the people of Boston are made of."" ""We'll keep going. We will finish the race.""","Obama has had to offer words to a grieving nation on several occasions .

"(CNN) -- Venezuela's top election official said Thursday that authorities will complete a 100% audit of votes cast in Sunday's presidential election. Tibisay Lucena, president of Venezuela's National Electoral Council, said officials decided on the audit after a lengthy debate. Officials had already audited 54% of ballot boxes, and now will audit the remaining 46%, she said. READ MORE: Why Venezuela is so divided . The decision comes after opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski filed complaints with election officials about thousands of alleged violations during Sunday's vote. ""The electoral power is making this decision in order to preserve a climate of harmony between Venezuelans, but also to isolate violent sectors that are irresponsibly trying to harm democracy,"" Lucena said. Capriles said he accepted the council's decision Thursday because he believes that the problems his campaign spotted would be detected in the audit of the remaining 46%. ""I want to congratulate our people, because this was your fight,"" Capriles said late Thursday. Earlier this week, Lucena certified the election results and declared Nicolas Maduro president-elect, despite Capriles' calls for a vote-by-vote recount. Maduro secured 50.8% of votes in Sunday's election, while Capriles won 49%, election officials said earlier this week. Maduro is scheduled to be sworn in at a ceremony in Caracas on Friday. It was unclear late Thursday whether the audit would impact plans for his inauguration. The audit will take about 30 days and will involve comparing results from voting machines with printed reports and registries containing voters' signatures, Venezuelan constitutional lawyer Jose Vicente Haro told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. At the time of the electoral council's announcement, the president-elect was in Lima, Peru, where South American presidents were in an emergency meeting to discuss Venezuela's elections. The narrow vote margin has sparked mounting tensions in Venezuela after the closely watched election to pick Hugo Chavez's successor to the presidency. Venezuela's state-run AVN news agency said at least eight people have been killed in postelection violence across the country. The government news agency tied the deaths to opposition protests and said the victims were all followers of Maduro. CNN could not independently confirm the government reports of violence, and it was unknown whether there were any opposition injuries or fatalities. On nights since the hotly contested vote, supporters of Capriles have banged pots and pans to protest the government's refusal to recount the votes, while supporters of Maduro have set off fireworks to celebrate his victory and drown out the noise. Before he departed for Lima Thursday, Maduro sharply criticized the opposition in Venezuela and accused them of staging a coup against him. ""In Venezuela we do not have an opposition. ... We have a conspiracy,"" he said. Despite protests, he said he would be inaugurated on Friday with a large ceremony and a military parade ""because our only commitment is to the people and to the memory of Hugo Chavez."""" A smiling Capriles urged his supporters Thursday not to be discouraged by Friday's ceremony, and to stay home listening to salsa music. ""This fight has not finished. ... I am sure that sooner rather than later the truth will come out,"" he said. READ MORE: Tensions mount after tight Venezuelan vote; government says 7 killed in post-election violence .

"(CNN) -- Test results on material found at the former New York home of late gangster Jimmy ""The Gent"" Burke have come back positive for human remains, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office said Monday. An anthropological investigation is now under way on the material, said office spokeswoman Grace Brugess. She said investigators will try to extract DNA from the remains to try to identify who was buried there. On Wednesday night, investigators at Ozone Park in Queens finished the search for remains possibly connected to a case that happened before 1996, said a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity last week. According to public records, the house is now owned by Burke's daughter, Catherine Burke, who declined Tuesday to comment to CNN. James Burke died in 1996. According to his obituary in The New York Times, he was serving a 20-years-to-life sentence in a New York prison when he fell ill with cancer. Robert De Niro played Burke as Jimmy Conway in the 1990 Martin Scorsese classic mafia film ""Goodfellas,"" and Burke is probably best known as the alleged mastermind of the 1978 Lufthansa heist, an $8 million robbery at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which was the largest robbery in history at the time. The source said that Burke and his cohorts, closely associated with top members of the Lucchese crime family, also were allegedly involved in a number of other activities -- so the search in Queens may not be related to the Lufthansa heist.

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabweans voted Saturday for a key referendum on a new constitution that limits presidential terms for the first time in the African nation. Robert Mugabe, 89, has been in power for decades, first serving as prime minister in 1980 and taking over as president seven years later. ""This is a Zimbabwean document to replace a British one. That is why I voted for it,"" said Babra Mheno, 34, a university student, referring to the nation's former colonial rulers. If approved, which is highly likely, the constitution will give more powers to the parliament and limit the president's. It also introduces a two-term limit of five years each for a president. The limit will not apply in retrospect, which means Mugabe has 10 more years as head of state if he is re-elected. ""I have voted no for the document,"" said Kizito Marwe, at a polling station east of Harare. ""It was written by politicians, not Zimbabweans."" The 27-year-old said he'll spend the rest of the day taking advantage of the public holiday. ""I was in line for two hours. I am heading home and spending the day watching TV,"" he said. Mugabe has indicated he will run for re-election during the polls scheduled for between July and October. The referendum -- one of the conditions set before an election -- clears the way for the first poll since a disputed outcome plunged the nation into chaos in 2008. The upcoming election will end the fragile coalition between Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. Both entered a power-sharing agreement in 2009 after regional leaders nullified Mugabe's victory,citing violence by his loyalists targeted at rival supporters. The two leaders are expected to run for president. About half of the nation of 12 million is expected to vote in the referendum. The referendum also addresses gender equality, and sets aside 60 parliamentary seats for women out of a total of 310. In days leading up to the referendum, Mugabe shut out Western observers, but allowed monitors from African nations to take part. Sporadic reports of violence have marred campaigns in the days leading up to the election. ""We should not have violence ... the party will not tolerate that nonsense (political violence) whether it is intra-party or inter-party,"" Mugabe said in a statement this week. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report .","If approved, which is highly likely, the constitution will give more powers to the parliament .

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Frederic Deloizy says his life began the day he met Mark Himes by chance at a birthday party in April 1990. Himes had recently started a job with Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education, and Deloizy was studying at a nearby college. The strangers arrived at the party at the same time, and Deloizy held the door open for Himes, catching his eye. ""It was love at first sight. We felt we belonged together,"" Deloizy said. What followed was a whirlwind romance lived out across two continents, through overseas phone calls and hand-written love letters. Deloizy, a French national, spent the past two decades in and out of the United States leapfrogging from one visa to another, in hopes of creating a life together with Himes, who was born and raised outside of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. But 21 years and four adopted children later, the couple -- who were married in California in 2008 -- is fighting to stay together since Deloizy's final visa expired in September. Deloizy faces deportation because immigration officials are barred from recognizing their marriage under the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Himes filed a spousal green card petition so they can continue living stateside in Harrisburg with their four children, John, 11, Claire, 8, and 6-year-old twins, Jacob and Joshua. ""I will no longer ride in the back of the bus. I am tired of waiting for people to give me rights,"" Himes said. On Wednesday, they faced an immigration officer at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' district offices in Philadelphia to defend their relationship and marriage, the usual process for opposite-sex married couples where one spouse is foreign-born and not a U.S. citizen. The immigration authorities will now review their information and make a decision about their green card petition at a later date. Deloizy and Himes represent a growing number of same-sex couples with a partner of foreign nationality at risk of separation under DOMA, according to the couple's immigration attorney, Lavi Soloway. ""They have sacrificed everything for their family, and the idea that the federal government wants to tear them apart in the name of the Defense of Marriage Act is preposterous and cannot [be allowed to] happen,"" said Soloway, co-founder of Stop The Deportations, a campaign to stop the deportations of spouses of gay and lesbian Americans. DOMA was passed in 1996 by the GOP-controlled Congress and signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton. It bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and says states cannot be forced to recognize such marriages from other states. Deloizy and Himes are hoping their case is placed on hold until DOMA makes it to the Supreme Court. On the flip side, if their petition is rejected, deportation proceedings could begin for Deloizy. ""If I'm deported, the whole family is deported. You don't split a family,"" Deloizy said. ""It could make me mad, but it makes me sad. This is our reality."" In February, President Barack Obama ordered the Justice Department to stop defending the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act. Despite the order, the administration will continue to enforce the law. ""(DOMA) is clearly unconstitutional because it violates basic equality rights,"" said David S. Cohen, associate professor of law at Drexel University's Earle Mack School of Law. ""Unless the legislative stars align themselves and make it a part of the priority to repeal DOMA, it will take some time for the courts to get to it."" The couple is not seeking special treatment, instead they're asking for equal protection under the law, Himes said. ""You live constantly with the stress of knowing that you're a second-class citizen and at any moment your family could be torn apart by the same government that permitted you to become a family,"" Himes said. ""This is not gay life. This is two guys with a lot of kids trying to get laundry done and homework finished."" With Deloizy unable to work because of his visa status, Himes is now the sole breadwinner for the family. Deloizy runs the household when Himes is at work, packing lunches, getting the kids off to school, and shuttling their brood to doctor's appointments and activities. ""I simply could not do this by myself,"" Himes said. ""The private schools are gone, the nice cars are gone, and the big house is gone. But we have our family and we have our love."" Himes chronicles their daily life on his blog, where he creates a ""virtual scrapbook"" of the couple's children: his daughter, Claire, getting her ears pierced for Christmas; his son, Jacob being rushed to the hospital when he bit his tongue after falling off his pogo stick; and the family trip to Washington for the White House Easter Egg Roll in 2010. ""It's not about being gay or straight, it's about love,"" Deloizy said. ""If we're not a family then what are we?""","Frederic Deloizy, a French national, and American Mark Himes were married in 2008 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday tossed out a provision in Arizona's voter registration law that required proof of citizenship. The 7-2 majority said the state's voter-approved Proposition 200 interfered with federal law designed to make voter registration easier. The state called the provision a ""sensible precaution"" to prevent voter fraud. Civil rights group countered that it added an unconstitutional and burdensome layer of paperwork for tens of thousands of citizens. Justice Antonin Scalia said the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 ""forbids states to demand an applicant submit additional information beyond that required by the federal form."" But in a nod to state authority, he said the federal law ""does not prevent states from denying registration based on any information in their possession establishing the applicant's eligibility."" The appeal was a classic federalism dispute, on the often delicate line between conflict and cooperation between state and federal governments over enforcing voting procedures. During last year's election, there were numerous court challenges to state voter identification laws at the polls. The current fight has produced a range of states, lawmakers and advocacy groups on both sides on the gateway issue of registration. The Obama Justice Department opposed the Arizona law, which went beyond what other states have done to ensure integrity in the registration system. Arkansas governor rejects voter ID measure . Retired justice Sandra Day O'Connor, an Arizona native, was among those who attended the spirited April oral arguments. National Voter Registration Act . Justice Anthony Kennedy a year ago blocked the Arizona law from being enforced, while the high court decided internally whether to accept pending appeals for review. The ballot measure was passed in 2004 and has been lingering in the federal courts ever since. The Constitution's Article I says ""the times, places, and manners of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature."" But Congress is also given the power ""to make or alter such regulations."" Federal lawmakers did just that, passing the National Voter Registration Act two decades ago, which has since been called the Motor Voter Law, designed to streamline election participation. It requires states to have any application for a driver's license treated also as a voter registration -- the ""motor voter."" And it requires states to ""accept and use"" mail-in and in-person applications. A federal Election Assistance Commission was created to produce a nationally uniform voter application form, which states must use. Any extra state instructions, or ""add-ons,"" must be approved by the commission. The question was whether certain extra instructions are permitted, and just how the federal from must be respected in the first place. The majority said the mail-in postcard was presumptive evidence of registration and of qualification. Would-be voters would check off a box attesting they are a U.S. citizen, then sign the form under penalty of perjury. The state said they had prosecuted cases of noncitizens registering to vote. Dissenting justices . In a dissent, Justice Samuel Alito said the majority produced ""truly strange results."" ""What is a state to do if it has reason to doubt an applicant's eligibility but cannot be sure that the applicant is ineligible? Must the state either grant or deny registration without communicating with the applicant? Or does the court believe that a state may ask for additional information in individual cases but may not impose a categorical requirement for all applicants? If that is the Court's position, on which provision of the NVRA does it rely? The Court's reading of [federal law] is atextual and makes little sense."" Justice Clarence Thomas produced a separate dissent. But Scalia and his six colleagues said that if the state were allowed to impose the additional requirements, ""the federal form ceases to perform any meaningful function, and would feeble means of increasing the number of eligible citizens who register to vote in elections for federal office."" Registration problems . Among those bringing suit was Jesus Gonzalez, a public school employee in Yuma, Arizona, who tried to register to vote the day he became a citizen. His application was twice rejected when his separate naturalization and driver's license numbers were improperly ""red-flagged"" by state databases that initially indicated he was a noncitizen. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which helped bring the original lawsuit against the state regulations, said 31,000 potential voters had their applications rejected in the two years after the Arizona law took effect. MALDEF said 90% of those were born in the U.S. The group's Nina Perales said voter registration drives at county fairs, church services and similar venues have dropped, since many potential voters don't bring the necessary citizenship documents -- like a birth certificate -- to these community events. One estimate found a 45% reduction in Maricopa County, the state's largest county and the seat of Phoenix, the capital. The ACLU said about 13 million people nationwide lack documents proving their citizenship, and it praised Monday's ruling. ""This decision reaffirms the principle that states may not undermine this critical law's effectiveness by adding burdens not required under federal law,"" said Laughlin McDonald, of the group's Voting Rights Project. ""In doing so, the court has taken a vital step in ensuring the ballot remains free, fair, and accessible for all citizens."" The Obama administration said that if the provision in Arizona's law were allowed to continue, it would create a mishmash of regulations across the county. ""Each state could impose all manner of its own supplemental requirements beyond the federal form,"" Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said. What supporters have to say . But Proposition 200 supporters say the state needs the power to keep illegal immigrants and those ineligible to vote in the U.S. from getting a ballot. ""The integrity of our nation's elections suffered a blow today from the Supreme Court,"" Tom Fitton, president of the conservative Judicial Watch, said Monday. ""This issue takes on increasing urgency with the prospect of 11 million illegal immigrants being given amnesty. It is essential that our elections be secured by ensuring that only citizens register to vote."" Some Arizona activists agreed. ""I believe we must go out of our way to protect the integrity of America's elections, to avoid the fraud we see regularly in other nations, and which if not checked will rise up here in the United States,"" said Russell Pearce, a former state Senate president, who helped spearhead Proposition 200's passage. ""It ought to be common sense that proof of citizenship be required for voter registration, especially given the concrete evidence we've seen that illegal aliens are indeed both registered and voting. But common sense and America's judicial system don't always see eye to eye, and this is one area we'll just have to keep working."" O'Connor has a professional stake in the current high court fight. As a retired justice, she can sit on lower appeals court cases, and she was part of a 9-2 majority to rule in 2010 that Arizona's citizenship requirement conflicted with federal law. The Supreme Court case is Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona (12-71).

"(CNN) -- NASA insisted Friday that it has dibs on rocket engines sitting deep on the Atlantic Ocean floor, a day after a wealthy adventurer announced the discovery of the prized pieces of space history. Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos revealed Thursday that, using deep-sea sonar, a team had found the F-1 engines that powered the Saturn V rocket carrying Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 mission to the moon ""lying 14,00 feet below the surface."" ""We're making plans to attempt to raise one or more of them from the ocean floor,"" the billionaire investor and entrepreneur wrote. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden, in his own statement Friday, applauded Bezos and his team for their ""historic find"" and wished them ""all the luck in the world."" At the same time, he stated that any Apollo engine that's recovered belongs to the space agency. ""NASA does retain ownership of any artifacts recovered and would likely offer one of the Saturn V F-1 engines to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington under longstanding arrangements with the institution,"" Bolden said. The NASA administrator added that he'd directed staff ""to provide a smooth and expeditious disposition of any flight hardware recovered."" Bezos himself requested, in a message to NASA, that an F-1 engine or another space artifact be put on display at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. This could still happen if the ""Smithsonian declines"" to take an engine that's raised from the ocean's depths ""or if a second engine is recovered,"" according to the NASA administrator. ""I sincerely hope all continues to go well for Jeff and Blue Origin, and that his team enjoys success and prosperity in every endeavor,"" said Bolden, referring to the Bezos-led venture into space flight. ""All of us at NASA have our fingers crossed for success in his upcoming expedition of exploration and discovery."" Bezos said Thursday that the condition of the discovered engines, which slammed into the ocean more than 42 years ago and have been in the saltwater ever since, isn't known. ""On the other hand, they're made of tough stuff, so we'll see,"" he said. Each of the engines weighs nearly nine tons, and they came in a cluster of five. They provided 32 million horsepower by burning 6,000 pounds of fuel every second, and the five together propelled the largest rocket in history up 38 miles in under three minutes. After doing their work, the rockets plummeted into the ocean, where they had been undiscovered for more than four decades. NASA had some clues as to where they landed, and a piece of the debris landed on a German merchant ship, providing more clues. Robert Pearlman, a space memorabilia expert who runs CollectSpace.com, said 65 of these engines were launched. He said if the engines can be brought to the surface and a serial number can be found, it would be easy to authenticate the find. But bringing them up could be a challenge. ""If all five are still clumped together, it will be like trying to bring up the big part of the Titanic,"" Pearlman said. Bezos made his announcement days after another wealthy, high-profile adventurer -- James Cameron -- made deep-sea history himself, as the first person to explore solo the deepest spot in all the world's oceans, in the Mariana Trench. Also this week, Sir Richard Branson used millions to fund his attempts to travel around the globe in a balloon. Pearlman said Bezos' disclosure came as a complete surprise to the space memorabilia world. ""But that fits into the way he does business,"" Pearlman said, referring to Blue Origins, which aims to make human spaceflight cheaper and easier. ""Bezos and that Blue Origins have always played their cards very close to their chest and often don't share their milestones until after they have succeeded.""

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Prominent Cuban dissident Oswaldo Paya Sardinas died in a car accident Sunday, his daughter Rosa Maria Paya told CNN. He was 60. She said her father died after the car he was traveling in was struck by another car in Cuba's eastern Granma province. The car crash took place at 1:50 p.m. near Bayamo, Cuba, according to statement released by the Cuban government's International Press Center. In Spanish: Government statement . Paya and passenger Harold Capero died in the accident, the statement said. Two other passengers -- a Spanish citizen and Swedish citizen -- were injured and taken to a hospital, it said. The government statement says there was not a second car involved in the crash and said the rental car that Paya was traveling in lost control and crashed into a tree. Cuban police are investigating the crash, the statement said. On Paya's website, his daughter Rosa Maria posted an audio clip saying his family believed that a second car had been involved and that it had intentionally struck the car in which Paya was traveling. A devout Christian and an engineer, Paya was known far beyond Cuba for his criticisms of the island's socialist government. Cuban doctors battle to control cholera outbreak . In 2002, shortly before former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Cuba, Paya delivered petitions containing 11,020 signatures calling for democratic elections and freedom of speech to Cuba's National Assembly. Although the initiative -- called the ""Varela Project"" -- was ignored by Cuba's government, Carter later spoke of Paya's signature drive during a speech that was broadcast on state television in Cuba. The speech was the first time Cuba's government had allowed an American leader to address the populace as well as the first time that many Cubans had heard of Paya's efforts to change the country's political system.

"(Rolling Stone) -- California-based promotions company Goldenvoice is threatening to move one of its biggest events, the annual Coachella festival, out of Indio if the city goes through with a proposed admissions tax, according to the Desert Sun. The report comes after the newspaper obtained a series of text messages in which Goldenvoice vice president Skip Paige told an Indio official about the plans to move Coachella and also its country music festival, Stagecoach, from the city. ""If the tax initiative of putting $4 million to $6 million onto Coachella gets on the ballot,"" Goldenvoice president Paul Tollett told the Sun, ""we're going to take off [in] 2014; 2015 we'll be at a new facility outside of Indio."" The 5- to 10-percent tax on admissions for events of more than 2,500 people was initially proposed by City Councilman Sam Torres, who believes that the cost would add an average of $18 to each ticket. Torres belives this would generate $4 million for Indio, which recently had to cut almost $4 million from its budget through layoffs and leaves of absence. Tollett, however, estimated that the tax would make tickets approximately $36 more expensive, a cost he did not want to make festivalgoers pay; the tax, then, would cost Goldenvoice an extra $4 to $6 million. After his initial measure was turned down by the City Council, Torres is now leading a petition drive to get the measure on the ballot in November. Approximately 2,700 Indio residents would have to sign the petition for it to go forward. It was Torres who forwarded the texts that Paige sent him to the Desert Sun. The texts indicated that Goldenvoice was already planning on moving the two festivals out of Indio. One read, ""You know were moving right? All this is a game. Why in the world would we stay where we are not wanted."" [SIC] . While Tollett said he couldn't respond to the texts because he had not seen them, he noted that some excerpts -- like one about how Goldenvoice decided to move two years ago -- were misleading. He did acknowledge that Goldenvoice had attempted to buy the Eldorado Polo Club just down the road from the current site of the Empire Polo Club, not the Empire Polo Club as Paige's text read. ""We've spent money on options for new venues,"" Tollett told the Desert Sun. ""I regret that, but I had to. There's too much uncertainty. In any other place, this festival would have had a long-term deal. We have it with the venues. With the city, it's been this year-to-year thing."" While Paige's texts indicate that Goldenvoice hasn't had any meetings with Indio city officials to discuss a long-term deal ""because there isn't one,"" Indio mayor Glenn Miller said otherwise. City Manager Dan Martinez added that negotiations won't be able to begin until the city knows what will happen with the tax proposal as well as Goldenvoice's possible purchase of Eldorado. While both Tollett and Empire owner Alex Haagen III say they want to keep the festivals where they are, they can't ignore the effects that Torres' proposed measure would have. Before any decisions are made, they'll have to see how many signatures Torres' petition gets. ""Sam, his slogan should be, 'I want to turn the city of festivals into the city of festival' â€” the Tamale Festival, which is free,"" said Tollett. ""That's what he's doing. That's his legacy."" While Coachella 2014 remains uncertain, dates for next year's festival have already been set for April 12th-14th and April 19th-21st. See full story at RollingStone.com.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Ad time for next Sunday's ""All-American Muslim"" episode is apparently sold out, despite Lowe's decision to pull its commercials from the TLC reality series, a TLC network spokeswoman said. Hip hop mogul Russell Simmons announced his intentions Monday to buy up any unsold commercial time on the controversial show in response to the withdrawal of the home improvement giant. He would use the ads to promote his prepaid Visa ""Rush Card,"" he said. ""He has tried to buy,"" TLC's Laurie Goldberg told CNN in an e-mail Tuesday. ""We are checking inventory. Still don't know on that one. I do think it was already sold out, but still checking."" If any ad time is left, Simmons said he was standing by to take it. Simmons' website posted a statement Tuesday saying ""TLC has announced that Rush Card will not be able to purchase the remaining ad space as they have all been sold out."" ""All-American Muslim"" is an eight-part series that follows five Muslim families living in Dearborn, Michigan. ""Each episode offers an intimate look at the customs and celebrations, misconceptions and conflicts these families face outside and within their own community,"" TLC said in the show's description. The controversy, and Lowe's decision to pull their spots, followed a complaint by the Florida Family Association. The group warned Lowe's in a letter that the show ""is attempting to manipulate Americans into ignoring the threat of jihad and to influence them to believe that being concerned about the jihad threat would somehow victimize these nice people in this show."" Lowe's, a national home improvement chain, defended its decision in a statement to CNN last Saturday. ""Lowe's has received a significant amount of communication on this program, from every perspective possible,"" the company said. ""Individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic, and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views. As a result we did pull our advertising on this program."" Simmons, who is an outspoken social activist, sent a series of Twitter messages over the last several days urging Lowe's to reverse its decision: . ""Dear @Lowes, we got over 21k signatures standing up against ur poor decision. Do right thing: apologize & put $ back in #AllAmericanMuslim"" Simmons called the controversy ""a press nightmare"" for Lowe's in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. ""This country is built on religious freedom,"" he said. ""This is the kind of hate that tears this country apart.""

"London (CNN) -- It's the place where countless teenagers have spent a Saturday afternoon meeting friends and browsing racks, but now one of the world's oldest music retailers is in difficulties after its management announced this week it was going into administration. When HMV opened its first store on London's Oxford Street in 1921, it sold gramophones, sheet music and recordings. In the 1960s, The Beatles cut their first demo in the store's studio and in the 1980s, Live Aid founder Bob Geldof opened HMV's Oxford Circus shop -- believed to be the world's biggest entertainment store. But the chain of more than 200 stores has failed to keep up in the digital age -- putting 4,000 jobs at risk. Industry analysts look at the reasons for the store's demise. How did HMV end up in this position? The music industry has undergone many changes over HMV's long history but perhaps one of the most significant developments has been the growth of digital recordings. In a 2012 report, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) said CD and other physical recorded music sales had dropped from 145.8 million units in 2007 to 92.1 million in 2011 -- a slump of more than 20%. This contrasted with a rise in sales of single digital tracks and digital albums combined from 84.2 million units in 2007 to 202.8 million units in 2011 -- that's more than double in four years. Kantar Worldpanel estimated that in 2011 HMV was still the largest retailer in the UK's recorded music market -- with its digital and physical sales accounting for 22.9% of overall expenditure. But its figures showed that Amazon was catching up, with 22.4%. Of that 22.4% market share, 14.3% came from home delivery and 4.4% from digital downloads. Singer David Bowie put the importance of the download into focus by releasing his latest single on iTunes last week rather than on CD. According to Kantar Worldpanel, iTunes had 12.8% of the UK's music market share in 2011. Why didn't HMV do well in the digital market place? In fairness, HMV hung on longer than its rivals over the last 20 years like Tower Records, Our Price, Virgin Megastore and, latterly, Zavvi. HMV has invested in the online market, selling music from HMV.com and in 2009 buying a 50% stake in smaller digital company 7Digital -- but analysts believe the company left its run too late. Matt Piner -- retail research director for research agency Conlumino -- says HMV ""failed to keep up"" and that by the time the company focused on online sales the key players had already been established. ""Because HMV wasn't able to break into that strong core group of players it was always going end up in this situation."" What does the future look like for other in store music and video retailers? There are only a few hundred independent record stores left in Britain and Conlumino estimates that by 2015 about 90% of music and video sales will be made online. Supermarkets and non-specialist stores are expected to make up some of the 10% of sales Conlumino predicts will still be made in store by 2014. With more innovative ways of accessing music -- through online streaming, Spotify and Sky Box Office for example -- the physical product is likely to play a much more depleted role. ""By the end of the decade, the physical product will be seen as a thing of the past,"" Piner says. What advantages do the online competition have? HMV's real estate costs -- to maintain a presence in city centers -- as well as staff wages, gave it overheads that can be avoided by some online competitors. But campaign group UK Uncut argues that rivals such as Amazon also have an advantage in the way they pay tax. Spokesman Mark Williams says the British government has failed to tackle tax avoidance. ""Now that failure appears to be one of the main reasons companies like HMV can no longer compete with tax avoiding giants like Amazon,"" he says. Amazon has yet to respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN. Is any action being taken to change the tax situation? In a speech in December 2012, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was putting the issue of low taxes paid by multinationals ""at the top of the agenda"" for the G8 summit. ""It's simply not fair and not right what some of them are doing by saying, I've got lots of sales here in the UK but I'm going to pay a sort of royalty fee to another company that I own in another country that has some special tax dispensation,"" he said. Similarly, France is looking at why multinationals are able to avoid paying sales tax when selling to French consumers. The country's technology minister is also considering ways of ensuring internet giants help subsidize the networks they run on. Earlier this year, the BBC reported that Jersey-based Play.com was shutting down its online retail business after the government closed the Low Value Consignment Relief (LVCR) loophole. The LVCR allowed items valued at less than Â£15 to avoid sales tax in the UK. What allure do record shops have in a digital age? Online shopping and digital downloads may be convenient, but some argue they lack the ""romance"" of a traditional record store, especially one with informed staff. Q Magazine's associate editor Paul Stokes says consumers can actually talk to people in shops and benefit from the curation that sales staff can provide. ""The great thing about record shops as opposed to online is that you can go in and see racks,"" he says. ""That's the big thing -- that sort of spotting things and thinking 'great I want to listen to that'."" Online shoppers tend to type in the specific name of a band whose music they are interested in, reducing the likelihood of a chance purchase, Stokes says. ""It would be a real detriment to the culture to lose a high street presence across the country because I think it's one way that people discover things that they weren't looking for."" What about the impact of online shopping on other products? HMV Group owned book retailer Waterstones between 1998 and 2011. In December 2011, the chain's new managing director -- James Daunt -- told The Independent newspaper that he regarded online retailer Amazon as ""a ruthless, money-making devil."" Daunt said computers were a ""terrible environment"" in which to select books. ""All that 'If you read this, you'll like that' -- it's a dismal way to recommend books. A physical bookshop in which you browse, see, hold, touch and feel books is the environment you want."" He nonetheless acknowledged that Waterstones was developing its own e-book. And six months later Waterstones announced it would sell an e-book reader in its stores -- the Amazon Kindle.","HMV to go into administration after more than 90 years in business .

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- ""We can't tolerate this anymore."" That's what President Barack Obama told those attending a memorial service Sunday in Newtown, Connecticut, two days after a man shot his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 26 people -- 20 of them children no older than 7, who would never go on a date, drive a car, marry or have kids of their own. Obama offered his condolences, saying, ""All across this land of ours, we have wept with you."" He praised the residents of Newtown for having pulled together and ""loved one another"" with a spirit all could emulate. And he asked whether more could be done to prevent more parents, sisters and brothers, like those in this quiet New England town, from suffering similar heartaches. ""Can we honestly say we're doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe from harm?"" Obama said, adding that ""if we don't get that right, we don't get anything right."" ""If we're honest with ourselves, the answer is no."" Read the full text of the president's speech . His call to action capped an emotional prayer service at Newtown High School, in which local leaders of several religions -- a Jewish rabbi singing a prayer, a Muslim man choking back tears, and several Christian leaders offering perspective -- attempted to comfort a shattered community. Nine hundred watched in the school's auditorium, including several children toting teddy bears, and another 1,300 saw the proceedings from a nearby overflow room. The aim was to show those suffering in Newtown they were not alone. With the help of their neighbors, they could move past this ""act of unfathomable violence and destruction,"" explained the Rev. Matt Crebbin, senior minister at Newtown Congregational Church. ""We needed this,"" Crebbin said of the service. ""We needed to be together."" Remembering the victims . That sentiment was echoed by Obama, who said the nation stands with Newtown. Then he went further than that, saying that the country owes it to them -- and to the people of Tuscon, Arizona; Oak Creek, Wisconsin; Aurora, Colorado, communities that also have been sites of mass shootings in the last two years -- not just to remember the victims, but take steps to prevent more bloodshed in the future. The president didn't specify what steps he favors, but he did promise to put the power of his office toward preventing more senseless grief -- saying, ""We can't accept events like this as routine."" ""These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change."" Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America . Clearer picture of what happened, but not why . The first calls came into police around 9:30 a.m. Friday. Adam Lanza used ""an assault weapon"" to ""literally (shoot) an entrance into the building,"" Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Sunday. The nightmare got worse as he moved through Sandy Hook's halls. Timeline of the shooting . Using a Bushmaster AR-15 ""assault-type rifle,"" the 20-year-old fired ""multiple magazines"" -- each of which contained 30 bullets -- to gun down six adults and children in two classrooms, said Connecticut State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance. He then took out a handgun and shot himself in a classroom as law enforcement officers approached, officials said. All the victims were shot multiple times, said H. Wayne Carver II, Connecticut's chief medical examiner. Their deaths -- as well as that of Nancy Lanza, Adam's mother who suffered ""multiple gunshot wounds"" at their Newtown home -- are classified as homicides. ""This probably is the worst I have seen or the worst that I know of any of my colleagues having seen,"" said Carver, who did autopsies on seven victims. Why did Lanza do it? That much, at least publicly, remains a mystery. He had no criminal record. He and his mother, who collected guns, had visited a gun range at least once, ATF spokeswoman Ginger Colbrun said. The few who spoke of Lanza publicly, including an aunt and former classmate, described him as very intelligent and quiet. His father, Peter Lanza, released a statement Saturday saying his family is ""grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy."" ""We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can,"" the father said. Authorities shared that sentiment. Even as they have offered more details on what happened Friday morning, they haven't given a motive. ""We will and we are searching diligently and nonstop to attempt to answer that,"" said Vance, the police spokesman. Tears and hope . At Sunday's memorial service, Obama solemnly read out the first names of those Lanza killed. ""God has called them all home,"" he said. Share your tributes . And for every victim, there's a story. Six-year-old Emilie Parker was ""bright, creative and very loving,"" her father, Robbie Parker, recalled Saturday. ""My daugher Emilie would be one of the first ones to be standing up and giving her love and support to all of those victims, because that is the type of person she is,"" he said. ""...This world is a better place because she has been in it."" Victoria Soto, 27, moved her students away from her first-grade classroom door when she heard gunfire. She is being hailed for having saved some of her students, even though she herself didn't survive. ""She was truly selfless,"" her mother Donna Soto said Sunday. ""She would not hesitate to think to save anyone else before herself and especially children. She loved them more than life."" Many more tears will be shed in the coming days, as victims are laid to rest. The first two funerals tied to the massacre -- for Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto, both Sandy Hook students -- will begin Monday at noon and 1 p.m. respectively, according to the Connecticut Funeral Directors Association. Malloy, Connecticut's governor, said Sunday that they will never be forgotten. At the same time, he expressed hope that the strength of community will make a difference. ""We will go on. We will find strength,"" he said at Sunday's memorial service. ""We will get better."" What really makes schools safer?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An inspection of barracks across the United States found that only a small fraction of rooms required immediate repairs, the Army said Friday. A soldier battles overflowing sewage in the Fort Bragg barracks shortly after coming home from Afghanistan. The inspection was a result of recent reports of substandard living conditions in some barracks at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Of the 148,000 Army barracks inspected nationwide, 45 barracks at eight Army posts ""were found to need immediate attention,"" said an Army statement released Friday. Most of the barracks identified ""have issues with mold and moisture-related problems,"" Army Installation Management Command spokesman Ned Christensen told the Army Times. Only 13 soldiers had to be relocated while repairs brought their rooms up to living standards, Army officials said. They said $250 million was redirected from other funds to get the repairs done immediately. Army official gave this breakdown of how the funds will be divided among the barracks that need repairs: . • Fort Polk, Louisiana, $166 million. • Fort Gordon, Georgia, $49.7 million. • The United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, $9.3 million. • Fort Lewis, Washington, $7.4 million. • Fort Stewart, Georgia, $6.2 million. • Fort Bragg, North Carolina, $2.9 million (in addition to the $2.6 million spent in response to the initial reports). • Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii, $1.7 million. • Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, $1.2 million. Army officials admitted that they are not happy about the conditions of many of the old barracks, and soldiers are not happy either. New barracks at many posts are under construction or have been completed and will eventually replace all of the old units, the officials said. ""In the interim, the Army must continue to use and maintain aging barracks in our inventory,"" a written statement said. ""Thirty percent of our existing barracks are World War II and Korean War-era and require large investments to extend their life until replacement facilities are constructed."" The inspection, which took place between April 26 and 30, was prompted by a video posted online by a soldier's father showing sewage backing up, rusty staircases, peeling paint and other substandard living conditions in a Korean War-era barracks at Fort Bragg. Paratroopers from the 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment moved into the barracks after returning from fighting in Afghanistan this year. The video was posted in April. The Army said that it was quick to fix the problems and that the video was posted after the barracks had been repaired.","Some barracks have ""mold and moisture-related problems,"" Army spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Six people were hospitalized after a boat exploded at a Maryland marina, an official with the Anne Arundel County Fire Department said Monday. Six children, all of whom are 13 or younger, were injured, Lt. Jack Bell said. ""We saw that the dad was actually picking kids up and throwing them into the water, and people were just frantically scrambling to get off the boat,"" Care Corradin told CNN affiliate WJZ. Corradin said the people from the boat began to swim back to the dock. ""And there was a ton of smoke just billowing out the back, and the dad went back in and picked up all the life vests and he was throwing the life vests at the kids and the people in the water,"" Corradin said. Sgt. Brian Albert of the Maryland Natural Resources Police, which is leading the accident investigation, said two of the children were transported to the Johns Hopkins burn center. No one on the boat suffered life-threatening injuries, he said. Bell said the boat got gas at the marina, and the 32-foot vessel, with nine people aboard, stalled when it left the dock just after noon. The blast happened when the captain tried to refire the engines. The cause of the explosion at the Oak Grove Marina near Edgewater, Maryland, is unknown. The marina is about 30 minutes east of Washington on the South River.","NEW: Witness said man was throwing younger victims into the water .

"New York (CNN) -- New Yorkers are not especially known for their patience. Stand on a subway escalator's left side -- otherwise known as the passing lane -- and it might evoke a sharp reprimand from fellow riders. But in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, millions across the New York metropolitan region who depend on the nation's busiest transit system are still waiting for their subway system to be fully restored. ""There is no precedent for this,"" said Clifton Hood, author of ""722 Miles: The Building of the Subways and How They Transformed New York."" Dubbed New York's ""life-blood,"" an estimated 5.5 million people ride the city's subway system each day in the country's most densely populated region. Most New York City residents don't have cars to fall back on. Less than half own cars, according to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which cites the latest census data on car ownership. That's a stark contrast with the rest of the nation, where 92% of all households own at least one car. Opinion: New York infrastructure FAIL . So when Gotham launched into emergency mode this week ahead of Sandy, shutting down all of its 468 stations for the second time ever, the effect was crippling on commuters and the places they work. At a corner Midtown market, where the Manhattan bustle continued in spite of Sandy, Edward Greenwald, 49, struggled to fill scheduling gaps left by stranded employees despite his own commute from storm-battered New Jersey. ""I've got employees coming in from all across the Tri-State area,"" he said. ""It's been really hard for them to get in, almost impossible. I've been coming in at 6 a.m. everyday and leaving at 10 p.m. just to help out."" Dating back to 1904, New York's century-old subway system is so extensive that if it were laid out in a single line, the tracks would extend from Manhattan to Detroit. Defending it and the city's power grid from storms that whip along New York's low-lying neighborhoods could be a concern that gains momentum beyond the week's recovery effort. ""We going to have to find some long-term, or longer-term solutions to this,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters this week. Could giant plugs prevent subway floods? And yet there were some indications that this kind of crisis was coming. Just 14 months ago, Hurricane Irene prompted New York's first-ever total subway closure. ""Rising sea level and climate change are likely to cause dangerous flooding in the coming decades,"" according to a 2004 report produced by the Marine Sciences Research Center for New York's Department of Environmental Protection. That report said much of the region is less than three meters above sea level -- which is slowly rising -- and therefore at risk from a so-called ""100-year flood,"" a term often used to describe its relative probability. New York ""has a 100-year flood every two years now,"" Gov. Andrew Cuomo quipped this week to President Barack Obama, who briefly cut off campaign stops to tour the region and assess the billions of dollars in damages along New York and New Jersey's coastal plains. ""Our climate is changing,"" the mayor wrote in an editorial this week. ""And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be -- given this week's devastation -- should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action."" Broader questions about climate change, infrastructure and how cities like New York will respond to storms like Sandy will likely continue to loom large. ""New York might have to take the Netherlands model, where they have all their power systems elevated,"" said Kenneth Button, a professor of public policy at George Mason University. Opinion: New York has what it takes to rebound . ""This is really not just a New York problem, it's a problem that exists in many places."" The Dutch flood protection model employs large-scale flood gates, as well as a series of low-lying drainage canals and pumping stations. In Japan, engineers have devised a $3 billion system called a ""Water Discharge Tunnel"" that essentially works as a floodwater diversion facility to protect Tokyo's 13 million residents during rain and typhoon season. Still, making New York's subways watertight would be an ""engineering feat equal to the scale and creativity of the original construction (of the system itself),"" said Lucius Riccio, New York City's former Transportation Commissioner and lecturer at Columbia University. ""Our engineers are up to it, if given the resources and the free hand."" In the days ahead, New York faces at least two big challenges, according to Ben Orlove, senior climate scientist at Columbia University. First, the city must cope with its immediate problems -- power outages, stranded residents, suspended subway lines, flooding and fire damage. Then it needs to deal with long-term infrastructure. ""We need to be innovative,"" said Orlove. ""And we should consider things like putting up flood gates at the mouth of the Hudson (River) and other vulnerable points that could help hold back the tide."" An army of municipal workers and private contractors is addressing the more immediate concerns, working around the clock in New York to pump out sea water and wipe down salt-caked machinery like underground transformers, circuit switches and generators. As workers scrambled to restore equipment, thousands of otherwise stranded commuters defiantly walked to work this week, often abandoning taxi cabs in the city's traffic-clogged streets. ""I left my house at 6:45 a.m. and I'm still walking,"" said Elizabeth Gorman, a 40-year-old Queens resident who crossed the Queensboro Bridge at around 10 a.m. ""I don't know what (else) to do. I have to get to work."" New York's buses, trains and subways are all slowly coming back online. But for many residents across the region where full transit service has yet to be restored, the slog to work continues. In the end, NYC marathon didn't feel right .","An estimated 5.5 million people ride New York's subway system each day .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Thousands of people of all ages gathered Wednesday evening in Ugur Mumcu square in Antakya, a picturesque town in the Hatay province of Turkey. They chanted ""Tayyip istifa!"" or ""Tayyip resign,"" demanding that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan leave office. On nearly every street, CNN journalists heard pots and pans banging and saw security forces. The authorities, who have violently clashed with protesters across Turkey, seemed to be avoiding the demonstrators. Though it was mostly quiet around 10 p.m. local time in Antakya, it seemed that the situation nationally was only getting worse. In a move likely to inflame the anger of Turkish protesters, authorities earlier arrested two dozen social media users on accusations of spreading false information about demonstrations sweeping the nation. Police detained 25 people and were searching for 13 more on accusations of using social media networks such as Twitter to spread false details about the anti-government protests and police reaction to them, according to the semiofficial Anadolu Agency news service. Read more: Is Turkey on the verge of a meltdown? The government response to the protests -- tear gas, pepper spray and water cannons -- has drawn condemnation from protesters and rights groups. Worldwide, headlines and social media have spread photos of a young woman in a red dress, apparently unarmed, being pepper sprayed by police in Istanbul. She carried only a white satchel and was walking past demonstrators when an officer lunged and sprayed her. Even as she tried to turn away, photos show he continued spraying her, hitting the back of her neck. There have been tweets of support for the woman and the protesters. The woman, however, has said she doesn't want the attention. On Wednesday, an official at the police station in Izmir confirmed to CNN that some of those accused of spreading false information on social media were brought in Tuesday night and remained in custody. But the official, who declined to give his name, refused Wednesday to provide additional details. CNN Explains: What's driving unrest in Turkey? The mother of one suspect told CNN that police with the Smuggling and Organized Crime Unit showed up in force looking for her daughter -- a high school senior -- but she refused to hand her over without assurances that she would not languish in custody. ""I'm not giving my daughter up,"" teenage suspect Begum Ozpaklar's mother said. ""I spoke to our lawyer, who spoke with the police, and I'm not handing my daughter to them until I know that they will take her statement immediately."" ""Those kids are being held behind bars, no sunlight. It's not healthy,"" she said. Twitter 'menace' It wasn't immediately clear what those arrested had posted to draw the attention of authorities, but the Turkish Interior Ministry said Wednesday that false information shared over social media had ""misguided the youth"" and led to protests that ""threatened the security of life and property of people,"" according to Anadolu. Erdogan, who has been the target of protesters' ire over what they call his dismissive and authoritarian style, on Sunday described Twitter as society's ""main menace,"" saying it is full of exaggerations and lies.

Social networking services such as Twitter have become a mainstay for activists around the world to share information and organize protests and have been widely credited with aiding popular uprisings in Egypt, Libya and other countries. Protests have spread across Turkey in recent days amid dissatisfaction with Erdogan and anger about what protesters and international critics have described as a heavy-handed crackdown on protesters by security forces. The demonstrations began more than a week ago over plans to replace an Istanbul park with a new development but quickly morphed into broader protests against Erdogan's rule and exploded after protesters complained that police had used unnecessarily harsh tactics in an effort to break up the rallies. Authorities have used tear gas and water cannons on protesters, sparking violent clashes that medical officials say have injured at least 4,355 people, according to the Turkish Medical Association. Two people have been killed; one person in Istanbul and one in Hatay. Three remain in critical condition with 10 suffering head trauma. At least 10 people have lost an eye, the association told CNN Wednesday. On Tuesday, the group complained of ""unprecedented and abusive use of force by police officers against protestors"" and demanded immediate steps to stop it. Istanbul's Taksim Square -- where the protests began -- was filled with protesters Wednesday but was calm. The presence of organized labor unions was noticeable on the second day of a general strike called by a coalition of unions. Ankara also was calm Wednesday, a day after riot police in armored vehicles topped with water cannons made a show of force in the city's central Kizilay Square, the site of earlier violent clashes between protesters and security forces. At the home of Abdullah Comert, who died in the protests, friends and family placed blame squarely at Erdogan's feet. ""Erdogan is like Assad, he is a dictator,"" a woman mourning at the house Wednesday said, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose government has battled rebellion for two years in a conflict that has left tens of thousands dead. 'Aggression' acknowledged . Erdogan's governing Justice and Development Party showed some acknowledgment of the protesters' initial grievances Tuesday. Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc apologized ""for the police aggression against our citizens who were involved in the initial protests and acted with environmental concern,"" Anadolu reported. He said security forces had been ordered to only use gas in self-defense. ""They are doing a hard job. When they are executing their jobs, they may sometimes use extraordinary, even excessive, use of force. But they wait in a passive mode unless something comes from the other side,"" Arinc said. And he added, ""I don't think we owe an apology to those who caused destruction on the streets and who interfered with people's freedom."" A channel for frustrations . The protests began as a small sit-in over plans were made to raze Gezi Park -- the last green space in central Istanbul -- and replace it with a replica of 19th-century Ottoman barracks containing a shopping mall. After riot police moved in to break up the demonstration with tear gas and pepper spray, protesters set up barricades and hurled bottles at police. Analysts say the protests have provided a channel for Turks who feel alienated and frustrated by Erdogan's government. Opposition parties are weak and divided, observers say, and have failed to convincingly challenge the governing party during its decade in power. Under Erdogan, the Turkish economy has grown strongly and his party has been rewarded with comfortable victories at the ballot box. But many secular Turks complain that the Islamist-rooted government is intolerant of criticism and diverse lifestyles, as evidenced by the recent enactment of tight restrictions on the sale of alcohol, Fadi Hakura, manager of the Turkey Project at the London-based think tank Chatham House, said in a CNN.com column. Critics also complain about rapid urbanization and its effects on the environment, an issue that helped spark the initial protests in Gezi Park. Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta; Gul Tuysuz reported from Istanbul; and CNN's Ben Wedeman, Ivan Watson, Nick Paton Walsh, Talia Kayali, Jethro Mullen and Josh Levs also contributed to this report.","NEW: Worldwide, headlines and social media abuzz with photos of pepper-sprayed woman .

"(CNN) -- Brand Beckham is moving from the ""City of Angels"" to the ""City of Light."" Soccer star David will take former popstar wife Victoria and their four children back to Europe, with big-spending French club Paris Saint-Germain confirming that the former England captain has passed a medical and signed a short-term deal ahead of Thursday's transfer deadline. The 37-year-old was later unveiled at a press conference, ending speculation about his next destination following the end of his six-year spell with U.S. MLS team Los Angeles Galaxy in early December. Beckham said he will donate the wages earned during his five-month contract to a children's charity in Paris. ""It's something exciting and something I'm not sure has been done before,"" he told reporters, and revealed that his family will be based in his hometown London. He had been linked with a host of clubs around the world but, in the twilight of his career, has decided to join a team on the rise thanks to the injection of hundreds of millions of dollars by its Qatari owners. ""It's simply a very nice piece of short-term brand alignment that will be mutually beneficial to both parties,"" sports business expert Simon Chadwick told CNN. Beckham is one of the world's most recognisable names, both for his sporting prowess and numerous off-pitch endorsement deals, and his pulling power could provide a valuable income stream for PSG -- which must conform to European football's financial fair play rules that restrict over-spending by club owners. ""I think it's very difficult to quantify,"" Chadwick said. ""He's been away from Europe for too long -- he's now really in his twilight years, we don't know what part he'll play in the team, we don't know how he'll be used for commercial purposes, we don't know how the French public will respond. ""And we don't know how international fans will engage with and consume the PSG/Beckham brand. We may see a spike in activity such as increases in ticket sales, but I am not entirely convinced that there'll be a significant sustainable stream of revenues."" However, one leading football executive who had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Beckham to join his team said that the midfielder still had a strong role to play on and off the pitch. ""Not only were we looking for a playmaker in midfield but also a leader in the dressing room and someone to set the standards on and off the pitch. Beckham would have brought all that,"" the executive told CNN on condition of anonymity. ""Sure Beckham would have ensured exposure and possibly commercial opportunities, but without the quality as a player it wouldn't have been at all interesting."" Beckham had the chance to join PSG in January 2012, but opted to stay in the U.S., ending his American mission with his second MLS Cup title before announcing that he would not fulfill the second year of his contract extension. ""I chose Paris because I can see what the club are trying to do. I can see who the club are trying to bring in,"" he said Thursday. ""It's an exciting city and now there's a club that's going to have a lot of success over the next 10, 20, 30 years. I'm very honored I've been picked to be part of the future of PSG."" One man who saw him up close in the U.S. believes the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star still has what it takes to perform on the big stage. ""At first it is like the marketing -- you bring in him more for the brand than the player,"" said former PSG defender Didier Domi, who played in the MLS for New England Revolution in 2011. ""But when I watched him in the MLS he still has the physical condition to play at the highest level. He likes to compete. On the pitch he can add a lot. ""They are not signing him for his ability to sprint -- it's his technique and vision. He has that ability to elevate his game depending on the opposition. He can play a part for PSG in both Ligue 1 and Champions League."" ""Les Parisiens"" are seeking to win the French title for the first time since 1994, having been runner-up last season. The club's owners, the Qatar Investment Authority, have splashed out on top players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva, Javier Pastore and Lucas Moura since taking over in 2011. Carlo Ancelotti's team tops the Ligue 1 table on goal difference after 22 of 38 rounds in the 2012-13 campaign, and will play in the knockout phase of Europe's top club competition in a two-legged tie against Spanish club Valencia on February 12 and March 6. Former AC Milan coach Ancelotti managed Beckham during the former England captain's first loan spell with the Serie A club in 2009. However, Beckham might be struggling to be fit for those matches, according to the manager of English club Arsenal -- who allowed the veteran to train with his squad this month. ""He told me that he doesn't look at all to be in shape. Beckham is super-ambitious,"" Arsene Wenger told reporters this week. ""If, in his mind, he wanted to play in the Premier League he would not have gone on holiday. He would have prepared and come in and tried to impress me. He told me he has done nothing at all."" Beckham admitted it might take ""a few weeks"" to get fully fit. ""It won't take long,"" he said. He explained that he could not play for another club in England except Manchester United, where he won six Premier League titles and the Champions League before moving to Spain in 2003. ""It's the team I support and the team I dreamed of playing for,"" said Beckham, who to Manchester as a teenager and progressed through the club's academy. ""I'm very honored by the offers I had from other Premier League clubs but I didn't want to play there unless it was for Manchester United.""","David Beckham signs short-term contract at Paris Saint-Germain .

"(LifeWire) -- Carol Ann Carnese never considered herself an anxious person. Except when it came to wet wood. Does this small creature terrify you? You might have sciurophobia - the fear of squirrels. ""If I saw someone lick a wooden spoon, I had to turn away,"" says the 41-year-old massage therapist from Portland, Oregon. ""I'd break out into a sweat ... and I'd just get sick to my stomach. I could not even look at someone with a toothpick in their mouth."" It wasn't just looking at wet wood that freaked her out. It was touching it, too. ""I could not eat Popsicles to the end,"" Carnese explains. ""As soon as I got close to the end, I would give it to my kids. I would not even own wooden utensils because I could not wash them. Not even in the dishwasher because they would still be damp when they came out."" Until Carnese was treated by a professional -- a process that involved gradual exposure to wet wood to ""reprogram"" the way she thought about it -- physical contact with wet trees, fences and the deck surrounding her hot tub was out of the question. (Instead, she would wear slippers to walk back to the house post-soak.)  See some examples of unusual phobias » . A common affliction . Carnese's fear of seemingly innocuous objects and situations is no anomaly. Phobias are the No. 1 psychiatric illness in women of any age and the No. 2 in men older than 25, according to the American Psychiatric Association. A ""specific"" phobia, or an ""excessive and unreasonable fear of a specific object, place or situation,"" afflicts about 19 million people in the U.S., according to the Anxiety Disorders Association of America. Fears can range from the relatively commonplace fear of closed spaces, or claustrophobia, to the more unusual, such as a fear of dolls or children, known as pediophobia. ""Phobias can affect anyone,"" says Elizabeth Lombardo, a clinical psychologist in Wexford, Pennsylvania. ""So many highly functioning people have them. It doesn't matter your socioeconomic status, your intelligence level."" Being rational doesn't help . Even realizing that a doll or a wet popsicle stick is harmless doesn't help sufferers overcome their phobias. ""Knowing that it isn't rational or it doesn't make sense doesn't help them get over their fear,"" Lombardo explains. ""Your mind says it's not rational, but your body says, 'Yeah, but I'm scared.'"" Just ask Bryan Schultz, 36, who is afraid of ""any small, furry animal that gnaws on things."" ""Rabbits and squirrels are especially terrifying for me, but even non-rodentia, like ferrets, freak me out,"" says the copywriter from State Center, Iowa. ""I work right next to a park with many trees, and I have to honk the car horn to scare any critters away before I open the door on many mornings."" ""I recognize rationally that it's funny,"" says Schultz, who doesn't consider himself a ""fearful"" person. But that doesn't stop his heart from doing backflips when he encounters a squirrel. Coping mechanisms . Rather than seek professional help, which often involves confronting the feared object or situation directly, phobics may try to manage their anxiety through avoidance. ""I've never sought treatment, partly out of embarrassment and partly because I've learned to cope by making small modifications,"" Schultz says. Instead of walking on the sidewalk, he quickly moves to the street if he spots a squirrel in his path. When a carpool buddy intentionally parked under a tree filled with squirrels as a prank, ""I had to honk the horn and sit in the car for seven minutes"" after his colleague had gone into the office, Schultz says. Peyton Pinkerton, 37, guitarist with the band Pernice Brothers, battles a similar impulse to flee the object of his personal phobia: clowns. ""I was yelled at by a birthday party clown when I was about 4 years old and have been absolutely terrified of them ever since,"" says the resident of Northampton, Massachusetts. ""If I'm surprised by seeing a clown, it's like snakes or rats. My fight-or-flight response kicks in,"" Pinkerton says. ""I have run out of malls, fairgrounds, etcetera, on repeated occasions."" Face, don't flee, the fear . Avoidance and other quick fixes are no substitute for treating the phobia, Lombardo says. ""That's what we call a Band-Aid reaction,"" she says. ""It perpetuates your fear."" The good news, Lombardo says, is that phobias can be cured. If you're suffering from one, she suggests the following: . • Go easy on yourself. ""People are so embarrassed by this,"" Lombardo says. ""They think there's something wrong with them."" But, she says, not beating yourself up is key. • Remember to breathe. ""When people are confronted with their fear, their distress level increases,"" Lombardo says. ""Deep breathing is always a good thing."" • Seek counseling. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which Lombardo practices, can often help patients kick their phobias in eight to 12 sessions. CBT focuses on changing self-destructive ways of thinking. • Face the music. Facing the feared object head-on is important. ""You're retraining your body in addition to your mind. It's like putting your feet in a hot bathtub or cold pool: You wait a little bit, and your body gets used to it,"" Lombardo says. LifeWire provides original and syndicated content to web publishers.

"Editor's note: This is an excerpt from the February issue of National Geographic magazine. You can read the full story here. (National Geographic) -- Miles from the main roads, in rural Africa, soccer balls bounce unevenly. Playing fields are arid, lush, weedy, sandy—any flattish space will do. Goalposts might be made of gathered mahogany or driftwood. Some feet are bare, others shod in fraying sneakers, boots, rubber sandals. Yet children kick and chase handmade, lopsided balls with skill and abandon, competing for pride and joy—for the sheer pleasure of playing. Has the ""beautiful game"" ever been lovelier? Jessica Hilltout doesn't think so. In 2010, when the World Cup came to Africa for the first time, the Belgium-based photographer set out to see what soccer looked like far from the bright lights and big stadiums. What she found—over seven months, ten countries, and 12,500 miles—was a grassroots game where passion trumped poverty, a do-it-yourself ethic prospered, and one ball could ""bring happiness to an entire village."" In the 30-odd soccer-loving localities she visited, in countries from South Africa to Ivory Coast, balls are spun into being with whatever's at hand: rag or sock, tire or bark, plastic bag or inflated condom. Each might last days or months on a field of gravel or hard earth. Wherever Hilltout went, she swapped the store-bought balls she kept in her car for these ""ingenious little jewels,"" most of which were made by children.

"(CNN) -- Passengers from a United Airlines 787 Dreamliner that made an unscheduled landing in Seattle were expected to resume their journey to Japan on Wednesday morning. Flight 139 from Denver to Tokyo was diverted to Seattle on Tuesday afternoon ""due to an indication of a problem with an oil filter,"" United said in a statement to CNN. The aircraft landed normally, said spokeswoman Mary Ryan. The plane's 210 passengers were asked to stay overnight in Seattle. Coverage from CNN affiliate KIRO . The incident comes five months after the FAA and other officials grounded the Dreamliner worldwide due to troubles with its battery system. In April, the FAA ordered all 787 operators to make specific modifications and United has been flying its fleet of six 787s since May 20. In an apparent show of confidence in the new airliner, United announced Tuesday it was ordering 20 additional Dreamliners -- specifically the 787-10 model, which is a longer version of the plane. Chris Seewald tweeted that he was a passenger on Tuesday's diverted flight. He said the aircraft's pilot told passengers that the ""engine was not operating optimally."" Seewald also tweeted a photo that he said showed the Dreamliner dumping fuel before landing in Seattle. Coverage from CNN affiliate KING . The 787 Dreamliner began service in the U.S. in 2012. With a fleet of six, United is the sole domestic operator of the airplane, which boasts high fuel efficiency due to the light-weight carbon-composite materials used in its wings and fuselage. The plane represents a new generation of efficient wide-body, long-range airliners, helping to make it among the world's most watched aircraft. Airlines worldwide have committed to buy the plane, and hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on Dreamliner's success. Boeing's rival Airbus flew a similar airliner -- its highly anticipated A350 XWB -- for the first time on Friday at its facility in Toulouse, France. The entire global fleet of 50 Dreamliners was grounded in January after two battery overheating incidents triggered concerns among safety officials. Among the Dreamliner's innovative new designs is a battery system that uses new, lighter lithium-ion batteries. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration collaborated on a new battery compartment which involved insulating the batteries and putting them in a ventilated armor-plated box to protect the rest of the plane.","United Flight 139 from Denver to Tokyo was diverted to Seattle on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Hanging just above the reception at Wembley Stadium is a long, white pole. As tourists flock to the iconic ""Home of Football"" they gaze toward the slightly discolored and aging artifact. In days gone past, some would rub it. Some would kiss it. Some would simply walk past while muttering ""Nein"" under their breath. But to underestimate the contribution of this seemingly lifeless piece of apparatus would be criminal. Some 47 years since that pole played an integral role in deciding the 1966 World Cup final, FIFA, the game's governing body, has announced that goal-line technology will be used at the tournament in Brazil in 2014. When tourists take the grand tour of Wembley, they begin at the ""Crossbar reception"" where they will find that iconic feature still hanging to this day. It was on July 30, 1966 that Geoff Hurst appeared to fire England into a 3-2 lead on the way to victory over West Germany. Hurst's effort, which hit the crossbar and bounced down ""over"" the line, was awarded by referee Gottfried Dienst and Soviet linesman Tofik Bakhramov amid heavy protestations . England eventually went on to win the contest 4-2, lifting the Jules Rimet trophy for the first and only time. Yet, even now, following years of fierce debate and the introduction of technology, nobody has definitively proved whether the correct decision was made that day. Fast forward to the 2010 World Cup and it was England which once again furthered the case for the introduction of technology. Frank Lampard's strike, ironically against Germany, was not awarded by Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda, despite the ball quite clearly landing over the goal line. To the entire watching world, it was a goal. But not the one man who mattered. The incident, which occurred under the watching gaze of FIFA president Sepp Blatter, convinced the Swiss administrator that technology should be introduced sooner rather than later. Goal-line technology (GLT) was successfully trialled at last year's Club World Cup in Japan and will be used at the Confederations Cup in Brazil this June ahead of the 2014 World Cup in the same country, FIFA said Tuesday. ""The aim is to use GLT in order to support the match officials and to install a system in all stadia, pending the successful installation, and pre-match referee tests,"" it said in a statement. ""With different technologies on the market, FIFA has launched a tender today, setting out the technical requirements for the two forthcoming competitions in Brazil."" Goal-line technology approved in soccer . The news will be widely greeted, and with some relief, following a whole host of incidents in recent years. At the 2012 European Championship finals, Ukraine was denied a goal against England when Marko Devic's shot crossed the English goal line but was not given. There have been several other instances, from Pedro Mendes' ""goal"" for Tottenham at Manchester United in 2005 through to Clint Hill's header for Queens Park Rangers in another English Premier League match at Bolton last year which was not given, despite replays showing it had quite clearly gone over the line. Two rival systems have been given licenses by FIFA: Hawk-Eye, which is similar to the system used at the Wimbledon tennis tournament; and GoalRef from Germany. FIFA expects others to enter the bidding, which is open until mid-March, with a final decision to be made in April. Hawk-Eye uses ""triangulation"" to pinpoint the exact location of the football. If it crosses the goal line, then an encrypted radio signal is sent to the referee's wristwatch to indicate a goal has been scored. In line with FIFA's requirements, the whole process takes less than a second to complete. GoalRef uses a microchip implanted in the ball and low magnetic waves around the goal. The system detects any change in the magnetic field on or behind the goal line to determine if a goal has been scored and alerts the ref. Michel Platini, head of European football's ruling body UEFA, remains a staunch opponent of the use of such technology. A football purist, Platini has maintained his position, despite incidents such as Ukraine's ""goal"" at Euro 2012. UEFA does not use goal-line technology in its Champions League and Europa League competitions. Instead, it persists with the use of extra officials behind the goal to inform the referee's decisions. Speaking to the media last June, Platini said: ""The goal between England and Ukraine: it was a goal. It was a mistake from the referee. But there was an offside before then. ""If the officials had given offside there wouldn't have been a goal. So why don't we have technology for offside decisions as well? Where does it stop? It's not goal-line technology in itself. ""I am against technology coming into force to actually make decisions. It invades every single area. If tomorrow someone handballs it on the line and the referee doesn't see it, what then? ""We can't just have goal-line technology. We also need sensors to see if someone has handballed it. ""We need cameras to see if it should be a goal or not.""","FIFA confirms that goal-line technology will be used at the 2014 World Cup .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- An Iranian non-profit company says it will honor U.S. President Barack Obama's request that Iran return a drone that crashed there last year. But instead of the actual drone, the company says it will send miniature toy versions. A lot of them. ""We plan to send a full squadron of 12 to the White House for President Obama as a present,"" said Reza Kioumarsi, a spokesman for the Aaye Art Group, a Tehran-based non-profit, non-governmental company that makes novelty items. The company is trying to determine what Obama's favorite color is before sending the drones, which are 1/80th the size of the real drone, Kioumarsi said. In December, Obama said the United States has asked Iran to return the highly classified RQ-170 Sentinel drone. ""We've asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,"" Obama said at the time. This is probably not the response Obama was seeking. Iran has said the country's armed forces had downed the drone near Kashmar, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) from the border with Afghanistan on December. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave a speech in December that seemed to suggest that Iran wouldn't return it. ""The North Americans at best have decided to give us this spy plane,"" Ahmadinejad said. The RQ-170 Sentinel is one of the United States' most sophisticated drones and flies at up to 50,000 feet. It is designed to evade sophisticated air defenses. One former intelligence official said it's ""impossible to see"" and discounted Iranian claims that it had been brought down by some form of electronic counter-measures. ""It simply fell into their laps,"" he said -- after satellite communication was lost.","An Iranian company wants to send replicas of a downed drone to Obama .

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- In the scorching summer heat, Deborah Hoffman can be found patrolling a section of Houston, Texas, that she's dubbed ""The Corridor of Cruelty."" ""It's basically a dumping ground for live and dead animals,"" said Hoffman. The corridor -- an area more than a mile wide where abused dogs are abandoned -- is located in northeast Houston near the Little York exit off U.S. 59 (Eastex Freeway). ""One of the saddest cases is when I come across one in a large green Hefty [trash] bag,"" said Hoffman. ""Some of the dogs that we find in the bags ... [have] some serious wounds ... most likely from dog fighting."" Hoffman, 52, started the nonprofit Corridor Rescue, and for nearly two years, she and her team of volunteers have been rescuing dogs from this area and shedding light on the neglect of these animals. In Texas, it is a criminal offense to abandon dogs, according to Assistant District Attorney Belinda Smith. As a result of Hoffman's efforts, Smith says her office has filed criminal cases against people who have dumped their dogs. ""Deborah not only brought the problem to our attention, but she takes it a step further -- she tries to find homes for animals that have been dumped,"" said Smith. Separately, in November 2008, Houston executed the largest dog fighting sting in the country to date, said Smith. As a result, 60 people were convicted and 168 dogs were seized. Hoffman has been involved in animal welfare for years and first came in contact with the corridor as a volunteer for a rescue group in 2006. Within a couple of months she rescued six dogs from the area. A return visit in August 2008 moved her to rally her community for help. On a tip from a friend, she went back to the area to search for a pregnant dog in need of rescue. She saw the place still teeming with emaciated and scared dogs fighting for food, shelter and their lives. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes . ""I took my 12-year-old daughter with me, and we spent the afternoon driving this neighborhood,"" said Hoffman. ""[We] both literally were in tears by the end of our journey."" Soon after, those tears turned to action. Hoffman sent out a mass e-mail to fellow animal lovers begging for help. ""[I] said ... 'We have an absolute atrocity going on day-in and day-out. And I'm calling this place The Corridor of Cruelty. There [are] animals scrounging around for food constantly. They're running in ditches with broken legs, broken bodies, pregnant. People, come out and help.' "" Many heeded the call, and Hoffman and her ""active army,"" as she calls it, started waging war on the corridor. In addition to the district attorney's office, Hoffman's efforts have gotten the ear of city council members, mayoral candidates and the police department, which set up cameras in the corridor to try to capture people dumping animals. The group also educates community members about anti-cruelty laws and spaying and neutering their pets. ""We literally are in a crisis here in Houston,"" said Hoffman. ""Enough is enough in the corridor. Things have got to change."" Hoffman and her group have set up 18 feeding stations throughout the area. Volunteers fill the bowls of food and water at each station six days a week, laying out a total of 600 pounds of food a week. ""We are keeping animals alive until we can get to some of them and bring them to safety,"" said Hoffman. Hoffman coordinates all of the rescues. Some dogs come up to the volunteers and want to jump in their vehicles; others are afraid, so Hoffman and two other designated volunteers trap them using snares and slip leads, among other means. While the corridor is safe for volunteers during the day, said Hoffman, the group's protocol is to never be out there after dark, even though no one has ever been bitten or attacked by a dog, she said. Once rescued, the dogs are taken to a vet to be treated before they are placed with a foster family or other rescue group. Hoffman often tries to place dogs before they are rescued. While in the field, volunteers photograph the dogs, and Hoffman e-mails the images to her group's vast network, which includes rescue groups for specific types of dogs. ""Hopefully we'll get someone to say, 'OK, I'll take that golden retriever,' "" she said. ""So we're really working together as a community."" Corridor Rescue covers the cost of food, a crate and vet bills for dogs that are fostered through them. Dogs that aren't immediately placed with a family or other rescue group go into boarding facilities until Corridor Rescue can find them a home. ""Volunteers and myself go visit these dogs on a weekly basis, so it gives them more social interaction,"" said Hoffman. ""We bring treats, blankets, take them outside on walks and hug them a lot."" Hoffman relies heavily on private donations to keep the operation going. So far, the group has relocated more than 180 strays from the corridor. ""The most proud moments are when we take a dog that is in horrible condition and we bring it back to life,"" said Hoffman. Corridor Rescue not only saves lives but helps build families as well, like Joan McKinney and her adoptive dog, Lotto. Hoffman and her group rescued Lotto from the corridor in 2009. ""It's truly a miracle, taking a dog like Lotto, in that bad a condition off the streets, and then putting him in a loving home with someone like Joan,"" said Hoffman. ""Lotto brings a lot of joy in my life. He's the sweetest dog,"" said McKinney. For Hoffman, the war will never be won until animal abandonment is extinct. ""Animal rescue is what I will do for the rest of my life,"" she said. ""I'll be ... trying to save an animal from my rocking chair."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- An Alabama teen was released on bail Monday, two days after his arrest for allegedly plotting to launch ""terrorist attacks"" in his high school. Derek Shrout was in a Russell County court Monday, where District Judge David Johnson set his bond at $75,000, prosecutor Buster Landreau said. According to CNN affiliates WRBL and WTVM, the teenager pleaded not guilty to attempted assault. The 17-year-old was arrested after a teacher at Russell County High School found a journal that ""contained several plans that looked like potential terrorist attacks, and attacks of violence and danger on the school,"" Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor said on Saturday. ""There were six students specifically named, and one teacher."" ""He had put a lot of thought into this,"" the sheriff said. ""It was obvious to us that there was more than just writing a story in a journal and it being fictitious."" Shrout's lawyer, Jeremy Armstrong, told reporters in court Monday that ""this was just a lot of talk from my client."" ""I believe he had no intentions ... to hurt anyone,"" Armstrong said to several media outlets, including WRBL. This weekend, authorities showed reporters 25 tobacco tins and two larger ones, each with holes drilled in them and pellets inside similar to BBs. Taylor said experts that his investigators consulted determined that, with a few more elements, the tins ""would absolutely blow up exactly the way he wrote it."" ""These ... devices were a step or two away from being ready to explode,"" the sheriff said. The suspect is a self-described white supremacist, though it isn't known if he was linked to any specific group, Taylor told the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group. ""At first through JROTC, he was confident, well-rounded. But as time went by, he was doing the whole white power thing,"" David Kelly, the senior class president at Russell County High School, told WTVM. Shrout began writing in the journal shortly after last month's massacre at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school that ended with 27 people, including the suspected shooter, dead. Taylor said that school shooting ""was potentially the spark that started him writing things down in a plan."" Opinion: How a boy becomes a killer . But Shrout's lawyer said he thinks his client's case may ""have been blown a little out of proportion, in light of what happened in Newtown."" ""Of course, everybody in our nation is on edge,"" Armstrong said. Under the conditions set Monday by the judge, Shrout must remain at home and will have an electric monitoring device, said Landreau. He cannot contact anyone at his school. His next court hearing is scheduled for February 12, according to Landreau.

"(CNN) -- In BBC America's new prime time drama, ""Copper,"" Irish-immigrant detective Kevin Corcoran roams from the filthy slums of Five Points to the glimmering sidewalks of Fifth Avenue -- all with a set of brass knuckles snugly resting on his fingers. The year is 1864, and the tattered remnants of an ongoing Civil War remain in New York City. Blood is regularly spilled on the cobblestones and in dirty back alleyways. No one gives a man carrying the body of a young dead girl through the streets a second glance, but they balk at the idea of women wanting to vote. It seems oddly fitting that ""Copper,"" premiering on Sunday at 10 p.m. ET, takes place in America, and is the channel's first original scripted series. The U.S. branch of the well-known British network wanted to explore a part of American history that has only been seen in ""Gangs of New York."" Historically accurate details, woven into the backbone of ""Copper,"" transform it from period drama to believable reality. For Anastasia Griffith, the world of ""Copper"" came to life as she was laced tightly into her corset, learning to breathe as her character, socialite Elizabeth Haverford, would breathe. For Ato Essandoh, it was leafing through the worn leather journal of his character, Dr. Matthew Freeman, to discover ornate, accurate sketches of medicinal roots from 1864. And for Tom Weston-Jones, it was opening a keepsake box of letters, only to find actual letters that gave him more insight into his character, detective Kevin Corcoran. Kevin Ryan became so immersed in his character, detective Francis Maguire, that he consistently ate with his prop knife. ""It's about honoring the details,"" Griffith said. ""And it's an added bonus if you have something to dig into, and take you away from yourself. Although the series carries certain devices of other crime dramas, they are covered in the grit and deceit of a point in New York's history that is rarely portrayed. The actors sport hand-sewn satin gowns and rugged leather coats against a realistic backdrop of swampy, methane stench-ridden Five Points and the clean-swept cream-colored sidewalks of Fifth Avenue on a 212,500 square-foot studio lot. Treachery, deceit and intrigue are rampant in Five Points, and disguised little better behind the facades of the Fifth Avenue brownstone. ""There is something very underdog-ish about all of the characters played by Kyle Schmid, Anastasia, Ato and I,"" Weston-Jones said. ""We've all come up from below for very different reasons."" His character, Corcoran, embodies a blend of backstreet tenacity and well-honed honor as he doggedly pursues the truth amidst his own crookedly led Sixth Precinct. The 10-part series, created by Tom Fontana (best known for ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and other dramas) and produced by Barry Levinson (the acclaimed director of films like ""Diner""), unfurls with Corcoran investigating a girl's death while trying to find his missing wife and solve his daughter's murder. Meanwhile, he reconnects with two men, aristocrat Robert Morehouse, played by Schmid, and physician Matthew Freeman, who Corcoran fought alongside during the Civil War. The series explores the mysterious events that forged their bond during their time served in the Union Army. While the plot may be full of dark twists and turns, there are also unexpected moments of humor. ""To find humor in the darkness is a very Barry [Levinson] thing,"" Griffith said. ""Barry always sees the humor in every moment. That's life -- however dark things get, the reality of the moment is actually kind of funny, and that's something Tom [Fontana] and Barry do very well, this balance of light and dark."" Moral ambiguity is what connects most of the characters to one another, although societal differences try to keep them apart. For Griffith, playing a woman in 1864 gave the added challenge of balancing an old-fashioned constraint with her own mettle. ""It was really about marrying two aspects: being tightly bound physically but at the same time, being very spirited and free inside,"" she said. Essandoh faced the same challenge as another intelligent ""underdog"" of the time. ""Kind of the way Anastasia is bound by her clothes, station and by being a woman, I am bound by being a black man in 1864, where racism is rampant and pretty much the norm of society,"" Essandoh said. ""He is a fantastically gifted physician and scientist so there is that want, especially as a man, to say 'look at all the stuff I am doing,' but not being able to express his own pride in his work and display it because of the unfortunate nature of racism."" The scenes are juxtapositions of brothels to drawing rooms, and ripped rags to tiered silk dresses. ""Copper"" layers these settings, between Five Points and Fifth Avenue, with Carmansville, a developing African-American community that later becomes part of Harlem, while weaving in societal tensions of immigration and race. Amidst the turbulence, ""Copper"" hopes to illustrate where America, and New York, came from by showing such a pivotal point in the city's history. ""We're really watching the birthplace of Manhattan happen and I think that is a pretty dynamic environment,"" Griffith said. But you may have to wait until the DVD releases to see an extra when Griffith and Schmid drop it like it's hot to Sir Mix-A-Lot's ""Baby Got Back"" in period costume during a ballroom scene. ""Sex, drugs, violence and Sir Mix-A Lot,"" Schmid and Weston-Jones joked. ""What's not to like?""

"(CNN) -- Before I set out to travel this world, 12 years ago, I used to believe that the human race as a whole was basically a few steps above wolves. That given the slightest change in circumstances, we would all, sooner or later, tear each other to shreds. That we were, at root, self-interested, cowardly, envious and potentially dangerous in groups. I have since come to believe -- after many meals with many different people in many, many different places -- that though there is no shortage of people who would do us harm, we are essentially good. That the world is, in fact, filled with mostly good and decent people who are simply doing the best they can. Everybody, it turns out, is proud of their food (when they have it). They enjoy sharing it with others (if they can). They love their children. They like a good joke. Sitting at the table has allowed me a privileged perspective and access that others, looking principally for ""the story,"" do not, I believe, always get.

"(CNN) -- We asked what you thought about hotels charging their guests to access Wi-Fi. As the subsequent influx of tweets and story comments showed, the issue generates strong and often divisive opinions. Some of you said that hotels charge exorbitant rates to access the web because they know guests have no other option if they want to go online. Others said that the cost of installing and maintaining a reliable wireless network for use by hundreds of people at a time comes with extensive costs that hotels must recoup through user charges. But is the issue as simple as that? Individual hotel policies on internet access and pricing are almost as divergent as the opinions the subject creates. Some mid-to-low budget hotels provide free access throughout their facilities while others only do so in selected areas, such as in the bar, lobby or restaurant. At the other end of the spectrum, some five-star resorts have been known to charge more than $40 a day on top of room rates for guests to access the web. So what did you have to say? Some of you were adamant that hotel Wi-Fi should always be free: . You get what you pay for . While some respondents were near evangelical in their demands for free web access, others said they were quite happy to pay for the internet as long as the price was reasonable and commensurate with the service received. Among them, Jingledew commented: ""I'd happily pay a buck or two for the convenience of a connection, but $10-$30 per night on top of $150 room is just pure extortion. If it was a true hardship, no hotel would offer it free."" Overcharging is getting old . Another popular theme to arise was that hotels that charge for internet access are damaging their own commercial prospects when others are providing the same services for free. For example, Todd_in_BMore commented: ""I have to admit I get truly insulted when I go to an upper-tier chain hotel who charges for usually poor quality internet access, knowing the mid-tier brands tend to offer it free ... ""Hotels really need to review their business model: overcharging for food, (telecommunications) and in-room entertainment is getting old fast. Even business travelers these days give some pause to paying for (convenience), we do have to justify those expense reports to clients more and more."" Hotels have to recoup costs . Others contended that hotels are well within their rights to charge for the costs they incur for for providing internet services to their guests. Dkf295 commented: ""I work for a company that installs and supports hotel Wi-Fi. People expect four to five bars signal and enough bandwidth to stream video at all times. ""For a 200-room hotel at close to full occupancy, where half the occupied rooms are using the internet, that's 1Mbps a person -- if they're paying for a 100Mbps fiber circuit that can easily cost $750 or more a month. What if they've got a bunch of business travelers using up more bandwidth? What if they're watching Netflix on one device and browsing on another? ""A solid, reliable network might cost a quarter million dollars for such a hotel too ... if you need to spend a quarter million dollars every four years for a new network, 40 grand for the ISP, $12,000 for 24/7 tech support for the network and its guests, as well as money for any maintenance or equipment failures, suddenly charging people for internet makes a bit more sense."" Pay by use . And some of you supported a tiered-payment structure, where basic Wi-Fi is free but users pay for using more bandwidth. ""I support that method. I think that's perfectly reasonable,"" said nordicnews. CaptainVic commented: ""You don't expect to pay for standard TV in your room, but you (do) for 'pay per view' movies. So the same should apply to Wi-Fi. ""The acid test of any tiered system will be an acceptable level of base connectivity, and the option to pay for a step up in bandwidth, be it for rich media streaming or to avoid the automatic hourly drop outs which is so annoying when you are trying to keep a remote connection open to your office network."" Wi-Fi is a must-have . But many of you felt that these days, unlike many hotel facilities, free Wi-Fi is an essential. Aznsk8s87 commented: ""In this day and age, it's completely unreasonable to charge for Wi-Fi. If you're traveling internationally, odds are that you need the internet in order to conduct business. ""Fortunately for a lot of international business travelers, this will go on the company tab. But even so - it's a service that is far more important than pay-per-view or whatever is in the minibar."" And @s77W tweeted: . What do you think? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.","Many hotels charge for Wi-Fi -- we asked what you think of hotel internet fees .

"(CNN) -- Fireworks going off inside his own house, a car crash in his first week at Manchester City, throwing a dart at a youth team player and that iconic image of a t-shirt adorned with the words, ""Why always me?"" The English Premier League will miss the crazy antics of Mario Balotelli. The 22-year-old has returned to Italy after signing a four-and-a-half-year deal with AC Milan following an action-packed spell with a club he last season helped end a 44-year wait for the league title. 'Sink or swim for 'Super Mario'? He has struggled to regain the form that took Italy to the final of Euro 2012, where he was the tournament's joint top scorer with three goals. ""I didn't start the season very well with City so I am coming to Milan to revive myself and to do well,"" said the Italy striker, who has completed a return to Serie A in a deal said to be worth around $30 million. ""I have wanted to play for Milan for a long time, but I was with other teams. When this chance came along I grabbed it. I hope Milan can become a big club again."" Balotelli was welcomed to the San Siro on Thursday's transfer deadline day as Milan's website reported his arrival with the banners ""Yes always you!"" and ""One of us."" It published a roundup of Italian newspaper headlines, one of which read: ""Mamma and Papa wanted him home"" -- a reference to Balotelli's foster parents Silvia and Francesco, who adopted him from his Ghanaian immigrant family at the age of three. Balotelli went to Manchester from Milan's city rival Internazionale for $37.8 million in 2010, one of several big-money deals funded by the English club's Abu Dhabi owners. He helped City win the FA Cup that season, its first trophy since 1976, but his time there was dogged by controversy ever since he crashed his car while en-route to the training ground just days after his arrival. Balotelli tussles with manager Mancini . Earlier this month, photographs emerged of him having a ""training ground bust-up"" with manager Roberto Mancini. Balotelli endured a love-hate relationship with Mancini, with whom he had previously worked at Inter Milan and who has acted as a father figure for the player. Balotelli said he spoke at length with the 48-year-old before farewelling his City teammates at a meal on Tuesday. ""It was a very emotional for me,"" he told City's website. ""I spoke with Roberto before I went to speak to the players. We spoke for some time about lots of things. He was sad, and I was too. But it was a good conversation. Balotelli settles dispute with Man City . ""I love Roberto, he has been very important for my career, and I will always thank him for having trust and faith in me. ""Being at City was an important part of my life and career. I needed to grow up like a player and as a person and it has been a very good experience for me."" Balotelli's first Premier League goals in November 2010 were overshadowed by a red card, the first of four he would go on to receive during his City career. Balotelli continued to catch attention both on and off the pitch, none more so than in October 2011 after a firework was set off in the bathroom of his home. Time to get tough on racism in football . Emergency services were called to deal with that incident which occurred the day before he scored twice in City's 6-1 win at rival Manchester United and revealed that infamous t-shirt -- and days later he was bizarrely named as the public face of a fireworks safety campaign. He broke a 48-hour curfew to visit a curry restaurant in December 2011 before a game against Chelsea, which was quickly followed by a training-ground bust-up with teammate Micah Richards. Trouble continued to follow Balotelli around and he was given a four-match ban in January 2012 after appearing to stamp on the head of Tottenham's Scott Parker during a Premier League game. He gatecrashed an Inter Milan press conference in March 2012 when the club was preparing to unveil new manager Andrea Stramaccioni, which was followed with another red card in the game at Arsenal. Balotelli scored just 20 Premier League goals in two years, and his only assist in 54 top-flight appearances famously led to Sergio Aguero's title-winning strike on the final day of last season.","Mario Balotelli joins AC Milan after leaving Manchester City .

"(CNN) -- Twitter users erupted in anger Saturday after discovering shirts listed on Amazon with a slogan that appeared to promote rape and violence against women. The shirt read ""Keep Calm and Rape On"" and was available on Amazon's UK website. The company that prints the shirts, U.S.-based Solid Gold Bomb, removed the listing after it was notified of the slogan. The company also removed a shirt with the slogan ""Keep Calm and Hit Her."" Solid Gold Bomb apologized, saying the slogans were computer-generated and the company did not deliberately create them. House passes Violence Against Women Act after GOP version defeated . Founder Michael Fowler posted a message on the company's website saying he was ""extremely sorry"" for the issue. ""We simply do not produce poor humor or offensive products,"" Fowler wrote. ""As a father, husband, brother and son, I would never promote such product in our company and it was clear to see this when looking across the millions of T-shirts that we offer or can produce on demand.

Amazon's spokesman in Britain, Ben Howes, gave a statement to CNN saying, ""I can confirm that those items are not available for sale."" The shirts were never actually printed, explained Pete Ashton, a blogger in Birmingham, England, who writes about the Internet.

"(CNN) -- As Arwa Al-Hujaili begins her legal career, she has not only her own expectations to live up to, but those of a generation: she has just become Saudi Arabia's first female lawyer. After three years of petitioning the Ministry of Justice, Al-Hujaili, 25, has finally received her registration to practice as a trainee lawyer, the first woman to do so. ""People tell me I'm a pioneer and I feel I need to live up to what they expect of me,"" says Al-Hujaili. ""There's a great sense of responsibility. From now on, people will look at everything I do."" Al-Hujaili, who decided on a legal career while preparing for university, graduated from King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah in 2010 and expected to be able to practice as a lawyer immediately. But much to her frustration, she has spent three years in a professional no-man's land, able to work as ""legal consultant"" but not officially recognized as a lawyer. Universities in Saudi Arabia began taking female law students in 2005 and the first graduates completed their studies in 2008. But the optimism soon wore off when female graduates found themselves unable to gain registration to practice. Many of Al-Hujaili's classmates, frustrated by the lack of progress in Saudi Arabia, left the country to work abroad. But Al-Hujaili stayed in her hometown of Jeddah and continued to apply for registration. In the meantime, some of her contemporaries began an online campaign to push for change, including a Facebook group called ""I am a lawyer,"" a Twitter campaign and YouTube videos from women arguing their right to practice. In October last year, after accepting a petition with 3,000 signatures submitted by a group of female law graduates, King Abdullah announced that women would be allowed to register as lawyers. However, the Ministry of Justice still wasn't processing applications from women. ""I kept on following up, but they wouldn't give me an answer either way,"" says Al-Hujaili. A friend and vocal campaigner, Hanouf Al-Hazzaa, then wrote a newspaper article in which she pleaded with King Abdullah to intervene. Al-Hazzaa had been one of Saudi Arabia's first batch of female law graduates in 2008, but had gone to the United States to practice after becoming disillusioned with the situation at home. ""I wrote about how depressing the situation was, saying here we were, many of us working for federal courts outside the Kingdom, because we had no future inside it,"" says Al-Hazzaa . Two days later, the Ministry of Justice announced they would start accepting applications and soon afterwards Al-Hujaili's application was granted. Now working as a trainee lawyer and due to qualify fully in two years, Al-Hujaili hopes to pursue a career in family law to help other Saudi women. ""Many women really need to talk to female lawyers, and I want to help those women to get their rights,"" she says. Al-Hujaili knows the path ahead won't always be smooth. ""The social aspect is a very considerable one, for society to accept women lawyers, it's something new,"" she says. ""It will be also challenging for the judiciary system to deal with female lawyers, but I think we can overcome these hardships if we prove ourselves as competent lawyers."" Adam Coogle, a Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch, agrees that challenges remain for female lawyers. ""Saudi judges have a lot of leeway, and can remove a lawyer from a case,"" says Coogle. ""She might face judges rejecting her counsel or not allowing her to speak, particularly if that judge is conservative and doesn't want women to speak in court."" Other female lawyers are now following in Al-Hujaili's footsteps and gaining registration, although exact numbers are unclear. For Al-Hujaili, being able to pursue a legal career at home was well worth the wait. ""Success is a nice feeling, especially when it comes after tribulation,"" she says.","Arwa Al-Hujaili has become Saudi Arabia's first female lawyer .

"Washington (CNN) -- If all goes according to plan for President Barack Obama, his two-term presidency may end up being a case of ""second verse, same as the first."" He won re-election last year by touting a first-term recovery from economic recession, as well as a major domestic achievement in health care reform and a major foreign policy triumph in taking out Osama bin Laden. Now five months into his second term, the priorities and potentially achievable outcomes appear to be a similar trifecta. Obama is pushing hard domestically for an overhaul of the immigration system that would be similar to the health care reform bill in its scope and appeal to the Democratic base. He also is increasing U.S. aid, including military assistance, to Syrian rebels trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the economy continues to grow slowly but consistently, with the Federal Reserve signaling last week that it intended to end stimulus policies adopted in response to the recession inherited by Obama when he became president in 2009. The president has other objectives, including executive actions to reduce carbon emissions he plans to announce Tuesday as part of a second-term push on climate change. A major push of his first term included a sharp reduction over time in auto emissions. His critics, especially conservative Republicans, will continue opposing his priorities and attacking his administration for what they call overreach and excesses that they say demonstrate the perils of a big government philosophy. In a statement on Monday, the Republican National Committee listed controversies from the Obama presidency -- the government-aided Solyndra solar panel firm that went bankrupt; the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status; and wasteful spending by the IRS and the General Services Administration -- as examples of big government gone wild. ""Obama may not like the big vs. small government debate, but his scandals are tied to a government that keeps growing,"" the RNC statement said. Dominating the Washington agenda this week is the immigration reform bill drafted by a bipartisan group of senators in an attempt to resolve a bitter debate over 11 million people living illegally in the country. The proposal offers a pathway to eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants while strengthening border, visa and employment controls in an attempt to bridge what for years has been a political chasm. However, divisions among congressional Republicans remain the biggest threat to passage of the measure. Conservatives oppose offering legal status to those living illegally in the country, calling such a move an amnesty for lawbreakers. They want tougher border security measures, and continually criticize the bipartisan Senate proposal as similar to what they call the too-broad and misguided health care reform law passed by Democrats with no GOP support in 2010. However, moderate Republicans want to avoid another electoral drubbing by Hispanic voters as occurred last year, when Obama won a huge majority of the nation's largest minority demographic in defeating GOP nominee Mitt Romney. They consider the bipartisan Senate proposal as their best chance to finally move past their party's anti-immigrant stigma, while conservatives call such a move a trap for Republicans because they believe most of the newly legal voters under the law would be Democrats. U.S. Census figures show the growing political voice of minorities in the United States, particularly Hispanics -- the largest minority demographic at roughly 17% of the population. Almost half of the country's children under age five are minorities, portending a near future in which non-whites outnumber whites. Already, five states have a larger percentage of minorities than white residents. While the Democratic-majority Senate is expected to pass the bipartisan immigration measure with support from a dozen or so Republicans, the GOP-led House remains much more hostile to a broad immigration bill. Opponents in the House want to slow the momentum built by a bipartisan compromise in the Senate announced last week that appeared to ensure support from a solid majority of senators. House conservatives call for breaking up the legislation into smaller pieces, rather than voting on a comprehensive proposal that includes both the border protection measures they want and the ""legal status"" provisions they oppose. ""If you look through history, we don't do big things very well in Washington, so I think it's better to break it apart, do smaller pieces, have a heavy debate about it,"" GOP Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania told ABC on Sunday. Referring to the health care reform bill still despised by Republicans three years after becoming law, Kelly said ""any time you rush anything through that big -- this was up to 1,100 pages -- I doubt that anybody's really read it and been able to really get through piece of it."" House Speaker John Boehner said last week he would refuse to introduce an immigration bill unless it had support from a majority of Republicans. However, it appeared that the only way the bipartisan Senate plan could pass the House would be if it received strong support from Democrats bolstered by backing from a minority of Republicans. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, a member of the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" that drafted the immigration plan, warned that any attempt by House Republicans to stall or block the issue would bring a strong public backlash. ""We have all kinds of allies who are usually conservative pushing for this bill -- the business community, the high-tech community, the evangelical community, the Catholic bishops, the growers throughout the country,"" Schumer told CNN on Sunday, adding: ""I think they're going to have to act whether they have a majority of Republicans or not.""","President Barack Obama seeks a similar second-term record as his first .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- From the south-eastern edge of Europe, Turkish government officials expressed concern about the gains by right-wing parties in the European Parliament elections. EC President Jose Manuel Barroso, right, welcomes Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a meeting in Brussels in Jaunuary. ""The tendency in Europe towards the extreme right is worrisome,"" said Murat Mercan, the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the Turkish parliament and a top-ranking member of the ruling Justice and Development Party. In 2005, Turkey formally launched membership negotiations to become the first majority Muslim country to join the European Union. But in an interview Monday with CNN, Mercan called the accession talks ""very difficult, very complicated, very troubled."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy both oppose Turkish membership in the EU. The leader of Sarkozy's Union for a Popular Movement [UMP], Xavier Bertrand, declared that the party's candidates for the European Parliament had signed written promises that, if elected, they would reject Turkey's EU bid. The UMP saw significant gains in this month's elections. Meanwhile, Geert Wilders, the leader of the Netherland's far-right Party for Freedom, which also won seats in the vote, was quoted last week saying Turkey would not join the European Union, ""not in 10 years, not in a million years"" because it was a Muslim country. Turkey's foreign ministry denounced this election campaign rhetoric last week, saying it creates ""a distorted and particularly xenophobia-inducing environment for the European electorate."" Reaction in the Turkish press was fairly muted on Monday, though the Milli Gazete newspaper declared that ""Nazis came out of the elections in Europe."" On Saturday, the religious conservative Zaman newspaper wrote: ""Turkey-EU relations will be affected negatively in the case of rightist and racist parties strengthening in the EP. There are fears that racist parties who have common animosity against Turkey can reach numbers enough to form a group in the parliament."" According to a recent poll published by Istanbul's Bahcesehir University, 57 percent of Turks surveyed said they still supported Turkish membership in the EU.","Turkish government concerned by gains by right-wing parties in EU elections .

"(CNN) -- A collapse on the penultimate tee of the Players Championship by Sergio Garcia allowed Tiger Woods to win the $1.7 million tournament for the second time in his career. Spain's Garcia looked to be heading into a playoff with world No. 1 Woods before hitting two tee shots into the water at the 17th hole to throw away any chance he had of winning the title he picked up in 2008. A war of words between the two players broke out on Saturday when Garcia blamed Woods for crowd noise which he claimed distracted him during his swing. It led to Garcia describing Woods as ""not the nicest guy on Tour"", but the American had the last laugh as a final round of 70 saw him finish top of the leaderboard on 13-under par, six strokes ahead of the Spaniard. ""It sounds like I was the bad guy here,"" Garcia told the PGA Tour's official website. ""I was the victim. I don't have any regrets of anything. ""That hole has been good to me for the most part,"" Garcia said of the 17th after carding a final round of 76. ""Today, it wasn't. That's the way it is. That's the kind of hole it is. You've got to love it for what it is. ""It's always nice to have a chance at beating the No. 1 player in the world, but unfortunately for me, I wasn't able to this week."" For Woods it was a fourth tournament win of the year, one which moved him onto 78 PGA Tour wins, four off Sam Snead's record of 82. ""We just go out there and play,"" said Woods, who won the Players for the first time in 2001 and took his earnings for 2013 to over $5.8m from just seven tournaments. ""I had an opportunity to win the golf tournament when I was tied for the lead, and I thought I handled the situation well and really played well when I really needed to. And that's something I'm excited about it."" Sweden's David Lingmerth, playing alongside Garcia, missed a birdie putt on the 17th which would have seen him pull level with Woods. In the end Lingmerth (72) finished 11 under in a three-way tie for second with American duo Kevin Streelman (67) and Jeff Maggert (70). Garcia was part of a seven-strong group on seven under which also included two-time major winner Rory McIlroy and former world No. 1 Lee Westwood.","Tiger Woods wins the Players Championship after collapse from Sergio Garcia .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will step back into the national debate over free speech and abortion, accepting an appeal Monday on the rights of protesters outside medical clinics. A challenge to a Massachusetts law concerns government-mandated buffer zones set up around facilities that perform abortions. Oral arguments and an eventual ruling are not expected until next year. The state's ""selective exclusion law"" makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic ""employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment"" to ""enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk"" within 35 feet of ""a reproductive health care facility."" Anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances. But a federal appeals court in January said ""the right of the state to take reasonable steps to ensure the safe passage of persons wishing to enter health care facilities cannot seriously be questioned."" The court had rejected a similar challenge to the law four years ago. Municipalities in Montana, Colorado, Florida, California and elsewhere have enacted similar ""fixed"" and ""floating"" buffer zone laws. The Massachusetts case is McCullen v. Coakley (12-1168).","The Supreme Court accepts an appeal on the rights of protesters outside clinics .

"(CNN) -- Recent remarks by U.S. President Barack Obama that he is not thinking of military action against Iran are positive, according to Iran's supreme leader, Iran's state-run Press TV reported Thursday. But Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized Obama's threat to impose more sanctions on Iran, saying Tehran's enemies have been imposing repeated sanctions ever since the country's Islamic Revolution more than 30 years ago ""in the hope of turning Iranians away from the Islamic establishment,"" the television network said. The continued threat of sanctions demonstrates Obama's illusions on the issue, Khamenei said, adding that such a move will backfire on U.S. officials and fail. In remarks earlier this week, Obama made clear that the Iranian development of a nuclear weapon remains unacceptable, and that the United States ""will always have Israel's back."" However, he told reporters Tuesday, that comment ""was not a military doctrine that we were laying out for any particular military action."" It is ""deeply in everybody's interests -- the United States, Israel and the world's -- to see if this can be resolved in a peaceful fashion,"" he said of Iran's nuclear issue. And in an interview with The Atlantic this month, Obama cautioned against an Israeli strike on Iran. ""At a time when there is not a lot of sympathy for Iran, and its only real ally (Syria) is on the ropes, do we want a distraction in which suddenly Iran can portray itself as a victim?"" The president, however, has said all options are on the table regarding Iran. ""I think both the Iranian and the Israeli governments recognize that, when the United States says it is unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon, we mean what we say,"" Obama told The Atlantic. He told reporters Tuesday that sanctions already imposed on Iran are having significant effects. Tehran recently signaled a willingness to let U.N. inspectors visit a military base that some suspect is involved in the development of nuclear weapons, a move that could possibly ratchet down rising tensions . The question of how to address the Iranian nuclear issue has repeatedly been raised in the U.S. presidential campaign. Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney has harshly criticized Obama for not taking a more aggressive posture toward Tehran, as well as for failing to speak out more prominently on behalf of anti-regime protesters in 2009. Iran insists its nuclear program is only for peaceful, civilian purposes, but the United States, Israel, and many other countries suspect it is trying to develop nuclear weapons.","Ayatollah Ali Khamenei: Obama's recent remarks are positive .

"(CNN) -- If Fort Hood shooting suspect Maj. Nidal Hasan follows through on representing himself at trial, he'll get the rare opportunity to cross-examine victims on the stand. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, faces a court-martial on murder charges in a November 2009 shooting rampage at the base near Killeen, Texas, that left 13 people dead and dozens more wounded. He has been cleared to represent himself in the case. Jury selection was supposed to begin Wednesday, but Hasan, 42, has requested more time to prepare for trial. ""If Hasan is the lawyer, he will be cross-examining victims, people that he shot, which is a really appalling prospect,"" said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN senior legal analyst. One victim said he is ""very upset"" by the prospect of facing questioning by Hasan on the witness stand. Staff Sgt. Alonso Lonsford, who was shot seven times, including once in the head, said he found the strength to survive because he wanted to see justice served on a man who betrayed his uniform. Still, he is not relishing his day on the stand. ""The way I look at it, Maj. Hasan is an Army psychiatrist and so he's very well trained on how to deal with service members that suffer ... traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder,"" Lonsford said. ""I know that he's going to try to push certain triggers to get a physical reaction out of us to try to help him on his quest to become a martyr, so basically we have to outsmart and outwit him at the game he's trying to play."" Toobin concurred that Hasan was striving for martyrdom after the defendant told a judge he was defending Taliban leadership, specifically Mullah Mohammed Omar, during the massacre. ""He is trying to become a martyr, trying to be executed for this crime,"" Toobin said, adding that Hasan's defense amounted to a ""form of suicide by judge."" Many murder defendants have represented themselves at trial. Ted Bundy cross-examined witnesses. Long Island Railroad shooter Colin Ferguson cross-examined his own victims. After the testimony of Maryanne Phillips, the first person shot during the 1993 massacre, Ferguson asked if she had closed here eyes while playing dead after she was shot, according to a New York Times account from his 1995 trial. ""Yes, so you wouldn't come back and shoot me again,"" she said. ""But if your eyes were closed, how could you see the man you say was doing the shooting?"" Ferguson asked, according to the paper. Ferguson was found guilty. He will serve life in prison as his earliest possible release date is 2309.","Cleared to represent himself, Fort Hood shooting suspect could question victims during trial .

"(CNN) -- Hyundai is recalling more than 220,000 Santa Fe SUVs and Sonata sedans because of potential problems with their air bags. The recall affects almost 200,000 SUVs from the 2007-2009 model years, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. These vehicles' front passenger airbags may not deploy in the event of a crash because of a possible problem with their occupant classification system, which gauges the size of a passenger and based on that whether an air bag should be deployed. The system may need to be recalibrated to detect to ""small statured adults,"" the federal safety agency said. The company is also recalling more than 22,000 sedans from the 2012-2013 model years, according to the administration. These cars' curtain side airbags may inflate for no apparent reason because of a manufacturing error. Hyundai dealers are expected to notify owners and replace the curtain side airbags free of charge, the NHTSA said. Dealers will also update the classification software for free in the affected SUVs.","The recall affects almost 200,000 Santa Fe SUVs and more than 22,000 sedans .

"(CNN) -- This bizarre-looking concoction of glass, liquid and tubes could one day bring a whole new meaning to the idea of natural lighting. The new ""bio-light"" concept designed by Dutch electronics company Philips creates light in the same way that bioluminescent living organisms like fireflies and glow worms do. The phenomenon of bioluminescence is created by a chemical reaction where an enzyme called luciferase interacts with a light-emitting molecule called luciferin. In the bio-light a collection of hand-blown jars -- held in place by a steel frame -- contain a measure of bioluminescent bacteria which glow green when fed methane gas -- in this case through individual silicon tubes routed through a household waste digester. Harnessing these biological techniques could help redefine how we consume energy in the home, says Philips. ""Designers have an obligation to explore solutions which are by nature less energy-consuming and non-polluting,"" says Clive van Heerden, senior director of design-led innovation at Philips Design. ""We need to push ourselves to rethink domestic appliances entirely, how homes consume energy and how entire communities can pool their resources,"" van Heerden said in a statement. Jim Haseloff, a plant biologist from the UK's University of Cambridge says the bio-light is a very provocative idea. ""It's appealing because it brings two things together which you wouldn't normally associate,"" Haseloff said. ""I don't think you want to imagine that everyone's going to start putting bacterial cultures into their own home for lighting but as a way of exploring the idea it's quite interesting,"" he added. It part of a wider swing to sustainable technologies, Haseloff says, but he doesn't see bioluminescent lights competing with LED and other low-energy lights in the future. ""When you move out of the normal (lighting) area -- illuminated walkways and things like that -- where things could essentially be growing and delivering light for free, that's where you're going to have applications."" Philips envisages similar applications, perhaps using glowing plants to illuminate road verges or as warning strips on flights of stairs. It also says these same bioluminescence techniques could be used as a diagnostic indicator of pollution levels or even as a biosensor for monitoring diseases like diabetes. Philips says the bio-light would be more suited to providing mood lighting than ""functional illumination."" It forms part of a wider Philips Design's Microbial Home project which imagines an ""integrated cyclical ecosystem"" in the home where traditional waste is recycled to address sustainability issues.","Bio-light concept looks at new biological ways of creating light .

"(CNN) -- Two months ago, Emad Ghavidel turned on the television in Tehran and saw graphic footage of an injured Syrian child crying out in pain. The 24-year-old Iranian rapper was horrified by the violence and the government's brutal crackdown on Homs. The more Ghavidel learned about it, the angrier he became. He decided to channel his frustration into his music. He wrote a song, ""The Battle of Homs,"" expressing support for the Syrian protesters and lashing out against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. ""I swear to the laments of grieving mothers, I swear to the tears of grieving mothers, you will pay for it, Bashar al-Assad,"" raps Ghavidel. ""Even if I am drowned in my own blood, I will not shut up."" Within weeks, the song went viral on YouTube and was an instant sensation in the Middle East. ""I received many encouraging messages from both Syrians and Iranians,"" said Hamed Fard, an Iranian who helped Ghavidel produce the song. Many Iranians sympathize with the Syrian people, and the two peoples share a common bond, said Ahed al-Hendi, a Syrian who now serves as Arabic Programs coordinator at cyberdissidents.org. In 2009, many Iranians were arrested and tortured -- and some were even killed -- as they protested the disputed presidential election. ""When the Green Revolution was sparked in Iran, we stood with the Iranian people and supported their cause,"" Al-Hendi said. ""Now, lots of Iranians are supporting our cause. ""We are all facing one enemy. The mullah's regime in Iran and the Assad regime (in Syria) support each other openly, and their alliance is very rooted. But we need an alliance between a democratic Iran and Syria, not an alliance of dictatorship."" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad recently praised Syrian officials for how they ""are managing"" the yearlong uprising in Syria. Also, activists claim to have found a series of e-mails that showed al-Assad took advice from Iran on how to handle the unrest. Throughout the uprising, the Syrian government has described opposition leaders as terrorists looking to destabilize the country. To date, more than 9,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the United Nations. ""As a human and a journalist, it is unbearable to witness this crime,"" said Sasan Aghai, an Iranian who works for the Sobh-e Azadi newspaper. ""Everyone around the world who cares about human rights should be bothered by what it happening in Syria. It's genocide."" This is not Aghai's first foray into political activism. As an active supporter of the Green Movement, he was arrested for ""activity against the country's security"" and spent time in Evin prison, the notorious prison for Iran's political dissidents. Artists were also among those arrested. Aria Aramnejad, a young Iranian pop singer, was taken into custody after he posted a song on YouTube in support of the Green Movement. Ghavidel is keenly aware of the risks he faces as a rapper. Iran's Ministry of Islamic Guidance does not consider rap an art form, so no Iranian rapper can get government permission to record a song. ""All Iranian rappers work underground,"" he said. ""We all have difficulties recording and distributing our songs, but I don't let these problems stop me. ""People ask me if I'm worried about the consequences of my song, but I don't believe I've said anything wrong. I want to hope that there is enough freedom of speech in my country that I can criticize a mass murder."" Such support has not gone unnoticed by the Syrian opposition. The Syrian National Council recently published a letter thanking the citizens of Iran. ""It is important for all of us to know that we share one region and that our struggles and freedoms are connected,"" the letter said. ""The Syrian and Iranian regimes have cooperated very closely throughout the years to oppress their own people and to destabilize the region around them. We believe that the only way that our people can prosper is by cooperation and mutual respect to each other's past, present and future aspirations."" Would a Syrian revolution have an effect on Iran? Aghai thinks it is unlikely. ""I don't think the Syrian revolution will result in an Iranian revolution as well,"" he said. ""But after losing one of its good allies in the region, we can say that the power of the Iranian regime will start to fade.""","Many Iranians sympathize with the Syrian people and the violence they are dealing with .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Financial columnist Michelle Singletary maps out a financial rescue plan for Tisa McGhee, a 39-year-old, single mother of two who has lost her job and watched her debts pile up. Here's what you can do if you're in a similar position. In the Short Term . 1. Stick to a budget. I started by giving Tisa a blank financial worksheet to fill out. By looking at the full financial picture, I saw some expenses she could cut. First, she's paying $220 a month for cell phones for herself and her daughters. She should stick with the cheapest plan -- no downloading ring tones, surfing the Internet, or texting for the girls. Second, she has to cut back on restaurant meals, one of the most common ways people waste money. Third, she needs to spend less on transportation. Ideally, 6 to 15 percent of your net income should go to transportation costs (including your car payment, gas, and insurance); Tisa is spending more than 18 percent. I also advised her to make a list of top priorities and, every time she's tempted to buy something, pull out that list and look at it. Oprah.com: How to be a black-belt shopper . 2. Stay on top of the mortgage. Part of Tisa's trouble is her adjustable-rate mortgage. When housing prices were rising, a homeowner could refinance when interest rates went up. But once home prices began to fall, that was no longer an option for many borrowers. While Tisa's interest rate was rising, the value of her home was dropping -- from $302,000 to about $230,000 by last November, according to an estimate by Zillow.com. Thanks to her emergency fund, she was able to keep up with the higher mortgage payments until August 2008. But then she stopped paying, and the lender began foreclosure proceedings. She eventually sought help through the Obama administration's Making Home Affordable program (MakingHomeAffordable.gov), which allows strapped borrowers to refinance or modify their mortgages. Tisa's lender offered to lower her monthly payment from $3,180 to $1,747; she began making the new payments last July but stopped because her lender never sent her the proper paperwork. I suggested Tisa turn to NeighborWorks America (NW.org), a nonprofit that helps consumers avoid foreclosure, and the agency intervened. If you are having trouble paying your mortgage, you can also contact a free counselor approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (find one through HopeNow.com or at 888-995-4673). Oprah.com: Unlocking the keys to your mortgage woes . 3. Stop making extra debt payments. Tisa has been trying to dig herself out of debt by paying more than the minimum on her credit cards. Normally that would be smart. But because she is unemployed, I advised her to preserve as much cash as possible, making basic expenses -- food, housing, utilities, and transportation -- her highest priority. 4. Get financial counseling. Tisa needs to work one-on-one with a credit counselor. Counselors with the National Foundation for Credit Counseling can provide free or lowcost debt help. To find a counselor, go to DebtAdvice.org or call 800-388-2227. Look for accredited counselors who have independent certification and training in budgeting, consumer credit, and debt management. Oprah.com: 9 small steps that will pay off next year . In the long term: . 1. Stop using shopping as therapy. Emotional spending causes a lot of people to end up in serious debt. Seventynine percent of women go on spending sprees to cheer themselves up, according to a 2009 study released by the University of Hertfordshire, in England. Forty percent of the women surveyed named ""depression"" as a reason to go shopping. 2. Save to buy a used car. Tisa, who has spent almost $30,000 over the past six years on two leased cars, needs to eke out some money to pay cash for a used car when her current lease is up. Yes, you can lease a car for less each month than it would cost you to buy the same vehicle, but at the end of that lease, you have no car. In the long term, buying a car and keeping it for years saves more money. 3. Aggressively pay down debt. After Tisa starts working full-time again, she needs to follow what I call the Debt Dash Plan: List your debts, starting with the smallest. Take all the extra money you can find in your budget and apply it to that debt, and make only the minimum payments on your other debts. When you pay off the first debt, move on to the one with the next lowest balance, and so on. This strategy works because people get an emotional boost from eliminating one of their debts quickly, which motivates them to stick to their debt repayment plan. 4. Pay down student loans. Once Tisa is back on her feet financially, she must start paying off her student loans, because the interest is killing her. An income-based repayment plan for her federal loans will cap her monthly payment at an affordable amount based on income and family size. (For information about this plan, go to Ibrinfo.org) Her lender will determine her eligibility and how much she must pay each month. (But, in exchange for lower monthly payments, she may end up paying more interest than under a standard ten-year repayment plan.) 5. Build the consulting business. Tisa has already started her business, Mc3 Consulting Inc., which teaches nonprofits how to improve their services and internal operations. ""Mc3 Consulting is the seed I am planting for my girls,"" she says. ""I want them to see their mother be successful and show them that we can turn this situation around. I want them to learn from my mistakes."" Tisa has a good business plan and great contacts, but until she has enough contracts to cover all her expenses and debt, she needs to pursue and stay in a full-time job. She should continue to seek advice, especially to steer clear of tax problems. One place to start is score (Score.org), a nonprofit association of working and retired executives and business owners who donate their time to advising entrepreneurs. Tisa has been financially solid before, and she can do it again. She needs to set a budget, get rid of her debts, and keep spending in check. Recognizing her issues is a big part of the battle. ""A combination of factors led me to where I am today,"" she said, ""but I can't regret those things. They're helping me become the woman I hope to be someday."" Oprah.com: 25 ways to save a bundle .

"Rome (CNN) -- Black smoke billowed from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel Tuesday night, indicating that cardinals gathered at the Vatican to elect a new pope had not chosen one in the first ballot of their conclave. The start of the secret election got underway earlier in the day, as the heavy wooden doors to the chapel swung closed on the 115 Roman Catholic cardinals charged with selecting the next pontiff. The next round of voting will begin Wednesday morning. Results will be revealed by puffs of smoke from the chimney following each ballot. Black smoke, no pope. White smoke, success. On a day rich with symbolism, the scarlet-clad cardinals entered the Sistine Chapel in solemn procession, chanting prayers and watched over by the paintings of Renaissance artist Michelangelo. Led by the conclave's senior cardinal, Giovanni Battista Re, each of the cardinal-electors -- those under age 80 who are eligible to vote -- then swore an oath of secrecy. A designated official then gave the order, in Latin, to those not authorized to remain, ""Extra omnes"" -- that is, ""Everyone out."" With all those not taking part in the conclave gone, the cardinals will remain locked in isolation until one candidate garners two-thirds of their votes. That man will emerge from the process as the new spiritual leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. Selecting a pope . Huddled under umbrellas as rain came down, crowds of onlookers watched on big screens set up in St. Peter's Square until the doors to the Sistine Chapel were shut. 'Noble mission' Earlier, the cardinals celebrated a morning Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, where they prayed for guidance in making a choice that could be crucial to the direction of a church rocked by scandal in recent years. Applause echoed around St. Peter's as Cardinal Angelo Sodano, dean of the College of Cardinals, offered thanks for the ""brilliant pontificate"" of Benedict XVI, whose unexpected resignation precipitated the selection of a new pope. Sodano's homily focused on a message of love and unity, calling on all to cooperate with the new pontiff in the service of the church. ""My brothers, let us pray that the Lord will grant us a pontiff who will embrace this noble mission with a generous heart,"" he concluded. Members of the public had waited in long lines Tuesday morning to join the Mass. As the service began, the morning sunshine came to an abrupt end, with the skies letting loose thunder, lightning and a torrential downpour. Before the service, the cardinal-electors had moved into Casa Santa Marta, their residence at the Vatican for the duration of the conclave. Jamming devices have been put in place to stop them from communicating with the outside world via mobile phones or other electronic means as they make their decision. Rome is abuzz . Rome was abuzz Monday with preparations for the conclave, from the 5,600 journalists the Vatican said had been accredited to cover the event to the red curtains unfurled from the central balcony at St. Peter's, the spot where the world will meet the new pope once he is elected. Tailors have completed sets of clothes for the new pope to wear as soon as he is elected, in three sizes. Video released by the Vatican over the weekend showed the installation of a pair of stoves inside the chapel. One is used to burn the cardinals' ballots after they are cast and the other to send up the smoke signal -- the one that alerts the world that a vote has been taken and whether there's a new pope. Workers scaled the roof of the chapel Saturday to install the chimneys. Possible papal contenders . When cardinals elected Benedict in 2005, the white smoke signaling the decision came about six hours after an earlier, inconclusive vote, Lombardi said. It took another 50 minutes for Benedict to dress, pray and finally appear on the balcony of St. Peter's, he said. The longest conclave held since the turn of the 20th century lasted five days. On Monday, cardinals held the last of several days of meetings, known as General Congregations, to discuss church affairs and get acquainted. Lombardi said 152 cardinals were on hand for the final meeting. As well as getting to know their counterparts from around the world, the cardinals discussed the major issues facing the church, including its handling of allegations of child sex abuse by priests and a scandal over leaks from the Vatican last year that revealed claims of corruption, as well as the church's future direction. Church rules prevent cardinals over the age of 80 from participating in the conclave but allow them to attend the meetings that precede the vote. Who will be chosen? Meanwhile, the Italian news media are full of speculation about which cardinal may win enough support from his counterparts to be elected, and what regional alliances are being formed. According to CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, also a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, the race was wide open as the cardinals entered the conclave. Unlike in 2005, when Benedict XVI was believed to be the favorite going into the election, no one has emerged as a clear frontrunner this time around, Allen said. Some names have cropped up in media reports as possible contenders, however. They include Italy's Cardinal Angelo Scola; Brazil's Odilo Scherer; Marc Ouellet of Quebec, Canada; U.S. cardinals Sean O'Malley of Boston and Timothy Dolan of New York; and Ghana's Peter Turkson. More than 80% of Africans believe their continent is ready for an African pope, but only 61% believe the world is, an exclusive survey for CNN has found. A mobile phone survey of 20,000 Africans from 11 nations, conducted by CNN in conjunction with crowd sourcing company Jana, found that 86% thought an African pope would increase support for Catholicism in Africa. Italy potentially wields the most power within the conclave, with 28 of the 115 votes, making it the largest bloc in the College of Cardinals. The United States is second with 11. Altogether, 48 countries are represented among the cardinal-electors. ""Many would say it's all about politics at this point,"" Monsignor Rick Hilgartner, head of U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops Secretariat on Divine Worship, told CNN, ""but I think it's important to remember that they also recognize that this is a very spiritual moment."" Once the doors close and the conclave begins, he says, it's less about politicking and ""more about prayer as they each in silence write their votes."" Sixty-seven of the cardinal-electors were appointed by Benedict, who stepped down at the end of last month, becoming the first pontiff to do so in six centuries. CNN's Dan Rivers and Richard Allen Greene reported from Rome, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Hada Messia, Ed Payne and Michael Pearson and journalist Livia Borghese also contributed to this report.","NEW: Black smoke comes from the chapel chimney, meaning no winner in first vote .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A strong earthquake struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan on Saturday, killing at least 179 people and injuring about 6,700 others in a region that suffered a catastrophic quake five years ago, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Sunday. Thousands of emergency workers, including soldiers, rushed to reach the affected zones in the hilly region, and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang traveled to the area from Beijing, state media reported. Xu Mengjia, the Communist Party chief of Ya'an, the city that administers the area where the quake struck, told state broadcaster CCTV that because of landslides and disruption to communications, determining the total number of casualties may take some time. Students gather outside to escape the quake . The quake struck just after 8 a.m. local time Saturday, about 115 kilometers (70 miles) away from the provincial capital, Chengdu, at a depth of around 12 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There was conflicting information about the earthquake's strength, with the USGS putting the magnitude at 6.6 and the China Earthquake Networks Center gauging it at 7.0. It was followed by a series of aftershocks, some of them as strong as magnitude 5.1, the USGS said. Authorities have responded by sending rescue workers to the area around the epicenter, briefly halting flights at the airport in Chengdu and suspending high-speed rail operations, state media reported. The event stirred memories of the devastating earthquake that hit Sichuan in 2008, killing more than 87,000 people. First responders to Saturday's quake reported that the damage caused didn't appear to be as severe as what was seen in the aftermath of the 2008 disaster, according to CCTV. Fan Xiaodong, a student in Chengdu, said when the tremors began to shake buildings in the city, many of his startled classmates rushed out of their dorms, some of them wearing only the clothes they'd been sleeping in. At first, Fan said, he only felt a slight trembling as he dozed in bed. ""I thought it was my roommates shaking the bed,"" he said. ""But the shock became stronger soon, and it came to me that an earthquake happened."" The epicenter was in Lushan country, a district of Ya'an. That area is home to China's famous giant pandas and houses the country's biggest panda research center. CCTV reported that the pandas at the facility, which is about 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) from the epicenter, were safe. Residents of Chongqing, a sprawling metropolis more than 300 kilometers (about 190 miles) from Ya'an, said the quake also shook buildings there. Are you there? Send your iReports .

"(CNN) -- They are one of nature's most spectacular sites: The aurora borealis, or northern lights as they are known, have captivated onlookers for thousands of years. This past weekend saw a particularly stunning display following a phenomenon known as a coronal mass ejection, where the sun spews a burst of particles into space that reach Earth one to three days later. Bursts toward earth can cause electromagnetic storms when they react with the Earth's magnetic field, resulting in an explosion of color in the sky. ""We see them regularly, but they were quite spectacular [Sunday] night ,"" said Halldor Sigurdsson from Iceland, who captured some of the display. ""A busload of tourists came and they certainly got their money's worth."" Meanwhile in the tiny Icelandic fishing village of Ólafsvík, photographer, tour guide and occasional fisherman Stefán Ingvar Guðmundsson spent three hours driving around the beautiful Snæfellsjökull glacier near his home to take photos. ""It's always a big 'wow,' but last night was overwhelming,"" he said Monday. The northern lights have been particularly spectacular in 2013 as the sun is expected to reach the peak of its 11-year solar cycle later this year.","Lights have been particularly stunning in 2013 due to sun's peak in its 11 year solar cycle .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two NATO-led soldiers were killed and six wounded in an attack in a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan early Sunday, officials said. U.S. soldiers at the Bagram  base in Afghanistan prepare for a mission earlier this year. The soldiers were serving with the International Security Assistance Force, the organization said in a statement. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attacks. Spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said three missiles were launched at the base at about 2 a.m. local time (5:30 p.m. Saturday ET). The attacks occurred at Bagram air field. The injured were being treated at the base, according to the statement. The security force does not release the nationality of casualties before the relevant country officials. Bagram is home to thousands of troops from the U.S. military. The majority of the troops do not leave the base and are in various support roles for U.S. troops across Afghanistan. ""On behalf of ISAF, I share our grief and extend our support to the loved ones of these service members,"" said Brig. Gen. Richard Blanchette, a spokesman. ""As we continue this vital mission in support of the Afghan people, we will remember this sacrifice with honor and the utmost respect."" The international alliance was formed under a U.N. mandate to bolster a secure environment and support the reconstruction of Afghanistan. NATO took command in 2003. The force comprises about 50,000 troops from 42 countries. CNN's Atia Abawi contributed to this report.","Two soldiers killed and six wounded in attack at U.S. base in Afghanistan .
