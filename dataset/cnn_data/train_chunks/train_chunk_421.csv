"Monday's CNN poll results just plain surprised, almost shocked me. When I saw the poll was due to be released, I expected the Republicans to be taking a beating considering the terms President Barack Obama and his staff have been using to describe them over the past 10 days (""extremists,"" ""people with a bomb strapped to their chest"") and the unfair, derogatory press coverage of their position. The results are so dramatically better for Republicans and worse for the Democrats and Obama than I expected that I was curious to see just how much better Republicans are faring during the shutdown of 2013 (and how much worse the president and the Democrats are faring) than in comparable polls of the 1995-96 shutdowns. What I discovered was revealing and runs against the entire media narrative of this year's struggle over the continuing resolution and the debt ceiling. Let's start with the shutdowns during the Clinton administration when I was leading House Republicans. There were two: one in November 1995 and one in December '95 and early January 1996. A CNN poll at the time showed Americans blamed Republicans over President Bill Clinton for the first shutdown by almost 2-to-1, 49% to 26%. Republicans fared only a little better in the second shutdown of the mid-'90s. A CNN poll after it began showed the American people preferred Clinton's approach to that of the Republicans by 52% to 38%. Sixty-two percent said they had negative feelings about the Republican leaders during that conflict, compared with only 49% about Clinton. This is not to say the shutdowns were a strategic mistake. Quite the opposite: The enormous progress we made afterward -- four consecutive balanced budgets, welfare reform, the first tax cut in 16 years -- was a direct result of Republicans standing firm in 1995 and early 1996. It proved to Clinton, and more importantly to the country, that we were serious about the ideas we had run on in 1994. As a consequence, we were the first re-elected Republican majority in the House since 1928. In the long run, in other words, the shutdowns didn't do us any damage, a fact Gallup documented recently. But as the above poll numbers suggest, most Americans were clearly frustrated during those shutdowns, and in the immediate term they blamed Republicans. In retrospect I brought some of this on us because I was very firm and clear beforehand that we were prepared to close the government if that was what it took to get an agreement to balance the federal budget. In a sense, Americans were right to blame (or credit) us with the shutdowns because we were in fact on offense, seeking a decisive change in government. As the first House Republican majority in 40 years, we were feeling empowered, and we probably showed it too clearly. There was another big reason why the public gave Clinton the benefit of the doubt, however. He was consistently willing to talk and to meet. People saw him as a reasonable guy trying to help get to a solution. And since Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, the congressional Democrats were not a big part of the public drama. Because we were so openly pushing for a big change and Clinton was so willing to be reasonable, the American people naturally attributed the shutdowns to us and gave Clinton good marks for at least trying to negotiate. Today the situation is radically different. Virtually every Republican has learned from 1995-1996. Republicans' consistent refrain is that they don't want to shut the government. They constantly say that they want to negotiate, to make a deal, and that they're frustrated by Obama's refusal to talk. The president, on the other hand, has taken the hard-line position that he will not negotiate, repeating this on television practically every day. In addition, he has used his office to cause as much pain to the people as he reasonably can, including very public and unnecessary pain for our soldiers, veterans and small business owners. This behavior strikes most Americans as offensive and unfair. I thought, however, that with the general bias of the press coverage -- the overemphasis on Republican dissent, the almost complete avoidance of covering Democrats who have split with their leaders to vote in favor of clean, piecemeal continuing resolutions to fund parts of the government, and the normal process of giving Obama a permanent benefit of the doubt -- that Monday's poll results would have been better than 1995-96 but still clearly anti-Republican. The results were vastly better for the Republicans and worse for Obama than I expected. When asked in the CNN poll whom they are angry at, 63% said Republicans, 58% said Democrats and 53% said Obama. That is a 10-point margin for the president and only a 5-point margin for Democrats, compared with a 23-point margin in November 1995. Independents said they blamed all three equally (60% GOP, 59% Democrats, 58% Obama). This is so clearly within the margin of error that it is for all practical purposes a tie. After weeks of the media focusing blame on House Speaker John Boehner, Sen. Ted Cruz and the House Republicans, it is clear the American people are not buying it. There have been too many days of the president saying, ""I will not negotiate."" The country believes him. They can see he's a big part of the reason the government is shut down. If House Republicans continue to pass targeted, clean continuing resolutions to fund parts of the government and Senate Republicans demand day after day for the right to vote on these popular measures, the margin of blame may begin shifting from virtual parity to a solidly Democratic problem. If the Republicans repeat every day their willingness to negotiate and Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid repeat every day their refusal to negotiate, this may become catastrophic for the Democrats.","Newt Gingrich: In shutdowns of 1990s, GOP was blamed much more than Democrats .

"When the biggest cable company in the United States buys the second-biggest cable company in the United States, what does that mean for you? If you're afraid the answer might be a higher cable bill, you're not alone. ""Americans already hate dealing with the cable guy -- and both these giant companies regularly rank among the worst of the worst in consumer surveys,"" said Craig Aaron, president and CEO of Free Press, a group that advocates for diversity in media ownership. ""But this deal would be the cable guy on steroids -- pumped up, unstoppable and grasping for your wallet."" On Thursday, Comcast announced it had agreed to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion. If approved by the federal government, and that's no sure thing, the two would become a massive cable giant, serving one out of every three homes in the United States. (Time Warner Cable was spun off from Time Warner in 2009 and no longer has any connection to the owner of CNN, HBO and Warner Bros.) Obviously, it's way too early to know whether the dire predictions of folks such as Aaron will come true. But the announcement has raised a lot of questions along those lines for subscribers of both companies, as well as others curious how the emergence of such a cable giant would impact them. So here's an effort to address some of those questions as best we can: . When could this happen? Comcast says that if the merger is approved by federal regulators, they would become one with Time Warner Cable by the end of this year. Subscribers to the two companies shouldn't see any changes before then. If it's any guide, Comcast's acquistion of NBC Universal was slowed down by the regulatory review process and took 13 months before it was completed in 2011. Would my bill go up? It depends upon whom you ask. As noted above, there are activists dedicated to fighting big media mergers on the argument that relying on a small handful of giant companies kills competition and drives up prices in any market. ""An enlarged Comcast would be the bully in the schoolyard, able to dictate terms to content creators, Internet companies, other communications networks that must interconnect with it, and distributors who must access its content,"" said John Bergmayer, senior staff attorney for online consumer activist group Public Knowledge. ""By raising the costs of its rivals and business partners, an enlarged Comcast would raise costs for consumers, who ultimately pay the bills."" But some industry analysts say there's no reason the merger would directly impact subscriber wallets -- at least no more than they're already being hit. ""I think this is more of a story about two companies wanting to get together to improve their market share and revenues for their stock price than it is for customers,"" said tech industry analyst Jeff Kagan. ""I don't think this is a story about customers at all."" Kagan noted that since Comcast and Time Warner Cable are largely in different U.S. markets, the merger wouldn't mean a loss of competition. But that doesn't mean cable bills won't go up, he said, because they're already doing just that. ""Cable television prices have continually risen over time; the price customers pay roughly doubles every 10 years,"" Kagan said. ""I don't see that changing."" How about service quality? If history holds, subscribers to both companies could be in for some bumps along the way. ""Whenever there are mergers of two large customer-service providers ... we tend to see quite a few problems,"" said David VanAmburg, managing director of the American Customer Satisfaction Index, citing surveys about mergers between airlines, banks and other companies. He said problems could be caused by hiccups in merging customer database -- things such as double billing or accounts getting lost. ""We'd be surprised if a new hybrid Comcast-Time Warner doesn't produce a lower level of customer satisfaction for a year or two,"" he said. ""Customers have felt burned in the past by large mergers where choice is effectively reduced."" And it's not like a lot of people are in love with their cable service to start with. Financial site MoneyRates.com released a survey Thursday in which 25% respondents called cable companies the worst for customer service. That led credit card companies at 15%, insurance companies at 14% and phone companies at 12% . Past gripes about cable-TV and broadband companies have focused on high rates and the difficulty of getting customer-service help over the phone, according to ACSI research. Many consumers now pay more for TV and Internet service than they do for heat or electricity. Consumers in most areas of the U.S. don't have a choice between cable TV providers, which makes them feel helpless when rates rise or service is poor, VanAmburg said. Would my cable offerings change? In terms of services, this could be a win for Time Warner Cable customers. If the deal goes through, TWC customers would likely be offered Comcast's wider menu of channels and services. While Comcast customers aren't necessarily satisfied all the time, a lot of its hardware and software has gotten high marks. In its announcement of the planned merger, Comcast said that, among other services, it offers ""50,000 video on-demand choices on television, 300,000 plus streaming choices on XfinityTV.com, Xfinity TV mobile apps that offer 35 live streaming channels plus the ability to download to watch offline later, and the newly launched X1 cloud DVR."" If the merger goes through, Comcast also would become the largest broadband provider in the United States. So Time Warner Cable subscribers would presumably have new options on that front as well.","Proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger raises some concerns .

"An Iranian woman convicted of murder -- in a killing that human rights groups called self-defense against a rapist -- was hanged Saturday, state news agency  IRNA reported. Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, was sentenced to death for the 2007 killing of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security. The United Nations has said she never received a fair trial. The U.S. State Department also said there were concerns about the trial. ""There were serious concerns with the fairness of the trial and the circumstances surrounding this case, including reports of confessions made under severe duress,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Saturday. ""We condemn this morning's execution in Iran of Reyhaneh Jabbari, an Iranian woman convicted of killing a man she said she stabbed in self-defense during a sexual assault,"" Psaki said. Jabbari's execution was originally scheduled for September 30, but was postponed. Amnesty International said the delay may have been in response to the public outcry against the execution. Jabbari was convicted of murder after ""a flawed investigation and unfair trial,"" according to Amnesty International. The United Nations has said Sarbandi hired Jabbari -- then a 19-year-old interior designer -- to work on his office. She stabbed him after he sexually assaulted her, it said. Jabbari was held in solitary confinement without access to her lawyer and family for two months, Amnesty International said in a statement. She was tortured during that time, the group said. ""Amnesty International understands that, at the outset of the investigation, Reyhaneh Jabbari admitted to stabbing the man once in the back, but claimed she had done so after he had tried to sexually abuse her,"" the rights group said. ""She also maintained that a third person in the house had been involved in the killing. These claims, if proven, could exonerate her but are believed never to have been properly investigated, raising many questions about the circumstances of the killing."" Iranian Oscar-winning director Asghar Farhadi joined scores of Iranian artists and musicians calling for a halt to the execution. In an open letter, Farhadi asked the victim's family to pardon her, a possibility under Iranian law. Rights groups have criticized Iran for a surge in executions under Hassan Rouhani in his first year as president. UK Foreign Office Minister for the Middle East Tobias Ellwood said he was ""very concerned and saddened"" that Jabbari had been executed, especially given the questions concerning due process in the case. ""The UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Iran, Dr Ahmed Shaheed, noted that her conviction was allegedly based on confessions made while under threat, and the court failed to take into account all evidence into its judgment,"" he said in a statement. ""Actions like these do not help Iran build confidence or trust with the international community. I urge Iran to put a moratorium on all executions."" According to the United Nations, Iran has executed at least 170 people this year. Last year, it executed more people than any other country with the exception of China, the world's most populous nation. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, speaking in July, said the death penalty has no place in the 21st century and urged all countries to work toward its abolition.","U.S. State Department condemns execution, questions fairness of trial .

"The near daily stream of violence in Iraq is a bitter reminder that the country is still far away from stabilizing and that the Sunni-Shiite divide, which has led to over 6000 deaths in 2013, appears wider than ever. Despite this climate of uncertainty and destruction, Iraq's top energy official told CNN that the country's oil production will continue to climb -- reaching at least 3.5 million barrels a day by the end of the year. Hussain al-Shahristani, the Deputy Prime Minister for Energy, said two new fields in southern Iraq, near Nasiriyah and Basra, have revved up production. ""These two fields will add between them 300 thousand barrels. There's extra production from the other fields so when you add them up you will get to 3.5, 3.6 million barrels a day by the end of the year,"" Shahristani told me during a one-on-one interview at the Gulf Intelligence conference in Dubai. Iraq has had difficulty managing expectations over the past few years. The original plan was to hit 6 million barrels a day by the end of this year, double that level by 2020 at the latest. Those forecasts have been ratcheted down significantly with the government's so-called revised integrated strategy. Shahristani said Baghdad needed to decide whether to front load production or set a more realistic target that will allow fields to produce more crude over the next two decades. ""We decided to go for the second option to maximize recovery rather than hit the highest possible production in a short time,"" he said. Iraq was criticized within energy circles for signing service contracts that gives international energy giants a production fee of just $1.15 -$2.50 a barrel, instead of production sharing agreements that give the majors a percentage of overall production. Shahristani admits that strategy has forced a rethink and in some cases a revising of existing contracts. ""I would confess that our contracts have been very tight, perhaps the toughest the oil companies had to deal with,"" he said. ""We want the oil companies to make a good profit in Iraq and that is why we are willing to reconsider those contracts,"" he added. The climate with its international partners is improving and Iraq is confident it can now deliver a sizable level of production capacity by the end of the decade.  It has committed to just over 9 million barrels a day, which would put the country in the league of Saudi Arabia and Russia -- currently the two largest producers in the world. The International Energy Agency in Paris has expressed reservations, suggesting Iraq will be producing 6 million barrels in that time frame. ""All I will say, at this point, is that Iraq has signed contracts with the largest international oil companies who have the best know-how in this field,"" Shahristani said. ""And they have very strong financial muscle, if they say they can do it, they can do it."" Further, he added, they are bound by contract to do so. According to BP's 2013 Statistical Review of World Energy, Iraq sits on 143 billion barrels of crude, 9% of global proven reserves. Oil executives say there is plenty more to be found, with some 300 potential sites in the southwest of the country still not explored. There is speculation that thawing relations between Tehran and Washington could see a partial lifting of economic sanctions on Iran, which has cut production by 1.5 million barrels a day. The deputy PM said he is hopeful negotiations will proceed in good faith, but does not expect downward pressure on prices as a result. However, he said, it was yet to be seen if that would reflect on oil production in the short term. ""I personally doubt 2014 will give sufficient time even if sanctions are relaxed,"" he noted.","The violence in Iraq is a reminder the country is far from stable, but oil production is set to rise this year .
Its forecasts have previously been ratcheted down and more realistic targets set .

"A Pakistani judge on Friday granted bail to Rimsha, a 14-year-old Christian girl detained over accusations she burned pages of the Quran in a case that has heightened religious tensions in the volatile country. The All Pakistan Minorities Alliance, which represents religious minorities in the country, will pay the sum of roughly $10,000 to secure Rimsha's release from jail, said Tahir Naveed Chaudhry, one of her lawyers and a leading member of the alliance. Judge Muhammad Azam Khan said written details of his decision on the bail application would be released Saturday. It was not immediately clear when Rimsha would be released. The judge's decision came after a lengthy argument Friday between Rimsha's lawyer speaking in court, Pervez Khan, and lawyers representing the accuser. Khan argued Rimsha should be granted bail because she was essentially an innocent girl with a lower than average IQ who was framed by a local cleric who planted evidence against her. The accuser's lawyer argued Rimsha committed blasphemy and should be punished no matter how old she is. Rimsha's family has left their home on the outskirts of Islamabad as a result of the tensions caused by the accusations against her. Police: Muslim cleric framed girl in Pakistan blasphemy case . The case took a dramatic twist over the weekend when the police said a Muslim cleric had planted evidence in order to link her to the blasphemy allegations.The imam, Khalid Jadoon Chishti, will himself face blasphemy charges for tearing pages out of a Quran to use as evidence against the girl, police said. Authorities arrested Rimsha last month after a neighbor accused her of burning pages containing texts from the Muslim holy book. Rimsha had two shopping bags with her: one containing ashes and the other, the partially burned pages, police said. She had gathered the paper as fuel for cooking, authorities said. Even though Rimsha's lawyer said no one actually saw the girl burning the papers, the neighbor went to Chishti -- the neighborhood cleric -- with the bags for safekeeping as evidence. Chishti wasn't certain that simply burning pages with texts from the Quran would be enough to convict Rimsha on blasphemy charges, the police said. So, the imam added two pages from the holy book itself to the bag to bolster the case, according to the police . Chishti was arrested on Saturday after three witnesses told a judge about the imam's actions. He was sent to jail for 14 days, accused of evidence tampering. Chishti has denied the allegation, authorities said. Opinion: Muslims in Pakistan, show compassion and justice .","The girl has been in jail since last month after she was accused by a neighbor .

"U.S. intelligence officials are leaning toward the theory that ""those in the cockpit"" -- the pilots of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 -- were responsible for the mysterious disappearance of the commercial jetliner, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the latest thinking told CNN on Saturday. The revelation followed news that Malaysian authorities searched the home of the lead pilot, a move that came the same day that Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters the plane veered off course due to apparent deliberate action taken by somebody on board. The Malaysian government had been looking for a reason to search the home of the pilot and the co-pilot for several days. But it was only in the last 24 to 36 hours, when radar and satellite data came to light, that authorities believed they had sufficient reason to go through the residences, according to the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""The Malaysians don't do this lightly,"" the official said. It's not clear whether the Malaysian government believes one or both the men could be responsible for what happened when the Boeing 777-200 ER disappeared March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. What we know about the cockpit crew . The official emphasized no final conclusions have been drawn and all the internal intelligence discussions are based on preliminary assessments of what is known to date. Other scenarios could still emerge. The notion of a hijacking has not been ruled out, the official said. A source close to the investigation told CNN that Malaysian police had searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53. Shah lives in an upscale gated community in Shah Alam, outside Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur. Two vans were loaded with small bags, similar to shopping bags, at the home of the co-pilot, 27-year-old Farq Ab Hamid, according to a CNN crew who observed activities at the residence. It was unclear whether the bags were taken from the home, and police made no comment about their activities there. Najib made clear in a press conference that in light of the latest developments, authorities have refocused their investigation to the crew and passengers on board. Undoubtedly, they will scour through the flight manifest and look further to see whether any of the passengers on board had flight training or connections to terror groups. A senior U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that investigators are carefully reviewing the information so far collected on the pilots to determine whether there is something to indicate a plan or a motive. That would seem supported by preliminary U.S. intelligence reports, which the U.S. official said show the jetliner was in some form of controlled flight at a relatively stable altitude and path when it changed course and flew toward the Indian Ocean. It is presumed by U.S. officials to have crashed, perhaps after running out of fuel. 'Someone acting deliberately' The first clue that perhaps one or both of the pilots were involved stem from when the plane made a sharp, deliberate turn from where it last communicated with Kuala Lumpur air traffic controllers, and before it would have to communicate with Vietnamese controllers, according to the U.S. official with knowledge of the latest intelligence thinking. ""This is the perfect place to start to disappear,"" the official said. Military radar showed the jetliner flew in a westerly direction back over the Malaysian peninsula, Najib said. It is then believed to have either turned northwest toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest elsewhere in the Indian Ocean, he said. ""Evidence is consistent with someone acting deliberately from inside the plane,"" the Prime Minister said, officially confirming the plane's disappearance was not caused by an accident. ""....Despite media reports that the plane was hijacked, we are investigating all major possibilities on what caused MH370 to deviate."" The focus of the search is now in the southern Indian Ocean. ""The southern scenario seems more plausible,"" the official said. Meanwhile, according to Najib, new satellite information leads authorities to be fairly certain that someone disabled the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS, just before the aircraft reached the east coast of peninsular Malaysia. ""Shortly afterward, near the border between Malaysian and Vietnamese air traffic control,"" Najib said, ""the aircraft's transponder was switched off."" ACARS is the system that routinely transmits information like turbulence and fuel load back to the airline. A transponder is a system controlled from the cockpit that transmits data about the plane via radio signals to air traffic controllers. It combines with ground radar to provide air traffic controllers with details about the plane, including its identification, speed, position and altitude. The last voice communication from the cockpit a week ago were these words: ""All right, good night."" They were uttered at the Vietnam air traffic control border at about the same time the transponder was shut off, Najib said. That suggests the incident on the plane began sooner than initially thought. But some have questioned the Prime Minister's account, given the dearth of information available. Malaysia investigation criticized . In the days since the flight disappeared, the Malaysian government has been under intense scrutiny for its handling of the investigation. The government has been criticized by some U.S. officials for not sharing information or accepting more offers of help. Shortly after Najib delivered his remarks, China demanded Malaysia provide more information on the investigation. Of the 239 people aboard Flight 370, 154 were Chinese. ""Today is the 8th day of the missing MH370, and the plane is still yet to be found,"" said a statement from the foreign ministry. ""Time is life."" The criticism was more pointed in an editorial published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. ""And due to the absence -- or at least lack -- of timely authoritative information, massive efforts have been squandered, and numerous rumors have been spawned, repeatedly racking the nerves of the awaiting families,"" the editorial said. Malaysian authorities have been highly sensitive to any suggestion they can't handle the investigation, said the U.S. law enforcement official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. It took several days last week to calm their anger over inaccurate reports that the FBI had dispatched a team to investigate, the official said. Malaysia Airlines defended its actions, saying there has never been a case where information gleaned from satellite signals alone could potentially be used to find the location of a missing airliner. ""Given the nature of the situation and its extreme sensitivity, it was critical that the raw satellite signals were verified and analyzed by the relevant authorities so that their significance could be properly understood,"" the airline said in a statement. ""This naturally took some time, during which we were unable to publicly confirm their existence."" Transcript: Malaysian Prime Minister's statement on Flight 370 . Kazakhstan to Indian Ocean . As the focus of the investigation shifted, so, too, has the focus of the search. Information from international and Malaysian officials indicate that the jet may have flown for more than seven hours after the last contact with the pilots. Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:41 a.m. on March 8. The last satellite communication from the plane occurred at 8:11 a.m., Najib said, well past the scheduled arrival time in Beijing. That last communication, Najib said, was in one of two possible traffic corridors shown on a map released to the press. A northern arc stretches from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand, and a southern arc spans from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. ""Due to the type of satellite data, we are unable to confirm the precise location of the plane when it last made contact with the satellite,"" Najib said. Because the northern parts of the traffic corridor include some tightly guarded airspace over India, Pakistan, and even some U.S. installations in Afghanistan, U.S. authorities believe it more likely the aircraft crashed into waters outside of the reach of radar south of India, a U.S. official told CNN. If it had flown farther north, it's likely it would have been detected by radar. Nonetheless for the last 36 hours, the U.S. military and intelligence community has been reviewing all satellite imagery and electronic data it collects from the region for any sign of an explosion or crash, according to another U.S. official directly familiar with that effort. Najib said authorities were ending search operations in the South China Sea and reassessing the deployment of assets. ""This new satellite information has a significant impact on the nature and scope of the search operation,"" he said. Investigators, he said, have confirmed by looking at the raw satellite data that the plane in question was the Malaysia Airlines jet. The same conclusion was reached by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch and the Malaysian authorities, all of whom were working separately with the same data, he said. Families hold onto hope . For the families and loved ones of those aboard Flight 370, Saturday was Day 8 of anguish. Some found comfort that there is no evidence the plane made impact. The father of one passenger watched Najib's news conference at a Beijing hotel. He said he hoped the plane was hijacked because that gave him reason to think his son was alive. ""I hope they are alive, no matter how small the chance is,"" he said. The search that began last weekend now involves 14 countries, 43 ships and 58 aircraft, Najib said, and that the relevant foreign embassies have been given access to the new information. China is sending technical experts to join the investigation, and two Chinese search vessels headed for the Strait of Malacca, according to Xinhua. Plane was taking 'strange path' Hours before Najib's announcement, U.S. officials told CNN the flight had made drastic changes in altitude and direction after disappearing from civilian radar. Malaysian military radar showed the plane climbing to 45,000 feet -- which is above its approved altitude limit -- soon after disappearing from civilian radar screens and then dropping to 23,000 feet before climbing again, a U.S. official familiar with the investigation said. The jetliner was flying ""a strange path,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. The details of the radar readings were first reported by The New York Times on Friday.","Area between Malaysia and Vietnam ""perfect place to start to disappear,"" official says .

"(CNN) -- An 8.0-magnitude earthquake struck off the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific on Wednesday, triggering a tsunami that killed five people but didn't threaten the wider region. Four elderly people and one child died after the roughly 1-meter (3-feet) high wave hit the Santa Cruz Islands, an eastern region of the Solomon Islands, said Augustine Bilve, a director at a hospital in Lata, the main town in the area. The strong waves appeared to have caused damage and disruption at the local airport and nearby villages. Bilve said that some patients were being relocated, but the hospital was intact. ""Our staff in Temotu province felt the quake and within five minutes there were a number of wave surges, which flooded the runway there,"" said Andrew Catford, the program director in the Solomon Islands for the humanitarian group World Vision. World's biggest earthquakes since 1900 . Temotu province is another name for the Santa Cruz Islands. World Vision said it was still trying to gauge the damage from the tsunami in the area, adding that ""it is likely that several villages close to the airport have been severely impacted."" The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially issued a tsunami warning for several countries in the area, including Papua New Guinea and Fiji. But the center later canceled the alert after reassessing the relevant data. It also called off a tsunami watch it had sent out for a larger number of countries in the region such as New Zealand, Australia and Indonesia. The center of the quake was located near the Santa Cruz Islands, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. It was initially reported to be 3.6 miles deep, but that was later revised to a depth of 17.8 miles. What is a tsunami? Precautionary measures taken in the region . Authorities elsewhere in the region took precautionary measures following news of the quake. The New Zealand Ministry of Civil Defense and Emergency Management warned people along certain areas of the country's west coast to stay out of the water and away from the shore. Japanese authorities issued advisories that small sea level changes could affect the country's entire eastern coastline Wednesday. The New Caledonia High Commission in the capital of Noumea ordered the immediate evacuation of coastal residents on the eastern coast of New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands. The main quake was preceded by a 6.3-magnitude quake in the region and was followed by several others, the largest of which had a magnitude of 6.6, the USGS said. In 2007, an 8.1-magnitude quake struck in the western part of the Solomon Islands, setting off a tsunami. At least 52 people died as a result of the disaster and thousands of others were left homeless. Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes .

The mistreatment was not the work of rogue soldiers disobeying orders, but part of a ""deliberate policy of abuse being used to assist interrogation,"" lawyer Philip Shiner argues. The ""allegations indicate systematic abuse of detainees which reflect policies of the Armed Forces or at least tolerated and widespread practices,"" he says in court papers. He showed interrogation videos in court on Friday and planned to introduce more evidence Monday and Tuesday, he told CNN. The allegations center on a unit known as the Joint Forward Interrogation Team, about which Shiner says he has been able to obtain little information. In court papers he says it was responsible for detainee interrogation and control, calling it ""effectively a black hole, a segregated and tightly controlled environment operating under a separate chain of command."" The Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond to CNN questions about the interrogation team. The European Convention on Human Rights requires the government to establish an independent investigation in the abuse allegations, Shiner says. Defence Minister Liam Fox, the defendant in the High Court case, is ""very concerned"" by allegations of abuse and is determined to ""get to the bottom"" of all such allegations, his lawyers said Monday. But he does not believe he is under ""any present obligations to set up a public inquiry."" The Ministry of Defence says the Royal Military Police are investigating allegations case by case. A two-year project under its jurisdiction, known as the Iraq Historic Allegation Team, was announced earlier this year. Fox believes that process is ""desirable and appropriate"" in investigating abuse allegations, and has made ""significant progress"" since it was established, government lawyers said. The Historic Allegation Team ""is the most effective way of investigating these unproven allegations -- to establish their truth or otherwise, identify any action that needs to be taken, including dealing with any connected or systemic issues and, should it uncover criminal behavior, provide the proper means to deal with it,"" said Brigadier John Donnelly of the ministry's Judicial Engagement Policy department. ""In our view a costly new public inquiry is not necessary or appropriate. It would be unable to investigate individual criminal behavior or impose punishments and will not serve the interest of fair and expeditious justice,"" he said in a statement. Shiner says that investigation is only putting off an inquiry that is certain to come. ""There is no justification for delaying the inevitable,"" he argues in court papers. He says the military's investigation is not sufficiently independent. And sending cases through the Iraq Historic Allegation Team before setting up an independent probe ""offends"" the European Convention on Human Rights requirement for prompt investigations in allegations of abuse, he says. The case opened Friday and is due to continue through Tuesday. It is not clear when the judge will rule. CNN's Bharati Naik and Andrew Carey contributed to this report.","125 Iraqis claim they suffered abuse such as hooding and sleep deprivation .

"Albuquerque police shot a homeless man in the back and killed him, and it was all caught on gruesome detail in a police video. It is just one more in a long line of police killings that has the city's Police Department on the verge of federal oversight. James Boyd, a mentally disturbed man who friends say was attempting to camp out in the foothills above Albuquerque one night in March because city homeless shelters had closed, was holding two small camping knives. Officers negotiated with him for five hours, eventually winning agreement from Boyd to leave the makeshift -- and illegal -- campsite. Then a police stun grenade went off, Boyd, 38, turned his back and three shots were fired. Police video shows Boyd on his stomach on the ground, wheezing for breath as officers sic a dog on his legs and fire bean bag rounds at him. He was already mortally wounded. An autopsy on Boyd found he was shot in the back. The medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. The horrific encounter, routinely recorded as part of police protocol, is now a key part of an ongoing drama in New Mexico's largest city -- a series of protests against the police and city officials. Federal officials are close to a deal that would have them supervising the Albuquerque Police Department. Records show that 26 people have been killed by city police in Albuquerque since 2010, a per capita rate of officer-involved deaths higher than New York City and Chicago. Forty people have been wounded by police over the same period of time. So far, the city has paid out $30 million in settlements and officials acknowledge that amount will grow. In a report written before Boyd's shooting, the U.S. Department of Justice blamed the Police Department for poor training and said ""we find that the department engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force during the course of arrests and other detentions in violation of the Fourth Amendment."" Boyd's death has been added to the list of questionable killings. In April 2011, a young Albuquerque man -- whose parents had contacted police because he had mental health issues -- was killed in his own backyard by two plainclothes police. The officers had come to the home of Christopher Torres on an arrest warrant issued the month before. They said he was armed and shot him in the back as they wrestled on the ground. Torres' parents, Stephen and Renatta Torres, say he was holding a broomstick, which he laid down when police approached. They sued police, and a judge awarded them $6 million in a civil judgment, saying the police testimony was ""not credible."" The Albuquerque district attorney, Kari Brandenburg, cleared the two officers in the Torres killing. She has cleared every other police officer involved in a killing during her last 13 years in office. Police Chief Gordon Eden has been on the job for only about three months. Initially, he called Boyd's shooting ""justified"" but tells CNN that he spoke ""prematurely, and I shouldn't have."" Eden says he is ""holding people to a higher degree of culpability,"" but he is also facing Justice Department oversight.

"Military forces have managed to take the remaining strongholds of al Qaeda affiliate Al-Shabaab in the far northeast of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, the military said. ""In effect, operations will now focus on the environs of the city and policing within the liberated areas,"" the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) said in a statement, adding that its troops worked with Transitional Federal Government forces. ""Our joint operations have gone extremely well today and over the weekend,"" AMISOM spokesman Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda said.  ""Casualties have been thankfully very low on our side, with just one killed and six minor injuries.  The outer north and eastern fringes of the city must still be cleared, but key ground and buildings are no longer under the control of the extremists."" ""It has been a big achievement to remove Al-Shabaab from the city, and put an end to the fighting that disrupted so many lives.  But the challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week, as they attempt to rebuild their lives."" Last week Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a suicide truck bombing in the heart of Mogadishu that left dozens dead. Other Al-Shabaab attacks last week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians. Al-Shabaab was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. The group is waging a war against Somalia's government to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or Sharia. Federal and African Union forces in the impoverished and chaotic nation have battled the group for years. Many analysts believe Al-Shabaab has been severely weakened by AMISOM, targeted strikes against foreign members and the weakening of al Qaeda. Al-Shabaab said in August that it was withdrawing from Mogadishu, and the Transitional Federal Government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, now control most districts of the capital city, the United Nations office said. Forces have pushed Al-Shabaab outside most of Mogadishu, but the group is still a major threat, said African Union forces spokesman Lt. Col. Paddy Nkunda in a statement last week.","Military forces say they have taken strongholds in northeastern Mogadishu .

"A car bomb exploded Thursday, killing at least 12 people near Somalia's national intelligence headquarters in the capital of Mogadishu, security spokesman Idris Aden said. Most of them were government soldiers. At least 10 other people were injured in the blast after a minivan packed with explosives crashed into a restaurant and blew up, sending flames and black smoke into the air. Al-Shabaab rebels claimed responsibility for the attack, which spokesman Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab said killed 15 security force members. The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, Aden said. The restaurant is popular with Somali security forces. Last week, militants carried out a deadly attack on Somalia's presidential palace, exploding a bomb and then opening fire. At least 12 died, including two government officials and seven Al-Shabaab attackers, but President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was unharmed. Bombings have rattled Mogadishu in regular intervals this year, and Al-Shabaab has regularly taken responsibility for them. The group, which the United States has designated as a terrorist organization, hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state by force. It also has launched attacks in other countries, such as Kenya and Uganda, that have killed dozens.","Al-Shabaab rebels claim responsibility for the attack .

"Washington (CNN) -- Top American officials welcomed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's decision to step down Friday but urged all sides in Egypt's rapidly unfolding political drama to ensure a peaceful transition to democracy. ""The people of Egypt have spoken,"" President Barack Obama said at the White House. ""Their voices have been heard, and Egypt will never be the same."" Obama said the sudden conclusion to Mubarak's three-decade rule was not ""the end of Egypt's transition. It's a beginning."" The U.S. president warned that there are ""tough days ahead"" for Egypt but declared his confidence in the ability of the Egyptian people to ""find the answers"" they are seeking ""peacefully, constructively and in the spirit of unity that has defined these last few weeks."" ""Nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day,"" he declared, promising that his administration is ready to provide assistance to America's longtime Middle Eastern ally. Obama praised the Egyptian military for acting responsibly over the past three weeks and urged it to help ensure a credible transition that, among other things, ends emergency rule, ensures the enactment of key legal reforms and brings ""all of Egypt's voices to the table."" ""The wheel of history turned at a blinding pace"" the past few weeks and disproved the notion that ""justice is gained by violence,"" Obama concluded.  ""In Egypt, it was the moral force of nonviolence -- not terrorism, not mindless killing ... that bent the arc of history toward justice once more."" The president spent part of the afternoon huddling with his national security team in the White House Situation Room, said Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council. Obama was in a meeting in the Oval Office when he learned that Mubarak was stepping down, Vietor noted. The president watched television coverage of the events in Egypt for several minutes afterward, Vietor said. Obama did not talk to Mubarak or Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman before the announcement of Mubarak's resignation, according to White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. Gibbs, however, also appeared to indicate that administration officials may have known Mubarak was stepping down before the official announcement was made in Cairo. The White House had indications ""that the last speeches may not have been given"" by authorities after Mubarak delivered his poorly received address to the Egyptian people Thursday night, Gibbs said. Vice President Joe Biden, speaking earlier to an audience in Kentucky, said the developments in Egypt marked a day of ""historic"" and ""dramatic"" change. Violence and intimidation against protesters in the days ahead remains unacceptable, he warned. The universal rights of people ""must be respected"" and their ""aspirations met."" Moments after the news broke, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, issued a statement urging a peaceful transition. ""I am pleased that President Mubarak has heard and heeded the voice of the Egyptian people, who have called for change,"" Reid said. But ""it is crucial that Mubarak's departure be an orderly one and that it leads to true democracy for Egypt, including free, fair and open elections."" He added, ""We caution all sides against violence during this transition."" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, released a statement calling Mubarak's resignation ""an extraordinary moment for Egypt."" But ""what happens next will have repercussions far beyond Egypt's borders,"" he said. ""We know from recent experience in Gaza that this requires not just elections, but hard work to build a government that is transparent, accountable, and broadly representative."" Gaza is currently governed by the militant Islamic group Hamas. Florida GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released a statement urging ""the unequivocal rejection of any involvement by the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremists"" in the transition of power. Egyptians should reject those who ""seek to exploit and hijack these events to gain power, oppress the Egyptian people, and do great harm to Egypt's relationship with the United States, Israel, and other free nations,"" she said. Former President Jimmy Carter, a key architect of the 1978 Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel, noted that Mubarak's resignation was ""only a first step toward self-governance"" in Egypt and called for a ""genuinely competitive and credible democratic presidential and parliamentary election process"" this year. Gibbs, expressing concern over relations between Egypt and Israel, said it's important for the next government in Cairo to recognize the Camp David accords. Gibbs also took a swipe at the Iranian regime, saying ""there is quite a contrast"" between the way ""the government of Egypt and the people of Egypt are interacting"" and the way the Iranian government is treating its people. Tehran is ""scared,"" Gibbs said. The Iranian government ""has met the concerns of its people with threatening to kill them."" As the Obama administration reacted, Washington was using a variety of intelligence assets to see what was happening in Cairo and other Egyptian cities, CNN has learned. The U.S. military and intelligence community are using ""national technical means"" in the sky over Egypt to gather information about the demonstrations and the deployment of Egyptian security forces. The phrase ""national technical means"" is used by the U.S. government to generally refer to the use of reconnaissance satellites to gather imagery or signals intelligence. A senior U.S. official with direct knowledge of the operation confirmed the intelligence-gathering but declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the matter. The official declined to say to what extent the Egyptian government is aware of the activity. The official would not say specifically which intelligence-gathering elements were being used but indicated that operations were being conducted in a manner that would not be visible to the Egyptian populace. The official said the decision to use intelligence-gathering assets came in part after violence erupted in the early days of the Cairo demonstrations.

"Four years after Michael Jackson died, his oldest son is ready to tell a jury about the last days of his life. Prince Jackson, now 16, was 12 when he followed an ambulance carrying his father to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on the afternoon of June 25, 2009. On Monday, in the Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit, Jackson lawyers informed AEG Live attorneys that Prince will be the next witness after a doctor who is an expert in medical conflicts of interest completes his testimony Tuesday. That would likely put Prince on the stand Wednesday, a day after the fourth anniversary of his father's death. Paris Jackson: Superstar's daughter builds own identity in spotlight . Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson and their grandmother Katherine Jackson are suing  AEG Live, accusing their father's last concert promoter of negligently hiring, retaining or supervising  Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Jackson lawyers argue that the promoter and producer of the ""This Is It"" shows pressured Murray to get Jackson to rehearsals but failed to get Jackson help despite numerous red flags that he was in trouble. Murray told police he used the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night for two months to treat Jackson's insomnia. The coroner ruled that an overdose of propofol killed him. AEG Live lawyers argue that Jackson chose and supervised Murray and that their executives had no way of knowing the doctor was using the dangerous treatment. Remembering Michael Jackson's music . A medical conflict of interest . Dr. Gordon Matheson, the director of the sports medicine department at Stanford University, testified as an expert in medical conflicts of interest Monday. After reviewing testimony and evidence in the case, Matheson concluded that AEG Live created a conflict of interest because the contract it negotiated with Murray to serve as Jackson's personal doctor for $150,000 a month ""was likely to lead to poor medical decisions."" Promoter deal with Jackson's doctor 'highly innapropriate' Matheson, the team doctor for Stanford's athletic department, compared it to a football coach telling a team doctor on the sidelines in the fourth quarter of a big game that a star quarterback has to go back in the game despite a suspected concussion. Murray, who had closed his clinics to take the job and was $1 million in debt, would be inclined not to resist the AEG Live executives' pressure to get Jackson to rehearsals despite evidence of his failing health, Matheson testified. Murray himself was conflicted because the negotiated contract was structured so that he answered to AEG, but it also could be canceled if the tour was canceled, he said.  ""I think that conflict played out as Michael Jackson's health began to deteriorate."" E-mails from the show director Kenny Ortega and production manager John ""Bugzee"" Hougdahl warned AEG executives of Jackson's deterioration during June 2009, including indications he was unable to do some of his trademark dances or remember lyrics to songs he had sung for decades. Jackson lost dance moves in last days . His makeup artist and a choreographer testified about Jackson's paranoia, his talking to himself and hearing voices, and his severe weight loss. Associate producer Alif Sankey testified that she ""had a very strong feeling that Michael was dying"" after a rehearsal 11 days before his death. ""I was screaming into the phone at that point,"" Sankey testified. ""I said he needs to be put in the hospital now."" Lost battle for sleep . A Harvard sleep expert testified last week that the nightly propofol treatments likely interrupted Jackson's sleep cycle, robbing him of REM -- rapid eye movement -- sleep, which is vital to keeping the brain and body alive. ""The symptoms that Mr. Jackson was exhibiting were consistent with what someone might expect to see of someone suffering from total sleep deprivation over a chronic period,"" Dr. Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School sleep expert, testified Friday at the trial. Expert: Jackson went 60 days without real sleep . If the singer had not died on June 25, 2009, of a propofol overdose, the lack of REM sleep may have taken his life within days anyway, according Czeisler's testimony Friday. Lab rats die after five weeks of getting no REM sleep, he said. It was never tried on a human until Murray gave Jackson nightly propofol infusions for two months. Prince to testify . Prince will be the only one of Jackson's three children who will appear in court, although the video of Paris' deposition over two days in March will be seen at some point during the AEG Live defense presentation.  The company compelled her testimony, calling her a key witness to her father's dealings with Murray and to her own relationship with her father. Jackson lawyers informed the court last week that Paris, 15, would not be available to testify in person because she is hospitalized for psychiatric treatment after a suicide attempt earlier this month. In testimony last week, chef Kai Chase recalled how devastated Paris was in the first moments at home when she realized something was very wrong with her father. ""We were literally pulling her by her ankles down the stairs as she was trying to go back up, screaming 'Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!'"" Chase testified. Paris, Prince Jackson testimonies shown in Jackson death trial . Paris made millions cry two weeks later when she spoke at the public memorial for Jackson. ""Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine,"" she said.  ""And I just want to say that I love him so much."" Jackson confided in his son about his business dealings at an early age.  His testimony is expected to include revelations about what his father told him in his last weeks about whom he trusted and distrusted. ""Prince has always been, even at 12, the little man -- daddy's little man,"" Chase testified. ""He wanted his father to be very proud of him, which Michael was."" ""The weight of the world is on his shoulders, the eldest, big brother and father figure to his siblings,"" Chase testified. ""It's a lot for him, growing, liking girls. He wishes his father was here to give him advice. It's devastating to him."" Life after his death . Jackson died just two weeks before he was to travel with Prince, Paris and Blanket to London where 50 concerts were scheduled over the next 10 months. Their father told them they would go on a long world tour after the London shows, which they were excited about, Paris said in her deposition. After the tour, Jackson intended to buy a mansion in Las Vegas to serve as a base while he concentrated on making movies, his children said.  To prepare them, Jackson hired a film professor from the University of Southern California to teach them movie-making techniques in their home school. With their father gone, the children moved in with their grandmother in the same Los Angeles home where Michael Jackson lived at a teen.  The veil of privacy -- which included wearing masks when in public with their father -- was soon replaced by occasional public appearances to honor their father. The children spoke at the Grammys, a Hollywood Boulevard dedication ceremony, a tribute concert and to Oprah Winfrey.  In each event, they appeared poised beyond their years. The two oldest enrolled in a private school, a major change from the home tutoring their father provided. Prince and Paris have both begun exploring careers in entertainment. Prince worked several days as a ""special correspondent"" for ""Entertainment Tonight"" and acted in an episode of the television show ""90210.""  Aunt La Toya Jackson arranged the jobs for him. Paris signed up with an A-list Hollywood manager to help with her acting career earlier this year, but that's on hold while she is being treated. Blanket, whose nickname came from the blanket his father often covered him with in public, is still taught at home, which is now a big hilltop house in a gated Calabasas, California, community. ""He does dance moves like his father,"" according to Chase, who was rehired as the children's chef last year. Blanket, now 11, does ""a lot of remembering what daddy did, and it's constant nonstop talking of him and his father's relationship together,"" Chase testified last week.  He often wears a T-shirt from the Cirque du Soleil ""Immortal"" show based on his father's music, Chase said. ""He wears it constantly."" The trial, in its ninth week in a Los Angeles courtroom, is expected to last into August, according to lawyers on both sides.","Tuesday is the fourth anniversary of Michael Jackson's death .

"Crowds in a Syrian town surrounded by government troops cheered Arab League monitors who visited Sunday as others fled the town on foot to escape the fighting inside. Residents of Zabadani, about 50 km (30 miles) northwest of Damascus, lifted one of the monitors onto their shoulders and passed him around the crowd during Sunday's visit. They told CNN that their water and electricity had been cut off for the past three days, and they showed off wounds they said had been inflicted by pro-government forces. The monitors got a different reception from Syrian soldiers, who berated them as the soldiers carried off the body of one of their comrades they said had been shot by opposition forces. The visit came as another 32 people were killed by government troops trying to crush a 10-month-old uprising against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition umbrella group. The toll included 13 in Homs, the scene of some of the worst fighting to date; 10 in the city of Idlib; and three people, inlcuding a child, in Hama. During a visit to neighboring Lebanon, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon delivered a blunt message to al-Assad: ""Stop killing your people."" Meanwhile, al-Assad announced that he was granting amnesty to anti-government demonstrators for ""all crimes committed"" since the uprising began last March, Syrian state-run media reported. In Zabadani, a CNN crew heading into the city with the Arab League monitors saw men, women and children trudging out of the city to get away from the fighting. When the monitors prepared to leave, many of the thousands who greeted  the monitors in town urged them to stay, warning that attacks by government troops would resume once they left. Some offered to show the monitors where Syrian tanks were hidden in the fields surrounding the city. Syria was required to pull heavy weaponry out of the cities under the agreement its signed with the Arab League in November, but Zabadani residents said the tanks pulled back only when the monitors were on their way. Fares Mohammed, an LCC spokesman, said about 100 armored vehicles had surrounded the city for three days, and that power and water had been cut off as the city faced sub-freezing temperatures. A member of the Free Syria Army -- composed mostly of deserters who are siding with the opposition -- said there were about 70 lightly armed fighters in the city. The fighter asked not to be named for security reasons. ""The situation is very bad. The siege is choking us, and even air is running out,"" the fighter said, adding that fighters were setting up roadblocks to try to keep government forces out of residential areas. On their way out of town, the monitors were held up at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Zabadani for about an hour and a half as occasional bullets whizzed by. During that time, Syrian troops carried off the body of a fellow soldier who had just been shot and turned their anger on the monitors. ""Is this what you want?"" one asked. ""Is this what the world wants? Is this a free Syria?"" More gunfire erupted as the monitors left town, and a soldier at another checkpoint rushed out to hammer at their vehicle. More than 5,000 people have died since mid-March, the United Nations has said. Opposition groups put the toll at more than 6,000. Al-Assad, who has characterized the anti-government protesters as ""armed gangs,"" says his security forces are battling terrorists intent on targeting civilians and fomenting unrest. His latest amnesty decree follows the recent release of 5,000 prisoners by the Syrian government under its agreement with the Arab League. It grants grants general amnesty for crimes committed between March 15, 2011, and January 15, 2012, according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency. The decree applies to people who engaged in peaceful demonstrations, carried or possesses unlicensed weapons or ammunition and draft evaders, SANA said. Fugitives must hand themselves in by the end of the month to benefit from the amnesty, the agency reported. It is the second time al-Assad has granted a general amnesty to protesters, who have been calling for an end to the regime. But reports of carnage mount every day, despite the presence of Arab League observers in the country and international calls for a halt to the crackdown. ""Today, I say again to President Assad of Syria: Stop the violence. Stop killing your people,"" Ban said at a conference on political reform and democracy in Beirut. ""The path of repression is a dead end."" CNN cannot verify accounts of what is happening in Syria because the government restricts the activity of journalists.  A number of journalists have been allowed in to the country in recent days, including a CNN correspondent, to travel with Arab League monitors. The Arab League mission began December 26 and is expected to conclude on January 19. It has been mired in controversy from the start, from the choice to head the mission -- Lt. Gen. Mohammed Ahmed al-Dabi, once the head of Sudan's military intelligence -- to reports that the Syrian government was limiting the group's access.","32 reported killed in the latest attacks .

"(CNN) -- The human rights group Amnesty International said Friday that Haitian authorities are launching a probe into alleged crimes against humanity committed during the 15-year rule of former dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier. Amnesty International researcher Gerardo Ducos gave Haitian authorities 100 documents that it says detail cases of detention without trial, systematic torture, disappearances and extrajudicial killings that took place in Haiti between 1971 and 1986. Amnesty International as well as Human Rights Watch say that thousands of Haitians suffered grave injustices under Duvalier's iron-fisted rule. The former strongman stunned the world by returning suddenly to Haiti last Sunday after 25 years in exile in France. In his first public statement since his unexpected return, Duvalier told reporters he wanted to be in Haiti to help with rebuilding the country after last year's devastating earthquake. He made no mention of any political ambition. ""The desire to participate at your side in this national reconstruction effort is more important than any of the problems I could face. The price to pay is not important. The essential (thing) for me is to be with you,"" Duvalier said. He spoke for roughly 10 minutes at a private residence and did not take questions from reporters. Earlier, he was expected to speak at a handful at public locations, but was forced to cancel because the owners of those places did not want him there. Police escorted Duvalier to court Tuesday, where a judge questioned him for hours. He faces charges of corruption and embezzlement on allegations he stole hundreds of millions of dollars from the national treasury. But human rights groups have mounted pressure on Haitian authorities to take Duvalier to court on abuse charges. Ducos said the decision to investigate Duvalier for such abuses is a huge step forward. He said he did not know why Duvalier returned to Haiti but many people have waited many years for an opportunity to prosecute him. ""The state has an obligation to bring him to justice,"" Ducos said. He said he met Thursday with Harycidas Auguste, Haiti's chief prosecutor, and Minister of Justice Paul Denis, to discuss the need for an investigation. He said he urged Haitian authorities to ensure that abuse survivors  -- including those who fled Haiti --  are given a chance to tell their stories. Four Haitians have already filed criminal complaints against Duvalier, Ducos said. Michele Montas, a journalist and former spokeswoman for the U.N. secretary-general, said she endured threats and detention and survived an assassination attempt for her journalism. The staff at her husband's independent radio station was harassed and the station was shut down during Duvalier's rule, she said. She was expelled from the country in 1980 and returned only after Duvalier's ouster. ""We have enough proof,"" she told CNN. ""There are enough people who can testify. And what I will do is go to a public prosecutor, and there is a public prosecutor that could actually accommodate our complaints."" Amnesty International researchers collected its information mainly through the testimonies of prisoners, many of whose detentions were never officially acknowledged. The testimonies revealed a pattern of abuse, the organization said. Journalist Yvens Paul told Amnesty International that he was detained at the Port-au-Prince airport in 1980. He said he was taken to prison, where detectives undressed him and beat him. He said his abusers enjoyed seeing the blood gush from his body. They told him he had been arrested because his radio broadcasts were ""subversive."" Frank Blaise, a 70-year-old agronomist, returned home to Haiti from the United States in June 1983 and was arrested two months later and driven by jeep to the Casernes Dessalines army barracks, which the United Nations says was used by Duvalier to interrogate and detain people suspected of anti-government activity. Blaise told Amnesty International he was arrested for his book on agrarian reform and kept in a dark, damp solitary confinement cell. Amnesty International's documents tell the experiences of cobblers, taxi drivers, filmmakers, mechanics, distillers and even hairdressers, all of whom, they say, were arrested for anti-government activity. ""Jean-Claude Duvalier was the head of state then,"" Ducos said. ""He shares responsibility for these crimes. He must face justice.""

Located within Banff National Park, this course is a natural panoramic wonder that's both challenging and captivating. Surrounding mountain cliffs stare down on you on nearly every green of the championship course. The original 18 holes were designed by Canada's master golf architect, Stanley Thompson, back in 1928. With a judicious use of bunkers and a layout that hugs the winding Bow River, it's a course that thrills amateurs and professionals alike. The Tunnel Mountain nine-hole course added in 1989 allows you to get in an early game and still enjoy the wide array of outdoor activities in the area, like a raft trip down to nearby Canmore, where more magnificent courses await. The Fairmont Banff Springs, 405 Spray Ave., Banff, Alberta; +1 403 762 2211 . Silvertip Resort . Located on the ""sunny"" side of the Bow Valley, this course brings you as close to wildlife as you'll get -- at least while holding a golf club. Between two wildlife corridors, the course has been certified as an ""Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary"" for its conservation and preservation practices. The par 72 sports 600 feet of elevation change and is the only course in the area on the south-facing side of the mountains -- so you can tee off later and enjoy longer days on the links. The clubhouse deck offers one of the most spectacular views in golf and offers front row seats overlooking the 18th, so you get to be judge, jury and commentator as your fellow golfers display their downhill skills on an extremely steep par 4. Silvertip Resort, 2000 Silvertip Trail, Canmore, Alberta; +1 403 678 1600 . Stewart Creek Golf Club . Built on an abandoned coal mine, this may be the area's most rugged and rewarding championship course. On the eastern slopes of the mountain range near Canmore, it's a 15-minute drive from Banff and consistently ranked with 4.5 stars by ""Golf Digest."" A massive, eye-catching three-peak wall known as The Three Sisters hovers over the property and makes for stellar selfies. In a nod to its proud past, this reclaimed masterpiece incorporates a number of refurbished mine entrances that add authenticity, and places to hide from the rain. While the mine shafts that still run beneath the fairways have been reinforced, the steep tees and vanishing fairways may leave you feeling a bit shaky -- all the more reason to make sure you get some ""beautiful shots"" of the photographic kind. Stewart Creek Golf Club, 4100 Stewart Creek Drive, Canmore, Alberta; +1 403 609 6099 . The Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge . Another Stanley Thompson creation, this course is considered his greatest work. Having designed or reworked more than 100 courses in his native Canada, the Jasper showcases his trademark features:  scruffy-edged bunkers, mounded fairways and daring par threes. Fairways here are carved out of the forest, with attention paid to the natural contours of the mountains. An 18-hole, par-71 course, it has elevated tee boxes with views that soak in the surrounding mountain peaks. The 14th tee is the crown jewel. Overlooking a pristine green lake, it's both inviting and exhilarating, requiring a gutsy drive over water and through some well-placed pine trees. Accept the challenge and you'll be rewarded with a rare bunker-less green that's defended by only the natural slope of the land. Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, Old Lodge Road, Jasper, Alberta; +1 780 852 3301 . Canmore Golf and Curling Club . Conveniently situated in the heart of an alpine village, this easily accessible course has deep roots in a proud mountain community. Constructed and funded solely by the residents of Canmore, it's a public space that embraces visitors with its natural beauty and hospitality. The surrounding snow-capped peaks serve as reminders that this is still Canada.  And though they love their golf in Canmore, when the greens are inevitably blanketed with ice and snow, people around here turn to another sport to test their patience and precision: curling. Like golf, curling can be mystifying to those who've never tried it, yet magical to those who'll never leave it.

"The famously anonymous British graffiti artist Banksy, whose work regularly commands six figures in art auctions, says he had a hard time moving his spray-painted canvases in New York's Central Park. Banksy, whose work began popping up on New York walls this month, posted a video on his website showing an elderly man -- not the artist -- working at a stall at the park on Sunday. The selling price for each piece: $60. The man sat, as people passed by the paintings with barely a glance. Banksy sets New Yorkers on race to find street art before vandals . According to the video, more than four hours passed before the first sale was made, to a customer who bargained to get two paintings for $60. Later, a woman from New Zealand bought two at full price, the video says. Then a man from Chicago stopped and said, ""I just need something for the walls"" of his new house. He bought four more, Banksy's video says. The total take for eight paintings: $420. The artist says he's on a ""residency on the streets of New York."" His website shows photos of a truck he parked in various places around New York after painting the interior with a garden scene. Paintings on New York walls include one of a dog urinating on a fire hydrant, with a cartoon bubble that says, ""You complete me."" Banksy never shows his face. He even asked for permission to wear a disguise to the 2011 Academy Awards ceremony when his documentary film, ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" was nominated. The academy said no, so he didn't attend (as far as we know). He did not win the Oscar. Devoted fans race to find his latest work in Britain, and the phenomenon moved to New York this month. Late-night TV host Stephen Colbert went so far as to broadly hint that he'd like for a Banksy work to show up on his studio wall. But don't look for him in Central Park. His website said, ""Please note: This was a one off. The stall will not be there again today."" Art fans lament . Fans outside Banksy's latest installment Monday lamented their missed opportunities to get their hands on an original canvas during the artist's Central Park sale. ""I'm really annoyed that I wasn't there to get one. It's just genius,"" said Bea McMonagle who brought her 1-year-old daughter Isa with her to see the newest creation. McMonagle, who lives in Brooklyn, has been following the succession of Banksy works around the city. ""It's really bringing people together. I recognize people from the crowd that have been at other installations. It's kind of neat,"" she said. Jackie Hadel crouched on the ground with her iPad and said she keeps a blog with all the works she has spotted around New York since the launch of the ""Better Out Than In"" street show. ""I was over on Ludlow the other day and I snapped a picture of a guy leaning against a wall and I posted it on my blog and then a little while later an artist contacted me privately and said, 'Do you realize that's Banksy?' Swear!"" she said. Hadel, however, recognizes that the artist shrouds his identity in complete secrecy. ""But there's no proof of it. Nobody's gonna call it out. No one wants to acknowledge that that could be,"" she said. ""As long as he's anonymous he's going to keep making these incredible pieces for the rest of the month,"" she said.  ""It shouldn't be about chasing him as much as just chasing his murals and chasing his ideas."" S.M. Kamruzzaman lives across the street from the wall where the mural appeared. His opinion on the graffiti? ""Very fantastic. This artist is very nice. Everybody likes this one,"" he said, smiling.

"(CNN) -- One of the most outspoken gay critics of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy said Thursday that he has been discharged from the Army. Lt. Dan Choi, who was arrested in March for handcuffing himself to a White House fence in protest of the policy, released a statement saying he had been honorably discharged. The ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy bars people who are openly gay or lesbian from serving in the military. ""This is both an infuriating and painful announcement,"" Choi said. ""But my service continues. ... Remaining silent when our family and community members are fired or punished for who they truly are would be an unequivocal moral dereliction that tarnishes the honor of the uniform and insults the meaning of America."" Choi told CNN he received the news through a phone call from his Army National Guard battalion commander. His discharge, however, actually became effective on June 29, according to Eric Durr, a National Guard spokesman. ""You prepare yourself,"" Choi said. ""I built an armor up."" Choi, a 2003 West Point graduate who is fluent in Arabic, was an infantry platoon leader, serving with his unit in Iraq in 2006 and 2007. He admitted his sexual orientation publicly for the first time last year on MSNBC's ""The Rachel Maddow Show,"" prompting the Army to initiate proceedings to discharge him. Choi, who lives in New York City, founded KnightsOut.org, an advocacy and education organization of West Point graduates who are gay, lesbian, transgender or bisexual. KnightsOut estimates there are 65,000 gays in the military. President Barack Obama is pushing for a repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. A bill that would overturn the measure after a Pentagon review is completed in December is currently before Congress. More than 12,500 gays have been booted from the military since ""don't ask, don't tell"" went into effect.

"Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic can't stop playing classics. Two months after their five-set thriller at the French Open, Nadal beat Djokovic 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 to reach the Rogers Cup final in Montreal. In a contest with memorable baseline rallies that routinely got the crowd off their feet, it was Nadal -- just like in Paris -- who prevailed to set up a clash with home favorite Milos Raonic. Nadal stormed to a 6-0 lead in the tiebreak and when Djokovic sent a forehand long on Nadal's third match point, the Spaniard recorded his first win on hard courts over the Serb in three years. He improved to 9-0 on hard courts this season and boosted his overall record against Djokovic to 21-15. ""To play very well, I have to play aggressive,"" Nadal was quoted as saying by the ATP's website. ""If not, I cannot play well on this kind of surface. And I did. ""I played a very high level tonight I think. I played with the right decisions in the important moments. Yes, the serve worked well during the whole night. And the shots from the baseline, I tried to stay very close to the baseline."" The loss is a blow to Djokovic, whose best surface is hard courts. He had won the tournament the previous two years. ""There were very few points that decided the winner,"" Djokovic was quoted as saying by the ATP's website. ""I had my chances, he had his chances. I guess at the end he played better. ""Whenever we play against each other, it's always a thrilling match for the crowd to see."" Raonic defeated his fellow Canadian Vasek Pospisil in another third-set tiebreak, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6. The big-serving Raonic suffered a dip in his game the past couple of months but has awoken at home and will now crack the top 10 -- a first for a Canadian man in singles. He is bidding to become the first Canadian to win the event in the Open era. Nadal, however, leads their head-to-heads 3-0 without dropping a set.

"(CNN) -- Bret has become the second tropical storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, according to the National Weather Service. As of Sunday night, Bret was about 100 miles (165 kilometers) northwest of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas, packing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts. These winds could be felt up to 35 miles (55 kilometers) from the center of the storm. Not much movement was expected overnight, but the National Weather Service said it expected a slow north-northeastward motion to begin on Monday. Additional strengthening is expected in the next 48 hours, according to the agency. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Grand Bahama Island and the Abaco Islands in the northwest Bahamas. Bret could produce 1-3 inches of rainfall and high surf conditions along northern- and western-facing beaches.","Bret strengthens from a tropical depression to a tropical storm .

"(CNN) -- Can graphic design help protect your privacy? Sang Mun, a designer and former NSA contractor, thinks so. Just months after Edward Snowden controversially lifted the lid on digital surveillance being conducted by the U.S. and other governments, the issue of online privacy is back in the spotlight. Earlier this month Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed concern that users' trust in internet companies had been damaged by the revelations. Google's Eric Schmidt also called for greater transparency from the U.S. government over surveillance. Sang Mun's response was more direct -- the Korean designer has created four new fonts called ZXX that aim to disrupt the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems used by Google and others to analyze text. ZXX Type Specimen Video from Sang Mun on Vimeo. ""I decided to create a typeface that would be unreadable by text scanning software (whether used by a government agency or a lone hacker),"" Mun told CNN via email, ""misdirecting information or sometimes not giving any at all."" Mun, who worked with the NSA during his time in the Korean military, says that a number of global developments motivated him to act: ""The news about the NSA secretly building the country's biggest data center; the House passing the controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA); the social network media accumulating abundant information on every individual's life; Google announcing its work-in-progress Glass project -- and the list goes on."" ""Sometimes these ideas about privacy can feel large and abstract to the average person. I thought that addressing these issues through the design of a typeface -- a building block of language and communication -- would bring home the conversation to the average person,"" Mun says. The four different fonts -- Camo, False, Noise and Xed -- were developed through a rigorous process of drawing and testing, Mun says: ""The challenge was to make the OCR legible typeface illegible to computer vision, while keeping it readable to the human eye."" Each font uses a different optical trick to make them difficult to scan: 'Camo' adds camouflage-like patterns over letters, 'Noise' overlays the letters with dots, 'Xed' puts a neat X across each character, and 'False' uses a small letter beneath a larger 'false' one. Matthew Green, Research Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, says that of the four different fonts, 'False' could be most promising, but that in his view camouflaged fonts are not terribly effective at protecting people's privacy: ""For standard optical character recognition that's tuned to read traditional typefaces and handwriting, yes, I think (these fonts) will be confusing ... But if the NSA really wants to detect this data? Not really. The problem here is that the fonts don't appear to be randomized, which means every time I type the letter 'A' I'll get the same letter. To an OCR program these letters are just shapes. The funny-looking A shape is no more difficult to detect than a real A shape."" Ross Anderson, Professor in Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, shares Green's criticisms: ""I don't think any of this is more than privacy theater. The fonts could probably be broken."" Mun concedes that the fonts' actual effectiveness may be limited, but that he hopes they will alert people to the issue of digital surveillance: ""ZXX is a call to action, both practically and symbolically, to raise questions about privacy. Intercepting and storing world citizens' words and thoughts is simply a vulgar intrusion on our daily lives ... It's our duty to call out crimes against democracy.""

"A defiant former Vice President Dick Cheney stood by his defense of the extreme interrogation techniques used by the CIA on detainees in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on Sunday, saying, ""I would do it again in a minute."" Critics of the interrogation tactics -- detailed in a recently released controversial Senate report -- contend they should be considered torture and regretted. But Cheney said there is no ""moral equivalence"" between the terrorists' actions and the CIA's interrogation techniques. ""With respect to trying to define that as torture, I come back to the proposition torture was what the al Qaeda terrorists did to 3,000 Americans on 9/11,"" Cheney said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""There's no comparison between that and what we did with the respect to enhanced interrogation."" The former vice president also dispelled the report's findings that then-President George W. Bush was unaware of the techniques taking place, saying that Bush authorized the tactics, and the report detailing otherwise is a ""lie."" ""We got the authorization from the President and authorization from the Justice Department to go forward with the program,"" Cheney said. ""It worked."" Cheney also said he believed the involuntary rectal feeding and hydration tactic revealed in the report was not, in his mind, considered torture, but rather a medical procedure, despite medical experts denouncing the tactic as ineffective and not medically justified. ""That does not meet the definition of what was used in the program,"" Cheney said. RELATED: Senate torture report restarts debate . Cheney called the report ""seriously flawed,"" contending that the analysis was conducted in a partisan fashion and was released without speaking to anyone who knew anything about the program.

"Even after the identification of the Boston bombing suspects through grainy security-camera images, officials say that blanketing a city in surveillance cameras can create as many problems as it solves. A network of cameras on city streets and other public spaces increases the chances of capturing a criminal on video but can generate an overwhelming amount of evidence to sift through. The cameras make some people feel more secure, knowing that bad guys are being watched. But privacy advocates and other citizens are uneasy with the idea that Big Brother is monitoring their every public move. Meanwhile, facial-recognition software and other technologies are making security-camera images more valuable to law enforcement. Now, software can automatically mine surveillance footage for information, such as a specific person's face, and create a giant searchable database. After last week's bombings at the Boston Marathon, authorities had to sift through a mountain of footage from government surveillance cameras, private security cameras and imagery shot by bystanders on smartphones. It took the FBI only three days to release blurry shots of the two suspects, taken by a department store's cameras. Compare their quick turnaround with the 2005 London bombings, when it took thousands of investigators weeks to parse the city's CCTV (closed-circuit television) footage after the attacks. The cameras, software and algorithms have come a long way in eight years. Cities under surveillance . In major cities, in the age of terrorism, someone is almost always watching. The cameras used in London are part of the city's extensive and sophisticated ""Ring of Steel"" surveillance system that combines nearly a half million cameras, roadblocks and license plate readers to monitor the heart of the city. Set up in 1998, the system is one of the most advanced in the world and allows authorities to track anyone going into or out of central London. Many residents question the effectiveness of London's system, however. In 2008, only one crime was solved for every 1,000 cameras, according to the city's police. CCTV cameras across Britain also cost authorities nearly $800 million over the past four years, according to civil liberties group Big Brother Watch. Modeled after London's system, New York's Lower Manhattan Security Initiative monitors 4,000 security cameras and license plate readers south of Canal Street. The project uses feeds from both private and public security cameras, which are are all monitored 24 hours a day by the NYPD. Using face and object-detection technology, the police can track cars and people moving through 1.7 square miles in lower Manhattan and even detect unattended packages. The $150 million initiative also includes a number of radiation detectors and automatic roadblocks that can can be used to stop traffic in an emergency. Boston's camera network is smaller than those in London and New York, though that is likely to change soon. In 2007, Boston law enforcement had an estimated 55 CCTV cameras set up around the city. Since then, the city has expanded its surveillance system, though authorities there are not commenting on the exact scope of the current camera setup. Boston's example has shown the power of these systems to help solve crimes, causing many to call for even more cameras. But it's still not clear whether they are effective at preventing crimes. According to the Surveillance Studies Centre at Queen's University in Ontario, urban surveillance systems have not been proven to have any effect on deterring criminals. Facial recognition . As the volume and quality of cameras and sensors are ramped up, cities are turning to more advanced face- and object-recognition software to makes sense of the data. ""We describe what's in the video, and we store that in a database,"" said Al Shipp, CEO of San Francisco-based 3VR, one of several companies that makes this type of facial-recognition technology. The company's first investor was In-Q-Tel, the CIA's venture-capital arm, which finds and funds promising security-related technology. Now, 3VR works with federal and local law enforcement agencies, as well as private companies and banks. Its software can identify objects by shape, size and color. It can read license plates and recognize cars. When it comes to people, it can detect their gender, approximate age, mood and other demographic information. Using multiple cameras, it can track their patterns and some behaviors. It automatically zooms in on any person's face and identifies them based on things like the distance between their eyes or the shape of their nose. All that information is stored in a database. Big clues that would take a traditional investigator untold hours of watching video to uncover can be found with a 15-second search query. Opinion: Surveillance state no answer to terror . For example, they could do a search for anyone who entered a 7-Eleven store between 8 and 11 p.m. on a specific night, pull up the times that certain cars have entered and left a parking lot, or ask for images of every person who has entered a certain building over the past year. ""It instantaneously gives you a picture of everybody who has walked in the door in the past based on the geometries of their face,"" Shipp said. Privacy concerns . Civil-liberties activists are concerned about how this technology could be abused. With cameras in far-flung cities all connecting to the same database, a person's movements can be tracked across states or continents. For example, it could be used to single out a person attending multiple political protests. ""We like to think we have some privacy in our lives, that we can go places that we don't necessarily want the government to know about,"" said said Jennifer Lynch, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet civil-liberties group. ""What concerns me is if all of those cameras get linked together at some point, and if we apply facial recognition on the back end, we'll be able to track people wherever they go."" For now, many of the biometrics databases in the United States are still separated. Some are scattered across various federal and local government agencies, and connecting them will take time and big budgets. The FBI is in the process of building out its own facial-recognition database and is working with state DMVs to access their photos. It's less likely the government will be able to tap into private databases anytime soon, but it's still a cause for concern down the line, privacy advocates say. Facebook has the largest facial-recognition database in the world, a potentially rich vein of data for any government agency. Another worry is the misidentification of suspects. Shipp acknowledges that these systems can make mistakes but says the computers aren't there to take over for humans but to assist investigators by weeding out useless information. ""The cameras themselves are not a panacea. They're not going to solve the problem. It's one of the steps,"" he said. But at least one prominent tech blogger thinks the benefits of surveillance cameras outweigh our fears about privacy. ""The idea of submitting to constant monitoring feels wrong, nearly un-American, to most of us. Cameras in the sky are the ultimate manifestation of Big Brother --  way for the government to watch you all the time, everywhere,"" Farhad Manjoo wrote last week in Slate. But Manjoo thinks we need to be thinking about ways to make cameras work for us, not reasons to abolish them. ""When you weigh cameras against other security measures, they emerge as the least costly and most effective choice. In the aftermath of 9/11, we've turned most public spaces into fortresses -- now, it's impossible for you to get into tall buildings, airports, many museums, concerts, and even public celebrations without being subjected to pat-downs and metal detectors. When combined with competent law enforcement, surveillance cameras are more effective, less intrusive, less psychologically draining, and much more pleasant than these alternatives.""","New technology makes it easier to identify suspects in surveillance photos and video .

"Mogilnoye, Ukraine (CNN) -- In the Ukraine house where she grew up, Oksana Balinskaya's hazel eyes transfixed on television images of Moammar Gadhafi. He was now a fallen leader, a fugitive sought for justice. He had been known as the ruthless leader of a pariah state, a butcher, a delusional man divorced from reality. But Balinskaya, 25, who served as one of Gadhafi's five Ukrainian nurses for nearly two years, had always seen him in a different light. She had checked his blood pressure, monitored his heart, stuck him with a needle to draw blood, gave him vitamins and pills for his ailments, though he didn't seem to have many. He was a healthy man. She even called him ""Daddy."" All the Ukrainian nurses did. It was a nickname they used to speak about him among themselves, without attracting attention. ""Daddy gave us jobs, money and a good life,"" she said. Far removed now from the sands of Libya, Balinskaya sat at the kitchen table with her Serbian husband, looking upward at the boxy TV set atop the refrigerator. Images of Gadhafi's fiery defiance flashed in the face of ouster. She would feel sorry for him if he were killed or captured, she said. ""Gadhafi was quite considerate to us,"" she said. ""He would ask us whether we are happy and whether we have everything that we need."" Every September, on the anniversary of his rise to power, Gadhafi presented souvenirs to his Ukrainian nurses and other members of his inner circle. Balinskaya received a medallion and a watch etched with his picture. She took turns with the other nurses accompanying him on foreign trips, sometimes sparking rumors spread in the media about Gadhafi's harem. All of what was being said about Gadhafi seemed contrary to what she knew about the man -- including the allegations by Gadhafi family nannies and domestic staff that they were tortured and abused. Gadhafi, she said, always treated her very well. Her job now lost to Libya's civil war, she pitied the nation. ""If it were not for Gadhafi, who else would have built it?"" she said. ""It was he who constructed it. He has transferred Libyans from camelbacks into cars."" The rules were strict: No lipstick . By the time Gadhafi visited Ukraine in October 2009, Balinskaya had graduated from nursing school in Kiev and been working in the area of her native Mogilnoye for three years. But life was not easy in Ukraine; she was making only $125 a month. She knew of opportunities in Libya and had already submitted an application for work there. It was an opportunity to make a better life for herself. Salaries were higher in Libya and she would receive housing and other perks. She had been waiting for about a month to hear back when Gadhafi arrived on his state visit to Ukraine. A meeting was arranged for him to meet six personal nurse candidates. Balinskaya was one of them. She knew little about Gadhafi then and felt nervous at their first meeting. Three of the six nurses had already worked in Libya and knew Arabic. Balinskaya thought she did not have a chance. Gadhafi greeted them but Balinskaya found nothing special in the selection process. ""I don't know how he made the choice; perhaps he was a good psychologist,"" she said. She learned later that he understood people from that first handshake, from that first gaze into their eyes. Soon, she was on her way to Tripoli. Her job was solely to treat Gadhafi and his large family. The rules were strict. The attractive Ukrainian nurses wore no flashy makeup or revealing clothes. ""Our appearance was very humble so as to not attract anybody's attention,"" she said. ""We would never put on lipstick going to his house and have vivid colors in our clothes."" She was always surrounded by others -- Gadhafi's wife, children, grandchildren, officials within his inner circle. ""None of us had ever been one on one with him,"" she said. ""There wasn't even a single room in his household where we could have possibly been left alone with him."" That's why she was shocked by the gossip that Gadhafi had sexual relationships with his foreign nurses. Veteran Ukrainian nurse, Galina Kolonitskaya, 38, who had worked with Gadhafi for nearly a decade, was described in a U.S. diplomatic cable posted by WikiLeaks as a ""voluptuous blonde"" who ""knows his routine."" It said the Libyan dictator was deeply attached to her. ""Galina was the same kind of nurse as we all were,"" Balinskaya said. ""She is of course a glamorous and very kind woman with a big heart. She helped me a lot. ""I don't know who created this image about us nurses, as well as about his female bodyguards,"" she said. ""How could anyone in sane mind assume that we could have had any intimate relationship with Gadhafi?"" Hoping to return to Libya . Both Balinskaya and Kolonitskaya left Libya in February when the uprising against Gadhafi took root. But it was not just the threat of war that prompted Balinskaya to leave. She was pregnant then and had started showing. She returned to her native Mogilnoye, a village south of Kiev. Her husband Dejan, a 38-year-old Serbian businessman, joined her there. A month ago, as Gadhafi's regime teetered, Balinskaya gave birth to a baby boy. Journalists were also eager to hear Kolonitskaya's tales of Gadhafi, lining up at her apartment door. But she has avoided publicity. ""All that gossip about her is untrue,"" Balinskaya said. ""She was totally fed up. There was too much attention on her for no reason."" The nurses, she said, had no personal relationship with Gadhafi. ""I can only say good things about him,"" she said, thinking of the comfortable life she had in Libya, dreaming of how to make it happen again. ""I very much hope that we will return to Libya,"" she said, flipping through an album with photographs of herself in Libya. Only, it will be a different Libya now. One without Gadhafi. Without ""Daddy."" CNN's Maxim Tkachenko reported from Mogilnoye, Ukraine, and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta.","Oksana Balinskaya worked as a personal nurse to Moammar Gadhafi .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli government's press division is apologizing for circulating a link to a video that mocks activists aboard a ship headed to Gaza earlier this week that was blocked by an Israeli raid. ""Due to a misunderstanding on our part, earlier (Friday) we inadvertently issued a video link that had been sent for our perusal,"" according to a statement from Israel's Government Press Office, which distributed the link to media outlets. ""It was not intended for general release,"" the statement said. ""The contents of the video in no way represent the official policy of either the Government Press Office or of the State of Israel."" The video, titled ""We Con the World"" -- set to the tune of the 1985 hit, ""We are the World""-- was put together by Caroline Glick, a former member of the Israel Defense Forces and columnist for the Jerusalem Post. In the video, up to a dozen members of the so-called ""Flotilla Choir"" -- some wearing a variation of traditional Arab dress -- sing satirical verses, such as: ""There's no people dying, so the best that we can do is create the biggest bluff of all."" On her blog, Glick, who briefly appears in the video, says, ""We produced a clip in English. There we feature the Turkish-Hamas 'love boat' captain, crew and passengers in a musical explanation of how they con the world."" ""We think this is an important Israeli contribution to the discussion of recent events and we hope you distribute it far and wide,"" she adds. Nine Turkish citizens were killed Monday after violence erupted on one of six ships in a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to the Palestinian Gaza Strip. A number of other people were wounded. Israel said the passengers initiated the attack; the passengers blamed the troops. That incident drew widespread condemnation and cast a spotlight on the dynamics of the Gaza crisis. On Saturday, Israel intercepted the final boat that was part of the flotilla, though the incident aboard the Irish-owned MV Rachel Corrie ended peacefully about 22 miles off the Gaza coast. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev dismissed the the video link, saying, ""The GPO sends out lots of articles. It doesn't mean they like it."" Regev said he first noticed the video on the New York Times website. ""I called my kids in to watch it because I thought it was funny,"" he said. ""It is what Israelis feel. But the government has nothing to do with it. The GPO distributes non-government items, things that we think that show our side of the story."" It was not the first time the Israeli GPO stirred controversy with its public communications on the Gaza flotilla. Prior to the storming of the Turkish ship, the GPO sent an e-mail to journalists sarcastically recommending that while covering ""alleged humanitarian difficulties,"" journalists should dine at one of Gaza's few restaurants. ""We have been told the beef stroganoff and cream of spinach soup are highly recommended,"" the e-mail said. The message included an internet link to an old promotional video for the restaurant. The e-mail drew criticism from the foreign press and pro-Palestinian activists. In an interview with the Jerusalem Post, GPO director Danny Seaman defended the communication, arguing that foreign media coverage of Gaza was not balanced. CNN's Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","NEW: E-mail sent by press office prior to ship's storming also sparked controversy .

"Justice Anthony Kennedy was among the first of his colleagues to arrive Wednesday at the U.S. Supreme Court. His chambers lit up several hours before the last-day release of monumental rulings on same-sex marriage. There was little doubt that later that morning, this quietly powerful justice would be having a major say in the legal, political, and social path of gay rights moving forward. And at precisely 10 a.m., Kennedy kicked off the public session with his eloquent majority ruling striking down a key part of a federal law that blocks a range of benefits for legally married gay and lesbian couples. The Defense of Marriage Act ""humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples,"" he said. ""The law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives."" What's next for gay rights movement? It was vintage Kennedy -- a mix of sweeping rhetoric mixed with practical legal and social considerations. ""If Bill Clinton was 'the first black president,' Anthony Kennedy has now firmly secured his place in history as 'the first gay justice,'"" said Michael Dorf, a law professor at Cornell University and a former Kennedy law clerk. ""Justice Kennedy makes clear that he not only accepts, but welcomes the task of writing majestic opinions affirming the dignity of gay persons and couples."" By the Numbers: Same-sex marriage . Kennedy, a moderate-conservative, is in many ways the ""power broker"" on the court. He shared the role of a ""swing vote"" with fellow centrist Sandra Day O'Connor before she retired seven years ago. ""The basic principle is, it's Justice Kennedy's world and you just live in it,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a private attorney who publishes the well-read SCOTUSblog.com. ""Justice O'Connor, having been the most powerful woman in the world, handed the keys to him on her way out the door and said, 'Have fun.' And he took up that invitation."" The thinking goes that with four solid conservatives aligned on the right and four liberals on the left, Kennedy is the man in the middle, often able to cast the deciding vote in contentious cases, assuring his views of the law prevail. Kennedy has crafted a powerful, if hard to define, judicial legacy -- seemingly in the forefront of every major ruling during his tenure. As an unapologetic ""swing"" vote, he was the key behind-the-scenes architect of the 2000 Bush v. Gore drama, and a 1992 opinion upholding abortion rights. He has written majority decisions upholding rights to homosexual couples, underage killers, and foreign fighters held by the U.S. military in the war on terror. That was true this past term in several other hot-button cases in which he played a key role by: . • Writing the majority opinion allowing for the continued but limited use of race in the college admissions process, yet making it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity. • Siding with his fellow conservatives to strike down a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, weakening federal oversight of states and counties with a past history of discrimination of minority voters at the polls. • Concluding criminal suspects can be subjected to a police DNA test after arrest but before trial and conviction. • Blocking a lawsuit by privacy advocates challenging the federal government's sweeping electronic eavesdropping on suspected foreign terrorists and spies. Kennedy was in the majority 91% of the time in the court's 78 argued cases this term, more than any justice. In divided cases -- where there was no unanimity -- he was on the winning side 83%, again tops on the court. Sometimes he sides with his more liberal colleagues, as he did in the Defense of Marriage Act case, but he is mostly a reliable conservative vote, especially on business and regulation disputes. That unpredictability has long made liberals and conservatives equally nervous, but many on the right are more outspoken in their disappointment in the Ronald Reagan nominee, who turns 77 in July. ""Kennedy's style as the 'man in the middle' is often as a 'justice in a muddle,'"" said Douglas Kmiec, a law professor at Pepperdine University and a former lawyer in the Reagan and Bush administrations. ""He writes cryptically ... suggesting a standard of his own making that is not fully developed."" Despite the rhetoric, Kennedy's moderating force has generally benefited his conservative colleagues. Of the 23 divided 5-4 cases this term -- including the two marriage cases as well as voting rights -- Kennedy was in the majority 20 times, according to SCOTUSblog.com, again higher than anyone on the nine-member bench. Only on six decisions did he side with the four left-leaning justices: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. But it was his majority opinion in the DOMA case that could have ripple effects for years to come. ""Although Justice Kennedy's opinion explicitly states that it is confined to same-sex marriages that have been recognized by states, it contains reasoning and language that will certainly be used, in later cases, to argue that legal recognition of same-sex marriage by all states is constitutionally required,"" said University of Notre Dame law professor Richard W. Garnett, a past clerk to former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.  ""Almost certainly, and fairly soon, that argument will be presented squarely to the court."" What about us, ask other gay couples . Within the marbled halls of the high court, Kennedy is personally respected by his colleagues, both for the power he wields and for his courtly, low-key manner. But professionally, justices on the losing side of a big case can often be unsparing in their criticism of Kennedy and his legal reasoning. Justice Antonin Scalia on Wednesday called Kennedy's analysis in the DOMA case ""jaw dropping"" and an assertion of ""judicial supremacy"" that ""envisions the Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex of government."" And this from a close friend -- Scalia and Kennedy joined the court a year apart, were born the same year, and live on the same street. The Sacramento, California, native joined the high court in 1988, the third choice of President Reagan after more conservative nominees Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg flamed out. And along with O'Connor for almost two decades, the two native Westerners carved out a jumpy place in the center. Less driven by practical concerns than O'Connor was, Kennedy has striven for a loftier sense of the law's impact on society. ""He has brought to the bench a combination of a very scholarly, erudite, academic bent,"" said Brad Berenson, a friend and former law clerk to Kennedy, ""and a very practical bent he had developed while practicing law on his own."" Kennedy himself acknowledged the unique role he played for decades on the court. ""There is a loneliness"" to his job, he once told CNN. For now, Kennedy, like his eight colleagues, will retreat from the public spotlight. He has some vacation time ahead, mixed with his annual overseas teaching gig in Austria in two weeks. Then, come the first Monday October, Kennedy is expected back in his familiar seat, just to the left of Chief Justice John Roberts on the bench. But clearly he is the man in the middle, and the man that in many ways shapes the direction of a divided court.","Kennedy wrote majority opinion striking down parts of Defense of Marriage Act .

"The world is expected to get a look at the findings of U.N. weapons inspectors Monday as Security Council powers work to turn a U.S.-Russian framework on Syria's chemical weapons into a concrete plan. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon received the inspectors' report on the August poison gas attack outside Damascus on Sunday, the United Nations announced. Ban is scheduled to brief the Security Council on the report in a closed-door session Monday morning -- and two diplomats told CNN the report is likely to be released publicly at that time. The attack led to U.S. threats of military action in Syria, where a civil war has left more than 100,000 dead since 2011, and Syria's stated decision to hand its chemical weapons arsenal over to international control. Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov laid out a series of steps the Syrians must take to eliminate its stockpile. The plan now goes to the Security Council, where members are working to craft a resolution that will keep the process under review and allow the world body to consider the use of force if Syria fails to comply. That effort will start at U.N. headquarters in New York and in Paris, where French President Francois Hollande told the television network TF1 talks would start ""as soon as tomorrow"" among Kerry, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and British Foreign Secretary William Hague. ""Then Laurent Fabius will go to Russia to meet with his Russian counterpart to end this process, and we could vote on this resolution before the end of the week,"" Hollande said. But he added, ""This does not mean that we would be done with the case. The violence is still ongoing, the war in Syria is still ongoing, so the next step will be to find a political solution."" Under the plan, Damascus must submit a comprehensive list of its chemical arsenal within one week, and international inspectors must be on the ground no later than November. Senior U.S. State Department officials said that according to the timeline, initial inspections of declared chemical weapons sites must be completed by November; all production and mixing and filling equipment must be destroyed by November; and all chemical weapons material must be eliminated by mid-2014. Framework for eliminating chemical weapons . Russia is Syria's leading ally and has vetoed Security Council resolutions on the conflict in the past. China, the fifth of the veto-wielding Security Council members, said Sunday it welcomed the deal. ""We believe this framework agreement has cooled the tense situation in Syria and has opened a new opportunity to use a peaceful means to resolve the chemical weapons issue,""  Foreign Minister Wang Yi said after a meeting with Fabius in Beijing. The verification and destruction process will be carried out by personnel from both the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the body that implements the international ban on chemical weapons use, according to the framework agreement. A diplomatic source said the OPCW will assess the timeline Kerry and Lavrov laid out in Geneva to assist negotiations at the United Nations. Syria confirmed it had chemical weapons in 2012. U.S. intelligence estimates it possesses about 1,000 tons of ordnance -- mostly the nerve gases sarin and VX, which cause convulsions, paralysis, respiratory failure, and death, but also mustard gas, which inflicted horrific casualties on the battlefields of World War I. Syrian official hails 'victory' in Geneva . A Syrian official, National Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar, called the framework a ""victory"" and thanked Russia for orchestrating a chemical weapons deal to avert U.S. military action, Russia's state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. ""On the one hand, they will help Syrians come out of the crisis, and on the other hand, they prevented the war against Syria by having removed a pretext for those who wanted to unleash it,"" RIA Novosti quoted Haidar. He called the deal an achievement of Russian diplomacy, and ""a victory for Syria won thanks to our Russian friends."" U.S., Russia agree to framework . But in Israel, where he met Sunday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Kerry told reporters that ""the threat of force remains"" to make sure Syria follows through with the agreement. ""I want people to understand the key elements of what we agreed to in Geneva. It is a framework, not a final agreement,"" he said. ""It is a framework that must be put into effect by the United Nations now."" And Hollande told TF1 that ""the military option must remain."" ""One must take into account the threat of sanctions, if the agreement and the results of the Security Council U.N. resolution were not carried out,"" he said. ""Therefore, we must ensure that there is some kind of sanction if it is not applied."" A U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN that the technical timeline agreed to in Geneva would not be revisited this week in New York. The thornier question of whether a resolution should be under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter -- which potentially authorizes the use of force if Syria is in violation -- remains to be worked out. ""You cannot just copy and paste what's in Geneva into the resolution,"" the diplomat said. Also remaining to be discussed is whether any resolution would condemn al-Assad's government for the August 21 attack and whether it would call for those accused of ordering the strike to face trial before the International Criminal Court. Both the U.N. diplomat and a Western diplomat said a vote isn't likely before mid-week, perhaps Wednesday. The Western powers have blamed government troops for the poison gas attack, which Washington says may have killed more than 1,400 people. Syria's government denies using chemical weapons and has said rebel forces used poison gas on its forces. But in a report issued last week, Human Rights Watch said al-Assad's forces ""were almost certainly responsible,"" citing photos of and videos from the attack scene that pointed to weapons not known to be in rebel hands. Opposition group wants Syrian air power restricted . A leading Syrian opposition group said Sunday that a ban on chemical weapons isn't enough, and called for the Syrian regime to end the use of air power over populated areas. ""The Syrian National Coalition insists that the ban of use of chemical weapons, which led to the loss of lives of more than 1,400 Syrian civilians, must be extended to ban the use of the regime air power and ballistic weapons against population centers, in addition to the redeployment of heavy weapons away from population centers, and the prohibition of use of these weapons to bomb Syrian cities and villages,"" the group said in a statement. ""The world must not allow the Assad regime to take advantage of the Russian initiative and their joining the treaty on the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons as an excuse to continue the daily slaughter of the Syrian people with impunity,"" it added. The group expressed skepticism about the chemical weapons deal. ""The Assad regime has a long track record of deceit when it comes to dealing with the treaties and empty promises in the regime attempt to buy more time,"" the coalition statement said. It called on its supporters in the region and in the West to strengthen its military capabilities. ""The coalition calls upon the Arab brothers and Friends of Syria military to strengthen the arm capability of the military opposition to be able to neutralize the Assad air force and his tanks to force the regime to end its military campaign and accept a political solution that will lead to a democratic transition in Syria,"" it said. Last week, Gen. Salim Idriss, head of the rebel Free Syrian Army, said he has information that Syria has already started to move chemical materials and weapons out of the country, into Lebanon and Iraq. Iraq denied the allegation, calling it ""cheap propaganda."" ""We confirm that Iraq is against possessing such weapons and other weapons of mass destruction anywhere in the world and under any excuse,"" said a statement Sunday from the Iraqi prime minister's office.","U.N. inspectors deliver their report to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon .

"Killeen, Texas (CNN) -- The U.S. Army private who authorities say admitted to planning to bomb a restaurant popular with soldiers from Fort Hood is to be held without bond, a federal magistrate ordered Friday. Pfc. Naser Jason Abdo was formally charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges are likely, said Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in San Antonio, Texas. Abdo, who refused to stand when Judge Jeffrey C. Manske entered the courtroom, shouted an apparent reference to the 2006 rape of an Iraqi girl by U.S. soldiers and the 2009 shooting spree at Fort Hood by Army Maj. Nidal Hasan before being hustled out of the courtroom by marshals. Abdo, a Muslim American soldier who had been granted conscientious objector status before going AWOL, was being held Friday in federal custody at an undisclosed location. According to the criminal complaint unsealed after his appearance Friday, Abdo admitted he planned to turn two pressure cookers found in his Killeen hotel room into gunpowder- and shrapnel-filled bombs to detonate inside an unnamed restaurant popular with soldiers from Fort Hood. Among other things, police and FBI investigators who searched the room found six bottles of gunpowder, shotgun shells and pellets and ammunition cartridges. Police who arrested him found wire, a handgun, ammunition and an article titled, ""Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom"" in the backpack he was carrying, according to the complaint. The backpack also contained a notebook with a hand-written list for many of the components police recovered. The public defender appointed to represent Abdo, attorney Keith Dorsett of Waco, did not immediately respond to e-mails and telephone messages seeking comment. Killeen police arrested Abdo, 21, on Wednesday after a gun store employee tipped them that Abdo's behavior had raised red flags when he purchased six pounds of smokeless gunpowder and other supplies. The tip came from Greg Ebert, a retired police officer who works at the Guns Galore gun store. He said the young man appeared suspicious as soon as he pulled up in a taxi cab. ""How many people go shopping at gun stores in a taxi cab?"" Ebert asked. He described Abdo as being guarded and asking odd questions. Abdo browsed for about 20 minutes, Ebert said, choosing six pounds of gunpowder, shotgun ammunition and a magazine for a semiautomatic handgun. He asked Ebert what smokeless gunpowder was before finishing the purchase. ""Well, hello! Why are you buying this if you don't know what it's for?"" Ebert said later. ""That is a red flag for me. He should know. Why is he buying that much?"" Ebert said he called police after discussing the transaction at length with the owner of the store, which is the same place where Hasan bought supplies for his shooting spree. Abdo joined the infantry in 2009 and was assigned to Company E of the 101st Airborne Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team when he refused to deploy to Afghanistan on religious grounds. The Army approved his request to be discharged as a conscientious objector. But on May 13, he was charged with possession of child pornography on his computer, according to the statement. After a June 15 hearing, at which Abdo was recommended for court-martial, he went AWOL. In media interviews last year, Abdo talked about seeking conscientious objector status, saying he felt compelled to remain true to his faith. ""We have two things that I believe make us American, and that's freedom of religion and freedom of choice,"" he said. When he signed up for the military, Abdo said, he had not thought that his religious beliefs would be an issue. ""I was under the impression that I could serve both the U.S. Army and my God simultaneously,"" he said. But as his deployment neared, he began to rethink things and eventually worked up the courage to approach his unit and tell them how he felt, he said. ""Islam is a much more peaceful and tolerant religion than it is an aggressive religion,"" he said. ""I don't believe that Islam allows me to operate in any kind of warfare at all, including the U.S. military and any war it partakes in. I believe that our first duty as a Muslim is to serve God."" In court Friday, Abdo mentioned ""Iraq 2006,"" an apparent reference to an incident in which U.S. Army soldiers were accused of killing three members of an Iraqi family, including a 6-year-old girl, and raping the family's 14-year-old girl before also killing her and setting the bodies on fire in an attempt to cover up the killings. Four soldiers were convicted and imprisoned for their roles in the shootings, rape and subsequent cover-up. After Abdo's arrest, Texas Gov. Rick Perry issued a statement calling it ""a sobering reminder of the importance of remaining vigilant in the ongoing efforts to protect our communities from those that would do us harm."" Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, the House Army Caucus chairman, praised the gun-shop employee who tipped police to Abdo, as well as the police themselves, for interrupting what could have been a deadly plot. ""Thanks to quick action by a Texas gun dealer in alerting local police to a suspicious character, and a prompt and vigorous response by the Killeen Police Department, we may well have averted a repeat of the tragic 2009 radical Islamic terror attack on our nation's largest military installation,"" he said. ""We now have an example of what works to prevent these type attacks, and as the coming days reveal more details about this attempt, we can determine better ways to thwart similar efforts in the future,"" Carter said. In addition to being the site of the Fort Hood shootings, Killeen is also where, in 1991, George Hennard crashed his pickup into a Luby's cafeteria, fatally shot 23 people and wounded another 20 before killing himself. ""We've been through a lot in this community,"" Killeen Police Chief Dennis Baldwin said. ""But I can tell you that's when the character of the community is more obvious."" CNN's Tracy Sabo, Barbara Starr, Marylynn Ryan and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Naser Jason Abdo makes a reference to the 2006 rape and murder of an Iraqi girl .

"(CNN) -- A few months into the Iraq war, David Petraeus, then a three-star general and commander of the storied 101st Airborne Division, told CNN about what it would take to win. ""Frankly,"" he said, ""the way ahead will require a lot of determination and just plain old ingenuity and stick-to-itiveness."" It was January 2004 and the United States had lost 60 men and women. No one could have predicted accurately the course of the war then, but Petraeus stuck to his playbook, eventually becoming the top U.S. commander in Iraq, leading U.S. counterinsurgency operations and, in 2007, a strategy to overcome a bloody insurgency that was fronted by a surge in troops. Applauded for turning around what seemed a losing battle in Iraq -- he was dubbed King David for his successes -- Petraeus later went to Afghanistan, commanding U.S. and NATO forces there. He is arguably the most influential general of his generation. In fact, Esquire magazine called him one of the most influential people of the 21st century. But after a career that began after graduation in 1974 from West Point and as a second lieutenant in the infantry, Petraeus is hanging up the uniform for a civilian suit, leaving the Pentagon for halls of another hallowed Washintgon institution: the CIA. Petraeus relinquishes his Afghanistan post on Monday. In an official ceremony, he will hand over command to Marine Lt. Gen. John R. Allen. Petraeus plans to retire from the Army at the end of August and assume the CIA director's job September 6. Some were stunned that a decorated military career was ending prematurely. Petraeus is only 58. ""I wanted this job,"" Petraeus said at his Senate confirmation hearing. ""I am taking off the uniform I have worn for 37 years to do this the right way."" With that, the U.S. Army is losing the architect of modern-day counterinsurgency operations. Petraeus wrote his doctoral dissertation on the lessons America learned in Vietnam. Later, he devised the Army/Marine field manual, challenging the military to think differently in how it relates to the civilian population in dealing with an insurgency. This week, ahead of his departure, Petraeus assessed the results of his strategy in Afghanistan. ""What we have done is implement the so-called NATO comprehensive approach, a civil-military campaign ... that does indeed embody many of the principles of the counterinsurgency field manual that we developed back in 2006, and which we employed in Iraq in the surge of 2007-2008,"" he said in an interview with NATO-TV. ""I think generally, it has borne fruit."" He said it has been a difficult journey, rife with setbacks, but coalition forces have halted the momentum of the Taliban in much of the country and reversed the insurgent hold in restive Helmand province. Petraeus's experience in working with the CIA on counterinsurgency efforts in the field was cited as a reason for his nomination as the spy agency's director. Petraeus told NATO-TV that he never thought his military career would end in Afghanistan. The top commander's job came unexpectedly after a Rolling Stone magazine article prompted the resignation of Gen. Stanley McChrystal. Obama asked Petraeus to leave the top post at U.S. Central Command. He took command in Afghanistan on July 4, 2010. ""We've jokingly said that I went to the White House for the monthly National Security Council meeting on Afghanistan and Pakistan with President Obama, and came out with a new job,"" Petraeus said. ""And that's not far from the truth.""","David Petraeus has been called the most influential general of his time .

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Rebel forces in the Nafusa Mountains of western Libya were under heavy attack Tuesday by forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi and had issued a call for help, the National Transitional Council said. ""Representatives have confirmed that Gadhafi forces are using GRAD missiles, snipers, and a previously unseen type of mortar,"" it said, adding that three locals were killed and another nine wounded on Tuesday. The Tunisian border is a portal for the delivery of humanitarian aid, which can no longer reach civilians in the area, it said. Pro-Gadhafi forces were also attacking the northwest Libyan city of Yafren, focusing on the hospital there, the statement said. Tunisia's state-run news agency corroborated the attacks, but cited different casualty figures. It said at least two people were wounded, two of them seriously, in shelling that began Monday night and continued until Tuesday afternoon in the Nafusa Mountains, the state-run Tunisian news agency said. But the focus of shelling, the Wazin crossing point, remained under rebel control, said Tunis Afrique Presse. Some of the shells fired by Libyan government forces fell inside Tunisia, TAP said, citing a security source. Libyan state television reported late Tuesday that government forces had exchanged fire with NATO vessels that were shelling west of Misrata, striking one of them directly. But the claim was flatly denied by NATO. ""No NATO vessels in that area have been engaged today,"" said a mission spokesman for the organization who, citing security reasons, declined to identify himself. Meanwhile, fighting continued in Misrata, where seven people died and 32 were wounded Tuesday, said Khaled Abu Falgha, a physician at Al Hikma Hospital in the city. Most of the casualties were among the rebels and occurred on Misrata's eastern edge, near the Tawergha area. Fighting there has been going on for three days, since rebels took control of the nearby airport and civil defense base, he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said fighting in Misrata and other cities was keeping medical aid from reaching civilians and causing casualties among health personnel. The continued attacks came as TAP reported that two former high-level Libyan government officials had crossed the border into Tunisia in the past few days. Abdallah Mahmoud al-Hijazi, the former adviser to the Foreign Affairs General Secretariat and deputy-director of Libyan military intelligence, entered Tunisia on Tuesday through the Ras Jedir border crossing, said TAP. He headed for the Tunisian tourist island of Djerba accompanied by four former civil servants, it said. The news agency also reported that the Libyan oil minister, Choukri Ghanem, had gone through the same crossing Saturday. Their intentions were not immediately clear. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim denied Monday that Ghanem had defected, and said he was still on the job. Early Tuesday, in the capital city of Tripoli, crowds gathered outside two burning buildings, the aftermath of what a Libyan official said were NATO airstrikes on government facilities. Ibrahim said the buildings housed the Ministry of Popular Inspection and Oversight, a government anti-corruption body, and the head of the police force in Tripoli. There were no reports of casualties. Some people ventured outside to inspect the damage. Others, including a group of young men carrying a portrait of Moammar Gadhafi and waving the country's green flag, marched in front of the buildings chanting slogans of support for the Libyan leader. Documents were strewn over the grounds of the ministry building. Ibrahim told reporters that in the last few days, the ministry had put together corruption files against leaders in the Libyan opposition's Transitional National Council. He said the files ""fortunately survived."" The area teemed with security forces, and men in civilian clothing carrying AK-47s. Some shot into the air in a show of anger. ""Is this their (NATO's) protection of civilians or terrifying civilians?"" one of the men asked CNN. ""This is a civilian neighborhood. ... Residents are terrified."" NATO on Tuesday said that, during the previous 24 hours, planes had hit a command-and-control center and a military training facility in Tripoli and struck radar systems in the vicinity of Tripoli. The damage in the capital is one of the latest developments in Libya's see-saw war, which has raged for months with no end in sight. NATO is operating under a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force and any means -- except occupation -- to protect civilians. Allied forces have conducted airstrikes on Gadhafi's resources for almost two months. The Libyan Red Crescent reported that three of its ambulances had been hit in separate incidents in recent days, resulting in the death of a nurse and wounds to a patient and three volunteers. It has also received allegations concerning the misuse of the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems to support military operations and the use of ambulances to transport arms and fighters. ""All parties to the conflict must refrain from harming injured people, medical personnel, medical vehicles and medical facilities,"" said Georgios Georgantas, the ICRC's deputy head of operations for North and West Africa. ""Medical personnel and ambulances must be allowed to reach the wounded. We reiterate our call to the authorities and to all weapons bearers to respect medical services and the emblems of the Red Crescent and Red Cross."" Libyan opposition members are demanding freedom and an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has sought the arrest of Gadhafi and two relatives, linking them Monday to ""widespread and systematic"" attacks on civilians. Luis Moreno-Ocampo told reporters his office has ""direct evidence"" linking Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and his brother-in-law Abdullah al-Sanussi to crimes against humanity. Ibrahim, the government spokesman, denied accusations against the regime. Judges on the international court must now decide whether to issue the arrest warrants Moreno-Ocampo wants. Security forces in Libya are accused of using sexual enhancement drugs as a ""machete"" and gang-raping women they stop at checkpoints, Moreno-Ocampo said. Meanwhile, the government spokesman said four Western journalists detained by Libyan authorities were to appear Tuesday in court. Ibrahim said Monday night he expected the American and Spanish journalists to be fined and released. He said he could not confirm the names of the journalists because he did not have the list. Ibrahim said the journalists were detained for entering the country illegally from the east. Libyan authorities have threatened to detain journalists passing through the rebel-controlled eastern part of the country. Many people have been working out ways to flee Libya. The U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday that hundreds of people who had fled Libya for Tunisia and Egypt ""have crossed back into Libya with the intention of boarding boats to reach Europe."" Members of the Somali, Ethiopian and Eritrean communities in camps at Shousha near Tunisia's border with Libya are among them. About 14,000 people have been taken by boat from Libya to Italy and Malta, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency said most have made the journey in boats ""overladen with passengers and in a very poor state of repair."" Frequently, there's ""no qualified skipper or crew to operate the boat."" ""UNHCR has met with refugees in Tripoli who are planning to make this treacherous journey,"" the agency said. ""UNHCR repeats its call to all vessels on the Mediterranean to consider all boats departing Libya to be in need of assistance, and likely to face a situation of distress at some point in the journey.""

"(CNN) -- Perhaps more important than the newest mystery surrounding CIA contractor Raymond Davis -- who paid the purported seven-figure sum to the Pakistani victims' families who blessed his release from jail? -- will be the political reaction within Pakistan, where the populace is already outraged over Davis' fatal shooting of two men there, analysts said Wednesday. The other potential impact of the ""Raymond Davis Affair,"" as one analyst dubbed it, is whether it will damage diplomatic relations between the United States and Pakistan, in which Americans depend on Pakistan in fighting terror and the Pakistanis enjoy substantial U.S. aid. ""There is the curious question of who made the payment. I suppose it's going to remain a mystery for a while,"" said Mark Quarterman, director of the Program on Crisis, Conflict, and Cooperation of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""His presence there and the story about his presence were kind of a mystery from the start,"" Quarterman added. ""Now his presence in Pakistan ends with one more curiosity. I think the fallout from this is far from over. It will be interesting to see what the reaction is in Pakistan. It's been the lead story"" in media there, he added. Davis was released under a Sharia practice called diyat, or compensation, which is enshrined in Pakistan's penal code and allows victims' families to pardon a murderer with or without being paid ""blood money,"" said the former chief justice of Pakistan's Supreme Court, Saeed U Zaman Saddiqi. Although the origins of the payments in the Davis case are a significant political matter, the more imminent concern is whether average Pakistanis will accept how ""blood money"" was paid to the victims' families, analysts said. ""What we're watching for,"" analyst Scott Stewart of the online global intelligence firm Stratfor said in a statement, ""is to see which way public sentiment rules: whether it will accept this resolution as acceptable or whether they will be outraged and take to the streets."" On Wednesday, it wasn't known who paid the compensation to the families, and there were conflicting accounts over how much. A lawyer closely connected to the case said the payment was $1.4 million, but Punjab province law minister Rana Sanaullah said that $2.34 million was paid to the legal heirs by the U.S. government. A U.S. official not authorized to speak for attribution insisted that the release of Davis was a decision made by the Pakistanis and that there was ""no quid pro quo"" between Washington and Islamabad. It was Pakistani officials who worked with the family in making the arrangements for what is referred to as ""blood money,"" the official said. The United States ""did not sit across from the families"" to work out an arrangement, but the official acknowledged that there were ""interagency discussions and a policy decision"" for the United States to agree to the arrangement, the official said. The official said ""cooperation continues"" between the United States and Pakistan despite the recent controversy. ""Flareups happen periodically,"" the official said, pointing to the Davis incident and the public disclosure of the name of the CIA's chief of station in Islamabad. The U.S. relationship with Pakistan ""has evolved over the years"" and ""increasingly has the ability to withstand these kinds of disagreements,"" said the official. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who said ""we are very grateful"" for the families' decision, which enabled Davis to leave Pakistan, stressed that the U.S. government didn't pay any compensation to the families, and she wouldn't say whether the Pakistanis or a third party did. ""We also have a Department of Justice investigation that has begun into what happened in Lahore. And we've communicated our strong support for the relationship between Pakistan and the United States, which we consider to be of strategic importance,"" Clinton said during a press conference Wednesday. Analyst Robert Grenier, the former CIA station chief in Islamabad, said the Sharia practice allowed both countries to save face in a difficult controversy. ""It had become such a huge domestic political issue in Pakistan, and both sides had a very strong interest in finding some way out of the corner that they had been painted into,"" Grenier said. In recent years, the U.S. government has compensated families accidentally injured during counterinsurgency warfare, said Grenier, who's now chairman of ERG Partners, a financial advisory firm in Westport, Connecticut. ""Let's not forget that the U.S. government has frequently paid blood money to people who have fallen victim to collateral damage in Afghanistan and Iraq. So albeit that the details of this case are quite extraordinary and quite different from the usual ones in Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of paying blood money under Sharia is not new,"" Grenier said. In Highland Park, Colorado, where Davis lives, his wife, Rebecca, defended him in an interview with reporters outside her their home. ""I knew it was self-defense. He's not a Rambo as the L.A. Times said,"" Davis' wife said. ""He's not an agent. He's not Jason Bourne. He's not any of these kind of crazy things that have been portrayed of him."" After being released from jail where he had been held since January, Davis was taken to Kabul, Afghanistan, on Wednesday, where he was resting and receiving a medical exam, said the U.S. official who asked not to be identified. Sanaullah, the Punjab province law minister, first told Pakistani media Wednesday that the victims' families did not want to press charges and added that Davis would be free to go. The statement came just hours after the American was charged with murder in connection with January shootings that left two Pakistani men dead. Sanaullah later said that $1,169,500 was paid to 11 legal heirs of one victim and the same amount was paid to eight legal heirs of the others. The court asked the legal heirs whether there was any pressure on them to make this agreement, and they told the court that they forgave Davis on their own free will, Sanaullah said. Davis claimed self-defense in the shootings and asserted the two men attacked him as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, but Lahore Police Chief Aslam Tareen said ""it was clear-cut murder."" Many Pakistanis wanted Davis to be tried, and hard-line Pakistani clerics demanded that their government not release Davis to the U.S. government. On Wednesday, Davis appeared in the Lahore court after the payment was made and was acquitted of the charges, in accordance with diyat, said the lawyer closely connected to the case. The court released Davis from two cases, the double murder and the carrying of an illegal gun. In the gun charge, the court fined Davis $250 and credited him with time served in jail, Sanaullah said. The amount of diyat was not paid in front of the court to the legal heirs because the court needs only affidavits from the legal heirs saying that they have pardoned the accused, Sanaullah said. Carmela Conroy, the U.S. consul general in Lahore, escorted Davis after his release, Sanaullah said. The United States had been seeking the release of Davis from a Lahore jail on the grounds that he has diplomatic immunity. U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat and later revealed that he is a CIA contractor, intensifying the already highly charged situation.

"(CNN) -- Deadly fighting between Yemeni government forces and al Qaeda erupted in a restive southern province on Saturday. Demonstrators took to the streets and demanded the creation of an interim body that would guide and shape the country's political transition. Twenty-one al Qaeda members and 10 Yemeni soldiers have been killed in Yemen's Abyan province, where fighting has raged Saturday, Yemen's state-run news agency reported. Clashes between security forces and suspected militants have erupted in Lawdar and Zinjibar, towns in Abyan -- a militant stronghold with a presence of Yemen's al Qaeda wing, SABA reported, citing a military official. Eighteen al Qaeda members and nine soldiers were killed in Zinjibar and three militants and one soldier were killed in Lowdar, the report said. Dozens of people were injured. ""The heroes of the armed and security forces in Abyan province caused the terrorist elements of al Qaeda heavy losses in lives and material after fierce confrontations with those elements that began in the early hours of the morning and lasted several hours and ended with the killing of a number of them and injuring many others,"" SABA reported. A Yemeni security official, who has asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that Yemen's government conducted air raids on positions in Lawdar believed to be held by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Government forces have been fighting Islamic militants who seized the town of Zinjibar. Heavy gunfire and explosions were heard through the city, and planes were seen flying overhead and conducting airstrikes, witnesses and residents said. The military official cited by SABA said Yemeni military forces targeted a warehouse used by militants to store weapons and cars used by the fighters. The official said troops are working to track down al Qaeda fighters and ""cleanse the pockets and hiding places where terrorists are present."" Yemen has been consumed with unrest for months as protesters demand an end to the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A six-nation Gulf Arab alliance, the Gulf Cooperation Council, has tried to broker a government-opposition agreement that would lead to Saleh's departure, but that effort has so far been unsuccessful. The demonstrations continued on Saturday as thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets in Sanaa, Taiz, Ibb and Hodeidah, eyewitnesses said. Witnesses said the demonstrators on Saturday called for the vice president to create an interim transitional council to help fashion a political transition. They accused the United States and the GCC of supporting the Saleh regime, and demanded support of the youth revolution. Anti-government forces also criticized opposition political parties and politicians for supporting the GCC deal, which would lead to Saleh's departure but give him immunity. Khaled Al-Anesi, a prominent rights activist in Sanaa, said the United States and the international community should support the Yemen revolution ""as it did in Tunisia and Egypt if it wants Yemen to continue to be its ally in the future."" The chaos there intensified when Saleh and other senior officials were injured in a June 3 attack on the mosque at the presidential palace. Saleh and other senior officials injured in the attack went to Saudi Arabia for treatment. A government spokesman said Thursday Saleh was in good health and would be returning to Yemen ""within days.""

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- A reporter for Newsweek magazine who was arrested in Tehran has confessed to doing the bidding of Western governments, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported Wednesday. Newsweek says Maziar Bahari has been reporting for years without bias and beyond reproach. Maziar Bahari, 42, made his alleged confession at a news conference Tuesday. Because international journalists have been limited in their ability to gather news in Iran, CNN has not been able to confirm the agency report. Fars reported that the Canadian-Iranian reporter who had worked for the BBC and England's Channel 4 network admitted having filed false reports for Newsweek during the elections -- a charge the magazine rejected. ""He has been reporting for years without any possible hint of bias and beyond reproach,"" Newsweek Paris Bureau Chief Chris Dickey told CNN. ""We think he's one of the best reporters in the business."" He called the report ""preposterous."" Dickey said Bahari had not been allowed to speak with a lawyer or with his family since his arrest on June 21. ""The Western media are part of the capitalist machinery and liberal democratic governments of the West,"" Bahari reportedly said. ""When a Western reporter comes to Iran, like a politician or specialist, he will be made to fit into the Western complex. For that person, the interests of the Westerners, who take advantage of every occasion to stand against Iran, are of utmost importance."" The Fars News Agency account adds that most Western news outlets oppose Iran, but that the Ministry of Information scrutinizes reporters' work, minimizing any harm they might do. Bahari reportedly said Iranian reporters can be tempted by offers of money from Western news organizations to report for them. ""Unfortunately, sometimes we fall prey to mistakes, wrong feelings and we become greedy, thus falling into the traps of the foreigners,"" he said, according to the news agency transcript. In their alleged attempt to foment revolution in Iran, journalists' efforts began two months before the election, according to the account attributed to Bahari: . ""The first step was to propagate the thought of questioning religious authority and maintain that the Islamic Republic of Iran has no popular support and then they said that, under the shadow of such a system, the voting process would be rigged and much hard work went into making this thought a reality in peoples' minds."" Hassiba Hadj-Sahraoui of Amnesty International rejected Bahari's alleged confession, calling it part of the Islamic Republic's effort to intimidate the opposition and blame Western powers for the post-election chaos. ""We know from people we've talked to that people have been forced to make confessions on TV where they are supposed to have acted on instigation of foreign powers,"" she said. Indeed, Iran's state-run Press TV has broadcast interviews with people who said they were guilt-ridden protesters who wanted to unburden themselves by confessing that the Western media had made them act as they did. Bahari is not the only reporter said to have confessed, according to Reporters Without Borders, which last week condemned ""a parade of Iranian demonstrators being shown on state-run TV confessing to having protested at the behest of foreign media."" The reporters all used the same words: ""I admit that I demonstrated under the influence of the BBC, the radio Voice of America and other foreign media,"" according to the advocacy group.  Watch about the dangers of reporting in Iran » . In a posting on his Web site, former President Mahmoud Khatami accused the government of having restricted communications in the country. ""The state-owned media outlet shows the same scenes over and over again, in order to provoke people's feelings,"" he said. ""Where was this media outlet when tens of people were killed and hundreds of people beaten?"" He added, ""The majority of those arrested are the political activists, journalists and attorneys, who now, unbelievably are pressured, as foreign agents, to falsely confess in television spectacles."" Reporters Without Borders said that 28 journalists -- including about 20 who work for a newspaper owned by opposition presidential candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi -- have been arrested since the election. ""Arresting an entire editorial staff is totally unprecedented,"" Reporters Without Borders said. Questioned about the arrest of foreign journalists during demonstrations, the intelligence minister, Mohseni Ejehi, said that ""one or two people who came to gather secret information were arrested, but not as journalists. One of them had his equipment confiscated and he is now the subject of an investigation."" Reporters are not the only people at risk. Amnesty International said as many as 1,000 people have disappeared since the June 12 election. With his purported confession, Bahari is no longer among them. ""We're very happy that they've acknowledged responsibility for holding him,"" Newsweek's Dickey said. ""And we hope very much that they will understand that it is in everybody's interest to release him as soon as possible.""","Maziar Bahari, 42, makes his alleged confession at a news conference Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Hours after a North Carolina police chief issued a tearful plea for help in locating a registered sex offender suspected in the death of his 23-year-old daughter, the man was arrested in upstate New York, authorities said Monday. Michael Neal Harvey, 34, was arrested without incident by FBI agents and U.S. marshals in Niagara Falls, New York, on Monday morning in connection with the death of Valerie Hamilton, according to a statement issued by Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina, police. Detectives from Charlotte were on the way to New York to interview Harvey and ""work on the extradition process,"" the statement said. Harvey was located inside a house in Niagara Falls, said Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe. The town was one of the places authorities thought he might flee, because he has relatives there, Monroe said. Warrants for Harvey were issued on murder and auto theft charges, police said. A stolen 1996 Chevy Blazer that police had said Harvey was last seen driving also was recovered in Niagara Falls, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said. Authorities earlier had issued a description of the vehicle. Earlier Monday, Hamilton's father, Merl Hamilton, the chief of police of Concord, North Carolina, about 30 miles northeast of Charlotte, issued a tearful plea on ""Good Morning America"" for help locating the suspect. ""I just want to get this guy now,"" he said. Valerie Hamilton, who lived in Charlotte, was last seen between 12:30 and 1:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Thomas Street Tavern in Charlotte with a man believed to be Harvey. Her friends and family became concerned when she failed to show up at the Little Otter Swim School, where she worked as a children's swim coach, according to CNN affiliate WSOC. ""It's not like her not to show up and let us know,"" her boss, John Kirk, told the station. He described Valerie Hamilton as ""one of those bright, shining people that a kid can't cry around."" After several days of searching, Valerie Hamilton's body was found in a Charlotte storage unit late Saturday. Monroe said repeated witness interviews and ""very aggressive investigation"" led authorities to the storage unit. He said the cause and manner of death was not immediately known, but an autopsy was being conducted Monday. When the body was found, it was wrapped, he said, and authorities avoided disturbing it as much as possible, he said. The cause and manner of Valerie Hamilton's death, when determined, could result in additional charges being filed or the modification of existing charges, he said. Investigators are focusing on several areas, including a hotel where media reports said Harvey was thought to have stayed and the storage unit where the body was found. Authorities are not sure whether Valerie Hamilton was abducted or left the tavern willingly with Harvey, Monroe said. ""Just trying to rehash Miss Hamilton's steps ... led us to Mr. Harvey,"" he said. Authorities believe Valerie Hamilton was killed shortly after she was last seen, and her body had been in the storage unit for a couple of days, Monroe said. When a reporter from CNN affiliate WVIB in Buffalo, New York, approached Harvey's relatives over the weekend, they refused to go on camera. ""He hasn't been here in six years,"" an unidentified man told the station. ""Leave. That's my comment."" Monroe said authorities had not found a connection between Harvey's relatives and the house where he was located. ""I want to ask my law enforcement brothers and sisters across the country to help me with this,"" Merl Hamilton said Monday on ABC. ""I'm trying to stay strong, and they know what it means because the cameras are on -- but he took my daughter, guys. And play it right, play by the rules, but y'all get out there and find this guy for me, and when it comes my way, I'll pay you back."" Harvey is a registered sex offender with a 1996 first-degree sex offense conviction out of New York, according to the state sex offender registry website. WIVB and the Charlotte Observer newspaper reported he had served time in prison. He also has a lengthy police record in North Carolina, including drug and weapons charges, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police spokeswoman Officer Rosalyn Harrington said. Monroe said police had gotten word that Harvey knew he was wanted. ""I don't think it came as any real surprise to him that authorities were able to locate him,"" he said. Neighbors of Harvey's family described their Niagara Falls neighborhood as a quiet one, where families remain for a number of years, WIVB said. Concord is ""a very close-knit community,"" Mayor Scott Padgett said on ""Good Morning America."" He said there had been a ""tremendous outpouring"" of support for the chief and his family. Hamilton told ABC young women should remember the safety lessons they have been taught. ""It carries into when you're in your 20s,"" he said. ""... Make sure these men treat you with respect, and be safe."" Asked to describe his daughter, the chief said, ""She was a good kid. She was a wonderful kid. She lived her life to take care of children. That's all she wanted to do. She was the perfect daughter, and I miss her, and I need justice for her and I need folks to be looking for this guy.""

"Detained American Alan Gross told his wife and daughter something they weren't expecting during a recent visit in Cuba: Goodbye. ""Our daughter, Nina, was unprepared to see how gaunt and physically frail her father has become. And his decision to say goodbye to us was wrenching,"" Judy Gross said in a statement released Monday. The former U.S. Agency for International Development subcontractor, who's been imprisoned for nearly five years, is refusing to see visitors from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, the statement said. ""Alan has withdrawn, and he told me that his life in prison is not a life worth living,"" said Scott Gilbert, Gross's attorney. Gross, 65, is serving a 15-year sentence for bringing satellite communications equipment to Cuba as part of his work as a subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development. He was convicted in March 2011. U.S. officials said Gross was merely trying to help Cubans bypass the island's stringent restrictions on Internet access. But Cuban authorities say Gross was part of a plot to create ""a Cuban spring"" and destabilize the island's single-party communist government. A letter to U.S. President Barack Obama from 300 rabbis across the United States Monday called for the U.S. government to negotiate his release, describing the situation as ""increasingly urgent."" ""Alan went to Cuba on behalf of our government. His immediate release from prison in Cuba and return to the U.S. must be a priority for our nation,"" the letter says. ""Indeed, we believe this is a moral imperative."" Asked Monday about reports that Gross had refused to meet with the new head of the U.S. mission in Havana, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she couldn't provide details due to privacy restrictions. ""Absent written authorization, there's really not more information I can share about those specific reports,"" she said. U.S. officials have repeatedly pushed for Gross's freedom, she told reporters. ""We keep his case at the forefront of discussions with the Cuban government, make clear the importance the United States places on his welfare, and we engage also with a range of our foreign counterparts at the highest levels and urge them to advocate for his release,"" she said. ""So we urgently reiterate our call for the Cuban government to release him immediately."" Last month Judy Gross told CNN that her husband had reached his breaking point. In April, Gross went on a hunger strike to protest the lack of progress between the United States and Cuba over his case. Gross finally heeded his mother Evelyn's request to end the protest. Last month, Evelyn Gross died from cancer. Cuban officials denied his request to attend her funeral.

"(CNN)  -- A militant Islamist group associated with al Qaeda has for the first time threatened to attack Israel, far from its normal base of operations in Somalia. Al-Shabab, which is fighting to control the east African country, accused Israel of ""starting to destroy"" the Al Aqsa mosque, where standoffs have taken place recently between Israeli police and Palestinians. The mosque is part of the complex that Jews call the Temple Mount and Muslims call Haram al-Sharif. ""The Jews started to destroy parts of the holy mosque of Al Aqsa and they routinely kill our Palestinian brothers, so we are committed to defend our Palestinian brothers,"" said Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur, a prominent Al-Shabab commander. His threat was part of a series of fiery sermons delivered after Friday prayers in Baidoa in southwest Somalia. Al-Shabab controls the region, which is part of a country that has been without an effective national government for nearly 20 years. Other leaders of the group also threatened Israel, the first time the group is known to have done so. ""We will transfer and expand our fighting in the Middle East so we can defend Al Aqsa mosque from the Israelis,"" Al-Shabab commander Abdifatah Aweys Abu Hamza said in Mogadishu, the Somali capital. He is apparently the leader of a new Al-Shabab armed group calling themselves ""Mujahedin Al Aqsa,"" or ""Al Aqsa Holy Warriors,"" which they said is assigned to attack Israel. It is not clear whether Al-Shabab has the capacity to carry out its threats against Israel. But Rashid Abdi of the International Crisis Group, speaking last week before al-Shabab issued its threats against Israel, warned that the group should be taken seriously. ""We should not underestimate the capacity of Al-Shabab,"" he said. ""This is a deadly organization, a formidable foe."" Abdi said the group had been mutating from a nationalist group into a terrorist organization more like al Qaeda, which was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. ""If you look at the rhetoric and language and if you look at the Web sites, if you hear their preachers or their scholars speak, it is completely indistinguishable from al Qaeda leaders,"" Abdi said. The group has also become more vicious in Somalia, a local human rights expert said. ""The most gruesome and gross violations of human rights are committed by Al-Shabab,"" activist Hassan Shire Sheikh said. ""They have also instilled fear. They just shoot, they kill, they maim and they lash."" The group also threatened African neighbors on Friday, including Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Eritrea, Ghana, Sudan and Uganda. They have in the past threatened African nations that provide peacekeeping troops to the war-torn country. The U.S. State Department Country Reports on Terrorism from April lists Al-Shabab as a terrorist organization and blames it for shootings and suicide bombings inside Somalia. It does not list the group as having carried out violence outside Somalia, but says some members of the group have trained and fought alongside al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Mohamed Siad Barre and sparked brutal clan infighting. The transitional government has struggled to establish authority, challenged by Islamist groups like Al-Shabab that have seized control of Mogadishu and much of the south. CNN's David McKenzie in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this report.","Al-Shabab accuses Israel of ""starting to destroy"" the Al Aqsa mosque .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Senate health care bill is not worthy of the historic vote that the House took a month ago. Even though the House version is far from perfect, it at least represents a step toward our goal of giving 36 million Americans decent health coverage. But under the Senate plan, millions of Americans will be forced into private insurance company plans, which will be subsidized by taxpayers. That alternative will do almost nothing to reform health care but will be a windfall for insurance companies. Is it any surprise that stock prices for some of those insurers are up recently? I do not want to subsidize the private insurance market; the whole point of creating a government option is to bring prices down. Insisting on a government mandate to have insurance without a better alternative to the status quo is not true reform. By eliminating the public option, the government program that could spark competition within the health insurance industry, the Senate has ended up with a bill that isn't worthy of its support. The public option is the part of our reform effort that will lower costs, improve the delivery of health care services and force insurance companies to offer rates and services that are reasonable. Although the art of legislating involves compromise, I believe the Senate went off the rails when it agreed with the Obama Administration to water down the reform bill and no longer include the public option. But that's not the only thing wrong with the Senate's version of the health care bill. Under that plan, insurance companies can punish older people, charging them much higher rates than the House bill would allow. In the House, we fought hard to repeal McCarran-Ferguson, the antitrust exemption that insurance companies have enjoyed for years. We did that because we believed firmly that those Fortune 500 corporations should not enjoy special treatment. Yet the Senate bill does not include that provision -- despite assurances from some members that they will seek to add it. By ending that protection, we will be able to go after insurance companies with federal penalties for misleading advertising or dishonest business practices. The House bill would cover 96 percent of legal residents, while the Senate covers 94 percent. Compared with the House bill, the Senate's bill makes it much easier for employers to avoid the responsibility of providing insurance for their workers. And of course, the Senate bill did not remove the onerous choice language intended to appeal to anti-abortion forces. Now don't get me wrong; the current House and Senate bills are a significant improvement over the status quo. Given the hard path to reform and the political realities of next year, there is a sizable group within Congress that wants to simply cut any deal that works and call it a success. Many previous efforts have failed, and the path to reform is littered with unsuccessful efforts championed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Bill Clinton. Supporters of the weak Senate bill say ""just pass it -- any bill is better than no bill."" I strongly disagree -- a conference report is unlikely to sufficiently bridge the gap between these two very different bills. It's time that we draw the line on this weak bill and ask the Senate to go back to the drawing board. The American people deserve at least that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Louise Slaughter.","Senate bill isn't worthy of being called health reform, says Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-New York)

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel traveled to Afghanistan this weekend, his fourth and last trip to the country as he makes way for his likely  replacement, Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter. CNN traveled with Hagel to tactical base Gamberi in Eastern Afghanistan, where the outgoing defense secretary met with troops. Hagel is the first enlisted combat veteran to serve as defense secretary. Asked by CNN whether it will be a loss for the Pentagon to have a defense secretary without combat experience, Hagel said he will not judge. ""That's not for me to decide,"" Hagel said.  ""Everybody brings to their positions their own set of experiences and their own strengths."" Hagel: More U.S. troops than planned will remain in Afghanistan next year . At the end of December, U.S. forces will end their combat role in Afghanistan and instead focus on counterterrorism missions and training, advising and assisting Afghan troops. The U.S. made a similar investment in Iraq, training Iraqi security forces that later collapsed as the terror group ISIS advanced in the country. Hagel does not see Afghanistan's security force buckling like in Iraq, citing Afghanistan's willingness to sign an agreement allowing a residual American troop presence in the country. ""They want us here. They want us to help them assist, advise, train,"" Hagel said. ""How we left Iraq was totally different. The Iraqi government did not want us there. The Iraqi people did not want us there."" Nearly 11,000 U.S. troops will remain in Afghanistan in the beginning of 2015. American forces will drop to 5,500 in 2016 and by 2017 the coalition will consolidate to Kabul. Still, while the U.S. draws down in Afghanistan the danger for forces remaining in the country does not. US troops will engage in combat if threatened and will provide air support for Afghan units if needed. ""Bottom line is we've got to realize this is still a war zone, this is still a war,"" Hagel said. Hagel's visit comes as the capital city has seen a recent spike in violence.  But Taliban attacks are down in 2014 when compared to the previous year. Hagel said he has confidence in the Afghan security forces ability to protect Afghanistan from terror by the hands of al Qaeda and the Taliban. ""[There are] still challenges ahead, but I think every sign is that they can do this,"" Hagel said.","Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel made his fourth and final trip to Afghanistan this weekend .

"(CNN)  -- Bayer Leverkusen reclaimed top spot in the Bundesliga from Bayern Munich with a 2-2 draw at Werder Bremen to extend their unbeaten run to a record equaling 23 games. Eren Derdiyok gave Leverkusen the lead in the 29th minute, but Claudio Pizarro equalized for the home side five minutes later. Toni Kroos put Leverkusen ahead again in the 57th minute only for Per Mertesacker to salvage a draw for Bremen in injury time. The late goal meant Bayer failed to take full advantage of Bayern Munich's 1-1 draw at Nuremberg on Saturday, but they go ahead of the Bavarian giants on goal difference. Bayer's coach Jupp Heynckes was a member of the Bayern Munich team in the 1988 - 89 season which also went 23 games unbeaten in the Bundesliga. Prolific Swiss star Derdiyok put the visitors ahead with a superb free kick which eluded Tim Wiese in the Bremen goal. But German international goalkeeper Rene Adler blundered to enable Werder to level as he allowed a free kick to slip through his hands and Peruvian star Pizarro accepted the invitation to score from close range. A fine strike from outside the area gave Kroos his ninth of the season and the league leaders might have added to their tally before in stoppage time  Mertesacker headed the equalizer from a Marko Marin cross. In other matches on Sunday, coach Felix Magath's return to reigning champions Wolfsburg saw new side Schalke slip to a 2-1 defeat to lose ground in the title race. The third-placers took the lead through Kevin Kuranyi on the half-hour mark, but in the 71st minute Grafite headed the equalizer for Wolfsburg. And it was Grafite who scored the winner six minutes from time. In a relegation battle, bottom club Hertha Berlin beat fellow strugglers Freiburg 3-0 with Brazilian Cicero scoring twice.","Bayer Leverkusen go top again in Bundesliga after 2-2 away draw at Werder Bremen .

"New DELHI, India (CNN) -- Indian border guards fired four rockets into Pakistan on Saturday in what they said was retaliation to a similar fire from the other side. Pakistan denied that claim. Two unexploded rockets were traced after midnight near an Indian outpost along the border dividing the Punjab region between the two countries, said K. Srinivasan, a deputy inspector-general of India's Border Security Force. ""We have standing instructions to retaliate and retaliate heavily,"" he said, adding that Indian borders guards also fired about 50 gunshots. The firing has stopped as of now, he said. But a spokesman for the Pakistan Rangers said India's allegations were false. Nadeem Raza said that an explosion was heard at about 11:30 p.m., after which Indians fired mortars into Pakistani territory. Saturday's skirmish came a day after a long gunfight ended between Indian security forces and militants in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir state. The border between India and Pakistan is disputed in the Kashmir region, where India accuses Pakistan of fueling an insurgency. The two nations have fought three wars over the territory since their independence in 1947 and routinely exchanged fire along the border, known as the Line of Control, until a 2003 ceasefire agreement. But tensions between the two South Asian rivals, both nuclear powers, escalated after the deadly siege on Mumbai in November, 2008. More than 160 people were killed in the Mumbai assault, which derailed the peace process. The Indian government hinted Friday that Pakistan was behind this week's attack in Srinagar. ""The two militants who were killed were in communication with their handlers outside India,"" said a statement issued by Home Minister P. Chidambaram. ""The incident highlights the fact that the country, especially Jammu and Kashmir, remains vulnerable to militant attacks sponsored by forces from across the border."" Chidambaram's comment echoed India's allegations that the terrorists who laid siege to Mumbai were in touch with their leaders in Pakistan by phone. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh and journalist Umar Aziz Khan contributed to this report.","Indian border guards fire four rockets into Pakistan along Punjab region border .

"Washington (CNN) -- After more than six months in maximum confinement in the U.S. Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Virginia, the prime suspect in the WikiLeaks case ""seems frazzled,"" says one of the few people to visit Army Pfc. Bradley Manning. He is ""sometimes simply catatonic, unable to have conversations about anything really,"" said David House, who has visited his friend in the brig. House said Manning is physically deteriorating. ""He hasn't exercised in seven or eight months since he was confined,"" House said. The Pentagon disputes the idea that Manning is being mistreated. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell told reporters during a news conference last week that reports ""that he is being mistreated, or somehow treated differently than others, in isolation, are just not accurate."" Manning is held in his cell 23 hours a day. He is allowed out of his cell to exercise, for an hour a day. ""Just as though he is not being treated any worse than any other detainee, he is not being treated any better than any other detainee. He is not going to receive special privileges,"" Morrell said. ""He is being treated exactly like everyone else in the brig is being treated. That's what's appropriate."" To those, like House, who say Manning should not be held in maximum security conditions, Morrell said it's not just for his own protection. ""He's being held behind bars because he is deemed a threat, that he has been alleged to have committed a very serious crime that potentially undermines our nation's security, and therefore he needs to be confined during the course of a trial,"" Morrell said. House said he does not discuss the WikiLeaks scandal with Manning because their conversations are monitored by Marines. But they have discussed the recent popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia. ""He views the power of social media as a force that may replace one day very soon the typical talking heads we have on TV. And he views the power of social media as a force that has the power to unite people and can allow them to rapidly organize and outsmart tyrannical regimes,"" House said.","Pfc.

"An Army staff sergeant accused of leading a rogue ""kill squad"" charged with murdering three Afghan civilians took the stand Friday during his court martial and denied carrying out the killings. Yet he admitted to cutting off body parts as part of what prosecutors called a gruesome practice of keeping battlefield ""trophies."" Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs' surprise testimony came a week after his court martial began. It is the first time Gibbs has publicly presented his version of what happened with the platoon he led from the Army's 5th Stryker Brigade. He is the highest-ranking soldier charged in what prosecutors say was a rogue ""kill squad"" that allegedly targeted Afghan civilians and made it look like they'd been insurgents. Gibbs has pleaded not guilty. Twelve soldiers have been charged in the case. Three have pleaded guilty to murders and agreed to testify against fellow soldiers. Another six have been convicted of lesser crimes. More about the allegations against the Stryker Brigade . Besides the murders, Gibbs also has been charged with removing body parts from his alleged victims, such as teeth and fingers, to keep as souvenirs; planting ""drop weapons"" to fake attacks on soldiers; and intimidating several of his own unit members to prevent them from speaking out against the unit's alleged murder plots and rampant drug use. Having already served a tour in Iraq, Gibbs was on his second tour in Afghanistan when he took over the brigade's 3rd platoon. Its previous leader lost a leg in a roadside bombing, an attack that Gibbs said adversely affected his morale and others. ""I should've been on the truck that day,"" he testified Friday. Soldiers from his platoon testified during the court martial for Gibbs -- who stands 6 feet, 4 inches tall and has told investigators that his six skull tattoos are to track his kills in Iraq and Afghanistan -- that he called Afghans ""savages,"" talked about how he killed civilians in Iraq and told them they should not hesitate to fire when in a difficult spot. ""If they are put in a tight situation, don't not pull the trigger,"" Gibbs said he advised members of his new platoon. ""You won't go to jail for it."" He testified Friday about telling soldiers serving under him in Afghanistan how he ""lit ... up"" a car coming toward him in Iraq, while he was manning a nighttime checkpoint. Inside the car was an unarmed Iraqi family, Gibbs said. He recalled how, immediately after this shooting, another soldier called him a ""sicko"" and said he would ""fry"" for the family's deaths. But his superiors later told him he would not face charges, Gibbs' testified. Another soldier -- Private Jeremy Morlock -- testified that Gibbs bragged about the Iraq killings and claimed the incident showed that troops could target civilians without facing repercussions. Morlock is serving a 24-year sentence for the killing of three Afghan civilians. He agreed to testify against other soldiers as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. Gibbs' attorney said Morlock and other soldiers who have testified against Gibbs did so to save themselves from longer jail sentences. The defendant, himself, insisted Friday that never murdered civilians in Afghanistan. Still, Gibbs did admit that -- in January 2010 -- he removed fingers from the body of a dead Afghan man, which is against Army regulations. The man is one of three Gibbs is accused of murdering. He testified about later giving the fingers to the soldier that prosecutors say shot the man, in part because ""people wanted to prove they were there."" ""I was numb to the situation,"" Gibbs told the court about why he had ripped the fingers from the corpse. ""I wasn't thinking, it's sickening. I am embarrassed."" Defense attorney Phillip Stackhouse showed a photo of Gibbs and two other soldiers posing with the body of a different Afghan man. Gibbs has been charged with shooting that man in February 2010 in cold blood and planting an AK-47 near the body to make it look as if the man was an insurgent. Morlock, who is also in the photo, testified previously that Gibbs fired the weapon to make it look like they had come under attack first. On Friday, Gibbs maintained the man had fired on the three soldiers as they patrolled a village in Kandahar Province, insisting he shot back to protect himself and fellow soldiers. ""He got the drop on me,"" Gibbs testified. ""He engaged me with two to three rounds"" before the man's weapon malfunctioned. The staff sergeant admitted to using shears to cut off this man's finger after killing him, saying, ""That was the finger he tried to kill me with, I was pretty pissed off about it."" Speaking in a calm, steady voice throughout his day-long testimony, the staff sergeant denied testimony from fellow soldiers that he goaded his men into targeting civilians and employed ""off the books"" weapons. He also denied murdering a third man -- the mullah of a village, who two fellow soldiers have testified Gibbs killed with a grenade -- in March 2010. Yet Gibbs acknowledged he cut off out one of that man's fingers. ""I compared it to keeping antlers off a deer,"" the staff sergeant testified, saying he agreed to let his soldiers take their own ""trophies."" ""I didn't want to disappoint them. I didn't want to come across as a pussy, which I am not."" Gibbs also admitted Friday to taking part in the beating of Pvt. Justin Stoner, who complained about other soldiers smoking hashish in his room. For good measure, Gibbs said he showed Stoner several dead men's severed fingers and told him, ""Better not to talk."" But Stoner did talk, telling investigators that Gibbs' platoon had begun making up their own missions and selecting their own targets. Military judge Lt. Col. Kwasi Hawks said the case -- to be decided by a five-person panel including three military officers and two enlisted personnel -- should be over by the end of next week. If convicted on all counts, Gibbs could face a life sentence in military prison. ""I am terrified,""  the staff sergeant said Friday, when asked by his attorney about how he felt about testifying.","Sergeant say the Afghans he killed were insurgents, not civilians .

"The glitz of Cannes on the French Riviera is a world removed from the hellish conditions endured by the hundreds of illegal immigrants smuggled from Africa to Europe every year. But Senegalese director Moussa Toure is confronting attendees of the world's leading film festival with their story of desperation in ""La Pirogue,"" his first feature film in 14 years. ""La Pirogue"" -- a pirogue being a type of flat-bottomed boat commonly used for fishing in West Africa -- tells the story of Baye Laye, a boat captain who hails from a fishing village outside Dakar. It follows his ordeal after he agrees to take a pirogue containing 30 men to Spain's Canary Islands in search of a better life in Europe. Toure said the film was inspired by the fact that, in his experience, virtually every Senegalese family had a member who had left by boat for Europe. ""It's an everyday reality in my country,"" he told CNN, in French. ""In Dakar, young people attempt these journeys practically every day because they have no hope for their future in Senegal. They are often educated young people with qualifications, and they pay a lot of money to be smuggled out of the country, because they have no choice."" According to UNHCR figures, there were 5443 ""irregular arrivals"" from North and West Africa by sea in Spain in 2011 -- down from 32,000 in 2006. With the vessels poorly equipped for the arduous journeys of hundreds of kilometers, fatalities are commonplace. When Toure discovered his young mechanic was among those who had made the voyage, lasting two months in Europe before being discovered by authorities and sent home, the director pressed him for his experiences, which subsequently informed the film. See also: Beat goes on for Senegal's octogenarian star . The film was shot over two months in Senegal. Many of the actors, just like their characters, could not swim, making for some tense moments, said Toure. ""We had dangerous moments because we were filming at the mouth of the Saloum River and this is where it meets the sea. I was secretly terrified that we would capsize like often happens in real life. I was especially scared for those (the actors) who could not swim."" Moussa, a former electrician who shot his first short film in 1987, has been focusing on documentaries for the past decade. Working on ""La Pirogue,"" his third feature, was deeply affecting, he said, and the result had made his wife cry ""like I've never seen her cry before"". The film, a French-Senegalese co-production, is one of 20 films selected for the ""Un Certain Regard"" (A Particular Outlook) section of the festival, designated for original and innovative movies seeking international recognition. See also: African big cats caught on film . Toure's film is the only sub-Saharan African movie in competition this year, but African films -- particularly those from Senegal and Burkina Faso -- have fared well at the festival, especially over the past decade. In 2008, the French-Liberian co-production ""Johnny Mad Dog"" won the Prize of Hope at the festival, for its depiction of child soldiers at the end of the Second Liberian Civil War. It was based on the novel ""Johnny Chien Mechant"" by Congolese author Emmanuel Dongala. In 2005, ""Delwende,"" directed by Burkina Faso's S. Pierre Yameogo, won the same prize when it was screened. It told the story of a woman accused of being a ""soul eater"" and subjected to trial by a council of elders after a child died in her village. The year previous, ""Moolaade,"" by the late Senegalese writer and director Ousmane Sembene won the ""Prix Un Certain Regard,"" while in 1990, Burkina Faso's Idrissa Ouedraogo won the Jury Grand Prize for his film ""Tilai."" African cinema also has a strong presence at Cannes with South African and Nigerian delegations at the festival's film market. Their attendance is intended to showcase both countries' film industries and the investment opportunities they represent. Nigeria boasts one of the world's biggest film industries -- affectionately known as ""Nollywood"" -- alongside Hollywood and Bombay's ""Bollywood."" See also: Nollywood's Julia Roberts . Most of its output consists of pacey and vibrant video-format B-movies, which have immense popularity across the continent despite their shoe-string budgets. But recently a new generation of filmmakers has been seeking to elevate the industry through a movement they call ""New Nigeria Cinema,"" involving stronger story lines, higher production values and a more authentic depiction of African experience. Toure is no stranger to film festivals; last year he was president of the documentary film jury at Africa's largest film festival, FESPACO (the Pan-African Film Festival of Ouagadougou, in Burkina Faso). He said he was optimistic about the future of African cinema. ""I think there are great stories coming out of Africa and there are many people who are talented. Those who govern us do not get involved and leave cinema at the mercy of filmmakers,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- JetBlue is making the driver's fantasy of levitating above traffic a reality in Los Angeles this weekend. Anticipating the city's impending ""Carmageddon,"" the airline known for its egalitarian seating plans, satellite TV and fancy potato chips offered $4 flights between Burbank and Long Beach. The distance between the two airports is a little less than 40 miles and is the airline's shortest ever flight, JetBlue spokeswoman Allison Steinberg said. For more than 48 hours this weekend, a 10-mile section of Interstate 405 (""The 405"" in local vernacular) will be closed for construction, allowing workers to demolish a bridge and add carpool lanes. The freeway, which links the San Fernando Valley to the coast, usually sees about 500,000 cars each weekend on the stretch of road that will be closed. JetBlue announced the deal on its special fares Twitter feed Wednesday afternoon. The deal quickly gained momentum. ""405 freeway closure? We're so over it,"" JetBlue wrote on its blog. JetBlue announced that the flights were sold out three hours after initially tweeting the deal. The fare includes taxes and fees, except for possible unaccompanied minor fees or for checking an overweight or second bag, according to JetBlue's website. There will be two trips from each airport on Saturday afternoon and evening. Steinberg said that this is deal was different from other special offers, which offer discounts on existing routes but don't add new ones. ""We've offered different sales and tied them into local events, but I think it's unique in the sense that we literally added a route with two flights for Saturday.""","This weekend, a 10-mile section of Interstate 405 in California will be closed for construction .

"Millions of Americans are none too happy with the federal government right now. The shutdown is over after 16 days, but the things we missed while the government was closed are still fresh in our minds. Here are nine things readers are thrilled to have back, in no particular order. Add your own in the comments below and we might add them to our list. 1. National Parks (+ Panda Cam) Parks make us happy. That was the battle cry from photographers, campers, newlyweds and other outdoor lovers turned away from national facilities ranging from Yellowstone National Park to the neighborhood playground during the shutdown. ""I missed the first part of canoe season on the Buffalo National River in NW Arkansas, just as leaves started on fall color,"" Tulsa, Oklahoma, attorney Teresa M. Burkett wrote on Twitter. As soon as she heard the impasse was breaking, she set up a canoe trip for this weekend. ""The nation's first national river is America at its finest. Truly the best part of our federal government: America's national parks."" Lovers of the National Zoo's Panda Cam were also at a loss for cuteness. The webcam was back up by Thursday morning (the 8-week-old panda cub was sleeping, last we checked.) Yellowstone protester: Stop 'holding our parks hostage' 2. Health care research . The National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer life-saving treatments for a lot of hopeless people. Young mother Michelle Langbehn has been through nine months of chemotherapy, two cycles of radiation, a spinal fusion and several tumor removal surgeries for her cancer. When the government shut down, she was waiting for the NIH to review her medical files to determine if she was eligible to enter a clinical drug trial. She's since learned that she didn't qualify, but countless other patients will benefit from that study and others. Open for business again . 3. Weather information . Our environment plays a key role in our daily lives, even if we aren't giving much thought to which way the wind blows. The absence of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's website made it harder for some to find out about current weather conditions or see views of the Northern Lights. Those who depend on this information for school or other research were missing a key resource. ""It's day 14 of the shutdown and I have lost two weeks of thesis research because NASA and NOAA's websites are down,"" tweeted a user named Nicole. Omoju Miller, a resident of California's earthquake-prone Bay Area, tried to visit the U.S. Geological Survey website, but saw it was closed. ""So we had a small earthquake in the middle of the night,"" she wrote. ""Went to USGS, guess what? They are furloughed because of the government shutdown!"" 4. Museums . The Smithsonian Institution's museums -- including the National Air and Space Museum, the most-visited museum in the country -- were closed during the shutdown, spoiling vacation plans for thousands. But now that they've reopened, treasures like the Wright brothers' airplane, the original star-spangled banner, the Hope diamond, Dorothy's ruby slippers and spacecraft that actually went to the moon are again on view to the public, and all free. ""Any of the Smithsonian museums are wonderful. And the price is just right,"" noted reddit user empirialest on a discussion about favorite museums. Don't forget your astronaut ice cream! 5. Space exploration . Gazing up at the sky to see what's out there is a pastime here on this planet, but there is so much the naked eye can't see. Those addicted to space and the stars rely on NASA's website for views of what's out there in outer space, but with the shutdown in action, they were missing their space and science fix. The thought of it all coming back made some very happy, like Twitter user Angela Schmidt, who likes to tune in to what's happening with the International Space Station. ""The government is gonna reopen!"" Schmidt wrote excitedly. ""I finally get NASA TV back! Missing my daily ISS updates!"" Another Twitter user, Jeffery Elliott, wrote an abbreviated letter of support to the agency during the shutdown. ""Dear NASA,"" he said, ""On behalf of the American people, I want to apologize. We took you for granted and now we're paying the price. We're so very sorry."" 6. Libraries and archives . The Library of Congress, U.S. Census and other government departments keep the flow of information going. Students and researchers realized how much they needed access to archival materials during the shutdown. Georgia Tech graduate research assistant and Ph.D. candidate Glo Ross missed having census data at her fingertips. ""The #shutdown just got real for this PhD student. Access to census data for research? Denied,"" she tweeted. Ross uses Geographic Information Systems, spatial statistics and other data obtained from the U.S. Census site. She is writing her dissertation on the transformation of food deserts in Atlanta. Cutting off access to federal data ""stops knowledge flow and creativity -- big disadvantage to those studying past trends and predicting future ones,"" she said. 7. Being able to change names . San Francisco safety Donte Whitner's  name change wasn't the only one put on hold because of the shutdown (he wanted to drop the W and go by Hitner). ""No name change, but enjoyed the convo,"" Courtney Ziller wrote on Twitter after a trip to the local Social Security office in Minneapolis, only to be told she couldn't file the paperwork for a new Social Security card because of the shutdown. The Social Security office also stopped issuing replacement Social Security cards, replacement Medicare cards and proof-of-income letters. 8. Getting paid . 'Our shutdown fears have been realized' Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are ready for the government to show them the money. More than 400,000 were still furloughed at the end of the shutdown, and it was twice that when the shutdown began. Essential workers -- those who kept working without pay during the shutdown, including military service members -- can now receive their back pay. ""It feels like crap,"" said Air Force archaeologist and cultural resources manager Tom Penders when the shutdown began. ""We live paycheck to paycheck as it is and barely make ends meet."" Plenty of other workers and business owners will never recoup their losses, such as hotel server Joy Lorien, who was temporarily laid off from her job at the Skyland Resort in Virginia's Shenandoah National Park at the height of tourist season. There were other serious impacts on low-income families. Head Start preschool programs were forced to close in six states until a Houston couple donated $10 million to keep them running through the shutdown. 9. Our sanity . While the government stood still, some Americans felt their heads spinning. Angie Smith missed ""that sense of peace knowing things are functioning as they should."" E. Kate G. missed ""being proud of our country."" And Tim W. missed ""common sense,"" saying ""I have no reason to believe it will be back anytime soon."" What government resources are you glad to have back? Tell us in the comments below.","Americans are happy to have certain resources back after the government shutdown .
Most-missed included national parks, museums, government data and health services .

People out in the real world would tell me,  'Why aren't you over this? He's been gone for years. Why aren't you better by now?' ""All I wanted to do was end my life. I know I'm not alone. I've talked to other parents, other family members. We are hurting and someone must do something."" If you need help, contact the Veterans Crisis Line 1-800-273-8255, press 1 . Though the military tracks suicides among service members, suicides among their family members -- spouses, siblings and parents -- go uncounted. But CNN learned Wednesday that the Pentagon's Defense Suicide Prevention Office has sent a report to Congress detailing for the first time a proposal for tracking those deaths. The report came partly in response to cries for help from groups like the National Military Family Association, whose members know firsthand about the suicides and have struggled to call attention to the problem. Read the full report (PDF) In interviews with CNN, military family members who have attempted or considered suicide say the cumulative trauma of 12 years of war -- America's longest battles -- and unprecedented multiple deployments of their loved ones have left them wrung out and desperate. Some have attempted suicide while struggling to care for injured service members. Others, like Scott Warner, have been pushed to the edge by the loss of their loved one at war. Warner has slowly emerged from the darkness that enveloped him before his suicide attempt in 2010. When he heard about the Defense Department's report, he was hopeful. ""If they do this, it would validate that families are traumatized,"" Warner said. ""This is a lonely journey that parents, siblings, spouses are walking. I know; I've talked to them. I don't care how long it takes, we all want this."" The report, obtained by CNN Wednesday, says the Defense Department does not currently have the ability to investigate, monitor or receive notification of military family member deaths and details how that might be done and what it would cost. It would take 18 to 24 months for the Pentagon to analyze data it could buy from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, which tracks deaths in the general U.S. population, the report says. That data -- names and locations of deaths -- could then be compared against data the Defense Department has on family members enrolled in an ID card program. The card allows them access to health benefits and other services, like shopping at on-base commissaries. The cost of the effort, the report says: $681,600 the first year and $502,200 each additional year. The report concedes there are limitations to the plan. Some family members, for instance, opt out of enrolling in the ID program. Service members' parents typically would not be in the ID program. If a relative not in the program committed suicide, it's possible they would not be counted. Veteran confronts rape, suicide: 'I am angry that others are going through this' Spokespersons for the House and Senate armed services committees told CNN on Wednesday that lawmakers are still reading the 20-page report. ""$600,000 is very little money to spend on something this important,"" said Kristina Kaufmann, a longtime military wife who since 2006 has written editorials in national newspapers and spoken before Congress about the need to track military family member suicides. ""A couple years ago, I had people telling me I was being histrionic.  They'd say a bunch of military spouses weren't killing themselves. But we have the anecdotes. What we don't have -- and I'm glad we're going to try to get -- is the actual data."" Kaufmann personally knew military wives who committed suicide. She was friends with Faye Vick. In 2006, the Fort Bragg mother placed her baby and 2-year old in the backseat of her car and asphyxiated them all. Websites become tool for stopping veteran suicides . Monique Lingenfelter was the wife of a sergeant assigned to a special operations unit at Bragg. In 2009, she barricaded herself in her home and shot herself. Another military spouse, Karen Ruedisueli, told CNN that the organization she works for, the National Military Family Association, a nonprofit that serves a quarter-million military relatives, has heard an increasing number of stories about family members killing themselves. Late last year, the group formally implored Congress to ask the Defense Department to find a way to measure the deaths. ""We have a large network of volunteers across the country who come to us with these accounts and we have no way to track them,"" Ruedisueli said. ""We're encouraged that DOD has come up with some kind of methodology."" The spouse of the highest-ranking military officer in the country tried to call attention to the problem four years ago. Deborah Mullen, wife of Adm. Mike Mullen, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, took the stage at a Defense Department conference to say she'd tried to get information about suicides among relatives. She met with leaders to see if they tracked family member suicides. Army leaders told her there were nine military family member suicides in 2009. Study: Mental illness, not combat, causes soldier suicides . Mullen said she asked Army officials if they knew how many family members had attempted suicide. ""I was stunned when I was told that there were too many to track,"" she told the crowd. ""If that number is that large just in the Army, we really don't have an idea of the scope of the problem."" ""It's our responsibility,"" she implored. ""These are our family members. We have got to find a way to track them."" An annual survey by Blue Star Families, the largest military family advocacy group, found suicide among relatives to be a serious concern. Out of 5,100 military family members surveyed in 2012, 9% of military spouses reported that they had considered suicide. Of those, nearly a quarter said they had not sought help. But even if they had, it's unclear if they would have been heard. View: Stop saying 'committed suicide' The Defense Suicide Prevention Office report noted that branches of the military do not share standardized procedures in tracking suicide. The Army is the only service that attempts to track its military family members who commit suicide, the report says. ""I think we understand the bureaucracy,"" Scott Warner said. ""I know this will be difficult. It's government. But what else can we believe other than that they will try?"" Sharing experiences can help .","Defense Suicide Prevention Office sends a report to Congress .

"Misrata, Libya (CNN) -- On the front lines of Libya's war, rebel fighters say they are finding more than weapons on captured or killed soldiers loyal to ruler Moammar Gadhafi. Rebels say they have confiscated cell phones that contain video showing Gadhafi loyalists raping women and torturing people. CNN has obtained a copy of a video shot on a cell phone that appears to show a woman being sexually abused. The person who gave the video to CNN says it was on a cell phone that was confiscated from a Gadhafi loyalist. It shows two men in civilian clothes standing over a naked woman who is bent over with her face on the floor. The man standing behind her is sodomizing her with what appears to be a broomstick. ""I can't bear it! I can't bear it!"" the woman cries. ""Let's push it farther,"" a male voice says off-camera. ""No, no, that's enough!"" the woman begs. Eventually, one of the men puts his sock-covered foot on her face. In Arab culture, that is considered a major insult. But in this case, it pales in comparison to what the victim is already enduring. Arabic speakers who listened to the video at CNN's request say the voices have Tripoli accents. There is no date on the video and the men in it are not wearing military uniforms. CNN has been unable to verify the video's authenticity, when it was shot, or by whom. The person who gave it to CNN asked not to be identified for fear of being punished by Libya's conservative society. The Gadhafi government did not respond to CNN requests for comment on the allegations of abuse. But officials have said in response to similar accusations in the past that the government has not been able to verify the claims and would ""welcome"" a fact-finding mission. An opposition spokesman says the video illustrates a pattern of abuse. ""We were able to confirm that rape was used as a weapon of war, because it was systematic,"" rebel spokesman Abdullah al-Kabeir said. The rebels have many videos showing other types of torture, and a few depict rape, he said. He did not know exactly how many videos there were showing abuse. One of the most famous faces of Libya's revolution, Eman al-Obeidy, dramatically claimed in March she had been gang-raped by pro-Gadhafi forces. She has since fled the country. A Libyan psychologist who has conducted an investigation of her own says al-Obeidy's case is not unique. Siham Sergewa says she has evidence of hundreds of cases of rape by pro-Gadhafi troops. She began her investigation after receiving phone calls from women who said they had been sexually assaulted. Her survey of 50,000 people in refugee camps turned up 259 people who said they had been raped, she said last month. ""They tie up my husband, they rape me in front of my husband and then they kill my husband,"" Sergewa said one woman told her. ""I'm a psychologist and I've seen lots of things, really. But sometimes after I leave some of these families I just sit in my car and cry because it's really so painful,"" she said. She has compiled a number of distressing images that she says demonstrate the abuse of alleged victims. One appears to show a cigarette burn on a woman's breast, another a faded bite mark, while several others show the deep purple hue of nasty bruises. Sergewa shared her research, complete with pictures and recordings, with the International Criminal Court at The Hague, Netherlands, where prosecutors are investigating accusations that the Gadhafi regime has used rape as a tool of war. ""The victims are starting to come out,"" the court's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, told CNN Thursday. ""But in our court the crimes are massive and the crimes we are charging Gadhafi with are crimes against humanity, meaning a widespread and systematic attack -- in this case through rapes -- so we don't need to prove one case; we need to prove massive numbers of cases. ""In this case, the evidence can be different. It could be soldiers who were given instructions on how to do it. The evidence could be doctors or psychologists who have spoken to the victims. That's the kind of evidence we are collecting."" The court is still in the evidence-collecting stage, he said. For the video to be part of that evidence, its authenticity would have to be certified, he said. ""These are interesting pieces, but it isn't the only way to put forward the case. For instance, we have some information of people saying that Gadhafi himself was giving instructions. So if we can confirm this evidence, that will be enough to present this type of case as a crime against humanity -- as a widespread campaign of rapes."" Moreno-Ocampo said he was hoping the judge would soon issue an arrest warrant for Gadhafi. ""And then the challenge will be to arrest him, because arresting him will be the end to these crimes,"" he said. Rebel spokesman al-Kabeir, however, said some of the evidence of war crimes that prosecutors want to present in court has been destroyed by a rebel leader. ""There was a commander here at the eastern front in Misrata named Mohamed al-Halboos; he ordered all the (rebel) fighters to give him all the rape videos they find on Gadhafi soldiers' cell phones. I heard that he used to destroy every rape video he got,"" al-Kabeir said. Asked why potential evidence of war crimes being carried out by pro-Gadhafi forces would be destroyed by rebel forces, he cited the heavy stigma that Libyan culture attaches to the victims of such crimes. ""Aside from being a heinous crime, rape is perceived here in our culture as damaging not only for the girl, but also the whole family,"" he said. In fact, he added, rape is such a taboo here that some victims' families would rather erase potential evidence than risk living with the shame. In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was ""deeply concerned"" over the reports of wide-scale rape in Libya. ""A thorough investigation of this matter is needed to bring perpetrators to justice,"" she said in a statement. ""Gadhafi's security forces and other groups in the region are trying to divide the people by using violence against women and rape as tools of war, and the United States condemns this in the strongest possible terms."" CNN's Amir Ahmed contributed to this story.","CNN sees a video showing a woman being abused by two men .

"(CNN) -- Michigan's Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday allowing lower state courts to ""exercise reasonable control"" over the appearance of witnesses and parties, a rule change proposed after a Muslim woman refused to remove an Islamic garment in a small claims court. A niqab is a garment that covers the entire face and head, except for the eyes. The order allows courts ""reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses"" so as to ""ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact-finder and ensure the accurate identification of such person."" The order, which amends a rule of the Michigan Rules of Evidence, is effective September 1. The amendment was prompted by a 2006 small claims case in Michigan filed by Ginnah Muhammad, who wore a niqab -- a garment that covers the entire face and head, except for the eyes -- to court, the order said. According to the Detroit Free Press, Muhammad was contesting a $2,750 repair bill from a car rental company because she said thieves broke into the vehicle she was using. As she prepared to testify, Judge Paul Paruk asked her to remove her niqab, saying he needed to be able to see her face to tell whether she was telling the truth, according to court documents. ""I can't see certain things about your demeanor and temperament that I need to see in a court of law,"" Paruk said at the time. Muhammad refused, saying that she was a practicing Muslim and would take off the veil only in front of a female judge. Paruk said a female judge was not available and told Muhammad she could remove the niqab or have her case dismissed -- she chose the latter, according to court documents. She sued the judge in federal district court, which declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case. Muhammad has since appealed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement saying that if the amended rule was interpreted broadly, it could ""not only adversely affect Muslim females who wear the head scarf, but could also be used to violate Jewish, Sikh, and other people of faiths' constitutional rights under the First Amendment while in Michigan courts."" It added, ""As a civil rights advocacy group, CAIR-MI is concerned about individuals who may be reluctant to report crimes or petition the courts out of fear that their religious rights may be violated."" Other religious groups, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union and domestic violence groups, had opposed the rule change, the Detroit Free Press reported. The ACLU had asked that the court add a sentence to the rule saying ""that no person shall be precluded from testifying on the basis of clothing worn because of a sincerely held belief,"" the newspaper reported in May. CAIR also said that it would announce on Wednesday the filing of a federal lawsuit against a Wayne County, Michigan, judge who had asked a Muslim woman to remove her head scarf in court. ""The Muslim plaintiff felt so intimidated by the judge's repeated demand that she eventually removed her head scarf,"" the organization said in a statement released Tuesday. CAIR-MI is a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit being filed on behalf of the Michigan woman, who is a member of the group. Last month, the Judicial Council of Georgia adopted a policy allowing religious head coverings in the state's courtrooms, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.","Courts allowed ""exercise reasonable control"" over appearance of witnesses .

"Washington (CNN) -- Top congressional Republicans on Friday used a new dismal jobs report to blast Democrats' push for more tax revenue in the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations, arguing that such a move would derail an already shaky economic recovery. Federal officials reported Friday that the economy added only 18,000 jobs in June -- far below the number predicted by most economists. Unemployment inched up another tenth of a point to 9.2%. ""Today's report is more evidence that the misguided 'stimulus' spending binge, excessive regulations, and an overwhelming national debt continue to hold back private-sector job creation in our country,"" said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""A debt limit increase that raises taxes or fails to make serious spending cuts won't pass the House."" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said the jobs figures ""serve as a warning that as we address the debt limit increase we shouldn't do so in a way that raises taxes and impedes the ability of small businesses to create jobs and get people back to work. ... Let me be clear: Republicans will not agree to tax increases. Period."" President Obama didn't respond to the Republicans, but reiterated his call for a rapid conclusion to the debt ceiling talks. The employment report ""confirms what most Americans already know,"" the president said at the White House. ""We still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do."" ""The sooner we get"" an agreement raising the debt ceiling, the sooner businesses will have ""the certainty that they will need in order to make additional investments to grow and hire,"" he said. Boehner on Saturday said that the insistence by Obama and Democrats on raising revenue through higher taxes prevented any chance that Republicans could support a major deal that also would cut spending and reform entitlement programs such as Medicare. The White House immediately pushed back, with a senior administration official saying Boehner initially accepted the need to increase tax rates on wealthy Americans as part of a deal, but then Republicans offered a different plan in the talks with Obama that began Thursday. Boehner said the parameters of the negotiations would be scaled back from what the administration had requested and the focus would be on spending cuts already discussed in previous talks led by Vice President Joe Biden. ""I believe the best approach may be to focus on producing a smaller measure, based on the cuts identified in the Biden-led negotiations, that still meets our call for spending reforms and cuts greater than the amount of the debt limit increase,"" Boehner said in a statement. The White House maintains it will still push for the big deal and reiterated rejection of a short-term, temporary agreement to get the debt ceiling raised, a senior administration official said Saturday. Boehner and Cantor were part of a group of eight congressional leaders from both parties that met behind closed doors with Obama at the White House Thursday to help hammer out an agreement to raise the nation's $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. Treasury Department officials have warned that a failure to raise the limit by August 2 could led to a possible default with catastrophic economic fallout, including skyrocketing interest rates and a plummeting dollar. The group is scheduled to meet again on Sunday. Obama said in Thursday's meeting that he will not sign any agreement that fails to raise the debt ceiling beyond the 2012 election, according to two congressional sources with knowledge of the talks. The president has signaled a willingness to include reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare as part of a broad agreement for between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in deficit cuts over the next decade, said Democratic officials familiar with the negotiations. Defense spending and tax reform are also on the table, the officials told CNN. ""Nobody's plan is going to be the plan that emerges,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said. ""Comprehensiveness and balance are our targets."" Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, are wrestling with rising anger among liberal House members in the wake of news that the president might agree to entitlement cuts. A group of progressive House Democrats said Thursday morning they are collecting signatures for a letter to Obama opposing any reductions in Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. The members warned that they would oppose any deal that cuts entitlement programs or fails to raise taxes on the wealthy. ""We feel that the discussions have been skewed up to this point,"" said Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Arizona. He called for protection for ""programs that are essential to working folks and the middle class."" ""The debt must be addressed, but it should be done in a way that is fair to all,"" said Rep. Judy Chu, D-California. The politically influential AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, also weighed in, warning it would oppose any deal cutting Social Security. ""AARP urges all lawmakers to reject any proposals that would cut the benefits seniors have earned through a lifetime of hard work,"" said Barry Rand, the organization's CEO. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who met with Obama on Friday, told reporters she wants the president to ""have the room"" to reach a deal, and offered her ""full cooperation to do that."" However, she said, House Democrats ""do not support cuts in benefits for Social Security or Medicare,"" and negotiations on specific reforms to those programs should be separate from a broader deficit reduction deal. Pelosi linked entitlement reforms to Democratic calls for eliminating Bush-era tax cuts for wealthy Americans by restoring higher tax rates for families earning more than $250,000 a year. ""Do not consider Social Security a piggy bank for giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people in our country,"" she said. CNN has learned negotiators are considering the possibility of raising the Social Security retirement age and trimming benefit levels for older Americans with incomes over $60,000. Cuts in the range of $500 billion are being considered for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, a congressional aide close to the negotiations said. Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, have long rejected such cuts. The aide, however, insisted the only real talks going on are between Obama and Boehner, who are holding discussions ""in good faith."" The two men met last weekend, a Republican official told CNN. If Obama and Boehner reach an agreement on such an ambitious package, they realize it will likely be met with stiff opposition from lawmakers in both parties, the aide said. Tea party-backed conservatives will oppose revenue hikes, and liberal Democrats will oppose entitlement cuts. That said, the aide indicated, Obama and Boehner believe they can each gain politically from making an attempt to cut a grand deal -- even if it is rejected -- because the public would see they tried to take bold steps to solve the problem. If it is rejected, the two can fall back on a $2.4 trillion deal put forth before the talks collapsed. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, will likely reject such a deal, in part because Republicans believe they have a better chance of winning back the Senate if a long-term deal fails, the aide said. Democrats are confident Republicans will ultimately agree to some revenue changes -- such as a hike in some fees and the closing of some unpopular tax loopholes. But it will be much more challenging to get them to agree to significant and costly reforms like the capping of tax deductions for people earning more than $250,000 per year, the aide said. If Republicans ultimately reject any revenue increases and Congress can't raise the debt limit, Democrats believe Republicans will be blamed for causing a default, according to the aide. Publicly, both sides continue to rail against proposals by the other. Obama said Wednesday he wants a deal with Congress in the next two weeks, but didn't rule out using a constitutional argument to increase how much money the government can borrow. ""I don't think we should even get to the constitutional issue,"" Obama said during a Twitter town hall at the White House in response to a tweeted question on whether he would rely on a clause in the 14th Amendment to unilaterally raise the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling should not be ""used as a gun against the heads of the American people to extract tax breaks for corporate jet owners,"" Obama said, calling for ""a balanced approach where everything's on the table."" CNN's Jessica Yellin, Ted Barrett, Brianna Keilar, Tom Cohen, Kate Bolduan, and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .","GOP leaders say Friday's poor jobs report is more evidence tax hikes can't be part of a deal .

"Washington (CNN) -- The body of Sen. Robert C. Byrd arrived at the Capitol on Thursday, a rare honor for a man who rose from the poverty of Depression-era West Virginia to become the longest-serving member of Congress in history. Byrd, who died Monday at the age of 92, will lie in repose in the Senate chamber until 3:45 p.m. Thursday. His body will be transported to Charleston, West Virginia, Thursday evening, where it will remain at the state capitol overnight. Byrd will be buried Tuesday after a funeral service in Arlington, Virginia. Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are among the dignitaries expected to pay their respects to Byrd on Capitol Hill Thursday. While in the Senate, his casket will be displayed on the same catafalque used for Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Thurgood Marshall, among others. Since World War II, according to the Senate historian's office, only two senators have lain in repose in the Senate chamber: Wisconsin's Joe McCarthy in 1957 and North Dakota's William Langer in 1959. President Barack Obama has ordered flags on federal buildings to fly at half-staff until next week's burial, except for Independence Day. A proclamation issued by Obama said the order was given ""as a mark of respect for (Byrd's) memory and long-standing service."" Byrd, a nine-term Democrat, was known as a master of the Senate's arcane rules and as the self-proclaimed ""champion of the Constitution,"" a staunch defender of congressional power. His speeches were laced with references to poetry and the Greek and Roman classics, often punctuated by the brandishing of his pocket copy of the national charter. He also was known as the ""King of Pork,"" using powerful positions in Congress to steer federal spending to his home state -- one of the nation's poorest. Byrd viewed the title as a badge of honor. ""I have no apology for it,"" he once said. ""When I am dead and am opened they will find West Virginia written on my heart.""","Remains of Sen. Robert Byrd arrive at Capitol .

"On Wednesday, the United States government looked perilously close to hitting its debt ceiling -- the limit on the amount Washington can borrow to pay its bills. While Americans watched as the specter of a potential debt default and continuation of the government shutdown approached, life went on as usual in the rest of the world. Here are five stories you may have missed. Death toll from Philippines quake rises . Philippine authorities raised the death toll from Tuesday's  7.1 magnitude earthquake to 144. The quake was centered near a town in Bohol province, in the central Philippines, where the bulk of casualties were recorded. Almost 300 people were injured and local media said authorities were checking reports that people were trapped in collapsed buildings. Iran holds nuclear talks with the P5+1 . Representatives from Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- plus Germany -- concluded a meeting in Geneva on Iran's nuclear program by releasing a joint statement. Many in the West fear Iran is pursuing the development of a nuclear bomb, but Iran has always maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only. The joint statement described the talks as ""substantive and forward-looking,"" but details were scarce. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the Iranians had put forward a new proposal ""with a level of seriousness and substance that we had not seen before."" Discussions are scheduled to resume on November 7 and 8. Passenger plane crashes in Laos . A Lao Airlines passenger plane flying from Laos' capital, Vientiane, crashed as it prepared to land at Pakse Airport, near the border with Thailand. Forty-nine people -- 44 passengers and 5 crew -- were killed in the crash. They included 16 Laotian passengers and five crew, seven French, six Australians, five Thais, three Koreans, two Vietnamese, an American, a Canadian, a Chinese, a Malaysian and one Taiwanese, an airline spokesman said. It was raining at the time of the crash and the spokesman said later that gusts from the remnant of a typhoon appeared to have caused the pilots to lose control of the aircraft. At least 18 die in Tokyo typhoon . Typhoon Wipha pummeled the Tokyo region, killing at least 18 people and leaving more than 40 missing. The majority of deaths occurred after heavy rain triggered flooding and landslides that blocked roads and crushed houses in Oshima, a small island 120km (75 miles) south of the Japanese capital, a local official said. The typhoon cut power to more than 56,000 households and led to the cancellation of more than 500 flights, as well as the suspension of bullet train services in central and northern Japan. Fatwa allows Syrians to eat cats and dogs during Eid . Fighting continued in Syria on the second day of Islam's Eid al-Adha -- or Feast of Sacrifice -- holiday. At least 53 people -- including 13 children and four women -- were killed, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported. Meanwhile, Arabic media reported that an imam in the capital Damascus had issued a religious ruling allowing the desperately hungry to eat dogs and cats, where stores of food were inadequate. Eating dog, cat or donkey is forbidden under Islamic dietary laws.","In Washington Wednesday, the U.S. lifted its debt ceiling and reopened government .

"Washington (CNN) -- Since 1974, U.S. presidents have had a tool to use Central Intelligence Agency operatives clandestinely -- but with limits. The term ""presidential finding"" is back in the headlines this week because of the situation in Libya. A former counterterrorism official with knowledge of U.S.-Libya policy said there is a presidential finding authorizing the CIA to conduct operations in support of U.S. policy in Libya, including assessing the opposition and determining their needs. Here's a deeper look at prescribed covert activities: . What is a presidential finding? A finding is a subset of a presidential directive, focused on the Central Intelligence Agency. According to a Congressional Research Services study in 2007, presidential directives have been around since the early days of the federal government. ""Presidents, exercising magisterial or executive power not unlike that of a monarch, from time to time have issued directives establishing new policy, decreeing the commencement or cessation of some action or ordaining that notice be given to some declaration,"" the study said. Over the years, there have been various directives created, known by specific names and which have a set purpose. The notion of a presidential finding was established in 1974 during the height of a congressional investigation into allegations the CIA was illegally spying on Americans and was involved in covert programs to assassinate foreign leaders. In an effort to reign in the executive branch and the CIA, Congress passed the the Hughes-Ryan amendment to the 1974 Foreign Assistance Act. The law prohibits the expenditure of appropriated funds by or on behalf of the CIA for intelligence activities ""unless and until the President finds that each such operation is important to the national security of the United States and reports, in a timely fashion, a description and scope of such operation to the appropriate committees of Congress."" How is covert activity legally defined? U.S. law describes covert activity as any secret action taken by the United States in another country to influence that nation's political, economic or military situation. The involvement of the U.S. is not intended to be apparent or publicly acknowledged. The statute does not include traditional intelligence-gathering overseas; that is, seeking information within a country and analyzing it for policymakers. How specific are presidential findings? A former senior intelligence official said presidential findings are written in a way that is ""general enough to allow flexibility, but specific enough to know legally what you can do."" Intelligence officers engaged in the secret task will know that what they are doing has been authorized by the White House and determined to be legal. A U.S. official with knowledge of findings said they create a framework for broader actions taken in the future -- actions that would require permission from the White House before being done. A former counterterrorism official said the specific activities of CIA officers would be determined by conditions on the ground and would need further approval from the president. Who determines what the covert activities will be? The U.S. official said it is a ""collective decision."" The administration determines what the overall policy is and what the goals are, and then turns to the intelligence community for suggestions on how to carry it out. As the official put it, ""You need to look at all instruments of national power"" to carry through a policy. The former senior intelligence official said covert action is seeking to change such things as the political future of a country, the attitudes of the populace, and/or the economic conditions within a nation. The fact there is a presidential finding indicates there is a ""much greater involvement"" by the CIA in Libya, said the official. For instance, in the case of the rebels, the former official suggested some of the things the CIA operatives are doing on the ground are ""finding out who they (the rebels) are, what they are doing and what they need"" to be successful. The official went on to say the officers ""might be advising on how to target the adversary, how to use the weapons they have, reconnaissance and counter surveillance."" Is covert action always secret? Whenever the CIA is engaged in secret action, the U.S. wants plausible deniability of the role it may have played -- but as the former senior intelligence official indicated, that isn't always the case. For instance, when the CIA helped launch the occupation of Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, CIA operatives were in the country coordinating activities before there were any U.S. boots on the ground. ""Things were blowing up,"" said the official, making it difficult to deny the agency's involvement. The same could be said of the CIA's use of unmanned aircraft to fire missiles at suspected terrorists in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Although the CIA and the U.S. government never acknowledge the attacks, it is one of the worst-kept secrets. The drones can be seen and heard, and the damage done is publicly evident. But the U.S. government continues to be mum on the attacks because of Pakistani outrage to them. The former intelligence official angrily said the disclosure of the Libyan covert action ""puts people's lives at risk."" ""You can't do covert action without the U.S. showing its hand,"" said the official, adding that will have a detrimental impact on the United States' ability to carry out its foreign policy objectives.","A ""presidential finding"" allows certain covert activities .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- U.S. fighter jets in Iraq have shot down an unmanned Iranian spy drone aircraft, the U.S. military said Monday. The Iranian aircraft had been flying in Iraqi airspace for 70 minutes before being shot down 60 miles northeast of Baghdad last month, the military said. ""This was not an accident on the part of the Iranians,"" the U.S. military said in a statement. ""The [drone] was in Iraqi airspace for nearly one hour and 10 minutes and well inside Iraqi territory before it was engaged."" Two F-16 fighter jets followed the drone for about an hour before shooting it down, a Pentagon official said. The drone had no weapons and was strictly a spy aircraft, the official told CNN. The U.S. military has taken ownership of the drone, which the Pentagon official said is in ""pretty good shape."" Iraq's national security adviser, Mowaffak al-Rubaie, declined to comment on the allegation and most major state-run media outlets in Iran did not carry news of any incident involving an Iranian drone. The Bush administration regularly accused Iran of meddling in Iraq and arming fighters, and in 2002 President George W. Bush put Iran in his ""axis of evil."" Since President Barack Obama took office he has appeared more conciliatory towards Iran although the country continues to cause U.S. concern over its nuclear ambitions and its role in Iraq.","U.S. military says two F-16 jets shot down Iranian spy drone over Iraq .

"Over the past few weeks we have been bombarded with tales of woe from Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and arms industry executives about what they have described as the potentially devastating impacts of cutting the Pentagon budget. To hear them tell it, the most powerful military in the world will grind to a halt if it is required to cut its $500 billion-plus budget by about 8%. There's no question that the sequester -- the automatic across-the-board spending cuts that will kick in if Congress and the president fail to agree on a balanced deficit reduction plan -- is not an ideal way to trim the budget. It precludes one of the central tenets of good government: the ability to increase investments in programs that work while cutting or eliminating programs that don't. But we shouldn't confuse this management issue with an underlying truth. There is plenty to cut at the Pentagon without undermining our security. Given this reality, it is astonishing that former Sen. Chuck Hagel, the Obama administration's nominee for secretary of defense, has been chastised for pointing out the obvious: The Pentagon's budget is bloated and ripe for reform. Examples of egregious waste and misplaced spending priorities at the Pentagon abound. One need look no further than the department's largest weapons program, the F-35 combat aircraft. Even before it has moved into full-scale production, the plane has already increased in price by 75%, and it has so far failed to meet basic performance standards. GOP legislators: Forced budget cuts a disaster for military . By the Pentagon's own admission, building and operating three versions of the F-35 -- one for the Air Force, one for the Navy and one for the Marines -- will cost more than $1.4 trillion over its lifetime, making it the most expensive weapons program ever undertaken. And in an era in which aerial combat is of diminishing importance and upgraded versions of current generation U.S. aircraft can more than do the job, it is not at all clear that we need to purchase more than 2,400 of these planes. Cutting the two most expensive versions of the F-35 will save over $60 billion in the next decade. As for the Navy, it is planning to invest $2.2 billion this year alone in the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), a system that has suffered serious performance problems ranging from cracking hulls to failures of the shipwide power system. In addition, the service maintains its attachment to building costly and unneeded ballistic missile submarines at up to $8 billion per boat, even as possessing thousands of nuclear weapons is increasingly irrelevant to our security. Scaling back these programs would save at least $25 billion over the next 10 years. Weapons spending isn't the only area in which smart savings are possible. Personnel costs are far too high. For example, the Army put out a memo this week bemoaning the fact that budget cuts at the level called for under the sequester would cost up to 300,000 jobs nationwide. But the Army's plea for the status quo ignores two key facts: Our domestic basing structure is larger than it should be, and we have more troops than we need in a world in which we will no longer focus on fighting large, boots-on-the-ground conflicts like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Cutting the Army by 100,000 troops beyond current plans would save $10 billion per year. On the civilian side of the ledger, there has been far too little attention paid to the Pentagon's over-reliance on private contractors to do everything from tote guns to review budgets. The Department of Defense currently spends more on private contractors than on all of its civilian and military personnel combined, and many of them perform redundant tasks that could be done more cheaply by government employees. Cutting the use of these contractors by 15%, as suggested by Taxpayers for Common Sense and the Project on Government Oversight, would save more than $350 billion over the next decade. The most outrageous fact of all is that the Pentagon can't even figure out how much of our money it is wasting. The department has never passed an audit, making it nearly impossible to root out corruption and avoid duplication of effort. Whipping the Pentagon's accounting system into shape would save untold billions for years to come. The budget cuts forced by sequestration may be a bad way to control spending, but there is no question that the Pentagon can reshape its budget to meet current challenges while saving hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer funds. The Pentagon and the armed services should spend more time looking for ways to impose spending discipline and less time trying to prop up their budgets at levels we don't need and can't afford.  And Congress should revise the law to give the military more freedom to spend funds where they are most needed.","Defense officials, Pentagon contractors warn budget cuts could decimate military .

"Singer Chris Brown admitted Friday to violating his probation by getting arrested in Washington -- an admission his lawyer hopes will gain his freedom soon. Brown, 25, wore an orange jail jumpsuit and handcuffs, but he appeared to be smiling as he was led into court in Los Angeles by deputies Friday afternoon. The singer has been in custody for two months and in court-ordered rehab five months before that while awaiting a probation revocation trial.  But with that trial on hold because of a delay in his D.C. assault case, Brown lawyer Mark Geragos decided it would be better to settle the case sooner and not later. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin immediately sentenced Brown to serve 365 days in jail for the admitted probation violation.  He was given credit for serving 234 days because of the rehab and jail time, leaving 131 days left to serve. But Brown's lawyer told CNN that he expects Brown to be released from custody by the county sheriff within the next week. ""I would expect that Chris should be out of jail before the weekend's up or before Monday,"" Geragos said after the hearing.  ""If he isn't out by Monday, then I would expect he's getting special treatment.  He's got over 230 days credit on a 365 (day sentence) and generally the sheriff is releasing on a lot less than that."" Brown's probation for the 2009 beating of ex-girlfriend Rihanna was revoked after his arrest in connection to a misdemeanor assault charge out of Washington . Friday's admission in Los Angeles that he violated his probation by committing a crime in Washington should lead to a quick resolution of the District of Columbia assault case, Geragos said. Brown still must complete about 700 hours of community labor at a rate of three days a week once he is released from jail.  Geragos, however, said Brown has ""enjoyed"" the work because it is ""at a facility that has allowed to him to kind of expand his horizons."" His probation office calculated that his probation, which began in August 2009, should end on January 23, 2015. Until then, he must attend several anger management and family counseling sessions each week and submit to random drug tests the judge said. Friday's resolution is a relief for Brown after languishing in jail for the past two months, his lawyer said. ""We're gratified that he was not sentenced to state prison, gratified that he's still on probation,"" Geragos said. ""I think that Chris has learned quite a bit through this experience and I'm anxious to see how he does, as I think everybody else is.""

"(CNN) -- As the fallout continues from the release of thousands of diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website, Turkey's prime minister is threatening to file a lawsuit over comments made about him in one of the messages by the U.S. ambassador to his country. Recep Tayyip Erdogan says he plans to sue over remarks from then-Ambassador Eric Edelman in 2004 suggesting that the prime minister concealed his wealth in Swiss bank accounts.  Visibly angry, Erdogan told an audience in Ankara, Turkey, Wednesday that he wanted the U.S. administration to take action against the diplomats who had ""slandered"" him. ""The United States should ask its diplomats to make an explanation because no diplomat can accuse a country with slanders and misinterpretations,"" he said. ""This is the United States' problem, not ours... Those who have slandered us will be crushed under these claims, will be finished and will disappear,"" Erdogan said later, according to Turkish media reports. In a cable dated December 12, 2004, the U.S. ambassador in Ankara at the time wrote a less-than-flattering profile of Erdogan, who had recently become prime minister amid anxiety among Western governments about his ""Islamist tendencies."" The note sent to Washington by Edelman said the new prime minister's ""hunger for power reveals itself in a sharp authoritarian style and deep distrust of others.""   Erdogan's advisors were characterized as ""sycophantic (but contemptuous)"" in the missive. The cable also spoke of the prime minister's ""susceptibility to Islamist theories."" ""He indulges in pronounced pro-Sunni prejudices and in emotional reactions that prevent the development of coherent, practical domestic or foreign policies,"" the cable added. CNN calls to Edelman for comment were not immediately returned. The cable then discussed the alleged bank accounts. While apparently offering no evidence they existed, it continued: ""We have heard from two contacts that Erdogan has eight accounts in Swiss banks; his explanations that his wealth comes from the wedding presents guests gave his son and that a Turkish businessman is paying the educational expenses of all four Erdogan children in the U.S. purely altruistically are lame."" Erdogan vowed to resign if it could be shown he had bank accounts in Switzerland. ""I don't have a God's penny in Swiss banks to prove.  Now, I am telling the leader of the opposition and others, if such a thing would be proven, I would not stay in this position, I would not remain a parliamentarian.""","Erdogan calls on the U.S. to take action against those who ""slandered"" him .

"Scores of people were killed and at least 123 others were wounded Wednesday in shootings and explosions across Iraq, senior Interior Ministry officials said. Five bombings in the Iraqi capital were responsible for dozens of the casualties, Baghdad police officials said. Three of the Baghdad bombings happened in the morning, killing at least 25 people near checkpoints for entry into the city's International Zone, a heavily fortified area that houses Iraqi government offices and the U.S. and British embassies. In the deadliest blast, a suicide bomber targeted a security checkpoint near the International Zone, Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Saad Maan Ibrahim said. Police officials said the bomber struck a restaurant that is frequented by Iraqis going into the International Zone, which is also called the Green Zone. The second blast occurred near the entrance to Iraq's Foreign Ministry building. Police and residents said a car bomb exploded in a parking lot opposite the building, and the Interior Ministry said it was a suicide bombing. The third explosion took place in the Al-Sanak area of Baghdad, one of the capital's main commercial areas. Police officials did not give a breakdown of how many people were killed and injured in each blast. Conflicting accounts have emerged, with initial reports from security sources indicating all three of the morning blasts were car bombings. In the evening, two car bombs exploded near a busy commercial area in southeastern Baghdad, killing at least 10 people and injuring 24 others, police said. And a roadside bomb and a car bomb exploded at a coffee shop and a restaurant in al-Dora in southern Baghdad. It killed four people and wounded 16 others, police officials told CNN. In southwestern Mosul, in northern Iraq, a car bomb exploded outside the Turkish consulate, wounding five Iraqi security forces at a checkpoint outside the consulate, two senior Interior Ministry officials said. In western Mosul, gunmen targeted Um al-Rabiein police station, the officials said. The attack started when a suicide bomber drove a bomb-rigged vehicle to the main checkpoint of the police station and exploded. That was followed by rocket-propelled grenade and small-arms fire, they said. At least five people were killed, four of them police officers, and 23 were wounded, 14 of them police. Also in western Mosul, a car bomb exploded at an Iraqi army convoy, killing three soldiers and wounding eight people, four of them soldiers, the officials said. The United Nations' special representative in Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov, condemned the violence. ""Those who orchestrate such attacks should be condemned by all political, religious and civic leaders in this country,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""Iraq political leaders should show national unity in dealing with such threats and unite against terrorism."" Iraq's Foreign Ministry has been targeted in the past. The worst attack was in August 2009, when it was hit by a suicide truck bomb and dozens of staff were killed and injured. Another government building, the Transport Ministry, was attacked by gunmen last week. The militants seized part of the building and took civil servants hostage before security forces drove them out. Also Wednesday, a car bombing in the northern city of Mosul killed two bodyguards of a member of Iraq's Parliament, police said. The blast happened outside the eastern Mosul house of Wisal Salim, a Sunni Muslim lawmaker. The United Nations said 2013 was the deadliest year in Iraq since 2008, with almost 8,000 people killed, most of them civilians. The figures remained grim in January. According to the U.N. mission in Iraq, 618 civilians and 115 members of the country's security forces were killed. The U.N. tally does not include those killed in a fresh wave of violence in Iraq's Anbar province, west of Baghdad, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraqi security forces have been fighting since the end of last year. The ongoing violence in Anbar, Salaheddin and Nineveh Sunni provinces has raised concerns among some observers that parliamentary elections scheduled for April 30 will be delayed.

"Freelance journalist James Foley was brutally killed yesterday after being held for 21 months by Islamic militants in Syria. Despite the increasing dangers of working in the region, despite the many journalists who have been kidnapped or are still missing, and despite dreading this news, it has taken us all by surprise and we are deeply, deeply shocked. Freelance journalists, photographers and video journalists have always played a vital role in newsgathering, and their contribution today is more important than ever. They make a crucial contribution to the free flow of information that is an essential part of a democratic society and fully deserve our support and protection. Our Trust works with freelancers on a daily basis -- helping them, helping their families, and sometimes working with them to help other freelancers. And James was one of these. We worked with him, helping him financially as he and his colleagues searched for missing colleagues in Syria. We stayed in touch. James' kidnap and death is yet another tragic reminder of the very real dangers facing journalists today. Over the past two years, around 70 journalists have been killed covering the conflict in Syria, and a further 20 journalists currently remain missing, including freelancer Austin Tice. The Committee to Protect Journalists say that the last two years have been the most dangerous for journalists on record, with 174 confirmed deaths since 2012. Not only this, but threats, intimidation, assaults and kidnappings are becoming every day challenges for journalists working around the world. Reuters columnist David Rohde writes: ""Syria today is the scene of the single largest wave of kidnappings in modern journalism, more than in Iraq during the 2000s or Lebanon during the 1980s."" These are terrible facts. So, what of the freelancers? Who negotiates for them? Who sends in security consultants to try and get them out? Who helps their families? Freelance journalists like James often work alone without the resources and support of large news organizations behind them -- they are always the most vulnerable to these dangers. The Rory Peck Trust has been supporting and assisting freelancers for almost two decades, and we've never seen a demand for our assistance like this before. It's not just freelancers travelling to conflict zones who are at risk. The majority of newsgatherers killed each year are journalists working in their own countries. Freelance photographers, fixers and camera operators covering and reporting on conflicts that are affecting their own communities are often the most vulnerable. They're unable to leave areas when it becomes too dangerous, or when their reporting is exposed, and are frequently threatened, attacked and accused of being traitors for working with international news organizations. Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors . So, how to protect freelancers? How to help them work securely? Our organization gives financial and other practical support to freelancers in trouble. We offer online resources on safety & security for those reporting from dangerous environments, and run a Training Fund that provides bursaries for freelancers to enable them to undergo hostile environments training before travelling to a conflict zone. This training can teach freelancers how to assess risk and spot danger, handle a crisis, support others and give vital first aid. The right training can save lives. Although our focus is specifically on freelancers, we are only one of the many organizations that exist to support journalists worldwide. Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders and IFJ all have security guides that can help freelancers be more prepared in situations of crisis. The International News Safety Institute offers up-to-date information about the security situation on the ground for journalists, and RISC offers vital first-aid training. There's no question that conflict journalism has always been a dangerous occupation -- and how very wrong that is! So when we talk about protection, when we talk about security, we are talking about every sector of the news industry, whether news employers, staff or freelancers. In this brutal new world, everyone must be prepared to take responsibility -- for themselves and for others. James Foley was a freelancer in the truest and most honorable sense -- a talented journalist and an exceptional human being.  Our thoughts are with his family at this tragic time, and with the families of all other journalists currently being held in Syria.","The Rory Peck Trust works with freelance journalists on a daily basis, including James Foley .

"The government of the small Mediterranean island of Malta recently announced proposals to start selling citizenship of its nation to foreigners for €650,000 (about $888,000). But faced with rising criticism both in Malta and other European Union countries, the Maltese government has temporarily halted the law's implementation and will review its requirements. The European Parliament is to hold a debate on the scheme on 15 January 2014. ""The citizenship scheme as adopted by the Maltese Parliament in recent weeks seems to be a clear abuse of EU citizenship and Schengen rules, said European People's Party chairman Joseph Daul. ""Even if the Maltese give in to reason, and drop this scheme, it remains important that the European Parliament debates this issue."" But Malta continues to defend the program, which is said to target affluent individuals in order to boost Malta's economy, but insists: ""It's not an over-the-counter sale of citizenships, said Kurt Farrugia, head of Communications for the Maltese government. ""Applicants have to go through a thorough due diligence screening process, he told CNN. ""We are still discussing the details and regulations and there might be amendments made, for example to the fee of €650,000,"" Farrugia said. The unique program, would give holders of this Maltese passport a tremendous amount of liberty. Unlike other similar programs in the European Union, applicants for program are not obliged to live in Malta before being granted a passport. Instead, if the application is successful and the applicant is wealthy enough to spare the large sum, he or she will get a  Maltese passport -- and therefore EU citizenship -- immediately. So, the applicant could theoretically live in any of the other 27 member states of the European Union. Malta joined the EU in 2004; it is a member of the Schengen borderless travel area, and has a visa waiver agreement with the United States -- all perks that would come with Maltese citizenship for foreigners. Maltese citizenship already allows a holder to travel to 163 countries across the globe without a visa. Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has predicted that the scheme will bring in more than $41 million (€30 million) annually, and help ease the country's deficit, while also attracting ""high value"" people who could potentially invest in the island. Henley & Partners, an international firm specializing in international immigration and citizenship law, will administer the initiative. ""Of course Malta is trying to raise capital with the program, but it is also opening its doors to a very beneficial segment of the world population, said Eric Major, the company's CEO. ""Many people conduct businesses abroad, but they are restricted by the passports they hold to do international travel,"" he added. The change of plan means people can register their interest in the scheme with Henley & Partners, but cannot officially apply until the Maltese government reveals its planned amendments. Once the law goes into effect, applicants will have to go through a 4-tier due diligence process. After filling out the application documents, the application is reviewed on online databases, this is followed by a background check and a risk assessment which examines the applicant's nationality, job sector and where he or she conducts business. Lastly the information is verified against government databases, including CIA, FBI and UK police files. Previous criminal convictions, misstating or fabricating information or issues with the applicant's source of wealth could all lead to an application being refused. In the best case scenario, Henley & Partners expects the whole process, from filing an application to getting a passport, to take about four to six months. ""Malta is taking many thorough steps in the vetting process,"" said Major. Major says he expected between 200 and 300 people a year to be willing to stump up the estimated $1.2 million (€850,000) cost of applying, once processing fees and other expenses are taken into account. Whether anything can be done to stop the program's implementation, still remains to be seen. The European Union said it could not interfere with citizenship decisions made by individual EU countries. ""Member states have full sovereignty to decide how and to whom they grant their nationality,"" said Tove Ernst, press officer for the European Commission. ""The European Court of Justice has on several occasions confirmed the principle of international law, that it is for each member state to lay down the conditions for the acquisition of its nationality,"" he said. Simon Busuttil, leader of Malta's opposition Nationalist Party, called the program's passage a ""black day for democracy."" Some critics also claim that the program favors the super-rich and provides a fast-track entry into the European Union, while foreigners with no financial means are excluded from the program. Neil Falzon, director of the aditus foundation, a Malta-based human rights NGO, said: ""Many people who desperately need to come to the EU simply cannot do it and the boat tragedies out at sea are witness to this,"" he said. ""We have men, women and children fleeing wars and persecution who are unable to obtain legal entry to the EU simply because no embassy will grant them an entry visa."" Several European Union countries offer residence permits that include free movement within the Schengen area, in exchange for high fees and the requirement to invest in the country, like Britain's Tier 1 investor scheme for non-EU citizens with £1 million ($1.6 million) or more of private funds available for investment in the UK. In contrast to other existing immigration programs, the Maltese version is an expedited citizenship program. ""The program is aimed at cash-rich but time-poor people. There is a growing breed of individuals who don't have the time to be in one country for more than four months, Major said, praising Malta's PM as ""a visionary who sees the benefits of globalization.""

"(CNN) -- By 2050, minorities will be the majority in America, and the number of residents older than 65 will more than double, according to projections released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau. The Census Bureau looks at 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality rates and migration. Minorities, classified as those of any race other than non-Hispanic, single-race whites, currently constitute about a third of the U.S. population, according to Census figures. But by 2042, they are projected to become the majority, making up more than half the population. By 2050, 54 percent of the population will be minorities. Minority children are projected to reach that milestone even sooner. By 2023, the bureau said, more than half of all children will be minorities. ""Part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups, Hispanics in particular,"" said Dave Waddington, chief of the Census Bureau's population projection branch, which issued the report. ""Those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age. Non-Hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older."" The projections are based on Census 2000 results and assumptions about future childbearing, mortality rates and net international migration, the bureau said. The group predicted to post the most dramatic gain is the Hispanic population. It is projected to nearly triple, from 46.7 million to 132.8 million, from 2008 through 2050, the bureau said. Its share of the total U.S. population is expected to double from 15 to 30 percent. ""Thus, one in three U.S. residents would be Hispanic,"" the Census Bureau said in a news release. The African-American population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050, going from 14 percent of the U.S. population to 15 percent. The Asian-American population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million, or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population. Among the remaining races, the bureau said, American Indians and Alaska natives are projected to increase from 3.9 million to 8.6 million, going from 1.6 percent to 2 percent of the U.S. population. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are expected to more than double, increasing from 1.1 to 2.6 million. In addition, the number of U.S. residents identifying themselves as being of two or more races is projected to more than triple, increasing to 16.2 million from its current 5.2 million, the Census Bureau said. Meanwhile, the non-Hispanic white population is not expected to post dramatic gains in the same period. By 2050, whites are expected to number 203.3 million, slightly increased from the 2008 number of 199.8 million. Whites will comprise 46 percent of the U.S. population by 2050, down from the current level of 66 percent, the bureau said, as the group is projected to lose population in the 2030s and 2040s. By 2030, all baby boomers will be age 65 and older -- comprising nearly 20 percent of U.S. residents, or one in five Americans, the bureau said. By 2050, the 65-and-older age group will increase to 88.5 million, more than doubling its current number of 38.7 million. Meanwhile, the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple, from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050. Non-Hispanic whites make up most of the baby boomers, Waddington said. ""They're in a higher mortality rate ... nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster"" instead of reproducing at the rate projected for minorities. Obviously, the projections will have ""very strong policy implications,"" he said -- medical care for an increasingly elderly population, for instance, educational needs for increasing numbers of minority children and economic effects for the labor force. ""Who's going to do the jobs that are characteristically held right now by certain types of people?"" Waddington said. ""All those things are subject to change."" The United States is projected to reach the 400 million population milestone in 2039, according to bureau projections. By 2050, the population is expected to be 439 million. Of those, 235.7 million are expected to be minorities. As U.S. cities and towns have increasingly become more diverse, Census officials knew the day of a majority minority would come, Waddington said. And ""the aging one is sort of simple,"" he added. ""That's demography 101."" Other highlights from the report released Thursday: . • By 2050, 62 percent of the nation's children will be minorities, up from 44 percent today. Of those, 39 percent are projected to be Hispanic, up from 22 percent in 2008, and 38 percent are projected to be white, down from 56 percent in 2008 . • The percentage of the U.S. population between the ages of 18 and 64 -- the ""working age"" population -- is projected to decrease to 57 percent in 2050 from 63 percent in 2008. • The working-age population will become more than 50 percent minority in 2039, and by 2050 will constitute 55 percent of the population. • By 2050, the working-age population will be more than 30 percent Hispanic, up from 15 percent in 2008; 15 percent African-American, up from 13 percent in 2008; and 9.6 percent Asian, up from 5.3 percent in 2008. Waddington said the timelines are not written in stone. ""It's a projection. And things like the baby boom generation couldn't be predicted."" Major changes in policy affecting families and children, or a major policy affecting immigration, could have an impact on the expectations, he said. The nation's undocumented workers -- estimated at 12 million or more -- are included in the projections, Waddington said. Census data includes all U.S. residents, regardless of their legal status, he said. CNN's Ashley Broughton contributed to this report.","Census: By 2050, 54 percent will be other than non-Hispanic, single-race whites .

"World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka plans to take a break from tennis following her shock fourth-round defeat at the French Open on Sunday. The 22-year-old, who lost 6-2 7-6 (7-4) to 15th seed Dominika Cibulkova, said she was jaded after the opening months of the season in which she won her first grand slam at the Australian Open and went on a 26-match winning streak. However, the Belorussian lost in finals in Stuttgart and Madrid before pulling out ahead of a second-round clash against the diminutive Cibulkova in Rome last month due to a shoulder injury. She will lose the top ranking if Rome champion Maria Sharapova can reach the final in Paris for the first time in her career. ""There has been a lot of tennis for me in the last five months,"" she said. ""I haven't been home in a while, and it's something that I need just to get rested mentally, definitely, and just to get out of the tennis field a little bit. ""And once I have my passion and desire back on the court, I'll be on the grass."" Paris goes to Beijing? The Li Na effect . Azarenka had previously lost to the Slovakian just once in eight meetings, but five of those had gone to three sets and two were remarkable comeback victories. She had to come from a set and 4-0 down in her opening match in Paris last Monday, but could not pull off an escape this time as she smashed two rackets in frustration. ""Today I couldn't do it. It was just not going for me. I tried everything. All I could hope for was her mistakes,"" Azarenka said. ""I think she plays much better against the top players than maybe a little bit lower-ranked players. She really has that desire. I don't know what motivates her to play that way."" Cibulkova reached the French Open semifinals in 2009, but said she was nervous she would again blow her advantage against Azarenka -- who stands nine inches taller at six foot. ""You can't be human if you weren't thinking about that,"" she said. ""Because this year in Miami I was 6-1 5-2 up against her. And last year in Miami it was the same. ""Today it happened the same when I was 4-2 up. And that's why I got a little bit ... not nervous, but not going for my shots anymore. ""But today it was a great thing that I managed to go through these emotions. She was 6-5 up, and I said, 'Hey, come on, you have to play your game again and just make it.' "" The 23-year-old will next face U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur of Australia, who beat 79th-ranked American teenager Sloane Stephens. Sixth seed Stosur, the French Open runner-up in 2010, ended the 19-year-old's dream run as she won 7-5 6-4 in 85 minutes. Stephens lost in the first round last year and has not won a match in three attempts at her home grand slam. Italy's Sara Errani earlier reached the quarterfinals after beating 2009 French Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. The 21st seed, who also made the last eight in Melbourne in January and has won three clay titles this season, won 6-0 7-5 to set up a clash with Angelique Kerber. The German 10th seed, who lost to Stosur in the New York semifinals in September in her best grand slam achievement, ended the hopes of 21-year-old Croatian Petra Martic as she won 6-3 7-5 on Court Suzanne Lenglen.","Top-ranked Victoria Azarenka beaten in last-16 clash by Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova .

"The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, left the door open Thursday to stepped-up U.S. military involvement in Iraq if ISIS militants pose a threat to the United States. In response to a question about what the U.S. end game is in Iraq, Dempsey began by saying the U.S. military's current role is much different from it was during the Iraq war. ""Assessing and advising and enabling are very different words than attacking, defeating and disrupting,"" he said during a briefing at the Pentagon in Washington. ""We may get to that point if our national interests drive us there, if (the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) becomes such a threat to the homeland that the President of the United States, with our advice, decides that we have to take direct action. I am just suggesting to you that we are not there yet."" Dempsey also disputed the use of the term ""mission creep"" in Iraq. ""That's the wrong phrase. The issue is mission match,"" he said. ""We will match the resources we apply with the authorities and responsibilities that go with them based on the mission we undertake, and that is to be determined."" Barzani: It's time for referendum on independence . Masoud Barzani, the President of Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region, told the regional parliament Thursday that it is time to hold a referendum on the independence of Kurdish areas. He said Kurds should no longer have to wait on anybody to obtain the right of independence and told the Kurdish parliament to begin taking steps to hold the referendum. Last week, Barzani announced that disputed areas, including Kirkuk, were henceforth part of the Kurdish autonomous region, after the Iraqi central government failed to hold a long-awaited referendum. Last month, the Iraqi army withdrew from Kirkuk, and Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of the city and small villages in the areas as ISIS carried out its lightning offensive. The move by the Kurds will probably complicate efforts to get Iraqi lawmakers to form a new government representing all three major population groups -- Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. Official: Nuns, orphans missing . Two nuns, who were thought to be under house arrest by ISIS militants, and three orphans have gone missing from an Assyrian Orthodox church in central Mosul, the governor of Nineveh province and witnesses told CNN on Thursday. Militants believed to be from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria initially barred the nuns from leaving Miskintah Church in the Khazraj neighborhood in early June, Gov. Atheel al-Nujaifi said. The two nuns manage an orphanage on the church grounds, and both are very well known to Mosul residents, the residents say. Residents in the neighborhood who were in touch with the nuns told CNN they had not been able to reach them on their cell phones since Tuesday. On Thursday, the residents forced their way into the church and said they could not find the nuns or three orphans. The two nuns were identified by the governor and the residents as Sister Hannah and Sister Uttor. Indian nurses being moved . Forty-six Indian nurses being held by ISIS in former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit are being moved north, to the city of Mosul, which is under control of the militant group, Syed Akbaruddin, the spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs, said Thursday at a news briefing. The news about the nurses follows reports that Iraqi security forces have been battling ISIS militants for control of the city, north of Baghdad, raising questions about whether ISIS is losing its grip on the area. MAPS: Understanding the crisis . Syed said his understanding is that the nurses have been moved for their own safety. ""All of them are safe and unharmed,"" he said. Asked whether the nurses were being held against their will, he said: ""In zones of conflict, there's no free will."" Turkish truck drivers released . Thirty-two Turkish truck drivers who went missing in early June in Mosul, when ISIS fighters swept through the city, have been released, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Thursday in a televised news conference carried by Turkish television stations. ""As a result of efforts and daily consultations for the past 23 days, now I am happy to say that our 32 drivers have been received by our consul general, and now our consul general is on the way to Irbil with the drivers,"" Davutoglu said. The drivers will then be flown to Ankara, Turkey, he said. There are still more than 40 staff members of the Turkish Consulate missing in Iraq, Davutoglu said. Efforts continue ""nonstop"" for their safe return, he said. Among those missing are special forces soldiers, diplomats and children, who were seized by ISIS militants on June 11. Baghdad bombings . A double bombing in Baghdad's predominantly Shiite neighborhood of al-Furhat left eight people dead and 17 wounded, police officials said early Thursday. The blasts late Wednesday night targeted people leaving the al-Mustafa mosque after evening prayers in the neighborhood, which sits just 2 miles from Baghdad International Airport, the officials said. More than 16 people have been arrested in connection with the attack, officials said. They did not say whether those arrested were believed to be militants tied to ISIS. Fighting in Karbala . Dozens were reportedly killed in days of fighting between Iraqi security forces and followers of a prominent Shiite cleric in the holy city of Karbala, south of Baghdad, authorities said Thursday. The fighting raises concerns about whether infighting could fracture Iraq's Shiite majority, potentially sparking further violence in a country already battling extremist Sunni militants. The battle began Tuesday when Iraqi troops raided the offices of prominent Shiite cleric Mahmoud al-Hassani al-Sarkhi, sparking a battle with the cleric's followers, they said. The raid came after the cleric's followers blocked roads in and around shrines in Karbala. Al-Sarkhi has been a fierce critic of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and the United States. Last week, he blamed some of the bloodshed on the country's top Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who called for Iraqis to take up arms against ISIS extremists. Helicopters fired a number of times on the Saif Saad neighborhood, not far from the city's famed holy shrines, on Tuesday night, an employee at a shrine and a resident of Karbala said. The aircraft again hovered over the area Wednesday, as the city was placed on high alert and the streets remained empty of civilians. Videos posted on YouTube purported to show a firefight between Iraqi forces and the cleric's followers, including one that showed an Iraq Humvee burning as gunfire is heard in the distance. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the videos. Fighting in Diyala, Salaheddin provinces . Iraqi security forces, with the help of volunteer fighters and Sunni tribesmen, were carrying out an offensive Thursday against ISIS fighters north of Baquba in Diyala province, security officials told CNN on Thursday. The towns of al-Dawaleeb and al-Shohani, about 35 kilometers (22 miles) north of Baghdad, have been cleared of militants, the officials said. They said a number of ISIS fighters were killed and wounded during the operation, which lasted 7 hours. The officials say a large number of bombs were planted in both towns by ISIS, and Iraqi forces were working to defuse them. Meanwhile, state-run Iraqi TV reported that a counterterrorism unit killed 88 extremists and destroyed 12 vehicles in Salaheddin province Thursday. It offered no evidence of the killings, and no further details were provided. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims.

"Sally Ride, the first American woman to fly in space, died Monday after a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer, her company said. She was 61. ""Sally lived her life to the fullest, with boundless energy, curiosity, intelligence, passion, commitment and love. Her integrity was absolute; her spirit was immeasurable; her approach to life was fearless,"" read a statement on the website of Sally Ride Science, a company she started to help teach students -- particularly young women and girls -- about science, math and technology. Share your tributes to Sally Ride . Ride flew into orbit aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1983 to become America's first woman in space. She took a second trip aboard the same shuttle one year later. The first woman in space was Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, who orbited the Earth 48 times in 1963. Memories of my space flight with Sally Ride . ""As the first American woman to travel into space, Sally was a national hero and a powerful role model,"" President Barack Obama said soon after news of her death broke. ""She inspired generations of young girls to reach for the stars and later fought tirelessly to help them get there by advocating for a greater focus on science and math in our schools. Sally's life showed us that there are no limits to what we can achieve, and I have no doubt that her legacy will endure for years to come."" Photos: 1983 Challenger launch . A Los Angeles native, Ride attended Stanford University, where she earned four degrees, including a doctorate in physics, according to NASA. She joined the agency as part of the class of 1978, the first to include women. Ride responded to an ad in the Stanford student newspaper and was selected from some 8,000 applicants. She was assigned to a third flight, but that was scratched after the Challenger exploded shortly after lift-off in 1986, claiming the lives of seven crew members on board. Ride helped investigate that accident and later that of Space Shuttle Columbia, becoming the only person to serve on the commissions investigating both accidents. In 2003, the Columbia disintegrated during re-entry into the atmosphere, killing all seven crew members. Tributes pour in for Sally Ride . She served as a special assistant to the NASA administrator for long-range and strategic planning and was the first director of NASA's Office of Exploration, according to her company. After leaving the agency, Ride joined the faculty at the University of California, San Diego, where she was a professor of physics and director of the California Space Institute. She was also the author of several books. 'Sally Ride inspired me to dream' During a 2008 interview with CNN, Ride recalled what it felt like to look back on Earth, saying the view gave her a new perspective. ""You can't get it just standing on the ground, with your feet firmly planted on Earth. You can only get it from space, and it's just remarkable how beautiful our planet is and how fragile it looks,"" she said. Ride is survived by her partner of 27 years, Tam O'Shaughnessy, her mother, her sister and other family members. Sally Ride opens a new frontier for others . ""Sally Ride broke barriers with grace and professionalism -- and literally changed the face of America's space program,"" said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. ""The nation has lost one of its finest leaders, teachers and explorers. Our thoughts and prayers are with Sally's family and the many she inspired. She will be missed, but her star will always shine brightly."" People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .

"Al Qaeda gunmen killed at least two people Monday, including a French employee of the European Union's mission to Yemen, in one of the latest acts of violence in the country's capital after the government's crackdown on the terror group, two high-level Yemeni government officials said. The attack shows that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is responding to a weeks-long government offensive with ""open warfare,"" an official said on condition of anonymity. ""AQAP is taking the battle to the capital,"" said the official, who was not authorized to speak to the media. There was conflicting information about the nationalities of those who were killed Monday. Three Yemeni Interior Ministry officials said two French nationals died and another French national was injured. But the two high-level sources said a French national and a Yemeni security officer were killed, and a foreigner of an unconfirmed nationality was injured. The victims were in a vehicle when gunmen blocked it and started shooting. The gunmen fired 20 bullets in the vehicle's direction before fleeing in a pickup, a senior Interior Ministry official said. The attack came more than two weeks after Yemen's government launched a military offensive against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and amid an uptick in violence in the capital. Since Sunday, two military officers have been assassinated in Sanaa, authorities said. Al Qaeda ""had threatened they would target government targets and foreign targets in the capital,"" the anonymous official said. ""This military campaign has opened a Pandora's box, and things will only get worse, but it had to happen,"" the official continued. ""This is a decisive battle, and either we win or they win."" The crackdown killed more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen from April 19 to April 21, Yemeni officials have said. Twelve more were killed Thursday, according to a high-level Yemeni government official. Operations have included attacks by Yemeni commandos and suspected U.S. drone strikes, according to a Yemeni official. U.S. Special Operations troops have played a role in the offensive, in part by flying Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot in southern Yemen. But no Americans took part in combat, a U.S. official has said. After Monday's shooting, authorities set up checkpoints on roads leading to the building that houses the European Union mission to Yemen. The French Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Reza Taghavi, an Iranian-American detained for more than two years in Iran, returned to the United States Thursday evening. The retired businessman from Orange County, California, was released Saturday. He had been held in Iran's notorious Evin prison since May 2008 on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group. Taghavi's lawyer, Pierre-Richard Prosper, had been negotiating Taghavi's release since September 2009. Saturday's release was the product of three trips to Iran, meetings with Iranian officials in New York and Europe, and close to 300 e-mails with Iranian officials, he said. Taghavi, 71, traveled frequently to Iran to visit family and friends without incident, according to Prosper. In April 2008, Taghavi went to Tehran with his wife. Before he left, he was asked by an acquaintance in Los Angeles named Imran Afar to take $200 for a friend in Tehran ""who was down on his luck,"" Prosper said. Los Angeles has a large Persian community. Taghavi did not know the individual to whom he was asked to deliver the money, Prosper said. He handed it over and two weeks later was detained by Iranian authorities, after the recipient of the money was arrested on charges of association with an anti-regime group called Tondar. Prosper said Afar provided him with information he shared with the Iranian government that proved that Taghavi was not part of Tondar, which seeks to restore the monarchy in Iran. The group claimed responsibility for the April 12, 2008, bombing of the Hosseynieh Seyed al-Shohada mosque in the city of Shiraz. ""This is the product of fourteen months of nonstop negotiations with the Iranian government and authorities,"" Prosper said Saturday. ""They finally got to the point where they realized he was used by this organization and he does not pose a threat to them."" Prosper said Taghavi's case has thus far been ""suspended,"" but that he hopes after working out ""some final details"" with Iranian authorities, the case will be dismissed outright. Although Taghavi continues to maintain his innocence, Prosper said a condition of his release was that he travel to Shiraz before leaving the country to visit the sight of the mosque bombing and to meet with a survivors' group. Taghavi also agreed to share the story of the circumstances of how he was taken advantage of by Tondar. ""He is more than happy to that, as he feels aggrieved"" by the group, Prosper said. Taghavi's is a rag-to-riches story, his 36-year-old daughter, Leila Taghavi, told CNN in March. He brought his family to the United States in 1979, before the Iranian Revolution, and stayed on in California to keep his family safe. Leila Taghavi said her father taught himself English, started a video game company in his garage and grew it into a successful corporation, which he handed over to his son when he retired 10 years ago. ""His life was the American dream,"" Leila said. ""He learned everything the hard way, sacrificed for his children and taught us to be grateful for the good things. He is wonderful, honest and generous, the kind of father every daughter would want."" The family was silent for more than a year about his arrest, fearful that speaking out would politicize the case in Tehran and Washington. ""It was blind faith, really,"" Leila said, explaining the silence. ""Not knowing it would take this long, and fear of the system. There was never a doubt of his innocence."" In September 2009, with no movement on the case and losing hope he would be released, the family hired Prosper to contact the State Department and initiate a dialogue with the Iranian government. The United States and Iran do not have formal relations, and Switzerland serves as the ""protecting power"" for the U.S. in Tehran. Prosper, who served as the ambassador-at-large for war crimes under the Bush administration and as a prosecutor for the Rwanda tribunal at the Hague, said he kept the State Department informed about the case, but did not ask for U.S. intervention out of fear Taghavi would become a political pawn by Iran in its standoff with the United States over Tehran's nuclear program. ""It was a conscious decision not to engage them in the effort,"" he said. He added that political upheaval in Iran after 2009's disputed presidential election and the government's subsequent violent crackdown on demonstrators complicated his efforts. Other Americans remain in prison in Iran. American hikers Josh Fattal, Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd were detained in Iran on July 31, 2009. According to their families, they accidentally strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while on a hiking trip in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Shourd was released last month, while Bauer and Fattal are still being held on espionage charges. Kian Tajbakhsh, an Iranian-American scholar who spent four months in jail in 2007, was arrested in July after the disputed presidential election and sentenced to 15 years in jail for spying. An appeals court later reduced his sentence to five years. The United States has no information about Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran almost three years ago. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Retired businessman Reza Taghavi was released Saturday, his lawyer says .

"China has told the United States to butt out of a territorial dispute with Japan in the East China Sea after Washington warned that a military claim by Beijing to airspace in the region raises the risk of ""misunderstanding and miscalculations."" The creation of an ""Air Defense Identification Zone"" by China comes amid increasing tensions between Beijing and Tokyo over competing claims to disputed islands in the sea, which are believed to be situated near large reserves of natural resources. China's announcement Saturday of the zone, which it described as an early-warning system for self-defense, drew a swift response from the United States, Japan's closest military ally. Washington warned that the latest Chinese move creates the risk of potentially dangerous miscalculations in the sensitive region, where Chinese and Japanese ships and planes have already been involved in tense encounters. ""This unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea. Escalatory action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. ""We have urged China to exercise caution and restraint, and we are consulting with Japan and other affected parties throughout the region,"" Kerry said. The United States has thousands of troops stationed in Japan as part of a security treaty between the two allies. 'Inappropriate remarks' But Chinese officials dismissed the U.S. comments as unjustified interference. American criticism of the air zone announcement is ""completely unreasonable,"" Col. Yang Yujun, a Ministry of National Defense spokesman, said Sunday. The United States should stop taking sides on the issue, cease making ""inappropriate remarks"" and not send any more ""wrong signals"" that could lead to a ""risky move by Japan,"" he said. Beijing demands that the United States respect Chinese national security, stop making ""irresponsible remarks"" about the air defense identification zone and make ""concrete efforts"" for peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, Yang said. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had lodged a representation with U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke asking the United States ""to correct its mistakes immediately."" Dispute escalates . The dispute over the islands -- known as the Senkaku Islands by Japan and the Diaoyu Islands by China -- has strained relations between the two East Asian countries. The islands are close to strategically important shipping lanes and their surrounding waters are full of rich marine life. The Chinese defense ministry said the new air zone was not directed toward a specific country. But it released a map and coordinates that show the zone covers most of the East China Sea, as well as the islands. It declared that aircraft in the area must report their flight plans to China, maintain two-way radio and clearly mark their nationalities on the aircraft. And it warned that its armed forces ""will adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions."" China's declaration is ""definitely a net escalation in the dispute"" with Japan, said Stephanie Kleine-Ahlbrandt, director of Asia-Pacific programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace. ""It makes it more likely that jets will be scrambled,"" she said. ""An aerial encounter carries a much higher risk because of the faster timings involved"" than in a maritime encounter. 'Profoundly dangerous' Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday he is ""extremely concerned"" about the Chinese announcement. ""It unilaterally changes the status quo in the East China Sea and escalates the situation,"" Abe said. ""It is a profoundly dangerous act that may cause unintended consequences in the area."" Tokyo ""cannot accept at all"" that the Chinese air zone claim includes the disputed islands, which Japan considers ""an inherent part"" of its territory, a Japanese foreign ministry statement said. The Japanese government said has made ""strong protests"" to Beijing, summoning the Chinese ambassador to the foreign ministry. Chinese officials appeared unimpressed by the Japanese complaints. Tokyo's remarks are ""utterly groundless and China won't accept them,"" Yang said, observing that Japan had set up its own air defense identification zone in the 1960s. He reiterated Beijing's claim to the disputed islands and said its determination to ensure sovereignty over them was ""unwavering."" Defense ministry officials have made ""solemn representations"" on the matter to the Japanese Embassy in China, he said. The South Korean government also expressed regret Sunday over the Chinese announcement, saying the new air defense zone partially overlaps with its territory, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. 'Misunderstanding and miscalculations' The Chinese defense ministry has said it began patrols of the air zone on Saturday. Japan's defense ministry said two Chinese planes came within miles of its airspace, prompting authorities to scramble Japanese fighter jets. It's the second time this month that Japan has launched fighter jets, alleging Chinese planes appeared to be closing in on its air space. U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called the move by China an attempt to destabilize the status quo in the region, saying it ""increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations."" ""This announcement by the People's Republic of China will not in any way change how the United States conducts military operations in the region,"" Hagel said. U.S. and Japanese forces are due to hold joint naval exercises this week off Okinawa -- a few hundred kilometers from the disputed islands. Competing claims . The long-running disagreement over who owns the islands intensified between Japan and China in the second half of 2012. Protests erupted in China after Japan announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private Japanese owners. The deal was struck in part to prevent the islands from being bought by the controversial Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara, who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them. China was outraged, as were groups of its citizens who protested violently in several Chinese cities, calling for boycotts of Japanese products and urging the government to give the islands back. In December 2012, the dispute escalated further when Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese plane was seen near the islands. That situation has recurred repeatedly since, and China's latest announcement makes it likely it will keep happening. At sea, Chinese ships have frequently entered contested waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard. China says its claim extends back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province, also lays claim to the islands.

"(CNN) -- For the group calling itself FreeZimActivists it is back to the drawing board after its planned protest against President Robert Mugabe's rule in the style of Egypt and Tunisia flopped in Zimbabwe. The group launched an internet campaign for the so-called Zimbabwe Million Citizen March apparently planned for Tuesday to protest the 31-year reign of Mugabe. But at the Harare Gardens park which would have been Zimbabwe's Tahir Square it was peaceful and generally empty on Tuesday. In fact, all the streets of Harare were largely empty and peaceful, apparently over people's fears of being caught up in any protest which might be crushed violently by government allied forces. Zimbabwe's state media made no reference to the planned demonstration that was supposed to be similar to ones that toppled the long-serving leaders of Tunisia and Egypt last month and caused similar demonstrations throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi is battling to retain his 41-year-old dictatorship in the wake of demonstrations in that country. Armoured cars carrying riot police and water cannon vehicles have been seen shuttling through Harare since weekend when news of the planned protests filtered through. Political analyst John Makumbe said the organisers might have announced the date to test the state's preparedness.""I am sure it will happen. When it happens, the state structure will be caught napping,"" said the University of Zimbabwe political scientist. ""Given the way the state responded by bringing out its toys (armoured cars and police) you can tell that it was not going to make it easy for the protests."" One activist said the planning team and the protesters in Zimbabwe might have backed off reacting to the riot police patrolling the streets of Harare.""There is need to avoid all the information getting into the hands of those opposed to the cause if the protests are to be anything as what happened in Egypt or Tunisia,"" he said. The campaigns in Egypt and Tunisia were organised on Facebook and Twitter. Last week, Zimbabwe authorities charged 46 people with treason. The group was arrested after authorities said they were caught watching footage of the protests that led to the ouster of Tunisian leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia in January and of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in February. ""On 16 February they held a meeting and the purpose of the meeting was to organise, strategize and implement the removal of a constitutional government of Zimbabwe by unconstitutional means, the Tunisian-Egyptian way,"" prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba said in court on Thursday. At least 12 of the 46 activists were beaten with broomsticks on their buttocks and the soles of their feet, defense attorney Alec Muchadehama told a packed courtroom on Thursday. The charge carries a death sentence in Zimbabwe.","FreeZimActivists apparently planned Zimbabwe Million Citizen March for Tuesday .

"A provincial council candidate and nine of his supporters were killed by the Taliban in Afghanistan two days after they were kidnapped, said Sakhidad Haidari, deputy police chief of northern Sar-e-Pul province. The 10 were kidnapped Sunday and shot dead Tuesday night, Haidari told CNN on Wednesday. The bodies of four of those killed, including the Sar-e-Pul election candidate, Hussain Nazari, have been returned to police, he said. The other six remain in the hands of the Taliban. The Taliban have not commented on the incident, which comes ahead of presidential and provincial elections to be held Saturday. In a separate incident Wednesday, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate to the Interior Ministry in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing six Afghan police officers, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. The bomber, who was seeking to enter the ministry, triggered his explosive vest when he was identified by police, Sediqqi said. The Taliban have claimed responsibility for that attack. Taliban vow to disrupt vote . The violence is the latest to rock Afghanistan in the run-up to the April 5 vote. There are 11 candidates in the presidential race, with the three main contenders thought to be Abdullah Abdullah, who also ran in the 2009 election, Ashraf Ghani and Zalmai Rassoul. Outgoing President Hamid Karzai cannot run again because of term limits. The Taliban have vowed to disrupt the elections and punish anyone involved in them. But NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, speaking Wednesday in Belgium, said that the latest briefings from NATO commanders show that despite the Taliban's threats, overall violence across Afghanistan ""is lower now than at any time during the last two years."" Rasmussen praised the work of Afghan security forces, which have taken over many responsibilities from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, saying they had ""demonstrated commitment, courage and professionalism"" during preparations for the elections. ""As expected, we have seen a series of attacks including on Kabul today -- an attack which I strongly condemn -- but I welcome that the Afghan people have resisted these intimidation attempts,"" he said. He said the country was now looking forward to ""historic elections"" that would shape its future. ""My message to the women and men of Afghanistan is clear: Go to polls, exercise your democratic rights. Only you have the right to decide your country's future,"" he said. Rasmussen said any alleged electoral violations must be investigated swiftly to ensure the elections are credible to all Afghans. He added that  Afghan citizens are registering to vote in ""quite high"" numbers, despite the Taliban's efforts to disrupt proceedings. Insurgent attacks . On Saturday, Taliban insurgents attacked Afghanistan's election commission headquarters in Kabul, staff and a government official said. The five assailants were killed, and two people were injured. A day earlier, five militants set off a car bomb at a guesthouse used by foreigners and then held people as hostages until police killed one of the militants and the other four blew themselves up. A girl was killed in the attack. On Tuesday, militants stormed an election commission office in Kabul, leading to a five-hour gun battle with Afghan security services. Five people were killed -- two police officers, two election commission workers and a provincial council candidate. The Taliban claimed responsibility for all three of those attacks.","NATO chief praises work of Afghan security forces, says overall violence has fallen .

"Despite repeated police efforts to disperse them, thousands held a sit-in for a third consecutive night in the city's main commercial district to protest a government-backed shopping center project. Police deployed tear gas earlier Thursday at Taksim Gezi Park. They also removed tents and sleeping bags used by protesters, who are trying to prevent bulldozers from entering the park to take down trees. Demonstrators disapprove of plans to rebuild old Ottoman barracks and create a shopping arcade. They are organizing over Facebook and Twitter and by Thursday night the number of people in the park was in the thousands. Their protest has turned into an informal referendum on recent Turkish government policies. ""I saw it on TV last night, saw that there were people, young people taking ownership of the environment. I wanted to support them, because I think not supporting them is inhumane,"" said Adalet Makar, a retired banker who spent Wednesday night at the park in her sleeping bag. The demonstration has grown in number since late Monday. Public outcry over the proposed project, as well as two police interventions against the demonstrators with tear gas, has drawn more people to the park. ""Gas, gas, gas, it is the only way they deal with problems,"" said Esen Tuna, a 21-year-old architectural student. Turkish police routinely use tear gas and water cannons to break up demonstrations. The government led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made it clear that it will go ahead with the planned project. ""They can do whatever they want. We've made our decision and we will do as we have decided,"" said Erdogan on Wednesday, according to the semi-official Anadolu Agency. Erdogan said that the rebuilding of the Ottoman barracks was a matter of having ""respect for history."" Critics disagree, arguing that the project is a way for making profit from the sale of valuable real estate in Istanbul's main commercial district. ""This cannot be explained by saying this is historical conservation, It is not that, it is about money,"" said Ece Demirel, an activist with the Urban Movement Forum, an organization that tracks development projects across Turkey. The government's other controversial policies have also come under fire. Erdogan's policy on Syria, which many in Turkey blame for a twin car blast that killed at least 52, as well as a new law that would prohibit vendors from selling liquor from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., are part of the sit-in at Taksim Gezi Park. Demonstrators have chanted, ""this is only the beginning, our struggle will continue."" Many at the park said they believe this may be the beginning of a turning point in Turkey. ""This is an uprising, a protest against the increasing bans,"" said Michelle Demishevich, an activist and member of Turkey's Green Party. ""Perhaps just like we saw the Arab Spring, this will be the Turkish Spring.""","Demonstrators oppose shopping center in Istanbul .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Britain's decision to expel Moammar Gadhafi's diplomats from London ensures that the bloody test of wills in Libya will grind on for weeks, if not months to come. Barely 15 days ago, there was optimism from regime insiders here in Tripoli that a deal was in the works to resolve the five-month conflict. Perhaps this was because the Muslim holy month of Ramadan was fast approaching, and with it, an anticipated slow-down in fighting on the front-lines. Also, the regime was engaged in talks on multiple fronts with its European, American, and Libyan opponents. Developments over the last two weeks appear to have killed those hopes. First, the United States joined the growing list of countries officially declaring the rebel council based in Benghazi the ""legitimate governing authority for Libya."" A day after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made the announcement in Istanbul, Turkey, the message was personally delivered during a round of secret talks in Tunisia. The Americans said they had one message for the Libyans, ""Gadhafi must go."" At roughly the same time, the Benghazi-based rebels mounted an attack on the eastern front, against the long-contested oil town of al-Brega. Gadhafi's main spokesman accused the NATO military alliance of assisting rebels in the assault. He also drew a rhetorical line in the sand around al-Brega, declaring dramatically, ""We will kill, we will die for oil. You come to get our oil, we will destroy you."" Since then, the rebel advance on al-Brega has slowed, reportedly due to deadly fields of land mines. The rebels admit hundreds of their fighters were killed and wounded during a week of fighting around al-Brega, which Ibrahim grandiloquently re-branded ""Libya's Stalingrad."" Meanwhile, the Tripoli regime has been staging large rallies in support of its embattled leader. Enthusiastic, flag-waving crowds thronged the central squares of different regime-controlled towns and cities. Partisans swore allegiance to Gadhafi and defiantly fired volleys of gunfire in the air. State TV provided blanket coverage of the events, labeling them ""million man marches."" The size of the rallies has been the subject of heated debate between foreign journalists and government officials. But there is no question that Tripoli has been shoring up popular support for the man who has ruled this country for more than 40 years. Government officials argue that the rallies prove Gadhafi is the democratic choice of the Libyan people, a position that the rebels have fought and bled to refute. Therein lies the main sticking point. The regime insists cease-fire first, then talks, while also adding that Gadhafi's position as ""Brother Leader"" is non-negotiable. Benghazi and NATO say no talks until Gadhafi goes. In recent days, both the rebels and officials in Paris, London and Washington softened their demands. They indicated one possible way out of the stalemate could include Gadhafi remaining in Libya, rather than going into exile. But Wednesday's announcement by Britain's top diplomat marked yet another escalation against Gadhafi and his cohorts. William Hague announced he would hand over Tripoli's embassy -- as well as some of its frozen funds -- to the rebels in Benghazi. Gadhafi has never been this internationally isolated, even in the dark days of the eighties when Ronald Reagan famously labeled him ""mad dog of the middle east."" Turkey and even Germany, which abstained from the U.N. resolution authorizing the NATO operation in Libya, have both pledged to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars worth of regime assets to the rebels. Even tiny Malta, long described as the ""gateway to Libya,"" has all but broken with the Tripoli regime. This week, the United Nations special envoy to Libya seemed to kill all hope for peace. After yet another round of shuttle diplomacy between the rebels and the regime, Abdul Ilah al-Khatib offered this grim assessment: ""Both sides remain far apart on reaching agreement on a political solution."" A senior Muslim cleric told CNN that in the month to come, loyalist soldiers could break their daily Ramadan to better fight against what the regime calls ""the colonialist, crusader aggression."" Ramadan begins in just a few days. Expect Libya's holy month to be a bloody one.","There was optimism recently from regime insiders in Tripoli that a deal was in the works .

"North Korea has arrested a U.S. citizen for committing an unspecified crime against the country, state media reported Friday, 10 days after U.S. officials said an American had been detained by the reclusive nation. Bae Jun Ho entered North Korea on November 3 to carry out a tour, the country's official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, reported. He was detained and evidence was uncovered proving that he had committed a crime against the country, the news agency said. The American then confessed to the offense, it said, and faces legal action. A U.S. official told CNN last week that an American citizen named Kenneth Bae had been detained in North Korea for more than a month. The U.S. official said Bae had made several trips to North Korea previously, and that he was not believed to have been mistreated in detention. Neither Washington nor Seoul has yet confirmed that Bae is the same man referred to by North Korean state media. His detention was first reported by South Korean newspapers, which said that Bae, a tour operator, entered North Korea at the port city of Rajin accompanied by five other tourists. Bae and the group were on a five-day trip to the country, according to South Korea's Yonhap News. One of the tour members was carrying a computer hard disk ""that apparently contained sensitive information,"" Yonhap News reported, citing a Korean-language paper. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said last week that the United States was aware of the reports of Bae's detention, but that it would not discuss the issue further because of privacy issues. ""We obviously have no higher priority than the welfare of our citizens. As you may know we have no representation in Pyongyang. The Embassy of Sweden acts as our protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea,"" Nuland said then. Consular officials from the Swedish Embassy visited Bae on Friday, KCNA said. The United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations.","U.S. officials said last week that an American had been detained in North Korea .

"(CNN)A black man who was physically stopped from getting on the Paris metro by soccer fans says they should be ""locked up"" and that he intends to make a complaint. Filmed on a mobile phone by a bystander waiting on the platform of Richelieu-Drouot station, the incident took place before a Champions League tie between English club Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday. The group, who appear to be Chelsea supporters, can be heard chanting: ""We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it."" The French newspaper Le Parisien has tracked down the metro passenger at the center of the incident, identifying him only as Souleymane S, a father-of-three who was born in Paris. ""What happened should not go unpunished,"" he told Le Parisien. ""These people, these English supporters, should be found, punished and should be locked up. ""Having talked about it now gives me the courage to go to the police with a complaint. In any case, I intend to go to anti racism associations."" On his way home from his work as a chief operating officer in business near the metro station, Souleymane S says he was not surprised to find himself a victim of an apparent racist incident. ""They said things to me in English but I didn't really understand the meaning of what they said,"" he explained to Le Parisien. ""I don't speak a word of English. ""I understood that Chelsea supporters were involved and I made the link with the PSG match. ""I also understood that they were attacking me because of the color of my skin. ""You know, I live with racism, I wasn't really surprised by what happened to me, even if it was the first time in the metro. ""I stayed for a long time in front of them. One person came to say that I had been brave to resist people like that. ""No (metro) user took up my defense but, in any case, what could one do?"" While the metro moved out of the Richelieu-Drouot station with the Chelsea fans on board, Souleymane S waited to catch the next train and went home. The 33-year-old said he did not tell anyone about what happened, even though he realized he had lost his phone during the scramble with the soccer supporters. He did not know the altercation had been filmed by British expatriate Paul Nolan, who broke the story by sending the video to British newspaper The Guardian, which then posted it on its website. ""I returned home without telling anyone about what had happened, not my wife nor my children,"" said Souleymane S told le Parisien. ""What would I say to my children? That papa was shoved in the metro because he was black? That's useless."" Souleymane S may have been unaware of the ramifications of the incident but it has acted as a catalyst to more soul searching about soccer's seeming inability to root out racism in the global game. Chelsea has vowed to support any criminal action brought against its fans involved in the Paris altercation. ""Such behavior is abhorrent and has no place in football or society,"" the English Premier League club said in a statement released Wednesday. ""We will support any criminal action against those involved in such behavior, and should evidence point to the involvement of Chelsea season ticket holders or members the club will take the strongest possible action against them including banning orders."" Both French and British police have said they will analyze the footage. UEFA, the body which governs European football, said it was appalled by the footage, but as it occurred outside of the stadium it could not take any punitive action. Sepp Blatter, the president of football's global governing body FIFA, also took to Twitter to register his disapproval. ""I also condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans in Paris,"" tweeted Blatter. ""There is no place for racism in football!"" Queens Park Rangers boss Chris Ramsey -- the only black manager in the English Premier League -- was asked to comment on the incident in Paris during his media conference, Thursday. ""I don't believe they are Chelsea fans or fans of football,"" said Ramsey. ""I believe they are acting in a manner which we all think is a thing of the past. ""Those views are intrinsic in everyday life. I've been saying for a long time these are social issues which manifest themselves in the football world. ""It would be good to see what the authorities are going to do to either weed these people out, what sanctions they're going to enforce, to try to make this an avoidable situation in the future."" This is not the first racism allegation to be leveled against London club Chelsea in recent times. In 2012, team captain John Terry was banned for four matches and fined $356,000 for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. Terry was, however, found not guilty of any criminal wrongdoing at Westminster Magistrates' Court in July of the same year. Former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand, the brother of Anton Ferdinand, questioned whether football has the power to eradicate racism. ""The racist scene on the metro with the Chelsea fans - disgraceful behavior obviously. But can football change this? Does it have the power?"" he wrote on Twitter, Thursday. ""Football has come a long way since the 70's & 80's but are we all guilty of becoming a bit complacent? ""Football has done a lot over the years to combat racism..but society has to do more to make change or is there too much hatred in society?""

"Three matches and three comfortable wins. Rafael Nadal has made the perfect start to his bid for a record seventh French Open title, but the Spaniard will not face his first serious test until the clay-court grand slam enters its second week. The two-time defending champion will next play Juan Monaco in the last 16, having crushed one of the Argentine 13th seed's lesser-rated compatriots Eduardo Schwank 6-1 6-3 6-4 in the third round on Saturday. ""I have started well in the tournament -- into the second week now, that is the  most important thing,"" Nadal told reporters. ""Now I have a big confrontation against Monaco. He is having a fantastic  season."" Monaco has never gone past round four in a grand slam, but like Nadal he is adept on clay -- having won five ATP Tour titles and reached seven other finals on the dirt surface. Chinese fans track Li's Paris progress . Monaco has won only once in their four meetings, when Nadal retired hurt during a hard-court event in 2007, but he showed his mettle against big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic on Saturday as he came from behind to triumph 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 6-7 (5-7)  6-3 6-4. Nadal has lost only once at Roland Garros since his first appearance in Paris in 2005, when he began a run of four successive French Open titles, while Monaco's best effort is a fourth-round defeat in 2007. If he wins, Nadal will then take on his 12th-seeded compatriot Nicolas Almagro or Serbia's world No. 8 Janko Tipsarevic in the quarterfinals. The 10-time grand slam champion could face a semifinal against world No. 4 Andy Murray, who showed no sign of his worrying back problems on Saturday as he set up a last-16 clash with French 17th seed Richard Gasquet. ""I felt like I moved pretty well today. When you're playing in slams, I just think each day you need to take as it comes. And I felt much better than I did the other day. I felt better than I did yesterday,"" Murray said after beating Colombia's 50th-ranked Santiago Giraldo 6-3 6-4 6-4. ""So I'm hoping that tomorrow I'll feel good again, and that's all you've got to do is each day just be a little bit better."" Murray had been accused of being a ""drama queen"" by former tennis star Virginia Wade after receiving lengthy on-court treatment during an earlier match against Jarkko Nieminen, but revealed he had refused pain-killing injections to counter the back pain he has been suffering since the start of this year. ""Guys often during tournaments have numbing shots, if they're just trying to get through a match and are deep in a tournament or whatever,"" the Scot said. ""But I didn't do that. We got a lot of advice, I saw the doctor here and spoke to him as well, and took all the right medication and did all the right treatments."" Gasquet fought back from a slow start to defeat former world No. 2 Tommy Haas 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-0 6-0. The 34-year-old German, now ranked 112th, capitulated as he lost the last 14 games of the match. ""I knew that he had not played long matches in a while. There were quite a lot of people out there, so I really wanted to win this match, to give everything I could,"" said Gasquet, who lost in the fourth round last year and beat Murray in Rome in April to level their head-to-head record at 3-3. ""It was a beautiful match, and I played really well during the third and fourth sets."" The winner of the Murray-Gasquet match is likely to face world No. 5 David Ferrer in the last eight. The Spaniard thrashed Russian 27th seed Mikhail Youzhny 6-0 6-2 6-2 to set up a clash with compatriot Marcel Granollers, who beat a tired Paul-Henri Mathieu. The Frenchman overcame American John Isner in the second-longest match in French Open history in the previous round, which lasted five hours 41 minutes, but he could not repeat the effort as he went down in another five-setter 6-4 6-4 1-6 4-6  6-1.","Six-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal through to the last 16 in Paris .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- If anything were to go seriously wrong at Tuesday's inauguration of Barack Obama, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff is the man who would manage the crisis response. He is trying to make sure everything goes right. Barack Obama's visit to Baltimore, Maryland, on Saturday offered a taste of Tuesday's tight security. ""I don't anticipate anything disruptive. Part of my job is to hope for the best and plan for the worst,"" Chertoff said during a final tour of key sites across Washington. CNN exclusively accompanied Chertoff on the tour. Chertoff said authorities are not aware of any credible threat to the inauguration. ""We are constantly scrubbing and rescrubbing intelligence to see if there is a threat that we should be concerned about. And that is going to continue, frankly, through the inauguration itself,"" he said. ""We are literally going to be watching this every minute between now and the conclusion of events on the 20th."" It is difficult to detect individuals or small groups intent on causing trouble, and Chertoff is most worried about them. ""I am still focused on the kind of event we had at Virginia Tech: one disturbed person kills a bunch of people. So whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder ... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage,"" he said. Chertoff's first stop was the multi-agency command center from which he will monitor inaugural events. This is the security nerve center for the inauguration, with representatives of federal, state and local agencies that will help secure the swearing-in, the parade, the balls and other special events. ""Everyone has a common picture of what is going on,"" Chertoff said. ""If something arises, we know who has the ball. We know who plays a supporting role. If an issue that is not anticipated comes up, we are in the room; we can figure out what do; we can make a decision."" Chertoff also took a swing by the U.S. Capitol, where Obama will be sworn in. The west side of the Capitol gives a panoramic view of the National Mall, where crowds will assemble to watch Tuesday's events. Chertoff said it was useful to see the setting firsthand. ""You get a sense of the physical layout. You may get an idea of where the potential congestion areas or challenges are in terms of managing that large crowd,"" he said. The presidential reviewing stand was still under construction in front of the White House. This is where Obama will view the parade in his honor. In the biting cold, Chertoff got a quick tour and received a briefing from the United States Secret Service. Turning up his, Chertoff expressed concern that the public will not plan and prepare for the weather, which is forecast to remain frigid. ""The worst thing in the world would be for someone to come dressed like he is going to go to Bermuda, with no food or water or place to stay."" Critics have accused inauguration organizers of engaging in security overkill, but Chertoff said he has tried to strike a balance. ""You don't want to make this like an armed camp, because it spoils the event itself. At the same time, you want to have enough capacity so you can deal with any foreseeable issue,"" he said. Unlike other Bush administration officials, Chertoff will not leave his job when Obama is sworn in. He will stay on until the morning of January 21, to ensure continuity through this major security event and to allow his designated successor, Janet Napolitano, to enjoy the festivities. Chertoff believes that this is the largest and most complex security event in history. An estimated 8,000 police officers will be on duty, along with almost a thousand FBI personnel, Transportation Security Administration screeners and others, including 10,000 National Guard troops. Chertoff said that another 20,000 members of the National Guard are being held in reserve. ""I think we are ready,"" Chertoff said.","Homeland Security chief takes a final tour of inauguration hot spots .

"(CNN) -- It is six years since Lewis Hamilton was first crowned world champion but the Briton is treating Sunday's title win in Abu Dhabi as though it was his maiden success all over again. The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was billed as the ""Duel in the Desert"" as the battle between Hamilton and Nico Rosberg for the 2014 drivers' championship went down to the wire. Instead, it proved a solo march to glory. ""Winning the first world championship was something very, very special, it was obviously my dream as a kid and it was my dream to get this championship, it feels like it was the first time,"" Hamilton told CNN. ""Maybe because it has been those six years it does feel like it is the first time and you know I am going to enjoy it, I'm going to embrace it with my family and go to the factory and see the guys and really enjoy it."" The six-year gap between Hamilton's twin triumphs equals Graham Hill's previous record wait for a second drivers' title following his first victorious season in 1962. Hamilton is no stranger to championship deciders having been in title contention at the final race of his rookie season in 2007 only to be pipped by Kimi Raikkonen. The Briton went one better the following year, edging out Felipe Massa on the final lap of the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix. In 2010, he arrived in Abu Dhabi with a mathematical chance of winning the world title but came up short. In contrast, his return to the Yas Marina Circuit at the weekend saw Rosberg finish outside of the points after his car suffered a significantly loss of power. The German's frustrating race ensured a comfortable 64-point winning margin for Hamilton as a result of the double points on offer at the final race. ""Obviously I have only had it once with this kind of championship but growing up it takes time [to sink in] because it's a long season, it's not just a one-off race and there's a lot of emotions and a lot of focus that has gone on through the years,"" said Hamilton, who joins an elite band of 15 other multiple champions. ""So I think the initial feeling is of relief, of course massively proud of the group of people that I have been working with and of course very much conscious of what we've achieved and what I've achieved. But I think the whole 'two-time champion' is going to take some time to kick in."" The margin of his victory in the points standings is not a complete reflection of a title race that ebbed and flowed between the formerly close friends, whose relationship fractured during the course of an occasionally tense season. In the end, Hamilton proved victorious by virtue of his 11 grands prix victories to Rosberg's five, with the former clawing back a 29-point deficit following August's Belgian Grand Prix to win six of the last seven races. Hamilton relished the battle. ""It makes no difference who are you competing with, you want to beat the guy with whoever you're fighting for the championship with,"" he said reflecting the morning after the night before. ""Obviously, you always want to beat your teammate because he's in the same car with the same opportunities and the same opportunities so perhaps it's even sweeter when you do beat your teammate because obviously people can see the difference between you. ""I had a great competitor throughout the year, I wouldn't want it any other way, I wouldn't want it easy that's for sure and I definitely don't feel I ever had it that way."" Rosberg was quick to overcome his own personal disappointment and congratulate his teammate ahead of the podium presentation, although Hamilton admitted he had not seen him again bar a brief passing in the Mercedes team garage. Hamilton likened their championship fight to ""life or death, we both wanted it more than anything we'd ever desired in our life."" Mercedes, with the same driver line-up in 2015, look set to dominate the sport once more next season, leaving Hamilton and Rosberg as that likely title protagonists. Asked how long it would take for title number three after enduring such a long wait for his second title success, Hamilton added: ""Oh geez, I have no idea. I'm just going to enjoy this one.""","Hamilton says it's like winning the title for the first time after topping Duel in the Desert .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The man behind a pair of bloody terror attacks in Norway is set to appear in court Monday, his first such appearance since authorities say he killed at least 93 people by setting off an explosion and gunning down people at a youth camp. Police have not identified the suspect, but local television and newspaper reports say the man in custody is Anders Behring Breivik. Attorney Geir Lippestad, who claimed to represent the 32-year-old Breivik, told Norwegian TV2 late Saturday that his client ""is ready to explain himself"" in court. The suspect feels the terrorist attacks were ""horrible,"" but ""in his head (they) were necessary,"" Lippestad said. The 32-year-old Norwegian has said that he acted alone and has not pleaded guilty, acting National Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said Sunday. But authorities have not ruled out that others may have been involved or helped him along the way. The investigation continues as the Scandinavian nation continues to wrestle with the attacks' aftermath, with an ashen-faced and openly weeping King Harald V leading the nation in mourning Sunday. Memorial shrines with flowers and candles dotted Oslo's streets, and Norwegians gathered at a cathedral in the capital to mourn the victims of the attacks. ""Soon, names and photographs will be released. The enormity of the evilness will surface in all its horror, and that will be a new test for us all,"" Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said at a church service Sunday billed as a ""Mass for grief and hope."" ""In the middle of all the tragedy, I am proud to live in a country that has managed to stand tall."" Sponheim said there has been ""no progress"" in ascertaining what the suspect's motive might have been. But he said that investigators were studying a 1,500-page manifesto that authorities believe was published online the day of the attack. The document, apparently compiled over a period of nine years, rants against Muslims and their growing presence in Europe and calls for a European civil war to overthrow governments, end multiculturalism and execute ""cultural Marxists."" The author of the document identifies himself as Breivik and indicates he is from Norway. CNN could not independently verify that Breivik wrote the document, and Norwegian authorities would not confirm that the man in their custody wrote the manifesto, saying it was part of their investigation. Authorities allege that he killed seven by setting off a car bomb outside government buildings in Oslo on Friday, then went 20 miles and killed at least 86 more by ambushing an island political youth retreat. The suspect was carrying a considerable amount of ammunition when he surrendered to authorities, Sponheim told reporters. Investigators will conduct autopsies over the next few days, Sponheim said, and the identities of the victims will be released once all the next-of-kin have been notified. The death toll -- which inched up to 93 on Sunday, after a person succumbed to injuries from the mass shooting -- and may increase, police say. At least four people have not been accounted for around Utoya island, with investigators searching the waters nearby for victims who may have drowned trying to escape the shooter. Authorities are also still trying to determine how many people died in the Oslo bombing, where the explosion badly damaged several government buildings as well as the majority Labour Party office. They are also hunting for new evidence. On Sunday, for instance, police raided a property the suspect owned in the eastern Oslo area Slettelokka looking for explosives. ""We were there with dogs but found nothing of any value as evidence,"" Sponheim said. Police said Sunday that the area around the blast site would remain cordoned off, but members of the public in the area were not at risk. In addition to the dead, at least 96 people were wounded in the attacks -- 30 in the blast and 66 in the mass shooting. Doctors at Oslo University Hospital Sunday were treating 31 patients injured in the terror attacks, 18 of whom were critically or seriously injured, Oslo University Hospital spokesman Jo Heldaas told CNN. Pope Benedict XVI on Sunday offered his ""fervent prayers for the victims and families, invoking God's peace upon the dead and divine consolation upon those who suffer."" ""At this time of national grief he prays that all Norwegians will be spiritually united in a determined resolve to reject the ways of hatred and conflict and to work together fearlessly in a shaping a future of mutual respect, solidarity and freedom from for coming generations,"" according to a statement released by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone on behalf of the pope. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed U.S. solidarity with Norway.

"After a chaotic day that saw Libya pick a new prime minister only for the vote be declared invalid hours later, the volatile North African country appears to have a new premier -- the fifth in more than two years. The General National Congress, Libya's transitional parliament, seemed to have selected a new prime minister on Sunday, choosing businessman Ahmad Mitig during a lively legislative session that saw several rounds of voting. But almost as soon as Mitig was sworn in, the deputy speaker declared the election invalid. On Monday, the Congress confirmed Mitig as Libya's new prime minister after approving his appointment. ""Ahmad Mitig was appointed head of the transitional government, and asked to form his cabinet and present it to the GNC for a confidence vote within 15 days,"" said a decision signed by Congress Speaker Nuri Abu Sahmein. ""This decision is in effect from date of publication ... and anything that contradicts it is nullified and all those concerned must implement it."" The resolution was numbered as ""No. 38"" and dated May 4 but published Monday. Given Sunday's dispute, it was unclear what exactly would happen next. The appointment makes the 42-year-old businessman Libya's fifth and youngest premier since dictator Moammar Gadhafi was toppled and killed in a 2011 revolution. But the confusion was another blow to a transitional government that has struggled to impose its authority over myriad militia groups that have grown in power and influence since the NATO-backed uprising. Parliament's work has been undermined by internal squabbling and threatened by the North African country's fractious militias, many of whom fought to oust Gadhafi but have refused to lay down their arms. Sunday's vote was the latest in several attempts to choose a prime minister. Another vote was abandoned last week when armed men stormed congressional headquarters, sending lawmakers fleeing. It took two rounds of voting before Mitig emerged as the front-runner for the post on Sunday, but he fell short of the 120 votes required in a confidence vote. A power struggle soon erupted in the assembly, with officials giving contradictory versions of the outcome. Second Deputy Speaker Saleh al-Makhzoum said Mitig had clinched 121 votes after voting resumed. But First Deputy Speaker Ezzedin al-Awami, who had chaired the first vote, said it was illegal, as he had already declared the session over. Both men could be seen arguing in the chamber on television. Al-Awami took the role of acting speaker during Sunday's session. Abu Sahmein, who usually chairs parliamentary sessions, disappeared from public view after the prosecutor general reportedly launched an investigation into a leaked video showing him being questioned over a late-night visit by two women to his house. The premier's post became vacant after interim prime minister Abdullah al-Thinni resigned last month, citing an attack by gunmen on his family just a month into his term. He continued as caretaker premier until his successor was picked. He had taken over from Ali Zeidan, who fled the country after he was ousted by deputies over his failure to stop attempts by rebels in the volatile east to sell oil  independently of Tripoli's government. Many Libyans in the oil-producing nation blame political infighting for a lack of progress in Libya's fragile nascent democracy after more than 40 years of one-man rule. A new constitution is in the works -- a process that has been repeatedly delayed by political wrangling -- but many are increasingly frustrated with the lack of economic progress and deteriorating security. To appease the rising popular discontent, the Congress has agreed to hold early elections this year for a new legislature that would also produce a new government.","Ahmad Mitig confirmed by Congress as fifth prime minister since end of 2011 uprising .

"Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross have had talks with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the Islamist terrorist group for the more than 200 Chibok school girls kidnapped in April, a source involved in the negotiations told CNN. The officials met four times in mid-August with two senior members of Boko Haram in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. The swap would involve the release of 30 Boko Haram commanders in the custody of the Nigerian government, according to the source, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. Boko Haram submitted a list with the names of 30 members who were either convicted or awaiting trial on terror offenses. ""The two Boko Haram negotiators assured the ICRC and government negotiators that the girls were never raped, were never used as sex slaves and were never sexually assaulted,"" said the source, who attended the discussions. The terrorist group abducted an estimated 276 girls in April from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing. Boko Haram has expressed a willingness for a swap with the ICRC at an undisclosed location, according to the source. But there was disagreement on some terms, including the number of girls involved in the swap. Boko Haram had insisted on an even swap -- 30 girls for the 30 commanders -- but the government refused, according to the source. ""They were only ready to release one to one, which the government was not going to accept,"" the source said. Another hurdle in the talks was Boko Haram's insistence on meeting the imprisoned 30 members involved in the swap, but they only had contact with six at a prison outside Abuja, the source said. ""ICRC couldn't find where the remaining 24 were being detained,"" the source said. The six prisoners included Kabiru Sokoto, a senior Boko Haram commander convicted in December 2013 of terrorism charges related to the fatal Christmas Day bombing of a church in the town of Madallah in 2011. The Boko Haram negotiators said they would get back to the government after consulting with superiors. ICRC sources declined to comment. The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa. In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. Ongoing militant attacks . Dozens of merchants were killed this week when Boko Haram gunmen launched a rocket and gun attack on a local market in northeastern Borno state, witnesses said Saturday. The attack happened Thursday but details were slow to emerge because of a mobile phone shutdown in the region Friday. Phone signals were restored only on Saturday, residents said. Scores of Boko Haram militiamen wearing military and police uniforms stormed a market in the town of Mainok, 31 miles (56 km) outside Maiduguri, during peak hours, the witnesses said. The militants fired rocket-propelled grenades and fired on traders. They looted food and loaded it onto trucks abandoned by fleeing traders, witnesses said. ""They killed dozens of people in the raid but it is difficult to give precise toll because everybody fled the market to escape the gunmen,"" said local merchant Babagana Kyari, who witnessed the attack. The attack was an attempt by the militia to replenish depleted food supplies in areas under its control, said Madu Kachalla, another trader at the market. ""They seized cash from traders and loaded food stuff into trucks they impounded at the market before fleeing into the bush,"" Kachalla said. Boko Haram fighters looted a truck carrying sacks of grain to Maiduguri on Wednesday before setting it on fire, residents said.

"Outraged by a court verdict they considered too lenient, thousands of people took to the streets across Bangladesh on Wednesday demanding the death penalty for an Islamic party leader convicted of war crimes carried out more than four decades ago. ""We've taken additional measures across the country to heighten security,"" State Minister for Home Affairs Shamsul Hoque told reporters. From horror to hope: Boy's miracle recovery from brutal attack . The demonstrations began Tuesday, when an International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Abdul Quader Mollah, assistant secretary general for the  Jamaat-e-Islami party, to life in prison. The Jamaat-e-Islami party had called for a two-day general strike across Bangladesh beginning Tuesday, and demonstrators clashed with police and demanded that ruling party officials scrap the trial process. The government on Tuesday evening called in paramilitary troopers to maintain law and order in Dhaka and elsewhere as deadly protests erupted after the verdict. Jamaat-e-Islami protested the verdict as demonstrators -- including some from ruling party alliances -- took to the streets demanding the death penalty for Mollah. Read more: General strike disrupts life in Bangladesh . ""We've deployed troopers from the Border Guards of Bangladesh to maintain law and order,"" Hoque said. Hundreds of Dhaka University students took to the streets in the capital's Shahbagh Square, where they were joined by other city residents in protests that began Tuesday. Home Ministry officials said security forces were patrolling in Dhaka and other major cities, including in the large southeastern port city of Chittagong, where at least four people were killed Tuesday during clashes between police and supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami. Police opened fire and shot tear-gas shells to disperse the protesters, who torched and otherwise damaged more than 100 vehicles in major cities. Jamaat-e-Islami said its members would continue to protest; many of its leaders are behind bars facing charges of murder, arson, looting and rape stemming from the war of independence in 1971. Read more: Clinton leaves drama in China for turmoil in Bangladesh . They said the war-crimes trials, which began after more than 40 years of independence, was done with ""ill political motive."" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina showed no sign of backing down, saying the trials would be completed at any cost. The government, which promised in its election pledges in 2008 to complete the war-crimes trials, set up the tribunals in 2010. Amid tight security, a three-member panel of judges of the International Crimes Tribunal-2 delivered the judgment against Mollah in a crowded courtroom on Tuesday. Mollah, 64, was found guilty of five of six charges, including murder. They included crimes against humanity, tribunal Chairman Justice Obaidul Hassan said. After the verdict was read, Mollah stood from the chair on which he had been seated and cried, ""Allahu Akbar!"" (God is Great!) He declared he was innocent and began to curse the judges and the government. He then pulled a copy of the Quran from his pocket and held it in front of him, saying that the judges would one day find themselves on trial in accordance with the holy book's law. Lawmakers of the ruling party alliance criticized the verdict in parliament and asked the prosecution to appeal for the death penalty. Mollah, who was the chief of the students' wing of Jamaat-e-Islami in 1971, is the first Jamaat-e-Islami leader convicted in a war-crimes case by the tribunal. On January 21, the same tribunal sentenced to death the first war crimes convict, Abul Kalam Azad, alias Bachchu Razakar. Bangladesh had been the eastern portion of Pakistan until it gained independence in 1971 in a war that killed 3 million people.","The demonstrations began Tuesday, when Abdul Quader Mollah was sentenced to life .

"The parents who pulled their cancer-stricken son from a British hospital and spurred an international search for the boy have been ordered to appear Monday in a court in Spain, where they were arrested, police said. Brett and Naghmeh King took their 5-year-old son, Ashya, who has brain cancer, to France and then Spain late last week, authorities said. Hotel staff members in Malaga, Spain, recognized Ashya and his family from media coverage and contacted police. Authorities did not confirm what charges the couple will face, but say that ""cruelty"" could be one of them as suggested by British law. British police have arrived in Spain to question the parents, Malaga police told CNN.  The British Crown Prosecution Service will be working on extradition efforts. The court appearance is part of a European arrest order that was issued by Britain against the couple. Their arrests came hours after Brett King publicly asserted that he and his wife are not kidnappers and are not neglecting their son. ""We were most disturbed today to find that his face is all over the Internet and newspapers, and we've been labeled as kidnappers, putting his life at risk, neglect,"" King said in a YouTube video posted Saturday. ""We're very happy with his progress,"" the father said in the video. ""We're not neglecting him."" The father is seen sitting on a bed with his son leaning against him. He points to a machine on the nightstand next to him. ""We've got loads of these feeds here. We've got iron supplements and we've got Calpol,"" an over-the-counter medication, King said. ""As you can see, there's nothing wrong with him. He's very happy, actually. Since we took him out of hospital, he's been smiling a lot more. He's been very much interacting with us."" Brett King defended his actions in the video made shortly before his arrest. He accuses two doctors at the hospital for not allowing him to seek  proton beam treatment outside of Britain, even though he said he was ready to pay for the treatment himself. ""We pleaded with them for proton beam treatment. They looked at me straight in the face and said with his cancer, which is called medulloblastoma,  it would have no benefit whatsoever.""  King said he then looked on the Internet and found sites in the United States, France and Switzerland on proton beam treatment that ""said the opposite that it would be beneficial for him."" The University Hospital in Southampton issued a statement saying they are working with doctors in Malaga to ensure Ashya's welfare and  ""are delighted that he has been found."" ""We are aware of the comments made online by his father,"" the statement said. ""Throughout Ashya's admission we have had conversations about the treatment options available to him and we had offered the family access to a second opinion, as well as assistance with organizing treatment abroad."" After Ashya was taken from the hospital without authorization Thursday, the family -- including Ashya's six siblings -- boarded a ferry and headed to Cherbourg, France, that night, police in Britain said. Interpol issued an international missing person notice to the agency's 190 member countries to help find Ashya. While authorities were searching for the boy, Detective Superintendent Dick Pearson said Ashya is not mobile on his own, cannot communicate verbally and is supposed to be receiving constant medical care because of recent surgery and ""ongoing medical issues."" ""Without this specialist 24-hour care, Ashya is at risk of additional health complications which place him at substantial risk,"" Pearson said Friday. After the parents' arrest Saturday night, authorities acknowledged they could face criticism. ""All of our efforts resulted from explicit medical advice that Ashya's life was in danger,"" said Assistant Chief Constable Chris Shead of Britain's Hampshire Constabulary. ""I am very aware that there are comments about the rights and wrongs of our approach, but when we are told by experts that any child's life is at risk we will make no apologies for being as proactive as possible."" Hampshire police said Ashya was taken to Materno Infantile Hospital in Spain and that the facility was communicating with Southampton General Hospital, where the boy had been removed by his parents. It was not immediately clear what happened to the Kings' other children. In the United states only a handful of hospitals offer proton-beam therapy after surgery, including Massachusetts General Hospital, where the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy was treated for brain cancer in 2008.  He died just  a year after his surgery for  malignant glioma. That surgery was followed by six weeks of radiation. Kennedy wrote in a Newsweek magazine article at the time that he underwent proton-beam therapy. The theory behind proton therapy is that its high-energy particles zone in specifically on the tumor and so do not harm the surrounding healthy tissue as much as the X-ray photons in conventional therapy, said Dr. Donald O'Rourke, associate professor of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.","Parents ordered to appear in Spanish court Monday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama called Saturday for the Iranian government to refrain from violence and injustice against its own citizens. Iranian women demonstrate Saturday in front of the White House, where President Obama issued a statement. ""The Iranian government must understand that the world is watching,"" Obama said in a White House statement. ""We mourn each and every innocent life that is lost. We call on the Iranian government to stop all violent and unjust actions against its own people."" He said the United States stands with all who seek to exercise what he called the universal rights to assembly and free speech. The statement came as Iranian security forces cracked down Saturday on demonstrators in Tehran in continuing protests against the outcome of Iran's June 12 election.  Watch protesters clash with government forces » . President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming victor in voting that opposition groups called rigged. No independent monitors were permitted for the election, and protests against the outcome grew in succeeding days. Thousands of protesters took to the streets Saturday, even though the demonstrations were banned and police confronted them with clubs, tear gas and water cannons. A threatening statement a day earlier by supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had raised fears of bloodshed. Obama received intelligence briefings and discussed the situation with senior advisers throughout the day, an administration official told CNN. In his statement, Obama repeated a message from his recent speech to the Muslim world in Cairo, Egypt, that ""suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away."" ""The Iranian people will ultimately judge the actions of their own government,"" Obama said in the statement. ""If the Iranian government seeks the respect of the international community, it must respect the dignity of its own people and govern through consent, not coercion."" Obama quoted slain U.S. civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.'s statement that ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" ""I believe that,"" Obama's statement said. ""The international community believes that. And right now, we are bearing witness to the Iranian people's belief in that truth, and we will continue to bear witness."" The statement was Obama's strongest to date on the Iran situation. He has been criticized by Republicans in Congress for what they called his failure to strongly support the Iranian demonstrators. Previously, Obama has said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the violent protests but he has avoided siding with Ahmadinejad's opponents, telling reporters that ""it is up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be."" ""It's not productive, given the history of U.S.-Iranian relations, to be seen as meddling, the U.S. president meddling in Iranian elections,"" Obama said this week. Diplomats credited Obama with having avoided giving the regime an excuse to blame the turmoil on the Americans. Several diplomats told CNN that Iran is in ""unchartered territory"" and said this weekend's events could determine the fate of the regime. The diplomats said they were watching to see whether Iranian security forces would continue the crackdown. The military has shot people before but never in massive numbers, they said. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this story.","President issues statement calling on Iran to treat protesters justly .

"(CNN) -- In this case, BFF could stand for ""Bigtime Famous Friends."" The first lady turns 50 on Friday, and it's being reported that she will be serenaded by singer Beyonce for the occasion. The White House is not commenting on whether the singer will be in attendance for Michelle Obama's birthday party, but it's well known that the pair are friends. The superstar performed the Etta James classic ""At Last"" at President Obama's first inaugural ball and teamed up with Michelle Obama for her initiative to get children more active. Who can forget FLOTUS dancing to Beyonce's ""Move Your Body"" exercise theme? Even their spouses are friends. Rapper Jay Z changed the lyrics to his rap song to say ""I've got 99 problems but Mitt ain't one"" during an Obama fundraiser. In July, the first lady and daughters Malia and Sasha attended a Beyonce concert in Chicago. The singer even once wrote an open letter of admiration: ""Michelle, thank you so much for every single thing that you do for us. I am proud to have my daughter grow up in a world where she has people like you to look up to."" Michelle Obama responded, ""@Beyonce Thank you for the beautiful letter and for being a role model who kids everywhere can look up to. --mo"" Awwwww! Their friendship has not been without controversy, however. Some Christian mothers were reportedly upset over FLOTUS teaming up with Beyonce because of the singer's ""booty shaking"" and revealing outfits. Writing for the Daily Beast, journalist Allison Samuels noted that there was ""the unfortunate conundrum posed for Mrs. Obama."" ""When BeyoncÃ© goes into the studio to record an album for her millions of fans, she's not thinking about her friendship with the first lady; she's thinking about what's hot, what's edgy, and what will sell to the masses,"" Samuels wrote. ""That surely must have been her mindset when she recorded the controversial lyrics single ""bow down b**ches"" for her new album earlier this year."" Demetria L. Lucas from the Root wrote, ""This love fest has gone too far for my liking. I'm no one (and neither are you) to police the first lady's musical tastes, but this continued public endorsement of Houston's Finest rubs me the wrong way.

"The federal government has concluded there's a new leaker exposing national security documents in the aftermath of surveillance disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, U.S. officials tell CNN. Proof of the newest leak comes from national security documents that formed the basis of a news story published Tuesday by the Intercept, the news site launched by Glenn Greenwald, who also published Snowden's leaks. NSA leaker Edward Snowden asks to extend Russia asylum . The Intercept article focuses on the growth in U.S. government databases of known or suspected terrorist names during the Obama administration. The article cites documents prepared by the National Counterterrorism Center dated August 2013, which is after Snowden left the United States to avoid criminal charges. Greenwald has suggested there was another leaker. In July, he said on Twitter ""it seems clear at this point"" that there was another. Government officials have been investigating to find out that identity. In a February interview with CNN's Reliable Sources, Greenwald said: ""I definitely think it's fair to say that there are people who have been inspired by Edward Snowden's courage and by the great good and virtue that it has achieved."" He added, ""I have no doubt there will be other sources inside the government who see extreme wrongdoing who are inspired by Edward Snowden."" It's not yet clear how many documents the new leaker has shared and how much damage it may cause. So far, the documents shared by the new leaker are labeled ""Secret"" and ""NOFORN,"" which means it isn't to be shared with foreign government. That's a lower level of classification than most of the documents leaked by Snowden. Government officials say he stole 1.7 million classified documents, many of which were labeled ""Top Secret,"" a higher classification for the government's most important secrets. Big databases . The biggest database, called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, now has 1 million names, a U.S. official confirmed to CNN. That's boosted from half that many in the aftermath of the botched attempt by the so-called underwear bomber to blow up a U.S.-bound jetliner on Christmas Day in 2009. The growth of TIDE, and other more specialized terrorist databases and watchlists, was a result of vulnerabilities exposed in the 2009 underwear plot, government officials said. A year after Snowden . The underwear bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmuttalab, was not on government watchlists that would have prevented him from being allowed to fly to the United States. In 2012, the National Counterterrorism Center reported that the TIDE database contained 875,000 names. There were about 500,000 in 2009 before the underwear bomb plot. The Intercept first reported the new TIDE database numbers, along with details of other databases. The Intercept article . As of November, 2013, there were 700,000 people listed in the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB), or the ""Terrorist Watchlist, according to a U.S. official. Fewer than 1% are U.S. persons and fewer than 0.5% are U.S. citizens. The list has grown somewhat since that time, but is nowhere near the 1.5 million figure cited in recent news reports.  Current numbers for the TSDB cannot be released at this time. The Intercept report said, citing the documents, that 40% on the ""Terrorist Watchlist"" aren't affiliated with terror groups. U.S. officials familiar with the matter say the claim is incorrect based on a misreading of the documents. Americans on lists . The report said that as of August, 2013, 5,000 Americans were on the TSD watchlist. Another 15,800 were on the wider TIDE list. A smaller subset, 16,000 names, including 1,200 belonging to Americans, are listed as ""selectees"" who are subject to more intensive screening at airports and border crossings. According to the Intercept, citing the documents, the cities with the most names on the list are: New York, Dearborn, Michigan; Houston; San Diego; and Chicago. Dearborn is home to one the nation's biggest concentrations of Arab and Muslim populations. According to the documents cited by the Intercept, the government has also begun a new effort to collect information and biometric data on U.S. persons in the aftermath of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The data includes photos from driver's licenses. That effort likely was spurred by the fact that FBI agents investigating the Boston bombings found existing databases lacking when they tried to match images of the two bombers isolated from surveillance video, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter. Stored on Pentagon system . Documents classified as ""Secret"" are stored on a Pentagon-operated computer system called SIPRNet, which the Defense and State departments use to share classified information. A recent Government Accountability Office study found that between 2006-2011 there were 3.2 million approved by the Pentagon to handle secret, top secret, SCI (sensitive compartmented) information. SIPRnet is one of the computer systems that the former Army soldier now known as Chelsea Manning accessed to leak hundreds of thousands documents, including State Department cables. The Manning leak was the largest U.S. intelligence leak until Snowden. Obama, Congress working on changes to NSA . Opinion: NSA and your phone records: What should Obama do?

"Flooding the airwaves this election year in battleground states across the country are Democratic ads featuring two men not on any ballot, and not even politicians. They're the Koch brothers, billionaire businessmen and GOP mega donors. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid takes the unusual step of regularly ripping Charles and David Koch from the Senate floor. He says they have ""no conscience,"" calling them ""un-American."" And now, is proposing a constitutional amendment to ban the kind of anonymous political giving the Kochs engage in and, some experts say, perfected. Other high-profile Democrats are hitting the Kochs, too -- from Vice President Joe Biden to former Vice President Al Gore, who this week argued Republicans are reluctant to publicly accept the existence of man-made global warming for fear of crossing the Koch brothers. ""I don't think it's particularly complicated. They will face primary opponents financed by the Koch brothers and others who are part of their group,"" Gore said. Democratic sources tell CNN it's a carefully crafted strategy to make the Koch brothers the 2014 election villains -- the personification of the rich manipulating the political system -- bankrolling a GOP agenda to get richer. ""The Koch brothers seem to believe in an America where the system is rigged to benefit the very wealthy,"" Reid says as part of his regular anti-Koch rant. Democrats are also trying to goad Republicans into publicly defending them as a way to attack GOP candidate as being in the Kochs' pockets. Senate showdown likely coming over campaign spending . It begs the question: How wealthy are they? Forbes magazine puts Charles and David Koch as the fourth-richest men in the United States, with a fortune of more than $41 billion. An oil, gas and textile conglomerate . Their oil, gas and textile conglomerate, Koch Industries, makes products people use every day: Dixie Cups, toilet paper, Stainmaster products and even LYCRA. Their business is privately held. The brothers own 84% of Koch Industries shares. Their libertarian politics come from their father, Fred Koch, a chemical engineer whose experience working in the Soviet Union instilled an aversion to big government. Charles and David Koch spend tens of millions of their personal wealth to push those anti-big government views. But exactly how much they donate is impossible to track because it is cloaked in secrecy. They fund groups that are not required to disclose donors -- groups that work to determine the outcome of federal, state and even municipal elections. ""They are very secretive in the way they operate politically,"" explained Dave Levinthal of the Center for Public Integrity, which tracks political spending. ""They have a very vast and wide network of non-profit and limited liability companies,"" he said. It's a huge web of roughly three dozen conservative groups funded, at least in part, by the Kochs. One group, Freedom Partners, acts as a hub of sorts. It is funded by the Kochs and 200 other like-minded businessmen. If that sounds confusing, that's probably the point. Their IRS filing from 2012 shows Freedom Partners raised more than $250 million that election year. One of the most prominent Koch-backed groups is Americans for Prosperity, which the brothers helped found. David Koch is still on the board, and one of his few public speeches each year at AFP's annual meeting. AFP puts its money where its mouth is . Could spend $125 million this cycle . An AFP official told CNN that it's on course to spend more than $125 million this midterm election year, which would be unprecedented, and likely more than the party apparatus will spend. And like the political parties, that money will go toward television ads, ground operations and voter data collection. But unlike the political parties, AFP's money comes from anonymous donations. ""We're going to shield the privacy and the First Amendment rights of the folks who support us,"" AFP President Tim Phillips said. Phillips says he is proud to have the Kochs' support, but also says they have 90,000 donors from all 50 states as well. ""They're interested in the policies we're pursuing. They're interested in, are we going to have cheap, affordable, reliable energy,"" Phillips said. They're interested in are we going to stop tax increases from going thru the roof and hurting Americans, including businesses."" Democrats say the idea that money is going to opposing government regulation and environmental protections because of economic principle is laughable. They say it's really all about making the Kochs and like-minded businessmen richer. To counter that,  Koch allies argue that ethanol subsidies help Koch industries, but AFP and other groups the Koch's fund, lobby against the government assistance. CNN sought an interview with Charles or David Koch, but the media-averse brothers declined. A spokesman, instead, offered Nancy Pfotenhauer, their longtime friend and former employee. ""I would describe them as people who are driven by integrity, humility,"" Pfotenhauer said. The image of the Koch brothers as two fat cats with puppet strings controlling Republicans is ""just not reality,"" she said. Infusing America with libertarian ideals . Those who know Charles and David Koch say they have a long-term goal of infusing America with their libertarian ideals. But each has a personal passion. For Charles Koch, a soft-spoken intellectual who lives in the brothers' hometown of Wichita, Kansas, it's higher education. He has pumped millions into colleges and universities around the country, mostly to push free market economics with college students. He even founded the Cato Institute back in 1974, a think tank dedicated to studying  and advancing libertarian ideals. By contrast, David Koch lives in New York like a traditional big city billionaire. His passion outside of political advocacy is donating tens of millions to medical research, hospitals, and even the arts -- a liberal bastion. He gave $35 million to bring a dinosaur exhibit to the Smithsonian, and even restored the ballet at Lincoln Center -- which bears his name. Their name might be on buildings and on Democrats lips, but they remain largely silent. Earlier this year, shortly after Reid launched his anti-Koch campaign, Charles Koch took the rare step of penning an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. ""Instead of encouraging free and open debate, collectivists strive to discredit and intimidate opponents. They engage in character assassination. (I should know, as the almost daily target of their attacks),"" he wrote.

So, why don't they speak out more; do interviews to explain and defend themselves?

"After months of infighting within the Pakistan Taliban, a major faction of the deadly militant group has apparently had enough. The Mehsud faction has announced it's parting ways with the central leadership of the group, known formally as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), over ideological differences. The breakaway faction had made attempts to convince the TTP to give up what it said were ""un-Islamic"" practices, such as attacks in public places, extortion, and kidnappings, and decided to separate from the banned terrorist outfit after these attempts failed, a spokesperson for the newly-formed faction, Azam Tariq, said in a statement released to the media last week. It's the first split since the TTP -- a coalition of militant groups -- was founded in 2007, seeking to establish its version of sharia law across Pakistan. Analysts say the move has major implications for alliances among Islamist groups in the region but there's no guarantee it will lead to less violence. The breakaway faction will be led by Khalid Mehsud -- also known as Khan Syed Sajna -- a TTP commander based in South Waziristan, near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan, Tariq said. It's believed Mehsud will command as many as 2,600 tribesmen, representing around half of the TTP's forces, although the exact number is hard to determine due to the many smaller splinter groups with changing names and allegiances in other parts of the country, according to Raza Rumi, Senior Fellow at the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank and consulting editor at The Friday Times. Internal conflict . Tensions within the TTP have been brewing for some time. They escalated after the group's leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November last year, setting off a power struggle among top commanders of the TTP that led to violent clashes in recent months in which dozens of people were killed. Appointed by a tribal council, Mullah Fazlullah has stood at the helm of the TPP since Mehsud's death. He hails from the Swat valley and is the first TTP leader who is not a Mehsud. He has struggled to contain the internal frictions among the group's factions, especially those within the Mehsud tribe, which makes up the majority of the TTP. Speaking on behalf of the breakaway faction on May 28, Tariq said the TTP's governing committee had been taken over by ""criminals,"" accusing the group of taking foreign funding to attack targets in Afghanistan and ""spreading unfounded propaganda against the Afghan Taliban."" The split is expected by some to weaken the Pakistan Taliban. It has been hailed as a success for the Pakistani military, which appears to have adopted a strategy of trying to divide the TTP by negotiating with moderate factions, according to Moeed W. Yusuf, director of South Asia programs at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington -- although the military has never publicly stated this was its plan. ""Breaking an insurgent faction from within is a time-tested strategy,"" Yusuf said. Some factions of the TPP are more willing to end attacks on Pakistani authorities and civilians, in exchange for more autonomy in tribal areas than hardliners, who are determined to implement sharia law across the country. Fazlullah, who leads the group remotely from Afghanistan, is among those fighting for Islamic law at all costs. On May 19, he said the group would not end its jihad until sharia law was established or they ""embrace martyrdom."" ""The Fazlullah group is clear on (its) objectives to attack Pakistan's army and Pakistan's state,"" Rumi from the Jinnah Institute told CNN. ""The Sajna group (led by Khalid Mehsud) has reservations (about) what the military has been doing, but resists the brutal attacks on Pakistan's army."" The government began peace talks with the TTP earlier this year but they have yet to reach an agreement. ""I think these recent talks that the government has initiated with the TTP have played their part and it's quite a victory for the ISI (the military's intelligence agency) to have played a role in this split,"" said Rumi. War on terror . The ideological rift is also tied to the winding down of U.S. and NATO operations in Afghanistan, analysts say. ""The heart of the reason why the TTP came into being was that it opposed Pakistan's alignment with the United States in the war on terror and the presence of U.S. troops in Afghanistan,"" said Rumi. ""Now, with the impending NATO withdrawal, the impetus for attacks on the Pakistani state is diminishing because the U.S. has announced it will be leaving the region and of course, that changes the whole context in which (the TTP) is operating."" The question now, says Rumi, is how Al Qaeda and other splinter groups will react. ""Al Qaeda is likely to be worried about this split because in a unified strong TTP they had a very useful partner to capture more power and space in Pakistan, but now they will be feeling a little rattled by these counter-moves by Pakistan's government and military."" The secession also comes on the heels of a massive targeted operation in Waziristan by the Pakistani army. At least 60 terrorists were killed in airstrikes in tribal areas this month, the army claims. On Tuesday, Pakistan's army chief Raheel Sharif announced  ""together the whole nation has rejected the misplaced ideology of the terrorists, who have clearly lost their cause already and are being marginalized.""","Mehsud faction of Pakistan Taliban defects, citing ideological differences .

"A Florida judge cut short Thursday the probation of Debra Lafave, a former Tampa middle school teacher who six years earlier pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old boy, a state law enforcement official said. She originally was sentenced to house arrest. That was reduced to probation in July 2008, and was set to expire on November 15, 2015 -- 10 years after she entered her plea -- said Mark Cox, a spokesman for the Hillsborough County state attorney's office. The victim's sister, as well as prosecutors, argued unsuccessfully Thursday against letting her off probation, he added. Judge Wayne Timmerman issued his decision after the hearing in Tampa, which lasted more than an hour. ""We disagree with the judge's decision,"" Cox said. ""We will seek relief at the appellate level."" The prosecution claims that when it agreed to the 2005 plea deal, Lafave had agreed that she would not try to terminate her sentence early. The 31-year-old woman, who is engaged and recently had twin sons, did not speak at Thursday's hearing. But her defense attorney, John Fitzgibbons, earlier said that she had served a significant punishment and wants to return to some semblance of normalcy. ""She is a new mom with all the responsibilities that come with twin boys, so she hopes to finally put this matter behind her and move on with her life,"" Fitzgibbons said, . At her original sentencing, Lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors. In January 2008, a Florida judge ruled that she violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker, a 17-year-old hostess at a small Tampa-area restaurant named Danny Boy's. But the judge did not send Lafave to jail, saying the violation was ""not willful and substantial."" At the time, Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations that included  sex-related topics -- with a minor violated terms of her probation. She referred to the conversations that she admitted having at work as just ""girl talk."" A court report said those conversations included a variety of topics not related to work, including ""personal life, boyfriend issues and sexual issues.""","Debra Lafave pleaded guilty in 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy .

"(CNN) -- ""Hi I'm Mindy Grossman. I'm a mom, a wife, the CEO of HSNi but most of all I'm a disruptor."" Mindy Grossman has been the driving force behind making the Home Shopping Network both hip and profitable, by bringing in celebrities from Jessica Simpson to P. Diddy and boosting sales dramatically. Digital sales now account for approximately 45% of HSNi's (HSN and Cornerstone) total revenues, according to Forbes. CNN's Isha Sesay finds out how she did it and what inspires her. Upbringing . Isha Sesay: You didn't study fashion, so how did you get into this business? Mindy Grossman: I probably have one of the most unconventional career paths ever. My parents married young but weren't able to have children so my father's boss in the produce business lent them the money to adopt me. I felt a real responsibility to be the first one to go to college, and the first one to be successful. I grew up very fast, I took things very seriously. I graduated high school at 16 and went to college, determined to be an attorney. I also got engaged very young, at 19. But when I was in my last semester of senior year of college I realized I was leading someone else's life and I wasn't really recognizing things that were inside me that were really important. Creativity and curiosity and really experiencing things. I moved to New York and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan international. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, working for the president of their international division. I was 20. Early on I was told I could do anything I wanted to do. It wasn't an issue being a woman or not coming from a wealthy family, and that is what always inspired me. The vision . IS: How was it perceived when you first joined HSN in 2006? MG: It was definitely an interesting time. I spent the first 18 years of my career in the menswear industry. When I started polo jeans, which was my startup experience, and then I went to Nike, so those were somewhat difference transitions. When it was announced that I was leaving Nike, to go to what at the time was called IAC retail, it wasn't exactly looked at as aspirational. IS:  But why was it so attractive to you? MG: Because I had seen the world changing. I had the opportunity to be traveling globally, to Japan to China, Latin America. I saw the wave of growth of mobile interaction in Japan that wasn't even glistening here at that time. How people were interfacing with brands. How technology was going to change things, how content was becoming power. So I knew that there was something there and I thought this could be part of it. I was at home watching HSN, keeping an eye on the competition but I'm also food network lover. I remember my husband saying ""what are you doing"" and I said ""I'm trying to see what's gonna click"". All of a sudden I saw Wolfgang Puck -- who was engaging and entertaining and he wasn't selling. He was inspiring and engaging customers and they wanted to buy his product because of that. The next day I went and had lunch with Chairman Barry Diller at the Four Seasons and kind of laid out this vision. And what's wonderful, in pure Barry fashion he was like, go forth. And you know - I jumped in. IS: Do you shop at HSN? MG: I'm going to tell you the truth. My husband once burst out laughing and I said what's so funny. He said you just got a letter from yourself for being one of the best customers at HSN! IS: How much do you buy? MG: I think I might be one of, if not the biggest jewelry customers. I believe that the reason that I really understand our consumer is I AM her. I love the thrill of it, I love discovery, I love the story behind what I'm buying. You can walk with me in my home and I will tell you the story of where I found that chair and how I found that chair and every single piece. The celeb factor . IS: Part of the reason for your success has been you attracting major celebrities and their brands and bringing them to HSN. Why has it done so well? MG: One of the things that we said early on is if we're going to have credibility in this idea of editorial program commerce, we need every one of the individuals that come to HSN, they have to have a great product, a great story and be a great storyteller. It's about the story, so if you look at our recent 100 Foot Journey or Maleficent with our Disney partnership, those are things that can transport people they can feel they're part of that journey and then they can be inspired to want the product, and that's what we're trying to do. The challenges . IS: What are some of the challenges you've faced in your time here? MG: The challenge was getting people to embrace the new, and dealing with being dismissed. It hurts because you take it personally, but it makes you stronger. I'll never forget when I first went to some fancy cocktail party in New York, somebody said asked what I did, and I said i was the CEO of IAC retail and we have HSN, and they go (whispering) ""I've shopped on HSN"" and I go, ""Why are you whispering?!"" But it was a very sobering experience and one that really, reinforced my belief of how to behave, as a leader as an individual.

"Basma Jandali spent days consumed with fear. Her brother was stranded in the Syrian city of Homs, where government forces have killed hundreds of people this week. She didn't know he was alive until they spoke Friday. ""I feel relieved now,"" she said. Her brother is one of the lucky ones. Several hundred thousand people remain in Homs, a city suddenly peppered with snipers and surrounded by soldiers. Syrian forces unleashed an assault this week that has destroyed clinics and homes. It has dramatically altered the rhythm of everyday life. Parents keep their kids at home, afraid to send them to school. They get food from activists delivering flour and sugar at night. Those who do venture out use street smarts -- doctors make rounds at night, for example, jumping walls to avoid checkpoints. People have a tough time getting soap, toothbrushes, shampoo, and medications. ""The simple act of opening your door could be the last thing you do in your life,"" said Dima Moussa, an attorney in Chicago and Syrian activist who opposes the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian government blames the 11-month-old nationwide uprising on terrorist groups. Video images from citizen journalists and accounts relayed to the outside world by phone suggest otherwise. Mohamad al Homsy, an activist from Homs who fled to Turkey before coming to the United States, said he gets a sense of the danger and desperation in Homs in phone calls home. His wife told him that their 6-year-old daughter in Homs has nightmares from the sounds of bombing. She told him the girl drew a picture with crayons of the family, a tank, and a fire. ""Can you imagine kids drawing this instead of the tree?"" al Homsy said. ""That made me so angry."" Malaz Alatassi, a doctor who lived in Homs before moving to Detroit, said friends and family tell him it's hard to go out and buy or find supplies, like bread or heating oil. ""If you look out the window, you risk being shot,"" he said. Smugglers and activists wait until night to deliver flour, sugar and medicine to people huddled in fear at home, he and al Homsy said. ""That's risky,"" Alatassi said. ""There are reports that many of those people are killed."" Businesses have closed. Government employees work on and off. Along with a breakdown of medical care, there's no psychiatric help for stress, Alatassi said. Many people read the Quran or the Bible, Jandali said. Most Syrians are Muslim. About 1 in 10 are Christian. ""The only thing they do is pray,"" said Jandali, who lives in New Jersey ""That is the only thing available to them."" Fear pervades life in other parts of Syria, too. ""We all have martyrs and injuries in our families,"" said Abu Omar, who lives in the southern Syrian province of Quneitra. Because of that, he said, ""we can all relate to each other."" Gas and food are hard to find, he said. Medicine is scarce. Hospitals have little equipment -- and what they do have is old. ""People depend on each other and help each other with simple medicine,"" Omar said. Relatives have lost track of each other in the chaos that has engulfed Syria for nearly a year. ""I haven't seen my mother for a month and a half even though she lives about seven or eight kilometers away,"" Omar said. Yasmeen, an activist in the West, said most of her relatives in Syria dropped out of school and left their jobs. She recounts tales of regime forces using violence to bring the opposition to its knees. Thugs attacked and pummeled a cousin involved in the protest movement, she said, and his dad was arrested and beaten, as well. She's heard of people who died after burning wood at home to keep warm -- they had no other fuel to use. Aside from the shelling and gunfire, she said, a lack of money and health care is taking a toll, too. ""A lot of people die,"" she said.","Everyday life in Syria is a struggle .

"Washington (CNN) -- With the posting of 400,000 classified documents from the Iraq war, WikiLeaks has shown a much heavier hand redacting compared to its previous publication of documents. After the leak in July of more than 70,000 Afghanistan War documents, the website was heavily criticized by the U.S. government, the military and human rights groups for failing to redact names of civilians in the documents, putting them at risk of retaliation by the Taliban. Pentagon officials had warned that it had similar concerns of exposure of Iraqi names. After the publication Friday, Press Secretary Geoff Morrell told CNN's ""John King, USA"" the military was in the process of notifying some 300 Iraqis whose names were in the documents. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange told CNN's Atika Shubert the site was more ""vigorous"" this time compared to the Afghanistan process. But concerns of exposing civilians to harm did not seem to be the motivation. ""In this case we have taken an even more vigorous approach than we took in relation of the Afghan material, not because we believe that approach was particularly lacking [but] rather just to prevent those sort of distractions from the serious content by people who would like to try and distract from the message,"" Assange said. An initial comparison of a few documents redacted by WikiLeaks to the same documents released by the Department of Defense shows that WikiLeaks removed more information from the documents than the Pentagon. CNN accessed the Department of Defense versions from the official U.S. Central Command website, where it posts items that have been released under the Freedom of Information Act. The first incident examined by CNN was the case of a car that drove toward a group of soldiers moving on foot through Tall Afar on January 18, 2005. The version of the ""significant action"" (SIGACTS) report released by the Pentagon said the unit involved was the A/1-5 and it was a patrol (abbreviated PTL). When the car failed to stop after a single warning shot, the patrol ""engaged the car"" and killed two civilians. The same document released Friday by WikiLeaks does not include the unit, the A/1-5, or that its members were on a patrol. In a summary of the incident, WikiLeaks redacted the number of killed civilians, but the accompanying narrative included the number. The second incident examined by CNN involved a car that approached a vehicle checkpoint near a bridge ten miles north of Al Qaim on May 9, 2005. The Pentagon version of the report says in part that the incident happened ""10KM NE of Al Qaim. The sedan ran over berms built on the road (with heavy equipment) to warn and slow oncoming traffic. Warning shots to deck at 125m; to engine block at 100m."" But WikiLeaks removed any mention of Al Qaim, a town in western Iraq near Syria. It also removed the word ""berms"" and at what distance the car deck and then engine block were targeted before the people in the car were shot. It also removed details on the death of one civilian and the wounding of another, which the Defense Department did release. Even with redaction, the Pentagon is critical of the documents' release, saying the site had no right to publish and is not equipped to understand what information is harmful. ""The problem we have with WikiLeaks, it goes beyond just taking out names of people,"" Col. David Lapan, a top Pentagon spokesman said Friday before WikiLeaks released the documents. ""There are lots of other types of information that we've described that could be damaging that go beyond names and they wouldn't have the expertise to know what those are."" Morrell reiterated that point later in the day. ""They are not experts about how to redact in a way that protects American forces,"" Morrell said on ""John King, USA."" ""Classified documents should not be in the public domain. At least not willy-nilly like this."" The big concern, Morrell said, is that the documents provide insights into ""patterns of behavior, our tactics, our techniques and our procedures.""","WikiLeaks did more redaction on this release of documents .

"Philadelphia (CNN)Hazel Donnelly was taking her husband to the doctor when they got a call that their apartment building was on fire. Her first thought was about her 17-year-old cat, Kramer. ""I don't have children on my own, so my cat is like my child. I became hysterical,"" said Donnelly, 50. ""What if (he) didn't make it?"" Once she arrived home, Donnelly implored firefighters to get her cat, but they were busy trying to control the blaze. Then Red Paw Emergency Relief arrived. The nonprofit assists pets and their owners when disaster strikes. Jen Leary, a former firefighter who founded the group, met with building residents and, once the fire was out, retrieved the animals. ""Everyone who received their pets started to cry,"" said Donnelly. No one was hurt, but the Donnelly's apartment had severe damage, and they weren't sure where they were going to stay. Donnelly was thrilled to learn that Red Paw could provide free short-term care for Kramer. ""When (someone) loses everything in a fire, they shouldn't then be forced to lose their pets -- their family members -- as well,"" Leary said. ""Letting them know, 'We'll take care of your animal like it is our own,' it means the world to people."" Since 2011, Leary and her group have provided emergency assistance to nearly 1,000 animals and their families throughout southeastern Pennsylvania. Like the Red Cross, but for animals . Several years ago, Leary began working as a firefighter and American Red Cross volunteer. She would often arrive at a disaster scene and see traumatized survivors struggling to care for their pets. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . ""They'd ask, 'What am I supposed to do with my dog? Who is going to help find my missing cat? How is my pet going to get medical care?"" said Leary, 36. ""There just wasn't anyone there to help the other part of the family."" Pets were sometimes taken to shelters or abandoned. The situation broke Leary's heart. After a devastating fire in 2011, Leary formed her organization and teamed up with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. Now, whenever the Red Cross responds to a disaster and discovers that an animal is involved, they call Leary. She believes it's the only partnership of its kind in the United States -- one she hopes to replicate in other cities. Always on call . Leary's group responds 24 hours a day, seven days a week to residential disasters such as fires, gas leaks and building collapses. Leary answers nearly all the calls herself. Her firefighter background gives her unique privileges. ""I'm allowed into situations that other people might not be,"" Leary said. ""Once the fire is out and they're just hitting hot spots, I'll talk to the chief, and if they say it's OK, I'll go in."" Rescuing animals is only part of what Red Paw does. Through a network of 400 volunteers, boarding facilities and veterinarians, the group provides emergency transportation, shelter, pet supplies and medical care to any pet involved in a disaster -- all for free. Leary's home is the first stop for most animals that don't need immediate medical care. They usually stay with Leary for a few days while they get vaccinated, spayed and neutered, if necessary. Then they are moved to foster homes until their families are ready to take them back. The group's roster of animals has also included rabbits, ferrets, fish, birds, turtles and other reptiles. Reuniting families . Red Paw, which runs on donations, provides care for most animals for around 60 days. The group's caseworkers check in with the owners weekly. When families are reunited with their pets, they receive a kit of supplies. ""Food, cat litter, bowls, medicine, whatever they need,"" said Leary. ""We want to make sure that they're starting off the right way."" If a family can't take their pet back, the group will find the animal an adoptive home. Red Paw cared for the Donnelly's cat for more than three weeks. ""I cried when we were reunited,"" said Donnelly. ""They went above and beyond. I am so grateful."" For Leary, helping families and their pets is what her work is all about. ""My hope is that it's a fresh start, and they can move forward together,"" she said. ""After going through such a sad thing, it's so good to have a happy ending."" Want to get involved?

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Doctors at a field hospital in Martyrs Square in Zawiya said Friday that 17 people were killed and another 150 were wounded when government forces attacked the city. They predicted the death toll would rise by morning. Six pro-regime soldiers who were captured said they had been told that the city was being run by Arab militants and it was their job to liberate it, according to the doctors, who asked not to be identified. The soldiers added that they had been misled so that they would fight against their countrymen, the doctors said. By the end of the day, the situation was calm in the seaside city, they said. The casualties were announced shortly after Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi accused followers of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden of brainwashing the youth of Zawiya with hallucinogenic drugs, resulting in the unrest. ""They put it with milk or with other drinks, spiked drinks,"" he said. After taking the tablets, ""they attack this police station or that one so they can steal from there the criminal records."" He pleaded with the protesters' mothers to track them down in the streets of the coastal town about 55 kilometers (about 35 miles) west of Tripoli and take them home. He added that he had ordered an end to the violence there, but his order upset his security forces. ""They told me they are being shot at and they were doing it in self-defense,"" Gadhafi said. ""Why do you give us orders to stop?"" Addressing the people of Zawiya, he sent condolences to the families of the dead and wounded. ""These are our children,"" he said. ""We are quite upset about the senseless loss of lives."" Zawiya's residents are free to do as they like, though there will be consequences, he said. ""If you want to pit against one another, then it's up to you,"" he said. ""But the borders of the city will be sealed in order to stop it from spreading elsewhere."" He added, ""How can such lunatic youth cause such anarchy?"" Gadhafi said Libya has peaceful ways for its citizens to address their grievances. ""We are not like Egypt or Tunisia,"" he said, referring to two countries that have ousted their leaders in recent weeks. ""Here, the authority is in the hands of the people. You can change your authority, just make committees. And if you think they are corrupt, take them to court. Prosecute them."" In an apparent allusion to calls for government officials to be held accountable for violence against Libyan civilians, Gadhafi said it is bin Laden who should be prosecuted. ""He's responsible for any acts of murder or sabotage,"" Gadhafi said. He accused foreigners of fomenting the discontent. ""These acts cannot happen by Libyan men,"" he said. ""No Libyan of any background would go into this, join these acts of sabotage."" Some of the people involved in the opposition, he said, were detained by the United States in Guantanamo. Finally, he expressed confidence that all will end up will for his regime. ""I believe Zawiya will toe the line,"" he said, then directed his final comment to the city's residents themselves. ""Please live up to my expectations, people of Zawiya."" A resident of Tripoli who said she was too afraid to give her name for fear of retribution, called Kadhafi's speech ""crazy."" ""We're all in our houses like we're sitting in jail,"" she said. ""We can't go outside or we get shot. We hear the bullets."" She called for other nations to impose a no-fly zone so that Kadhafi would not be able to fly in mercenaries. Violence occurred elsewhere too Thursday. A formerly pro-government newspaper in Libya reported Thursday that African mercenaries were shooting at unarmed civilians in Tajura, about 25 miles east of Tripoli. CNN could not confirm the report. Ten days into protests that have resulted in his loss of control of eastern Libya and led members of his government to defect, Gadhafi faced new international pressure Thursday. Switzerland ordered that his assets, and those of his entourage, be frozen, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said. Gadhafi's characteristically rambling remarks followed reports that anti-government forces had gained control of Zawiya. At the hospital, a woman who said her son had been shot told CNN, ""Blood is all over the streets."" The woman said unarmed people had been fired on indiscriminately. ""We want to call all human beings: Zawiya is finished,"" she said. ""The people (are) finished. The people (are) dying."" She said it was unclear who was behind were shooting. Many seemed to be African mercenaries, but they may have been from the government or military, she said. ""People are crying,"" she said, calling for help from the world. ""Where (are) the people? Where is the peace?"" The hospital in Zawiya is ""a disaster,"" she said, adding that some shooters had entered the hospital and insisted that no one was killed. CNN could not confirm reports for many areas in Libya. The Libyan government maintains tight control of communications and has not responded to repeated requests for access to the country. CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone. Misrata -- sometimes spelled Misurata -- is in the hands of the opposition, who have driven out the mercenaries, witnesses and media reports said. It is the country's third-largest city and is east of Tripoli. Witnesses and reports also said the town of Az Zintan was under opposition control. The opposition already controls Libya's second-largest city, Benghazi, where crowds cheered as international journalists drove through. The only shooting that could be heard was celebratory gunfire. Men in their 20s were guarding the city with shotguns, clubs or hunting knives. But Tripoli was a different story. Gunfire erupted at dawn Thursday as chanting crowds dispersed. Government security forces were tightening their grip on the capital, according to sources. In one neighborhood, no one was allowed in or out. ""There's nobody walking in the street, nobody is trying to get out, even to look through the window,"" said a resident who, for security reasons, did not want to be identified. ""It's a little scary."" She said she was risking her life by talking to a reporter. ""I've been trying to keep my identity hidden,"" the woman said. ""There are reported kidnappings happening in homes for anybody credible that is talking to the media and giving them the truth about what's happening in Libya."" Continuing a stream of defections among Libyan diplomats, the ambassador to Jordan, Mohammed Hassan Al Barghathi, said Thursday he was resigning because of the unrest. So, too, did a cousin of Gadhafi, Ahmed Gadhaf al-Dam, a top security official who was considered one of Gadhafi's closest aides. In a news release, his office said he left Libya last week ""in protest of the way the crisis was handled"" and that he had resigned. Underscoring the growing distance between the Gadhafi regime and Libyan diplomats, the flag hanging outside the Libyan Mission to the United Nations in New York was the opposition flag; the regime's flag had been taken down. But an anchor on state television said that Libyan diplomats and staff in Saudi Arabia had sent a cable of support ""paying their respective loyalty to the leader of Libya."" The U.N. Security Council will meet privately at 3 p.m. Friday to discuss taking additional measures against Libya. The U.N. Human Rights Council also plans to meet Friday to discuss a resolution that would suspend Libya from the council.

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Cal Perry reports on a refugee camp in Islamabad, Pakistan. Children at the camp are in danger of dehydration, says a doctor who visited the refugees with CNN. ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- They are not war refugees, not displaced by violence; rather they believe they're here because they are Christian. A mother of two sobs as she tells us, ""I have no money. No money for books or uniforms to send my children to school."" It's around 110 degrees Fahrenheit in this squalid camp in downtown Islamabad, where 2,000 Christians have settled, literally in the middle of the road. The Christian population of Pakistan is only 5 percent of the overall population. Overwhelmed by a Muslim majority, at times they face violent attacks. Other times, they believe they're expelled from their lands -- faced with a distant and dark future. This group has ended up living in tents for the past 3 months. They say the government kicked them off their land without warning: only because they are Christian. The government tells a different story, saying that they were given plenty of warning. Further than that, they say they will take care of this problem, a problem they are well aware of. The minister of minority affairs, Shahbaz Bhatti, says, ""We are constitutionally bound to protect the life and property of the minorities and to look after the interests of the minorities in this country. Because they played a role in the founding, they are equal citizens of the country. Yes, there is a problem, but we are trying to solve those problems."" The truth is, regardless of any religious strife, people are dying of poverty in this camp. Two have died since the group settled here, and children lay in the sun, totally exposed to the sun, suffering slowly. We brought a doctor to the camp; he seemed stunned, both at its location and the conditions. ""I think there's a danger here, especially with some of the younger children, that they could just die from dehydration or from all kinds of infections,"" says Dr. Rixwan Taj. ""I am very surprised, really because this is the center of Islamabad, just right in the center. And every facility is not but 10 minutes from here."" The water the camp is using to survive on is a broken pipe that runs underneath the road and out one side. At the camp, the water is used for drinking and washing. It happens to run over a pile of trash and directly down into the makeshift toilets, which are two holes in the ground. Taj tells us the obvious: Typhoid will come to this camp -- the conditions are ripe. Other countries of course deal with religious strife; minorities all over the world face an uphill struggle. But here, with the addition of poverty, in the oppressive heat -- in an over-crowed camp on the side of the road in downtown Islamabad -- it seems that much worse. A little girl stares into our camera and rhythmically says, ""Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah."" Her religion teaches her that ""the poor"" will inherit ""the kingdom of heaven."" Heaven seems a long way off.","2,000 Christians have settled in the middle of the road .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's parliament threatened Saturday to cut off access to a  facility used by NATO forces to  ferry troops into Afghanistan, signaling a growing rift that began when  U.S. commandos killed Osama bin Laden during a raid on a Pakistani  compound. A resolution adopted during a joint session of parliament condemned the U.S. action. It also called for a review of its working agreement with the U.S., demanded an independent investigation and ordered the immediate end of drone attacks along its border region. Failure to end unilateral U.S. raids and drone attacks will force Pakistan to ""to consider taking necessary steps, including withdrawal of (the) transit facility"" used by the NATO's International Security Assistance Force, according to the resolution. U.S. lawmakers have questioned how the world's most wanted terrorist managed to live in plain sight for years in Pakistan -- near the country's elite military academy -- without being detected. Pakistani and U.S. intelligence officials have said there is no evidence that any active members of Pakistan's military or intelligence establishment knew about or actively protected the al Qaeda leader. Publicly, leaders in both countries have downplayed a rift. During a stop in Afghanistan Saturday, U.S. Sen. John Kerry stressed that Americans want Pakistan to be ""a real ally"" in combating terror. Still, he added, the United States is ""not trying to find a way to break the relationship apart."" ""We're trying to find a way to build it and to improve it and we need to work at that and that's part of what I'll be doing over the course of the next couple of days,"" said Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who also planned to visit Pakistan. The unanimous resolution made clear there was a growing dissatisfaction among Pakistani lawmakers. The resolution also ordered a review of its counter-terrorism cooperation agreement with the United States. The government is deeply ""distress(ed) on the campaign to malign Pakistan, launched by certain quarters in other countries without appreciating Pakistan's determined efforts and immense sacrifices in combating terror,"" the resolution said. It also said more than 30,000 Pakistani civilians and more than 5,000 military personnel had been killed in its fight against terror ""and the blowback emanating from actions of the NATO/ISAF forces in Afghanistan."" Anger over U.S. drone strikes has mounted during the past year after it stepped up efforts along the Pakistani-Afghan border. On Friday, a suspected U.S. drone strike killed four suspected Islamic militants in the Datta Khel region of North Waziristan, according to two Pakistani intelligence officials. They said an unmanned aircraft fired four missiles at a militant's vehicle on the border area. The demands by the Pakistani civilian government come as new details emerge about the raid on bin Laden's Abbottabad compound. Members of the U.S. Navy SEAL team that attacked the compound were wearing helmet-mounted digital cameras that recorded the mission, a U.S. military official told CNN on Friday. The official described the digital recording as hazy, fast-moving and subject to poor lighting in the rooms. The source also said it is hard to get clear images from the footage. ""This is not movie-quality stuff,"" the official said. An official familiar with the material seized from the compound said Friday that Navy SEALs recovered a stash of pornography. The official would not discuss exactly where it was found, what it was or whether it is believed to belong to the al Qaeda leader or to someone else living at the site, such as bin Laden's couriers or his son. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. Bin Laden's compound is also undergoing intense analysis, and U.S. officials say he apparently enjoyed a support network in Pakistan that allowed him to stay in one location for the past several years. He had no escape plan or means to destroy his reams and gigabytes of documents in the event of an enemy assault, according to the U.S. sources. Two U.S. lawmakers joined a public chorus for the release of photos of bin Laden's body after seeing the images themselves. ""These are very graphic, gruesome pictures,"" said Rep. Doug Lamborn, a  Republican from Colorado. But seeing them ""gave me a sense of finality and closure."" A conservative legal watchdog group has filed the first lawsuit seeking the public release of the video and photographs of the raid and its aftermath. Judicial Watch is asking the Department of Defense to comply with a Freedom of Information request for the material, especially photos of bin Laden's body. The legal complaint to force compliance was made in federal court in Washington on Friday.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Police issued an alert Thursday in Mumbai, saying four members of a militant group had entered the Indian city and were suspected of plotting violence on the Christmas and New Year's holidays. Himanshu Roy, Mumbai's joint commissioner of police, said the suspected terrorists belong to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, the Pakistan-based group that was blamed for a violent siege on Mumbai in November 2008. The four men were identified as Abdul Kareem Moosa, Noor Abu Ilahi, Walid Jinnah and Mahfooz Alam, each between 20 and 30 years old. At a news conference, Roy released a sketch of Jinnah. Roy said the four recently ""sneaked into the city to carry out extremely dangerous activity."" He had no information on their nationalities. A source familiar with the police investigation told CNN that India's Ministry of Home Affairs issued a bulletin earlier this week to police departments around India warning of possible terror attacks in Mumbai and Ahmadabad, further north in the western state of Gujarat. Specific to Mumbai, the bulletin called for beefed up security at luxury hotels, tourist hubs, churches and consulates, especially those of the United States and European nations, the source said. The bulletin warned of possible carjackings and vehicle-borne explosives. Mumbai police were restricting traffic starting Thursday in and around the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel, one of the landmarks that had come under attack in 2008, several Indian newspapers reported. ""All roads, except for two access points, leading to the Taj hotel will remain closed from Thursday,"" Nawal Bajaj, a police official, told The Times of India. ""This is being done due to a specific intelligence alert. This arrangement will continue for the next 15 days."" Bajaj said every food truck entering the hotel grounds will be checked and police will conduct background checks on hotel suppliers. Additional security has been arranged for crowded destinations like the seaside Gateway of India, a popular spot for New Year's celebrations. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is on the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations, and last month the U.S. Treasury said it is prohibiting Americans from ""engaging in any transactions"" with that group. The Treasury specifically cited Azam Cheema, who helped train operatives for the 2008 Mumbai attacks and was the ""mastermind"" behind Mumbai train bombings carried out by Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2006. Mumbai has been the target of several terrorist attacks in the past few years, including train bombings in 1993 that killed 257 people. The most shocking and freshest in the minds of Mumbaikars is the 2008 siege. In the coordinated onslaught, 10 gunmen stormed three hotels, a train station and a Jewish cultural center, killing 164 people. Only one of the gunmen, Mohammed Ajmal Kasab of Pakistan, survived the attack. He has been convicted of murder, conspiracy and waging war against India. His lawyers have appealed his death sentence to a higher court of Mumbai. Last month, Indians marked the second anniversary of the attack with prayers, a march for peace and a wreath-laying ceremony. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh vowed renewed efforts to track down those behind the assault. ""We will never succumb to the designs of our enemies,"" he said. ""We pledge to redouble our efforts to bring the perpetrators of this crime against humanity to justice."" The attack on India's largest city and its financial hub derailed the fragile peace process between nuclear-capable arch-foes India and Pakistan. Under U.S. pressure, the two neighbors resumed talks this year in a bid to restart a full dialogue, but progress has been slow.

"Authorities on Tuesday released the identities of five slain people whose bodies were found at two addresses in rural Franklin County, and stressed that none of them was responsible for the killings. Wanda Lee, the Franklin County coroner, said the victims were Roy D. Napier, 50; Angela Napier, 47; Melissa Napier 23; Jacob Napier 18; and Henry Smith 43. All five were residents of Laurel, Indiana, Lee said. The Napiers all had been shot in the head, Lee said, and Angela Napier also had suffered blunt-force trauma to the head. Henry Smith had been shot in the chest and also suffered blunt-force trauma to the head, the coroner said. However, Lee cautioned, the official causes of death will not be determined until all autopsies are complete. State police have officially launched a murder investigation into the case, and called on members of the public to be watchful and vigilant for their own safety. ""We are looking at all motives for this crime,"" said Franklin County Sheriff Ken Murphy. ""We do not have a motive for this crime yet."" Sgt. Jerry Goodin of the Indiana state police added that although no suspects are yet known, ""It doesn't matter where they are at -- I can tell you this, anywhere in the United States or anywhere in the world, we're gonna be going after them, whoever it is that's responsible for these killings, so it doesn't matter to us where they're at."" Authorities first got a call Sunday afternoon from people concerned about a small child wandering near the street along Stipps Hill Road near Laurel, in eastern Indiana about halfway between Indianapolis and Cincinnati. Not seeing any adults around, some citizens stayed with the child until police arrived. After ""gaining more information"" by talking with the child and neighbors, a Franklin County sheriff's deputy requested help. That led to the discovery of a dead man at one address and four other fatalities -- two males and two females -- at an address across the street, said Goodin of the state police. He said Monday night that ""the child is safe,"" declining to elaborate.","NEW: Investigator vows to pursue killer or killers ""anywhere"" in the U.S. or world .

"Chadian troops have rescued 85 Nigerians kidnapped last week by the Islamist terror group Boko Haram, security and human rights sources in Nigeria said Saturday. Dozens of Boko Haram insurgents stormed the Doron Baga fishing and farming village on the shores of Lake Chad late Sunday through Monday and took away 97 young men and boys plus several women, residents said. The raiders killed 28 residents and burned scores of homes, according to residents. The hostages were loaded onto motorboats and ferried into neighboring Chad, with residents saying they feared the hostages  would be forcefully conscripted as foot soldiers. Chadian security officials reported intercepting a convoy of buses carrying 85 Nigerians"" believed to have been kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists from Baga,"" a Nigerian security source said. ""The convoy being led by six Boko Haram gunmen was stopped on the Chadian part of the border along Lake Chad for routine checks and the huge number in the convoy raised suspicion,"" said the source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the issue. An official of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in Maiduguri confirmed the rescue of the 63 male and 22 female hostages. The source, who asked that his name not be used, said more than 30 hostages were still being held by Boko Haram. He said their captors sped off with them in motorboats when they spotted the convoy being questioned by Chadian soldiers. Boko Haram has been waging a five-year armed insurgency to create an Islamic state in northern Nigeria. The group has carried out series of abductions, including the April kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls from a boarding school in the town of Chibok. Boko Haram uses its hostages as conscripts and sex slaves, according to authorities. They say Boko Haram has killed more than 12,000 people and displaced more than half a million residents.

"The FBI caught the man accused of creating Silk Road -- the shadowy e-commerce site it describes as ""the most sophisticated and extensive criminal marketplace on the Internet today"" -- after he allegedly posted his Gmail address online, according to court documents. Federal agents swooped on Ross William Ulbricht in a San Francisco public library Tuesday afternoon, charging the 29-year-old American with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. They allege he is ""the Dread Pirate Roberts,"" the Silk Road's mysterious founder, who drew his pseudonym from the feared, fictitious character in the film The Princess Bride. The FBI claims the former physics and engineering student even publicly alluded to his alleged criminal enterprise on his LinkedIn profile, with a statement describing how his goals had ""shifted"" in accordance with his libertarian economic views since leaving grad school at Pennsylvania State University. Ulbricht's LinkedIn profile states that, since completing his studies in 2010, he has focused on ""creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force"" of the kind imposed by ""institutions and governments."" ""I want to use economic theory as a means to abolish the use of coercion and agression (sic) amongst mankind,"" he wrote. In the indictment against Ulbricht, filed in a New York court, the FBI cyber-crime specialist who led the investigation, Christopher Tarbell, stated that he believed ""that this 'economic simulation' referred to by Ulbricht is Silk Road."" The Amazon.com of vice . The FBI swiftly shuttered the site, an underground digital marketplace that, since its inception in 2011, has allowed users to anonymously trade illegal goods and services in near total secrecy, using the digital currency bitcoin, and an encryption network called Tor that routes traffic through a ""hidden"" area of the Internet known as ""the dark web."" Time.com: Online drug markets alive and thriving . Tarbell said the site ""sought to make conducting illegal transactions on the Internet as easy and frictionless as shopping online at mainstream e-commerce websites,"" and carried listings for hard drugs, hackers, counterfeit cash, forged ID documents, firearms, ammunition, even hitmen -- one of whom Ulbricht is alleged to have enlisted to kill a blackmailer. According to the indictment, Silk Road had acquired nearly a million registered users worldwide -- about 30% of whom were based in the U.S. -- in its two and a half years of operation, providing them guidance on how to encrypt their communications and vacuum-pack their wares before shipping through the postal service to avoid detection by law enforcement. Last year, it said, the site added a ""stealth mode"" for users who considered themselves ""at risk of becoming a target for law enforcement."" The indictment said the site had generated over 9.5 million bitcoins in sales revenue and over 600,000 bitcoins in commissions for its owner, allowing the site to employ a team of administrators. The value of bitcoins has fluctuated dramatically since the digital currency was created -- it plummeted after Ulbricht's arrest -- but Tarbell estimated Silk Road's turnover to be worth about $1.2 billion in sales, and $80 million in commissions. In February, an Australian drug dealer became the first person to be convicted in connection to Silk Road after using the site to import cocaine and MDMA from Europe. Catching the Dread Pirate Roberts . In the section of the indictment outlining how the link between Ulbricht and Dread Pirate Roberts was established, Tarbell detailed how an FBI expert codenamed Agent-1 had located an early online mention of Silk Road dating to January 27, 2011, when a user under the handle ""Altoid"" made a post on a forum for users of magic mushrooms. ""I came across this website called Silk Road,"" wrote Altoid, in a post which linked to the site. ""I'm thinking of buying off it... Let me know what you think."" Two days later, someone using the handle ""Altoid"" made a similar post on a forum called Bitcoin Talk, recommending Silk Road and providing a link. ""Has anyone seen Silk Road yet? It's kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com. I don't think they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff,"" it read. The posts, said Tarbell, were an attempt to drum up interest in Silk Road, employing the online marketing tactic of ""astroturfing."" Investigators were given a major break when, eight months later, ""Altoid"" made another posting on Bitcoin Talk, stating he was looking for ""an IT pro in the Bitcoin community"" to hire in connection with ""a venture backed Bitcoin startup company."" The posting asked interested parties to contact rossulbricht@gmail.com. The indictment also noted that Ulbricht and Dread Pirate Roberts were both vocal adherents of the libertarian theories of Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises, with Ulbricht's public Google+ account linking to YouTube videos posted by the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and Dread Pirate Roberts repeatedly crediting von Mises with ""providing the philosophical underpinnings for Silk Road."" From a San Francisco Internet cafe . Tarbell said that while Dread Pirate Roberts used a ""virtual private network,"" or VPN, to create a ""false"" IP address, the VPN server's records indicated a user had accessed it from a San Francisco Internet café near the home of a friend Ulbricht had gone to live with around September last year. Records obtained from Google showed Ulbricht had regularly logged into his Gmail account from the Internet café, he said -- including on the same day in June that the VPN was accessed. In July, Ulbricht was visited in San Francisco by Homeland Security agents who had intercepted a package from Canada containing fake ID documents in nine different names, each bearing a photograph of Ulbricht. According to the indictment, Ulbricht -- whose roommates knew him as ""Josh,"" and said he was always at home on his computer -- refused to answer questions about the IDs, but told the agents that ""hypothetically"" anyone could go on the Silk Road and purchase them. In the weeks prior to the encounter, said Tarbell, Dread Pirate Roberts had been inquiring with Silk Road users about buying fake IDs, saying he needed them in order to rent extra servers for the site. A killing for hire? It was not the only time Ulbricht is alleged to have used the site to procure illegal services. Tarbell claimed that in March, Dread Pirate Roberts solicited the killing of a Silk Road user who was attempting to blackmail him by threatening to release the identities of thousands of users of the site. The FBI alleges that the Canada-based extortionist, known as FriendlyChemist, demanded $500,000 to prevent the release of the information, prompting Dread Pirate Roberts to contact another user and order a hit on FriendlyChemist. ""In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn't mind if he was executed,"" he is alleged to have written, before attempting to haggle down the price. ""Don't want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80k."" The FBI claims the hitman later sent a picture of the victim after the job was done -- for approximately $150,000 in bitcoins -- although Tarbell said Canadian authorities had no record of a Canadian resident with the name passed to the alleged hitman, nor any record of a homicide around that location and time. Ulbricht's lawyer, Brandon Leblanc, declined to comment on the case. Silk Road's closure is unlikely to bring an end to the trade of illegal goods on the ""dark web,"" as similar sites operate on the Tor network.","Alleged creator of the Internet's biggest criminal marketplace arrested in U.S.

"(CNN) -- When Mississippi attorney Tim Holleman was approached by furious community officials in Gulfport to stop BP and its contractor from dumping tar balls and oil-stained byproducts into a local landfill, he sent out an e-mail asking if there were alternatives to deal with the waste. At least five companies replied, offering possible ways to reuse or recycle the oily waste -- an option that BP has yet to implement in its cleanup efforts of what scientists now say is the largest accidental release of oil into water in history. Instead, tar balls, oily sand and vegetation, and soiled gloves and suits from the thousands of temporary BP workers who've been working to clean up beaches along the Gulf of Mexico are being dumped in landfills along the Gulf Coast. BP has collected close to 40,000 tons of ""oily solid"" waste from the cleanup activities. All the dumping has sparked enough consternation among the community in Harrison County, Mississippi, where the Pecan Grove Landfill is based, that the board of supervisors there even passed a resolution this summer not to accept BP waste. Residents there worried that the estimated 1,200 tons of oil-tainted byproducts dumped at the landfill would contaminate its soil and water. ""We're left to deal with it 15, 20 years later if and when this landfill has a problem. BP is long gone, and we're stuck with the problem. Nobody is going to say I'm sorry,"" Holleman said. But if the solid waste is not dumped, where can it go? Waste Oil Collectors Inc. of Gautier, Mississippi, was among those who wrote back to Holleman, describing a process in which the oil waste can be shredded into uniform bits and then heated to 2,500 degrees in a kiln. That recovers energy from the waste and breaks it down into mineral components, some of which can be used in asphalt. Another local engineering firm proposed the use of a sand agitator, which ""cooks"" and separates sand from the tar balls collected on beaches. The two products are then further processed, turning the emulsion into a recycled sand product that can be returned to the beach, while the oil product can be accumulated, sold and reused. Bobby Knesal, owner of the firm, is partnering with several other companies and hopes to bring the agitator to the Gulf Coast. ""This is a technology that's not new to the oil industry,"" he said. ""It's what they do every day, but they've never done it on a volume of a sand beach."" Knesal said he is waiting for state environmental officials to tell him to what extent he must treat the processed sand before it can be returned to the beaches. Others say their products have been tried and tested and are good to go. Russell Markesberry, president of Hydra-tone Chemicals, also got in touch with Holleman and proposed the use of a coconut oil-based detergent that can be sprayed to clean booms or oil washed ashore on beaches and marshes. The organic compounds in the detergent bond with the oil and form a biodiesel fuel that can be resold, he said. The rest of the detergent combines with seawater and can be drained into an industrial waste treatment plant, where it biodegrades in a month. Booms can then be redeployed. Holleman said he has forwarded the proposals to representatives from BP and from Waste Management, the Mississippi company that owns and operates the landfill, but they fell on deaf ears. ""I didn't get a response from them, that's part of the problem,"" he said. The bigger problem, Holleman said, is how BP has been dealing with the oil waste from the very start. Dumping the waste in landfills is the ""least preferred"" option under a series of disposal methods outlined under the 34-page waste management plan from Unified Command, the federal agencies overseeing the cleanup efforts. The ""most preferred"" option is to reduce the generation of waste in the first place, something BP and Waste Management said they have tried to do. Following that comes ""reuse,"" ""recycling"" and ""treatment."" Last on the list is ""dispose."" ""It is a priority ... to implement recycling and reuse for the generated waste,"" the plan states. ""As far as we've been able to determine, they jumped right to the least preferred method of disposal rather than looking at alternatives that don't leave it in the landfill, that don't need to be dealt with in the next 20 years,"" Holleman said. Dumping is the easiest and cheapest way of dealing with the waste washed ashore. Holleman said that based on estimates he received, dumping the junk in landfills costs about $35 to $40 per ton, while recycling can cost twice as much. Knesal's soil agitation and recycling technology has a $60 per ton price tag. After several rounds of talks with Holleman and county officials, BP and Waste Management agreed last week to stop putting oil waste into the Pecan Grove landfill. Oil that has already been dumped into the landfill will remain there, and the oil in the staging areas will remain in large trash bins for now. BP said it agreed to stop dumping ""not because the material is hazardous but because of community sensitivity to the issue,"" spokeswoman Perry Hatcher told CNN. The oil giant says it is looking at ways to recycle and reuse the oil and equipment from the cleanup. Oil recovered from water has been used ""as it would be originally used,"" and the ""process wasn't so much recycling as recapturing product,"" Hatcher said. She said various recycling options are ""being explored for any other waste that would not be used directly as it would have been originally."" Mike McAnulty, BP's waste management coordinator, said the company is evaluating an option to process tar balls so they can be used to make asphalt. He also said BP is finalizing plans to use a centrifuge technology to spin out oil and water from absorbent booms so the remaining material can be used to make plastics. ""It's only lately that we had the quantity of that type of waste to execute the test on a larger scale. So we're really ahead of the curve on that one,"" he said. Then there are regulatory hurdles the company needs to clear. ""We have heard concerns that there could be adverse effects on the asphalt due to possible dispersant and residual volatiles still in the tar balls,"" said Amy Graham, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. There is concern too that sand transported with the oil is too ""round"" for constructing roads. Professor Ralph Portier, a bioremediation expert at Louisiana State University, said the cleanup efforts could benefit from better planning. Instead, responses from the government and BP seem ""reactive"" instead of ""proactive."" ""Because they're reacting to one of the largest spills ... and they had sheer volume and they had to do something with it. They couldn't just let it sit in containers along U.S. Highway 90,"" he said of BP burying the oil waste. It could have been worse if the oily waste was left unattended, Portier said. ""It's not sitting in a coastal area that when we have a tropical storm come ashore ... all the material is being blown all over Biloxi, Mississippi, for example. So those are pragmatic things, it's more reactive than it should be, but at least it is pragmatic."" U.S. Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Scott Carr said the priority of the incident response has been stopping the oil flow and cleaning up the beaches. ""From the incident standpoint, [recycling the waste] was not the top of the list three weeks ago,"" he said. BP insists that it had been looking at various ""green"" options ""since very early in the incident."" ""It's really the complexity of identifying first which options are reliable and then looking at the regulatory framework and where you can likely employ those,"" McAnulty said. ""And then actually running a pilot test and then having a test of sufficient duration to demonstrate that the technology works."" He declined to say when recycling options will be implemented. For now, Harrison County officials are claiming victory over their efforts to stop BP from filling up the Pecan Grove site.","BP and landfill operator agree to keep waste in staging area .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 10 Shiite pilgrims were killed and dozens wounded in attacks targeting them in Iraq on Tuesday evening, officials said. In western Baghdad's Ghazaliya neighborhood a roadside bomb detonated near a gathering of pilgrims killing at least 10 and wounding 21 others, an Interior Ministry official said. To the north of Baghdad, in Diyala province, at least 14 people were wounded when a roadside bomb detonated near a procession of Shiite pilgrims in Khalis, according to the town's mayor. This was the third attack in as many days in the ethnically mixed Diyala province targeting Shiite pilgrims. On Sunday and Monday two suicide attacks in the province left at least five people killed and nearly two dozen wounded. Attacks targeting Shiite pilgrims have spiked in recent days as hundreds of thousands of worshipers have been making their way to the holy city of Karbala in southern Iraq and other Shiite shrines. Shiites in Iraq and across the world are observing a period of mourning commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, prophet Mohammed's grandson, a 7th century Imam and one of Shiite Islam's holiest figures. Shiites in Iraq will mark the day, known as Ashura, on Friday. Security has been increased around the shrines, especially in Karbala where the governor expects around two million pilgrims this year from Iraq and other countries. Security officials in southern Iraq said around 28,0000 security forces have been deployed to protect the pilgrimage. The period surrounding such events is historically a violent one with attacks believed to be carried out by Sunni extremists being a main threat.","The attack is part of a recent spike in violence against Shiite pilgrims .

"(CNN) -- A day after violent protests erupted in the restive city of Daraa, security forces opened fire at protesters in the coastal city of Latakia, witnesses said. Anti-government demonstrations in Latakia had started peacefully before several people were wounded in a hail of gunfire as security forces tightened their control on access to the city, witnesses said. However, presidential spokeswoman Bouthaina Shaaban told state media that an unidentified group of gunmen opened fire at citizens and security forces. Although the group allegedly entered Latakia ""breaking and burning shops,"" security forces did not return fire, Shaaban told SANA, the country's official news agency. The gunmen killed two security force officers and one demonstrator, she said, blaming the clashes on those attempting to ""meddle"" in the security and stability of the country. ""The right to peaceful demonstration is guaranteed to any citizen in Syria,"" Shaaban said. ""But what is happening is an attempt to ignite an internal strife in the country and to target the security and stability of the nation and the lives of its citizens."" CNN could not independently confirm the accounts as the Syrian government has yet to grant access to the country. Meanwhile, in the southern city of Daraa where dozens of people were killed in violent clashes earlier this week, hundreds of Syrians demonstrated peacefully without security forces present, a witness said. The protest also served as a funeral site for throngs of mourners to remember those who died in earlier demonstrations, the witness said. Friday was marred with reports of casualties in the southern cities of Sanamen and Daraa where government security forces allegedly opened fire on protesters. In Daraa, dozens were shot in the head and neck and hundreds more were wounded on Friday when snipers on rooftops began firing into the crowd, according to a doctor in Daraa who declined to be named for security reasons. The protesters, who were not carrying weapons, chanted, ""We need our freedom, We need democracy,"" the doctor said. In the neighboring city of Sanamen, at least 20 others were killed and more than 60 people wounded Friday after government security forces began shooting at demonstrators, the doctor in Daraa told CNN. Thousands in Sanamen marched Saturday in what appeared to be a mixture of political protest and funeral procession as they sought to bury six people killed in violent clashes earlier in the week, another witness said. Women chanted, ""We will sacrifice our blood, our lives for you martyrs"" as they walked, the witness said. Presidential spokeswoman Shaaban again blamed ""a group of gunmen and smugglers"" who allegedly seized police weapons and began shooting. Their actions compelled security guards to fire back in defense of their post, she said. Syrian state television later broadcast the apparent confessions of foreign nationals arrested in Syria, including an Egyptian with American citizenship who worked in Syria, according to SANA. ""The Egyptian man said he was receiving e-mails from external forces asking him to send pictures and video clips from Syria,"" the agency reported, noting that the man had recently vsited Israel through Jordan. By Saturday, security forces had left the city, leaving Sanamen to the Syrian military. The army has since surrounded the city and restricted access to it. Some residents are anticipating a food shortage as a result of what some describe as a blockade. But chants of ""Allah, Syria, and the Army only"" seemed to indicate that at least some residents were encouraged by the army's presence, the witness said. One soldier said ""they would shoot themselves before they would shoot (the protesters),"" the witness added. Meanwhile, international concern over the escalating violence continued. ""The situation in Syria has worsened considerably over the past week, with the use of live ammunition and tear gas by the authorities having resulted in a total of at least 37 people being killed in Daraa, including two children,"" Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said Friday. Among the dead were 15 people who tried to march to Daraa, sources said, and nine others who died when security forces fired on demonstrators in Daraa's main square, said Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist. There were many casualties in Daraa, said Abdullah, who asked that his full name not be reported due to security concerns. ""Thousands gathered and moved to the governor's building in Daraa, and there they burned a large picture of Bashar al-Assad, and then they toppled a statue of Hafez al-Assad in the center of the square,"" Abdullah said, referring to the current president and his late father, the former president. ""After that, armed men came out from the roof of the officers' club in front of the governor's office and started firing at the crowd,"" he said. Aman al Aswad, a political dissident, said dozens of people appeared to have been killed or wounded in clashes with security forces in the square, but he could not be precise on the totals. Earlier Friday, thousands attended an anti-government demonstration in the town, according to Kamal Aswad, a political activist in Daraa. There, people ridiculed recent government pronouncements of reforms and an assertion by government spokeswoman Shabaan that the country's president had ordered ""no live bullets"" would be used against demonstrators. One witness said the people chanted, ""Bouthaina, we do not want your bread, we want dignity!"" He said an ""overwhelming number"" of protesters showed up in Daraa to support ""martyrs,"" people killed in recent clashes. ""The whole of the city was out in the street to bury the dead and demand that those responsible be tried for their crimes against the people of Daraa,"" the witness said. ""We broke the barrier of fear today and the security forces could not touch us."" The witness said the security forces had withdrawn from the center of the city and didn't interfere with the demonstrations, which are stoked by a range of political and economic grievances. The government announced a number of measures that apparently addressed protesters' demands. Among them are decrees to cut taxes and raise government workers' salaries by 1,500 Syrian pounds ($32.60) a month and pledges to provide more press freedoms, increased job opportunities and curbs on government corruption. The government said it will form a committee ""to contact and listen to citizens in Daraa."" It also said it would study lifting the country's emergency law and adopting new legislation that would license political parties. Syria's emergency law, which has been in effect since 1963, allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. It also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having a lawyer present during interrogations. On Friday, state television showed what it said were pro-government demonstrations in Aleppo and Damascus. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said its correspondent in Daraa ""reported that the crowds in the spontaneous popular rallies chanted national slogans highly lauding President Assad's generous decrees and decisions, pledging their loyalty to his excellency and their unity under his leadership in the face of any conspiracy against Syria."" However, video also emerged of protests in Hama, where the government violently suppressed an uprising in 1982. And the state news agency reported that an armed gang attacked security forces in the southern city of Sanamen, which ""resulted in the deaths of several attackers.""

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Even while under curfew following the ouster of their long-serving authoritarian leader, Tunisians on Saturday experienced newfound freedoms online as their acting president promised a ""new phase"" for his embattled land. Filters on websites like Facebook and YouTube, put in place under former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, were dropped and Internet speed picked up considerably -- a development that followed the new government's vow to ease restrictions on freedoms. In addition, three Tunisian journalists -- including two bloggers critical of Ben Ali -- have been freed from jail, the Committee to Protect Journalists said Saturday. These developments come as Fouad Mebazaa was sworn in as the country's acting leader on Saturday, after Ben Ali and his family took refuge in Saudi Arabia following days of angry street protests against the government . Speaking on national TV, Mebazaa, who had been the country's parliamentary speaker, promised to ensure the nation's ""stability,"" respect its constitution and ""pursue the best interest of the nation."" ""Citizens, sons and daughters of our country of Tunis, in this important and urgent moment in the history of our beloved country, I appeal to all of you of various political parties, and nationalist organizations, and all civil society organizations to fight for the national interest and to respect the army's command and the national security in security matters, and to preserve private and public property and to bring the return of peace and security in the hearts of the citizens,"" he said. Mebazaa's temporary assumption of the presidency corresponds to an article in Tunisia's constitution that says power will be transferred to the parliament speaker when the president resigns, dies or is unable to perform his responsibilities. He asked Mohamed Ghannouchi to remain as prime minister of what is now a caretaker government. This dramatic power shift comes after the departure of Ben Ali, the leader of the north African country since 1987 who had a reputation for ruthlessness and corruption, Ben Ali fled to Jeddah, where he was welcomed by the Saudi Arabian king. ""The government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia announces that it stands fully by the Tunisian people, wishing, by God will, its people will stand solid to overcome this difficult phase in its history,"" the Saudi royal court said in a statement. Moammar Gadhafi, leader of neighboring Libya, denounced the developments in a televised speech Saturday night. Ben Ali remains the nation's rightful president, per its constitution, and blamed unrest on criminal gangs, he said. ""Sadly, Tunisia is headed to more chaos and we do not know how it will end,"" he said. Gadhafi closed his speech by saying he was ""sad and hurt"" by the recent developments, which he said threatened to derail significant progress in Tunisia. ""I hope your sanity returns and your wounds heal, because you had a big loss that will never return,"" he said, addressing the Tunisian people. As the political situation remained fluid, the army appears to have clamped down and established a strong presence on the streets in the cities of Tunisia, long a relatively stable and prosperous country in what diplomats have described as ""a rough neighborhood."" Tunisian state TV reported that officials plan to hold presidential elections in 60 days, and an opposition leader told CNN that opposition figures were meeting with the caretaker prime minister to discuss formation of a unity government. The ruling government declared a state of emergency, ordering a curfew requiring all people to remain indoors between 5 p.m. Saturday and 7 a.m. Sunday. No large street protests in the capital, Tunis, were reported Saturday. But multiple videos posted online showed that Tunis' main train station had been burned. There were also reports of rioting and looting in the country, and security forces also have been spotted rounding up and roughing up people. At least 42 people died when a fire swept through a prison in the eastern Tunisian city of Monastir, Dr. Ali Chadly of the University Hospital of Monastir told CNN. It was not immediately clear what sparked the fire. A travel warning from the British Foreign Office on Saturday said ""there have been demonstrations, some violent"" and ""significant looting"" in Tunis and other locations, citing Sousse, Sfax, Nabul, Hammamet, Douze, Kasserine, Requeb and Thia. Under Ben Ali, Tunisia was a pro-Western state supportive of U.S. policy in the Middle East and in its efforts against terrorism. On Friday, U.S. President Barack Obama condemned ""the use of violence against citizens peacefully voicing their opinion in Tunisia"" and lauded ""the courage and dignity of the Tunisian people."" He also urged Tunisia's government ""to respect human rights (and) hold free and fair elections."" The wave of rallies in the North African nation was stirred by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate, who torched himself last month after police confiscated his fruit cart, cutting off his source of income. Since then, protesters had called for Ben Ali to step down and held daily demonstrations denouncing his government. The grass-roots protests, organized and supported through online networks centered on Twitter and Facebook, focused on poor living conditions, high unemployment, government corruption and repression. Amnesty International spokesman Claudio Cordone said that 55 people have been killed over the past several weeks of demonstrations. The former president had put the number at 21 before his departure. ""We hope that the army will match its reputation for being more professional and less trigger-happy than the security forces that have been responsible for much of the violence over the last several weeks,"" Cordone said. The tumult, including Ben Ali's departure, has reverberated in the Arab world, where the news of the uprising elated people in other countries across the region, where authoritarian rule has persisted for years. In Cairo, Egypt, about 100 people inspired by what some are calling the ""Jasmine Revolution"" in Tunisia massed in front of the press syndicate and called for a similar uprising there. Amid heavy security and the presence of many riot police in the city, the people chanted, ""Down with Hosni Mubarak,"" the nation's leader, and called him a corrupt and ruthless ruler. Tunisia has close cultural and economic links to France, which invaded Tunisia in 1881. That move led to the creation of a protectorate until Tunisia became independent in 1956. An official statement from French President Nicolas Sarkozy noted France's ""many ties of friendship"" to Tunisia and called for free elections as soon as possible. After Sarkozy met with some senior members of his Cabinet Saturday to discuss Tunisia, Finance Minister Christine Lagarde sent instructions to financial institutions and banks to freeze the assets in France of the Ben Ali family. French government spokesman Francois Baroin said Saturday that France asked some of Ben Ali's relatives to leave the country, adding that Ben Ali wouldn't be allowed in France. The African Union's Peace and Security Council on Saturday ""expressed its solidarity"" with Tunisians and deplored the ""excessive use of force against demonstrators."" It also urged ""the political stakeholders and the Tunisian people to work together, in unity, consensus and respect for legality, towards a peaceful and democratic transition, which will allow the Tunisian people to freely choose their leaders through free, open, democratic and transparent elections."" Also Saturday, the Arab League released a statement regarding ""this historic stage"" and urged the ""return of calm and security,"" according to a report by Jordan's state-run news agency, Petra. The Cairo-based alliance offered support for a peaceful, legal realization of ""the Tunisian people's aspirations for a decent, secure and stable future in a climate of democracy and political stability.""

"New York (CNN) -- A New York judge released Dominique Strauss-Kahn from house arrest Friday, after prosecutors presented evidence questioning the credibility of the hotel maid who accused the former International Monetary Fund chief of sexual assault. The alleged victim, a 32-year-old immigrant from Guinea, admitted to prosecutors that she lied about the specifics of her whereabouts following the incident, the details of an asylum application and information she put on tax forms, according to documents filed in court Friday by prosecutors. But while the case has taken a dramatic turn, it has not been dismissed, said Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance. The indictment and charges -- including criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse -- against Strauss-Kahn, 62, still stand, Vance said. His lawyers said the alleged victim told ""substantial lies about her own background and the facts of this case."" Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman commended Vance for doing what he said was appropriate. ""We believed from the beginning that this case was not what it appeared to be,"" he said. ""We are absolutely convinced that while today is a first giant step in the right direction, the next step will lead to a complete dismissal of the charges."" Strauss-Kahn's release significantly eases the extraordinary bail conditions that had been previously ordered. The French financier had been released from jail on $6 million bail but was under house arrest in a luxury townhouse in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood. He was paying roughly $250,000 a month for court-ordered 24-hour armed guards posted at the townhouse. The presiding judge said authorities will continue to withhold Strauss-Kahn's passport but that he is free to travel in the United States. The stunning twist in the case came after prosecutors, in the course of their investigation, discovered that the alleged victim had not been truthful in a variety of topics regarding her history and circumstances, prosecutors said in a letter submitted to the court. Prosecutors said the woman admitted lying in her application for asylum in the United States and that she had been a victim of a gang rape, providing details of that attack. She cried when she first told prosecutors about the rape but in a subsequent interview, she admitted the gang rape never occurred. She said the fabricated account on the asylum application was made with the assistance of a man who ""provided her with a cassette recording of the facts"" so that she could memorize them. The woman told prosecutors that she has declared the child of a friend as her own dependent on her tax return in order to receive a larger refund. She ""also admitted to misrepresenting her income in order to maintain her present housing,"" the prosecutors said. After the alleged hotel assault, the woman told prosecutors that she ""fled to an area of the main hallway of the hotel's 28th floor and waited there until she observed the defendant leave,"" the prosecutors said. She said she then reported the incident to her supervisor. But in subsequent interviews, the woman admitted her testimony before the Grand Jury was false; that she ""proceeded to clean a nearby room, and then returned to Suite 2806 (the room occupied by Strauss-Kahn) and began to clean the suite before she reported the incident to her supervisor."" In angry remarks delivered outside the courthouse, the woman's attorney, Kenneth Thompson, admitted problems with his client's credibility, but the bottom line, he said was that she was attacked. ""That was true the day it happened and it is true today,"" he said, describing in chilling detail the account the woman gave of her attack and the bruising on her body. ""She has described that sexual assault many times to the prosecutors and to me. And she has never once changed a single thing about that account."" The development is particularly stunning given prior statements by New York authorities, who spoke forcefully about the accuser's credibility, and it leaves the felony case against Strauss-Kahn teetering on collapse, despite incontrovertible DNA evidence of sexual contact recovered from the hotel suite. ""It's just an extraordinary, extraordinary development considering this case was brought with such great fanfare by the Manhattan district attorney and they very loudly trumpeted the credibility of the accuser,"" said Jeffrey Toobin, CNN's senior legal analyst. ""What makes it even more extraordinary is that the (DNA) evidence apparently shows a sexual encounter between Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the woman who is the maid. Yet even with DNA evidence, the prosecution is considering dropping the case. That shows how bad her credibility may be."" Kenneth Thompson, her attorney, said allegations about the woman's involvement in drugs, published in The New York Times, are a lie, adding that Manhattan District Attorney Vance was afraid of losing the high-profile case. Thompson also said one of Vance's top aides is married to an individual connected Strauss-Kahn's defense team, creating an untenable conflict of interest in the case. Vance told reporters Friday that Strauss-Kahn's release did not dismiss the indictment or any of the charges against the former IMF chief, though he did not address Thompson's accusations of impropriety. The implications of the case are far reaching, especially in France, where before his arrest, Strauss-Kahn was considered a viable candidate in France's presidential election. The turnaround in the case comes just ahead of the July 13 filing deadline for the French presidential primaries. If the case collapses, Strauss-Kahn theoretically has enough time to file. His supporters would still like to see him run, though some Parisians interviewed on the streets Friday said even if Strauss-Kahn was cleared of wrongdoing, it was too late for him to seek office this go-around. Still, many in France felt vindicated over concerns that New York prosecutors were perhaps over zealous and that there had been a rush to judgment. They were shocked by widely broadcast footage of Strauss-Kahn in handcuffs in May, since a French law passed in 2000 prohibits the publication of images of suspects in handcuffs or in court in order to protect defendants' presumption of innocence. Jack Lang, France's former minister of culture and education, said he was very happy about the latest developments -- and hoped to see his fellow Socialist party politician make a comeback. ""If the prosecutor and the court decide to declare the innocence of DSK, it will be a good day -- a good day for Dominique himself, a good day for American justice, a good day for France and a good day for the Left,"" he said. CNN's Susan Candiotti in New York and Jim Bittermann and Saskya Vandoorne in Paris contributed to this report.","The case has changed dramatically but has not been dismissed .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York judge dismissed sexual assault charges against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the prosecutor's request Tuesday. A grand jury indicted Strauss-Kahn in May over allegations he sexually assaulted hotel housekeeper Nafissatou Diallo in his New York hotel suite. But in July, prosecutors began to back off the case, asking Judge Michael Obus to release Strauss-Kahn from house arrest after information surfaced that they said called Diallo's credibility into question. On Monday, prosecutors asked Obus to dismiss the charges entirely, while Diallo's attorney filed a motion asking that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance be disqualified from the case and that a special prosecutor be appointed. Obus rejected the request from Diallo's attorneys and then, at a hearing Tuesday morning, approved the request to dismiss charges. He had stayed implementation of the order to give Diallo's attorneys time to appeal his decision on the special prosecutor. The New York Supreme Court rejected the appeal Tuesday afternoon, according to court attorney Lauren Holmes. Diallo's attorney, Kenneth Thompson, decried the decision. ""District Attorney Vance has abandoned an innocent woman and has denied an innocent woman a chance to get justice in a rape case,"" he said. Vance, in a news release Tuesday, said prosecutors had no choice because they were ""not persuaded -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- that a crime has been committed, based on the evidence we have."" He said Diallo's testimony ""was fatally damaged, for several key reasons."" In a statement, Strauss-Kahn -- who has always denied the charges --  thanked his attorneys and Obus for his decision. ""These past two and a half months have been a nightmare for me and my family,"" he said, adding that he was ""obviously gratified that the district attorney agreed with my lawyers that this case had to be dismissed."" Later, speaking to reporters outside his house, he said, ""I am thankful for my wife, my children, my friends, and those who supported me during this period. I look forward to returning to my country, but I still have some things to do before I leave. I will explain more fully when I return."" Strauss-Kahn's attorneys said in a statement Monday after prosecutors filed their request that it vindicated their consistent claim that their client is innocent. ""Mr. Strauss-Kahn and his family are grateful that the district attorney's office took our concerns seriously and concluded on its own that this case cannot proceed further,"" attorneys William W. Taylor and Benjamin Brafman said in a statement. In a Paris news conference before the hearing, one of Diallo's attorneys said dismissing the charges would be a travesty. ""For the district attorney to now dismiss this case or seek to dismiss this case and turn his back on this victim because of so-called credibility issues is an affront not only on Ms. Diallo but an affront on all victims and sexual victims who come forward in the future,"" attorney Douglas Wigdor said. Prosecutors filed a ""recommendation for dismissal"" in the case Monday, noting more questions about Diallo's credibility. ""The nature and number of the complainant's falsehoods leave us unable to credit her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt, whatever the truth may be about the encounter between the complainant and the defendant,"" the document states. ""If we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt, we cannot ask a jury to do so."" Prosecutors voiced concern that the case appeared to rest exclusively on the housekeeper's account, predicting her ""falsehoods"" would be ""devastating"" if revealed during a trial. They claim she ""has not been truthful in matters great and small,"" including lying about a ""gang rape, as well as other details about her life in (her native) Guinea."" Diallo lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and past details of an asylum application and information on tax forms, prosecutors said. She also admitted lying on the asylum application about having been a victim of a gang rape, even providing details of an attack and later admitting it never happened, according to prosecutors. In their court filing, prosecutors said that DNA testing indicated semen on her dress matched Strauss-Kahn and shows there was a sexual encounter. There was ""no trauma to her body or oral cavity"" and ""scrapings from underneath her fingernails ... yielded no results."" Moreover, prosecutors claim Diallo's current story of her ""prompt outcry to her first supervisor is inconsistent with certain aspects of that supervisor's account."" ""All of the evidence that might be relevant to the contested issues of force and lack of consent is simply inconclusive,"" wrote the prosecutors. Thompson said Strauss-Kahn's power and prestige played a role in the outcome of the case, saying prosecutors would not ""run from DNA evidence"" if Strauss-Kahn ""was a plumber."" In Paris before the hearing, Wigdor disputed almost every aspect of the prosecution's claim, saying a medical examination following the alleged rape showed bruises on Diallo's vagina and that she suffered a ""tear"" on her shoulder and rips in her stockings. A ""mountain of physical evidence"" points toward a violent sexual assault during a nine-minute period inside Strauss-Kahn's New York hotel suite in May, Wigdor told reporters in France, where he is gathering evidence for a civil lawsuit against the French citizen and onetime contender for that nation's presidency. Diallo quickly reported the incident to five co-workers and was visibly upset after the incident, shaken up, spitting and nearly vomiting, Wigdor said. He rejected explanations by Strauss-Kahn's attorneys that any sexual encounter that may have occurred was consensual, questioning how he could persuade a woman he had never met before to have sex during a nine-minute encounter. ""There is no other plausible explanation"" but sexual assault, Wigdor said. A crowd of protesters gathered near the courtroom in New York in support of Diallo, carrying handwritten signs reading ""No impunity 4 rapists in power"" and ""Nafissatou we believe you,"" among other things. In Tuesday's news release, Vance said, ""As prosecutors, we don't work in a world where we expect or require perfect witnesses. The tens of thousands of victims who come to our office each year come from varied and often difficult circumstances, and sometimes with imperfect pasts. If we are convinced they are truthful about the crimes committed against them, and will tell the truth at trial, we will ask a jury to consider their testimony to prove a crime. If we are not convinced, we cannot, should not and do not take the case to a jury."" He asserted that ""seeking justice for sex crimes victims, and protecting immigrants, are among the highest priorities in this office,"" but ""we have to judge each case by its own unique set of facts."" Attorneys for Diallo said claims that Diallo told a friend in prison that she was going to cash in on the incident were untrue and accused the district attorney's office of treating Diallo like a criminal defendant and not an alleged victim. In their now-rejected motion to have Vance removed from the case, Diallo's attorney cited allegations of ""abuse of confidence, unfair treatment and bias and prejudices"" by Vance that they say disqualify him from the case. ""Are we telling (sexual assault victims) that if they dare to name a powerful, politically connected man as their abuser, they will see their whole life laid out to be judged publicly?"" asked New York City Councilwoman Letitia James. ""What does it take for a low-income immigrant -- a woman of color -- to publicly name one of the most powerful men in Europe as a sexual abuser?"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said before the hearing that Strauss-Kahn should now be able to breathe easier and ""return to some semblance of his former life."" But he said that no one involved in the case ""comes out of it looking very good."" ""This is a case that looks like it has nothing but losers -- the alleged victim, the defendant, and the prosecutor,"" Toobin said. ""The conclusion is likely to be entirely satisfying to no one.""","A judge approves dismissal of sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn .

"Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the Sunday killings of two polio vaccination volunteers in the country's northwest, calling their slayings ""cowardly and inhuman."" The workers were shot to death while visiting homes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwestern Pakistan, police said. Islamic militants have targeted anti-polio campaigns since U.S. intelligence used a fake vaccination program to aid its hunt for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Pakistan is one of only three countries where polio remains endemic, with 58 cases reported in 2012, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. In a statement issued by his office, Zardari said the volunteers died in service of a ""noble cause"" and called for tighter security for the effort. ""While condemning the death of the two polio volunteers, the president said that such cowardly and inhuman acts of the militants and extremists can not deter the strong resolve of government to eradicate polio from the country,"" the statement said. The CIA used a fake vaccine program to collect DNA from residents of bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence before a May 2011 raid that killed him. Bin Laden had been holed up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, about 60 miles north of the capital, Islamabad. Sunday's killings capped a bloody weekend dominated by a bus bombing and hospital siege in Quetta, the capital of the southwestern province of Balochistan. Militants attacked a university bus carrying women, then struck the hospital where the survivors were taken for treatment, authorities said Saturday. The 28 dead included 14 women killed on the bus, along with four nurses, four police officers and four militants, police said. At one point, the attackers held hundreds of patients, physicians and nurses hostage as they battled security forces. Earlier Saturday, assailants bombed the home of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of the Pakistani state, in Balochistan, killing a police officer and wounding an employee, authorities said. Interior Minister Chaudry Nisar said Sunday that there was a ""secret war"" going on in the province, and the government had to work ""with all the parties involved"" to bring it to an end. ""The government is ready to hold talks with those that believe in dialogue,"" he said. ""But the government will not hold talks with those that propagate and practice extremism.""","The volunteers were killed Sunday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa .

"The embattled regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is not close to falling despite nearly two years of fighting between government forces and rebels seeking to depose him, Jordan's King Abdullah II said Friday. ""Anyone who says that Bashar's regime has got weeks to live really doesn't know the reality on the ground,"" he said during a panel appearance with CNN's Fareed Zakaria at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""They still have capability. ... So (I expect) a strong showing for at least the first half of 2013."" Nonetheless, fears are growing that Syria may implode as the protracted conflict gets nastier. Any fragmentation of the country into small states would be ""catastrophic and something that we would be reeling from for decades to come,"" Abdullah said. He also warned of the threat of foreign jihadist fighters now in Syria. Al Qaeda has been established there for the past year and is getting support ""from certain quarters,"" the king said. ""They are a force to contend with, so even if we got the best government into Damascus tomorrow, we have at least two or three years of securing our borders from them coming across and to clean them up,"" he said. Comparing the militant threat with that seen in Afghanistan, Abdullah said that ""the new Taliban that we are going to have to deal with will be in Syria."" Read more: Syrians find calm after carnage . Abdullah appealed for greater international help for more than 300,000 Syrian refugees who have already fled over the border into Jordan and are suffering in the grip of a cruel winter. He also urged the stockpiling of humanitarian supplies that could be taken across Syria's borders, to try to keep people from leaving -- and to win hearts and minds. ""If these people start to starve and they don't have fuel and electricity and water, and hospitals are not running, that's when radicalization comes in and take advantage,"" he said. The number of Syrians fleeing to a Jordanian desert in the dead of the night continues to skyrocket, as officials warn of dwindling resources and a prolonged humanitarian crisis. Syrian refugees continue to flood Jordan amid warnings of crisis . About 3,280 Syrians crossed into the Zaatari refugee camp overnight on Thursday, said Anmar Hmoud, a Jordan government spokesman for Syrian refugee affairs. A day earlier, nearly 3,000 refugees arrived in Jordan, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""Indicators show they keep coming and it's much more than we're used to,"" Hmoud said. As many as 36,000 Syrians have crossed into Jordan since January 1. Syria's grim toll continues into 2013 . And as more people take refuge from the upheaval, the escalating numbers are straining resources, officials said. About 350,000 Syrian refugees have fled to Jordan since the conflict began, a number described as ""staggering"" by Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. ""The weakest refugees are struggling now just to survive this year's harsh winter,"" Abdullah said. ""More international support is desperately needed. ""Here I cannot emphasize enough the challenges that we are all facing, both in Jordan and Lebanon. And it's only going to get worse."" He urged the international community to come together ""decisively"" to end the bloodshed and come up with a solution that gives all Syrians a stake in their country's future. ""The situation is now very volatile security wise. Parts of the country are changing hands at a very rapid basis,"" said Valerie Amos, the U.N. emergency relief coordinator. ""We are trying to get to as many people as we can because people cross the borders when they really reach a desperation stage, where they can't get food, they can't get medical supplies."" About 700,000 Syrian refugees have left for neighboring nations since the conflict began, Amos said. Young girl survives 11 hours under bomb rubble in Syria . The International Rescue Committee has noted that in Jordan and other countries, a majority of Syrian refugees are living outside of camps -- in cities and towns where social services, schools and even trash and waste systems are not equipped to meet the needs of a suddenly inflated population. Amos urged donors to help, saying she hoped a Wednesday conference in Kuwait would yield some of the $1.5 billion in aid requested by humanitarian groups. That money would help Syrians displaced within their own country and those who have fled to neighboring nations for six months, she said. ""If we do not receive these funds, we will not be able to reach the poorest and most vulnerable families who so desperately need our help,"" she said. Zaatari is in Jordan's northern desert, northeast of Amman. Enterprising Syrian refugees, many of whom arrived with nothing, have set up their own retail avenue amid dusty tents and prefabricated metal shelters. The facilities are providing a small source of income and -- perhaps more importantly -- something to do to stave off the boredom and discomfort of camp life. The United Nations estimates 60,000 people have died in nearly two years of fighting between the rebels and government forces. Violence continued in Syria on Friday, with three people killed in clashes nationwide, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees. Heavy shelling continued in the Damascus suburbs, the group said. Elsewhere, rebels raided the Idlib Central Prison and freed 300 prisoners, the LCC said. Video purportedly taped by rebels showed them using pipes to pry the prison's barred windows away from the wall. ""Be patient, be patient,"" a man behind the camera shouts at the inmates, with one waving his hand out the cell bars. Rebels were engaged in firefights Friday with government security forces at the prison, and the rebels managed to cross some prison walls, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Freed, wounded prisoners and injured rebels were treated at a makeshift clinic in Amaaret Misreen about 6 miles (9 kilometers) outside Idlib, an opposition activist said. The rebels' assault on the prison began Friday and they were in control of 60% of the facility, though fighting continued over two major buildings, said opposition activist Omar Abu Al-Huda. He told CNN he witnessed the offensive. The inmate population includes political prisoners, and the prison is considered the last major government position in western Idlib, Al-Huda said. Government forces have an army position, with tanks and heavy machine guns, inside the prison. CNN cannot independently verify many claims from Syria, as the government has severely restricted access by international journalists. On Monday, representatives from 50 countries and organizations will meet in Kuwait with two vice presidents of the National Syrian Coalition, a spokesman with the French Foreign Ministry said. The meeting will be a follow-up to a December 12 gathering in Marrakech, Morocco, where United States, Britain, France, Turkey and the Gulf Cooperation Council recognized the opposition coalition, the spokesman said. The meeting will address greater recognition for the coalition, confirmation of financial pledges to it, and the humanitarian situation in Syria, the spokesman said. Refugee camps in neighboring countries will also be discussed, the ministry said.","Nations recognizing opposition coalition will meet in Kuwait on Monday .

"(CNN)Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said his trial, which wrapped up Friday, was the first time his side of the aggravated pimping case against him has been fully heard. He'll learn June 12 whether investigative magistrates accepted his version. A verdict by the Lille court will be read on that date. The onetime contender for the French presidency has denied investigators' accusations that he organized or encouraged sex parties involving prostitutes. ""For the first time, throughout these last hearings, I felt I could explain myself and I have the feeling I have been listened to,"" Strauss-Kahn said. Strauss-Kahn appeared to get a boost earlier this week when the Lille prosecutor told the court that the defendant should be acquitted because of insufficient evidence. Lille Prosecutor Frederic Fevre's statement conformed with what his office said more than a year ago: that the evidence didn't support the charges. But investigative magistrates nevertheless pursued the case to trial, which began two weeks ago. Investigators alleged that the sex parties, in locations such as Belgium, New York and Washington, stemmed from a prostitution ring, organized from the Hotel Carlton in Lille. Strauss-Kahn, who was married to French TV journalist Anne Sinclair until their divorce in 2013, has never denied that he took part in the parties. But the crux of his defense is that he did not know that prostitutes were involved. In testimony last week, he acknowledged that the sexual encounters were organized in such a way that they could fit his agenda, but he denied organizing them or asking anyone else to do so for him. ""I don't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever,"" he said last week. In France, prostitution is legal, but pimping is not. Prosecutors allege that two other defendants, businessman David Roquet and Fabrice Paszkowski, a businessman friend of the former IMF director, picked up the bills for the sex parties. Strauss-Kahn saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011. He was later cleared of the New York allegations. Before that scandal erupted, he had been on track to run for the French presidency -- an election that his Socialist Party later won with Francois Hollande as its candidate. The Lille prosecutor's office in late 2013 asked for Strauss-Kahn's case to be dismissed, citing a lack of evidence. However, the investigating magistrates did not follow its recommendations. A judgment in the case could come ""within months,"" Fevre's spokeswoman, Maud Perraudeau, said Tuesday. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report.","Strauss-Kahn: ""I have the feeling I have been listened to""

"A New York hotel housekeeper and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the international finance executive accused of sexually assaulting her, have reached a settlement in her civil lawsuit against him, Bronx County Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon said Monday. Nafissatou Diallo sued Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, in August 2011, three months after she told police that he had attempted to sexually assault her in his hotel room. The scandal resulted in Strauss-Kahn's eventual resignation from the IMF and the implosion of his political career, including his shot at becoming president of France. Terms of the settlement were not released. ""I just want to thank everybody all over the world,"" Diallo told reporters after court hearing.  ""I thank everybody, I thank God. Thank you very much."" One of her attorneys, Douglas Wigdor, later issued a statement saying, ""While the agreement to resolve Ms. Diallo's claims with DSK is the final chapter in what has been a long and arduous year and a half, the agreement to settle this matter will provide her with a new beginning so that she and her daughter can move forward and begin the process of healing."" He said Diallo remains off the job, disabled by a shoulder injury she says she suffered in the assault. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers would not answer reporters' questions at the courthouse, but later William Taylor III and Amit Mehta issued this statement: ""On behalf of Mr. Strauss-Kahn, we are pleased to have arrived at a resolution of this matter. We are grateful to Judge McKeon, whose patience and forbearance allowed this agreement to be formulated."" Diallo had been seeking unspecified monetary damages for physical, emotional and psychological harm and damage to her reputation, according to her lawsuit. She told police that a naked Strauss-Kahn emerged from a room of his spacious luxury hotel suite and tried to force himself on her, at one point dragging her into the bathroom and trying to remove her underwear. Strauss-Kahn left the hotel and boarded an Air France flight set to leave New York. Police pulled him off the flight. Strauss-Kahn alleged the encounter was consensual. A grand jury indicted him on seven counts, including sexual abuse and attempted rape, but prosecutors later dropped the charges after concluding Diallo had lied about some details of the alleged attack. In her lawsuit, Diallo said she was suing Strauss-Kahn to ""vindicate her rights, to assert her dignity as a woman, to hold Dominique Strauss-Kahn accountable for the violent and deplorable acts he committed ... to teach her young daughter that no man -- regardless of how much money, power and influence he may have -- should ever be allowed to violate her body, and to stand up for all women who have been raped ... but are too afraid to speak out."" Strauss-Kahn's lawyers sought to have the lawsuit dismissed on the grounds that he carried diplomatic immunity, but a judge rejected the gambit in May. Later than month, he countersued Diallo for $1 million, calling her accusation a ""malicious"" fabrication that had cost him his career. That lawsuit is still pending. Diallo has also settled a libel lawsuit with the New York Post, McKeon said. After his New York arrest, a French woman accused him of rape. Those accusations were dropped. But in March, French authorities accused him of ""aggravated pimping"" for alleged participation in a prostitution ring. At the time, his attorneys called the allegations ""unhealthy, sensationalist and not without a political agenda."" A decision on whether he will face charges is expected next week. Strauss-Kahn is an economist, member of the French parliament and onetime French finance minister who until the scandal broke was widely considered to be the leading candidate to succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as president of France. He resigned his $500,000 a job with the IMF in May.","The former IMF head settles a lawsuit filed by his accuser .

"A newly disclosed CIA policy mandates that it won't use vaccination programs as part of its operations, according to the Obama administration. The directive by CIA Director John Brennan, made nine months ago but only coming to light now, followed concerns raised by leaders of a dozen U.S. public health schools in a letter to President Barack Obama. They spoke out following revelations the CIA had enlisted a doctor to oversee a false immunization campaign in Pakistan ahead of the 2011 raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad. The campaign's true purpose was to collect information on the residents of the compound, and attempt to confirm DNA matches to bin Laden or relatives. The public health programs reached out to Obama after the organization Save the Children was forced to ""withdraw all foreign national staff"" from Pakistan as a ""result of a CIA sham vaccination campaign."" Save the Children was in the midst of a campaign to administer the polio vaccination in Pakistan, one of the few places left in the world where the virus is still prevalent. In their letter to the White House in January 2013, the deans also alleged that ""seven or more United Nations health workers who were vaccinating Pakistani children against polio were gunned down in unforgivable acts of terrorism"" as a result of the CIA effort. In a letter dated May 16 and obtained by CNN on Monday, Lisa Monaco, the top White House adviser on homeland security and counterterrorism, told the health school deans that Brennan had ""directed in August 2013 that the agency make no operational use of vaccination programs, which includes vaccination workers. ""Similarly, the agency will not seek to obtain or exploit DNA or other genetic material acquired through such programs,"" the letter said. CIA spokesman Dean Boyd told CNN on Monday that Brennan established the policy ""after carefully considering a variety of views, including those from outside the agency. He took seriously the concerns raised by the public health community, examined them closely, and took decisive action."" Boyd also said it ""is important to note that militant groups have a long history of attacking humanitarian aid workers in Pakistan and those attacks began years before the raid against the bin Laden compound."" By publicizing the policy, he said the CIA hopes to ""dispel one canard that militant groups have used as justification for cowardly attacks against vaccination providers,"" noting that the agency ""has great  respect for the vital work that vaccination workers perform around the globe."" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden confirmed Monaco's letter to the school deans and its contents.","Policy was put into place last August following concerns raised by health school deans .

"Most people see a nice cut of beef and think, ""Gee, I should hold a barbecue this weekend."" Other people see raw meat as the perfect place to hide drugs. A 24-year-old man was arrested at Mineta San Jose International Airport in California after airport security officials discovered about 3 pounds of cocaine smuggled inside raw meat in his checked luggage, according to the Transportation Security Administration. The man was attempting to travel with his raw meat/cocaine combo from San Jose, California, to Seattle on November 8, the TSA said. ""TSA's screening procedures, which are governed by federal law, are focused on security and are designed to detect potential threats to aviation and passengers,"" spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote in an email. ""As is common practice, TSA notified the San Jose Police Department (Airport Division) of the discovery, who responded and took possession of the cocaine,"" Feinstein said. The TSA screens every bag that will eventually enter a plane, whether it is checked or the passenger carries it on board. Though officers are looking for bombs and other devices that can take down a plane, they also often find other illegal items. The airport screening process shows that passengers often creatively try (and fail) to smuggle illegal substances through security. A woman flying out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport in September attempted to hide two .40 caliber handguns and 33 pounds of marijuana inside baby wipes, coffee, floor dusting sheets, lemonade mix, iced tea mix, a box of cat litter and a box of laundry tablets, according to the TSA. In May, the agency said, a woman departing Oakland International Airport tried getting three bags full of 81 pounds of marijuana past TSA officials. One particularly creative passenger scooped out the middle of a jar of peanut butter and replaced it with marijuana, according to the TSA blog. Drugs aren't the only product that people are trying to bring on board without permission. In a more scholarly approach to smuggling, an old book was hollowed out to make room for a handgun at Honolulu International Airport in March 2012. The TSA is catching passengers with more guns than ever before. The 1,855 firearms seized from passengers' carry-on luggage in the first 10 months of this year has surpassed the 2013 total  of 1,813 seized firearms, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in a statement. Of those 1,855 firearms, 1,471 were loaded, Johnson said. Crazy things Americans tried to take on planes in 2013 .","The TSA says a passenger in California tried to smuggle cocaine in raw meat .

"A five-year-old ban on the use of trans fats in New York City restaurants has sharply reduced the consumption of these unhealthy fats among fast-food customers, a study by city health officials has found. In 2007, the New York City Board of Health, spurred on by the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, adopted a regulation that forced restaurants to all but eliminate the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and spreads, the main sources of trans fats in the U.S. diet. The ban appears to have had the intended effect. A new analysis of thousands of lunch receipts, collected at fast-food chains before and after the ban went into effect, estimates that the average trans fat content of customers' meals has dropped by 2.5 grams, from about 3 grams to 0.5 grams. Additionally, the proportion of meals containing less than 0.5 grams — an amount generally considered negligible — increased from 32% to 59% between 2007 and 2009. ""For consumers, the transition was seamless. Most New Yorkers didn't even notice,"" says Christine Curtis, a coauthor of the study and the director of the city's Nutrition Strategy Program. ""And now we know that it has really made a difference."" Health.com: The 22 worst foods for trans fat . The study is the first to examine the real-world impact of trans fat restrictions in restaurants, Curtis and her colleagues say. And it suggests that health regulations at the local level can have a measurable effect on public consumption — an important finding at a time when another pending citywide ban, this one on large sodas and sugary drinks, is generating headlines and controversy. The study included fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, KFC and Pizza Hut. Although the analysis was limited to New York City, many of those chains have chosen to eliminate trans fats nationwide as a result of the ban, Curtis says. ""It's a big health benefit for New Yorkers, but really we're looking at a much broader impact, as well,"" she says. Restaurants and food manufacturers use partially hydrogenated oils and fats in baking, frying and food processing. (Small amounts of trans fats also occur naturally in meat and dairy products.) Trans fats have been shown to raise ""bad"" LDL cholesterol while lowering ""good"" HDL cholesterol, and even moderate consumption has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Health.com: High cholesterol? Know the good and bad fats . As of 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required food manufacturers to include trans fats on the nutritional label of packaged foods. But because Americans eat more than one-third of their meals outside the home, this regulation addressed only part of the problem. The New York City ban, which was phased in between 2007 and 2008, was the first of its kind to target trans fats in restaurants, bakeries and other food-service establishments. The ban prohibits restaurants from serving foods or using ingredients that contain 0.5 grams or more of trans fats per serving. (The 0.5-gram cutoff is a nod to the FDA, which allows foods containing less than that amount to claim ""zero"" trans fats on their labels.) The restaurant industry initially opposed the ban, arguing that eliminating trans fats would be expensive and would alter the taste and texture of foods. Despite these early concerns, most restaurants were able to meet the new requirements by reformulating their recipes, reducing portion sizes and introducing new and healthier menu options, Curtis and her colleagues say. Health.com: Easy food swaps that cut cholesterol, not taste . In the new study, published this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine and funded by the City of New York and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, researchers at the city's department of health estimated trans fat intake by comparing nearly 15,000 lunch receipts from 168 fast-food locations with the nutritional info for the corresponding menu items. At the time the ban went into effect, some health advocates, including the American Heart Association, expressed concern that reducing trans fats would lead to an increase in the use of saturated fat, which also contributes to heart disease. But that doesn't seem to have happened. The average saturated fat content of lunchtime meals showed only a slight increase, 0.55 grams, between 2007 and 2009. The study provides a partial picture of the ban's effect, however. The researchers looked only at large fast-food chains, which are generally required to publish the nutritional content of their products, so they can't say how the ban has affected trans fat content at non-chain restaurants and other establishments. Health.com: 10 states that consume too much fast food . The new study comes just weeks after Mayor Bloomberg announced plans to restrict the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces in New York City. While the two bans address different health issues — fat versus sugar — the soda restriction could have a similar impact, says Alice Lichtenstein, a professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University, in Boston. The trans fat ban worked because it gave consumers a healthier default option and didn't require them to make a conscious change in their eating habits, Lichtenstein says. A ban on large sodas would accomplish much the same thing by eliminating an unhealthy menu item, although it will still address just one aspect of a much larger issue. ""The biggest health threat we face is our total caloric intake within the context of our physical activity levels and sedentary lives,"" says Lichtenstein, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. ""These changes are just small drops in that bucket, but we have to keep an open mind and try multiple approaches if we want to find more strategies that really work.""","There is a five-year-old ban on the use of trans fats in New York City's restaurants .

"(CNN) -- Few will long lament the departure of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. He was a weak choice for the job, seen as a comfortable one for President Barack Obama, a former senator he knew who was unlikely to ruffle feathers or be as challenging to work with as his stronger predecessors, Robert Gates or Leon Panetta. But if Obama thinks that pushing out Hagel will be seen as the housecleaning that many have recommended for his spluttering national security process, he is likely to be very disappointed. In the first instance, of course, Hagel can't be seen as the source of the tensions and frequent miscommunication that have existed between the Defense Department and the White House. Nor can White House whispers suggesting that he wasn't up to the job, especially with the new threats posed by ISIS, make that case any more compelling. No one can accuse Gates or Panetta of not having been up to the job -- and the tensions with the White House existed with them as well. Don't take my word for it. Read their books. Yes, things have been coming to a head with Hagel for a while. There was reportedly a tough memo he wrote to national security adviser Susan Rice taking issue with the administration's handling of the crisis in Syria. The details have yet to be leaked, but apparently it caused a firestorm in the White House. In addition, remarks by Hagel and senior military officials such as Gen. Martin Dempsey on how to fight ISIS have revealed gaps between the White House and Pentagon thinking that have frustrated officials close to Obama. In fact, it is not passivity or weakness that some thought Hagel would bring to the job that have caused his downfall. Rather it was in part caused by his toughness and refusal to be just one more comfortable insider from the Senate club that is all Obama knew of Washington before he took office as President. Indeed, the real problem that brought down Hagel had little to do with Hagel at all. It had to do with the fact that since Rice took over as national security adviser, the Obama administration has been buffeted by a stunning series of foreign policy missteps and challenges that have shaken confidence in the President at home and abroad. These include growing chaos in the wake of the intervention in Libya, the consequences of pulling out too quickly in Iraq, compounded by the consequences of failing to take effective action of any sort in Syria, the resultant rise of ISIS, the mishandling of the National Security Agency revelations in ways that alienated our allies, the weak response to the Crimean adventure of Vladimir Putin and a host of related problems. None of these can be traced to Hagel. Rather they are linked to a broken national security process, a President who has become reactive -- not proactive -- and defensive, who is more tactical than strategic and who, unlike past presidents serving a second term, has shown a resistance to growing in office as a statesman. In past presidencies, from George W. Bush to Clinton to Reagan, such growth has been accompanied by changing up their national security teams. Many have urged Obama to oversee such a shake-up. Hagel, who assumed his post shortly after the start of Obama's second term, was a sop to these critics. Easy to dismiss, not very popular and a weak advocate for the administration. Removing him will be unsettling to those in the Pentagon who realize he is being let go for advocating their views as well as to those throughout the administration who will worry whether getting rid of him will be seen as enough. The real changes needed are at a high level in the White House, in the team immediately around the President advising him on national security. Unless those changes happen, view the Hagel move as a distraction, as an effort to create the illusion of change where a shake-up is needed.","David Rothkopf: Hagel's departure isn't the foreign policy housecleaning some have urged .

"The United States has contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Edward Snowden, the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday. Federal prosecutors charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in Virginia on Friday. The United States already asked Hong Kong, where Snowden is believed to be in hiding, to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials. ""If Hong Kong doesn't act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong's commitment to the rule of law,"" the administration official said. The complaint charges Snowden with theft of government property, unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence to an unauthorized person. The latter two allegations amount to espionage under the federal Espionage Act. Snowden, 30, has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. Those leaks were the basis of reports in Britain's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post this month. The Guardian revealed Snowden's identify at his request. The documents revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the United States and monitor the Internet activity of overseas residents. The revelation rocked the Obama administration and U.S. intelligence community, raising questions about secret operations of the NSA and whether the agency was infringing on American civil liberties. Obama, top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach. They say the law allows collection of metadata, such as the time and numbers of phone calls, and that a special federal court must approve accessing the content -- listening to the call itself. In interviews earlier this month, Snowden said he fled with the classified documents after taking a leave of absence from his job as an intelligence analyst for NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamiliton. The company has since fired him. A series of blog posts this week purportedly by Snowden said he leaked classified details about U.S. surveillance programs because President Barack Obama worsened ""abusive"" practices, instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate. However, Obama ""closed the door on investigating systemic violations of law, deepened and expanded several abusive programs, and refused to spend the political capital to end the kind of human rights violations like we see in Guantanamo, where men still sit without charge,"" a blog post said. The Guardian newspaper and website identified the author as Snowden. Snowden said that he had to get out of the United States before the leaks were published by the Guardian and The Washington Post to avoid being targeted by the government. In the interview with the South China Morning Post, he said he plans to stay in Hong Kong to fight any attempt to force him to return to the United States because he has ""faith in Hong Kong's rule of law."" The complaint against him was filed under seal on June 14 in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, but it was unclear from the document whether the United States has asked or will be asking Hong Kong to detain Snowden. There have been ""some preliminary"" discussions with Hong Kong authorities, a U.S. official with knowledge of the process told CNN. The U.S. signed an extradition treaty with Hong Kong in 1996, just seven months before the then British colony was handed back to Beijing. Hong Kong's extradition laws had previously been governed by the United States-United Kingdom extradition treaty. This new treaty established an agreement under Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" that allows Hong Kong autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy.","U.S. contacts Hong Kong to seek Snowden's extradition .

"British authorities dropped charges against high-profile former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg on Wednesday, days before he was due to go on trial on charges of attending a terrorist training camp in Syria. Begg, from Birmingham in the English Midlands, will now be freed from prison, where he has been held since March, a West Midlands Police statement said. The case was discontinued after police and lawyers for the Crown Prosecution Service reviewed new material and concluded there was no longer a realistic prospect of gaining a conviction, the statement said. Begg's trial had been due to start on October 6. Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale said: ""New material has recently been disclosed to police and CPS, which has a significant impact on key pieces of evidence that underpinned the prosecution's case. Our criminal justice system -- quite rightly -- demands a very high standard of proof. ""I understand this is going to raise many questions. However, explaining what this newly revealed information is would mean discussing other aspects of the case which would be unfair and inappropriate as they are no longer going to be tested in court."" 'Testing time' Begg was charged with attending a terrorist training camp, facilitating terrorism and possession of a document likely to be of use to a terrorist. The London-based organization Cage, which campaigns for the rights of those affected by the ""war on terror"" and for which Begg worked as an outreach director, welcomed the decision to drop the charges. ""This has been a testing time for Moazzam, his family and the Muslim community,"" Asim Qureshi, research director of Cage, said in a statement. Qureshi accused UK authorities of criminalizing ""virtually any Muslim that has been to Syria"" and said Cage had also come under pressure to shut down. ""We hope that Moazzam's release is a sign that the government are now willing to adopt a more measured strategy in relation to anti-terrorism policy and avoid the attempt to criminalize all dissent and crush any organization like Cage that stands up for the rule of law and justice,"" he added. Author, speaker . Begg was arrested as a suspected al Qaeda member in Pakistan in February 2002 and was held at the U.S. airbase at Bagram, Afghanistan, before being sent to the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Begg spent nearly three years in custody. He was sent back to Britain by the Bush administration in early 2005 and was never prosecuted. He co-authored a book about his experiences at Guantanamo Bay in 2006 and has appeared as a public speaker and commentator in Britain and overseas since his release.","Group calls for the UK to pursue a ""more measured strategy"" on counterterrorism .

"The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday took a step toward essentially a total ban on artificial trans fats in America's food supply. This is not a trivial change. Not that long ago, trans fats were a part of all kinds of processed foods. Partially hydrogenated oils, as they are otherwise known, tend to improve both the shelf life and flavor of many foods. Trans fats have been around for more than a hundred years. They're used in a wide range of foods, from frozen pizza to microwave popcorn to packaged cookies. But trans fats are amazingly bad for you. By the 1990s, evidence was building that trans fats carried a significant risk for increasing coronary heart disease. Specifically, they were found not only to increase your level of  low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad cholesterol) but to decrease your level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or good cholesterol). Because of this, the negative effects of trans fats are about double those of saturated fat (which isn't that good for you, either). It gets worse. Trans fats also increase your level of lipoprotein(a) and triglycerides, both of which are thought to be associated with cardiovascular disease. These laboratory findings bear out in all kinds of epidemiologic studies showing that a diet containing higher levels of trans fats carried greater health risk than a diet similarly high in saturated fat. There has been a longstanding argument that we should stop using trans fats. The American Heart Association recommends that people's diets contain 2 grams or less of trans fats a day. That amount is what you might normally get in dairy products and meat. But if you eat processed foods, you'll end up consuming more trans fats. In 2006, the FDA started mandating that food labels list the amount of trans fats in foods in order to make consumers aware of their hazard. Some companies have made an effort to stay away from trans fats. McDonalds stopped using them 7 years ago. Burger King has a minimal amount in its foods, and that's from small amounts that are present naturally in meat and cheese. New York banned trans fats in restaurants in 2007. It was a controversial decision at the time, but consumption of trans fats in the city has dropped dramatically because of the ban. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that removing trans fats from the U.S. food supply could prevent about 20,000 heart attacks a year and 7,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease. Finally, the FDA issued a Federal Register notice announcing that trans fats are not ""generally recognized as safe."" Such a notice allows a period of time for people and businesses to comment and offer opinions and evidence if they believe that trans fats should not be banned. Of course, there are costs to such a move. The FDA estimates that it will cost about $8 billion initially to remove trans fats from the food supply. It believes the 20-year costs to be between $12 billion and $14 billion. I think it's likely that processed food producers will comply. There's almost no good evidence -- or argument -- to support the continued use of trans fats. In fact, it's been reported that some manufacturers have voluntarily lowered the use of trans fats by almost 75% in the past eight years. Given these moves, it's not hard to imagine them going the rest of the distance. There is some irony in this, of course. Trans fats first became more common in our diet because they were believed to be safer than animal fats (think margarine instead of butter). Turns out the opposite is true. The FDA's actions are putting us on the road to correcting that mistake, hopefully sooner rather than later.","The FDA took a first step toward eliminating artificial trans fats in food supply .

"Omar Hameed has no regrets about having worked with American forces while a Falluja police officer. Nor does he have hope -- at least in Iraq. ""There's no future for me here,"" the stoic 37-year-old man said. ""No future for me or for my kids."" That's why he is trying to get help from the country whose forces he once helped by applying for asylum in the United States with his wife and their four young children. Having a normal life in Iraq is unfeasible, Hameed contends. He is a marked man, targeted by militants overrunning his hometown of Falluja and other parts of his Middle Eastern nation. Need proof of his suffering, evidence of the steep price he's paid for having partnered with the United States and its Iraqi allies? Look down at Hameed's legs: One was blown off below the knee, the other at the upper thigh. READ MORE: 'Bad old days' return to Baghdad . From mechanic to Falluja police officer . Hameed had been a mechanic during the last days of Saddam Hussein's reign, before the U.S.-led invasion led to the heavy-handed leader's capture in December 2003. Hussein's capture and other decisions opened a vacuum in Iraq, during which U.S.-led international forces teamed with their fledgling Iraqi allies to quell ongoing violence. It also opened the door for Hameed to find a new calling as a police officer. One sign of the trouble around him came in 2004, when he spotted al Qaeda-linked insurgents planting a bomb outside his Falluja home. Dressed in black, the men worked fast to hide their handiwork in the dirt. ""I went out and spoke to them, and they told me to shut up or they would put my head on the sidewalk,"" Hameed recalls. ""I just had to turn around and walk inside."" But he didn't stay completely quiet. Hameed discreetly alerted American forces -- who were being targeted routinely by such militants -- about the bomb. U.S. troops showed up later at his central Iraqi house and made a very public display of arresting him. But it was all an act, Hameed explained, saying the Americans told him they had to make it ""look real because they wanted to take me to their base to talk."" In those conversations, Hameed said the coalition troops reached out to him. ""They asked if I would help them because of my police work,"" he remembered. ""And I agreed."" READ MORE: Ex-PM says violence could 'burn up' region . Parts of 2 legs lost, wrist deformed . Hameed returned to once again patrol the streets of Falluja. He also continued his alliance with U.S. forces, as evidenced in photographs of him proudly standing with American troops. Official documents signed by American officers praised his intelligence work and declared his efforts had undoubtedly saved American and Iraqi lives. But having such friends didn't mean Hameed was safe, especially after coalition forces started to pull out of Iraq. Nor did it mean that everyone was pleased with his work. He found that out in 2009, as he left his Falluja home to do some shopping. ""As I was driving my car, it suddenly exploded,"" Hameed said, adding that a ""sticky"" bomb had been affixed to his car. Two weeks in a Falluja hospital were followed by a year at medical facilities in Amman, Jordan. It left him with his left wrist scarred and deformed, twisted at a jarring angle. Today, there are prosthetics where the rest of Hameed's legs used to be, causing him to walk stiffly and awkwardly and to use a cane for balance. Still, he walks proudly. 'I don't know what to do' Hameed has spent the past few years moving between Jordan and relatives in northern Iraq, in addition to clandestine visits to Falluja to see his wife and children for a day or two. Coming home has become more dangerous in recent months in Falluja. This city some 70 kilometers (45 miles) west of Baghdad is seeing some of its worst violence in at least half a decade. Conflicting reports indicate the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq -- partially control the city in Anbar province.  Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki this month told his troops not to strike residential neighborhoods in Falluja, while at the same time appealing to the city's residents and tribes to expel ""terrorists"" there. READ MORE: Is Iraq worse than ever? Amid all this turmoil, Hameed hasn't been able to escape, even as he's tried to keep a low profile. In a visit there January 4, he said insurgents stopped him at a roadblock, tied up his hands and took him to a mosque they controlled. Hameed thought he was a dead man. ""They told me, 'We know you are Omar, you were working with the American troops and Iraqi police,"" he recalled. The militants showed him some mercy after he showed them the results of the bombing that maimed him. But he wasn't released until a few hours later, following what he described as calls from tribal leaders who argued that his severe injuries were punishment enough for cooperating with the Americans. Hameed hasn't turned back. His wife, 13-year-old son and three young daughters -- ages 9, 7 and 2 -- are now with him elsewhere in Iraq. They are waiting, like many other Iraqis, for American diplomats to decide on their asylum application. It's been about a year now.  Hameed argues his work with the Americans, the injuries he suffered because of that and the continued threats to his life are all reasons he and his family should be allowed to take the 7,000-mile journey across the Atlantic. Until then, he's in many ways lost in his homeland. ""I cannot work in Falluja, and I can't in Baghdad,"" Hameed said. ""I don't know what to do.""","Omar Hameed was a policeman in Falluja, where he worked with U.S. forces .
He says a bomb that destroyed parts of his legs was retribution for those efforts .

"Michael Jackson often cried after talking to AEG Live executives as he prepared for his comeback concerts, his oldest son testified Wednesday. ""After he got off the phone, he would cry,"" Prince Jackson testified. ""He would say 'They're going to kill me, they're going to kill me.'"" His father told him he was talking about AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips and his ex-manager, Dr. Tohme Tohme, Prince said. Prince, 16, began his testimony Wednesday morning in his family's wrongful death lawsuit against Jackson's last concert promoter, AEG Live. His first 30 minutes on the stand were filled with videos and photographs of Jackson with his children, but then the questioning by Jackson lawyer Brian Panish focused on the last weeks of his father's life. Prince testified that Phillips visited Jackson's rented Los Angeles mansion and spoke aggressively to Dr. Conrad Murray the night before his father's death. ""He was grabbing his elbow,"" Prince said. ""It looked aggressive to me. He was grabbing by the back of his elbow and they were really close and he was making hand motions."" He couldn't hear what Phillips was saying to Murray, he said. Michael Jackson was not there because he was at his last rehearsal, Prince said. He called his father from the security guard shack telephone to let him know Phillips was there. His father asked him to offer Phillips food and drink. Prince said that was his last conversation with his father. ""Sorry kids, your dad's dead"" Prince recounted the day his father died four years ago.  He saw his father ""hanging halfway off the bed, his eyes were rolled back,"" when he ran into the bedroom where Dr. Murray was doing CPR in a futile effort to revive him, he said. Paris followed him up the stairs, ""but we kept pulling her down the stair,"" he said. ""She was screaming the whole time saying she wants her daddy,"" he said. At the hospital later, Dr. Murray told them ""Sorry kids, your dad's dead,"" Prince testified. Prince was 12 when the pop icon died, but he said his father confided in him about whom he trusted and didn't trust and what he feared as he prepared for his comeback concerts. Michael Jackson's three children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- and their grandmother Katherine Jackson are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which contends AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death because the company hired, retained or supervised Murray, the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Murray told investigators he gave Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. The coroner ruled the singer died of an overdose of the drug. AEG Live executives allegedly created a medical conflict of interest that pressured Murray to pursue the dangerous treatments so Jackson would be rested for rehearsals, while ignoring warning signs that his health was failing, Jackson family lawyers argue. AEG Live lawyers contend that it was Jackson who chose and controlled the doctor and that company executives had no way of knowing what treatments Murray was delivering. Prince Jackson's 16th birthday gift: A career . AEG Live lead lawyer Marvin Putnam's cross-examination of Prince lasted just 25 minutes.  It centered on trying to discredit his testimony about Phillips' visit to his home and about cash payments that Prince said his father gave Murray at times. Prince stood by his story about the Phillips and Murray encounter, although he conceded it could have been two nights before his father's death and not the last night. The toll of losing their father . Prince's testimony gave Jackson lawyers a chance to show jurors the emotional toll suffered by Jackson's children, which they would have to put a dollar figure on if they conclude AEG Live is liable in their father's death. ""I can't sleep at night,""  Prince said.  ""I have a hard time sleeping.""  The death left him ""emotionally distant from a lot of people"" for a while, he said. He's missed sharing with his father ""the first day of going to school, having the first girlfriend, being able to drive,"" Prince testified. While Paris Jackson's suicide attempt and hospitalization was not brought up in court -- and it is unclear if jurors learned about it in the news -- Prince did speak about his sister. ""I think out of all of my siblings she was probably hit the hardest because she was my dad's princess,"" he said. Prince said the questioning of Paris by AEG Live lawyers over two days in March was painful for her.  ""She had some problems before, after and, I assume, during,"" he said. ""She definitely is dealing with it in her own way,"" her brother said. Paris, who was 11 when her father died, is not available to testify in person in court because she is hospitalized for psychiatric treatment. While he and his sister no longer want to celebrate birthdays because ""it's not the same without"" their father, Blanket, now 11, does, Prince said. ""Right now, I don't know if Blanket realizes what he lost,"" he said.  ""He was so young.  He is still growing up just like I am and he doesn't have a father to guide him."" AEG Live attempted to compel Blanket, the youngest child, to testify, but the judge rejected its request after a psychologist said it would harm the boy. Changing the world? Jurors watched a home video of Michael Jackson questioning his three children about how they planned ""to change the world"" when they grow up. Prince testified that the video was made at Christmas. ""What's Christmas mean?"" Jackson is heard asking his children. ""Love,"" Blanket responded. ""Who's Blanket going to be to change this world?"" Jackson asked. ""I don't know,"" Blanket, who appeared to be about 5 at the time, answered. ""What does Paris want to do?  Be honest search your heart,"" Jackson said. ""Help the poor,"" she answered.  Paris also said she would like to be a gymnast. Prince told his father he aspired to be a movie director and  architect because he liked ""making things."" Private details revealed . Prince, who said his grade point average is 3.68 at the private school in Sherman Oaks, California, at the end of his sophomore year.  He is a member of the National Honors Society and received artistic awards at school, he said. His extracurricular activities include martial arts and working as a mechanic in his school's robotics program, he said.   He wants to attend the University of Southern California to study film and business, he said. His father taught him how ""the great ones"" made movies, including how to ""find shots.""  He gave him a lens that hung on a necklace that showed what a shot would look like, he said. Prince said while his school requires a certain amount of community service, he's does more than that.  He volunteers at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles in a program that delivers books to young patients ""to keep their minds off their problems."" His father ""always said you should give back to the community and help out as much as you can,"" Prince said. The jury was shown video of Jackson and his children at the Neverland Ranch where they lived until moving after Jackson was acquitted in a child molestation trial. The family moved after the court case ""because there were complications,"" Prince said.  ""They ruined it for my dad."" One video showed a giraffe and several alpacas in the Neverland Zoo.  ""I never really went near them because they would spit on us,"" Prince said. The video also showed the carnival rides at Neverland.  ""We only went there and to the zoo on special occasions because my dad wanted us to remain humble,"" he said. When shown a photo of his father sitting with him at a piano, Prince said ""I can never play an instrument and I definitely can't sing.""

"Sen. Rand Paul made clear to his team of political advisers Wednesday that he'll run for re-election to the Senate in 2016 and reiterated that he won't make a decision on a presidential run until next spring, according to a spokesman. His strategists met behind closed doors at a Washington hotel Wednesday to sketch out a road map for 2015 and review the past two years, during which Paul traveled to 35 states campaigning for candidates and raising his national profile. Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, attended most of the meetings as well as a group dinner in the evening, said spokesman Sergio Gor. The sessions, led by RAND PAC executive director Doug Stafford, covered fundraising performance, grassroots engagement, communications, outreach and other areas of interest, though Gor did not give specifics. Paul has long made it known that he plans to campaign for a second term in the Senate, but questions have emerged over whether he can run for his seat and for the White House at the same time. Kentucky law prohibits candidates from appearing on the same ballot for two different offices. Attempts to change the law were made last year in the GOP-controlled state Senate but stalled in the Democratic-controlled state House. Attempts by Republicans to retake control of the state House in last week's elections were unsuccessful, meaning the law will likely stay in the books for 2016. Some of Paul's supporters have argued the law could be challenged, while others say there are ways he can get around it so that his name won't appear on the ballot twice. One such scenario would mean the state party changes its presidential primary to a caucus system. Attendees at Wednesday's meeting included Michael Biundo of New Hampshire. Biundo, who previously chaired Rick Santorum's presidential campaign, was one of a number key hires this year by RAND PAC in early primary states. The team also added Steve Grubbs and A.J. Spiker -- both former chairmen of the Iowa Republican Party -- as well as Republican consultant John Yob in Michigan.","Rand Paul meets with his advisers to lay out a road map for 2016, his spokesman said .

"(CNN)As further proof that you can now 3D-print anything, a company called Natural Machines has introduced a 3D printer for food. The ""Foodini,"" as it's called, isn't too different from a regular 3D printer, but instead of printing with plastics, it deploys edible ingredients squeezed out of stainless steel capsules: ""It's the same technology,"" says Lynette Kucsma, co-founder of Natural Machines, ""but with plastics there's just one melting point, whereas with food it's different temperatures, consistencies and textures. Also, gravity works a little bit against us, as food doesn't hold the shape as well as plastic."" The Barcelona-based startup behind the machine says it's the only one of its kind capable of printing a wide range of dishes, from sweet to savory. ""In essence, this is a mini food manufacturing plant shrunk down to the size of an oven,"" Kucsma said, pointing out that at least in the initial stage the printer will be targeted mostly at professional kitchen users, with a consumer version to follow, at a projected retail price of around $1,000. In principle, the Foodini sounds like the ultimate laziness aid: press a button to print your ravioli. But Natural Machines is quick to point out that it's designed to take care only of the difficult and time-consuming parts of food preparation that discourage people from cooking at home, and that it promotes healthy eating by requiring fresh ingredients prepared before printing. Nevertheless, the company is working with major food manufacturers to create pre-packaged plastic capsules that can just be loaded into the machine to make food, even though they assure these will be free of preservatives, with a shelf life limited to five days. The printing process is slow, but faster than regular 3D printing. Other than being capable of creating complex designs, such as very detailed cake decorations or food arranged in unusual shapes, the Foodini can be useful for recipes that require precision and dexterity, like homemade pizza or filled pasta. Currently, the device only prints the food, which must be then cooked as usual. But a future model will also cook the preparation and produce it ready to eat. The idea also comes with a social element too. ""There's a touchscreen on the front that connects to a recipe site in the cloud, so it's an internet-of-things, connected kitchen appliance,"" said Kucsma. Users will also be able to control the device remotely using a smartphone, and share their recipes with the community. That is, if people don't balk at the idea of eating printed food. ""We have done tests and everybody liked the food,"" explains Kucsma. ""Take the microwave oven, for example: in the 70s, people were a bit fearful about it, they thought food could be poisoned with radiation or something, but fast forward 30 years, and there's one in every household. This is real food, with real fresh ingredients, it's just prepared using a new technology.""

"It was a brazen attack, resulting in the death of the most senior U.S. officer since 9/11, and officials have named the attacker as a member of Afghan's military. Maj. Gen. Harold Greene -- a longtime officer who was leading efforts to train soldiers in Afghanistan -- was killed Tuesday at a military training facility in Kabul. An ISAF official said that the group was standing outside, and the attacker, who has been identified by the Afghan Ministry of Defense as an academy member named Rafiullah, shot from inside a nearby building at a distance of about 100 yards. The assailant had served in the academy for two and a half years, Zahir Azimi, an Afghan Ministry of Defense spokesperson, told CNN. Pentagon officials went out of their way to say the shooting would not change the relationship between U.S. and Afghan forces. ""I've seen no indication that there's a degradation of trust between coalition members and their Afghan counterparts,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters Tuesday. But the deadly ambush at a premier training facility for Afghan military officers raises questions about the vetting process for Afghan soldiers and also the upcoming handover of security to Afghan forces. ""When something like this happens, in the least it creates a crisis of confidence for Afghans and for us,"" said Vali Nasr, dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. So far, the Taliban has acknowledged the general's killing, but hasn't claimed responsibility for it. The Afghan Ministry of Defense continues to investigate the incident. The Pentagon isn't commenting on the possibility of Taliban involvement, saying the Afghan military and international forces are in the early stages of an investigation. Nasr told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that the attack raises serious concerns as the United States prepares to withdraw forces from Afghanistan. ""The Taliban have proven today they can infiltrate this force at will,"" he said. ""The discipline we are seeking or that we are claiming is not there, and I think it is very difficult for the administration to say that everything is going according to plan, as if this is just an isolated incident and we can just leave."" But it's still unclear whether the gunman had Taliban ties and whether he slipped through the military's screening process, said Philip Mudd, a CNN counterterrorism analyst and former CIA official. ""I don't think we should look and make judgments about the vetting process too quickly,"" he said. ""You would think on the surface that maybe he was recruited by the Taliban. That's not necessarily the case."" Witnessing the horrors of war sometimes inspires soldiers to turn against their onetime allies, he said. ""He might have seen something in the last months or years... and sometimes there is an emotional switch that turns on after their recruitment, after their vetting, that leads them to say, 'I want to do something about this. I'm going to kill someone in the U.S. military,'"" Mudd said. Insider attacks: When Afghan soldiers turns and kill allies . 'Routine visit' turns deadly . The attack occurred during a routine visit to the Marshal Fahim National Defense University in Kabul to look at improvements made at the school, Kirby said. In addition to the general's slaying, up to 15 coalition troops were wounded in the shooting rampage. The shooter was wearing an Afghan military uniform and is believed to be someone who had served for some time in a unit of the Afghan armed forces, Kirby said. ""A person that we believe was an Afghan soldier opened fire and hit many with his weapon,"" he said. The Afghan Defense Ministry described the shooter as a ""terrorist"" and said Afghan soldiers shot him dead. General helped lead training . Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno released a condolence statement confirming Greene's death. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene's family, and the families of our soldiers who were injured today in the tragic events that took place in Afghanistan,"" Odierno said in the statement, referring to other officers who were hurt. ""These soldiers were professionals, committed to the mission. It is their service and sacrifice that define us as an Army. "" Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, described the general as a very experienced officer who was a leader in the training command in Afghanistan. He was an expert in infrastructure and logistics, Kirby said. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed condolences on his official Facebook page Tuesday night. ""We serve, and where we serve we are often at risk,"" he said. ""God bless those wounded and killed in Afghanistan yesterday and their families."" Insider attacks: 'A threat you can't completely eliminate' This isn't the first time people dressed in Afghan security forces uniforms have attacked coalition forces who have worked to thwart such violence. ""The insider threat is one that we've been focused on for quite some time. ... It is a threat you can't completely eliminate,"" Kirby told CNN. But it's a threat that can be mitigated, he said. And officials stress that statistics show that the numbers of such attacks have decreased. In 2012, so-called ""green on blue"" insider attacks took the lives of dozens of coalition troops, and the U.S. command in Kabul halted some joint operations with Afghan security forces, CNN has previously reported. Two attackers wearing Afghan military uniforms killed two U.S. service members in February in Afghanistan, the military publication Stars and Stripes reported. In October 2013, a man in an Afghan soldier's uniform shot and killed an ISAF member in eastern Afghanistan, CNN reported. According to an April 2014 Pentagon report, insider attacks against ISAF forces declined from 48 attacks in 2012 to 15 attacks in 2013. In the first quarter of 2014, there were two insider attacks against ISAF. ""Despite this sharp decline, these attacks may still have strategic effects on the campaign and could jeopardize the relationship between coalition and ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces] personnel,"" the report reads. Kirby called insider attacks ""a pernicious threat"" that are ""difficult to always ascertain, to come to grips with... anywhere, particularly in a place like Afghanistan."" ""Afghanistan is still a war zone,"" he said. Numerous security protocols were instituted a few years ago to help ensure military personnel are safe, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The United States will review the circumstances of Tuesday's shooting to see if any changes should be made. White House: Attack is 'painful reminder' of troops' sacrifice . President Barack Obama was briefed about the shooting and called Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, to get more information, Earnest said. ""While we have made tremendous progress in disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda operations and leadership in Afghanistan and progress in winding down U.S. involvement in that conflict, this shooting, of course, is a painful reminder of the service and sacrifice that our men and women in uniform make every day for this country,"" Earnest said. In February, the Obama administration announced for the first time that it had begun planning for the possible withdrawal of all U.S. troops by the end of 2014 if Afghanistan did not sign a security agreement pertaining to rights of U.S. troops operating there. In May, Obama said that if the Afghan government signs a security agreement, virtually all U.S. forces would be out of the country by the end of 2016, shortly before his presidency ends. He called for 9,800 U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan after the end of 2014, along with some allied forces. The number would get cut roughly in half by the end of 2015, and a year later the U.S. military presence would scale down to what officials described as a ""normal"" embassy security contingent. Kirby told reporters Tuesday that Afghan National Security Forces ""continue to perform at a very strong level of competence and confidence, and warfare capability."" The U.S. military feels that the Afghan military ""grows stronger by the week"" and noted that they are already ""in the lead in combat missions"" throughout the country, he said. ""They'll be completely in the lead for military operations by the end of the year,"" Kirby said. ""We see no change in that."" 2 U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan .","Afghan Ministry of Defense names assailant as academy member named Rafiullah .

"A ceasefire negotiated between rival Muslim and Christian militias brought a brief respite Saturday to a Central African Republic town after two days of violent clashes. The truce between the Muslim Seleka militia and the Christian anti-Balaka in Bossangoa allowed aid agencies to begin assessing the needs of the population caught in the midst of the violence. At the Ecole Liberte school, where a makeshift displaced camp sprang up in September to harbor fleeing Muslims, the numbers swelled during the clashes from around 2,500 displaced to nearly 10,000. The people there are in need of almost everything: food, water and shelter. Over in a Catholic Church compound where 35,000 Christians sought refuge from the Seleka militias in September, the camp is more established, but water and food supplies are dwindling and there is very little shelter from the elements. Malaria and malnutrition are all too common among the camps' denizens. A tense standoff had developed earlier between the Seleka and the regional peacekeeping force, FOMAC, after the militia threw grenades into the compound in an attempt to storm it. A soldier from FOMAC was killed during an exchange of fire. There is still no official death toll, but witnesses at the Ecole Liberte camp told CNN at least 19 Muslims were killed in what has become a spiraling cycle of retribution between the two communities. The anti-Balaka began targeting Muslims after tens of thousands of Christians were forced to flee their homes as Seleka militias marauded through the countryside. 'Extremely dire circumstances' Julian Donald overseeing a hospital in Bossangoa managed by Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres, said the aid group had worked through the violence, almost overwhelmed by the flood of patients. ""We have been fully operational the entire time,"" he said. ""I can't give you any numbers right now, I'm sorry, all I can say is it's still ongoing."" But the work he and his agency do is not enough, Donald said. The Central African Republic desperately needs more help from the outside world. ""A situation where you have hundreds of thousands of people who through no fault of their own are living in extremely dire circumstances, I would hope that the international community would mobilize to provide them assistance,"" he said. ""The fact that we haven't seen it happen yet is a tragedy."" Some help could be on the way. On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a resolution approving military intervention in the Central African Republic by an African Union-led force, backed by French troops, to protect civilians, restore humanitarian access and stabilize the country. The number of African Union peacekeeping troops in the country will increase to 6,000 -- up from the current 3,500 -- the French presidency said. Central African Republic: What's going on, what's at stake, what's next . French forces arrive . France has named this mission in its former colony Operation Sangaris, after a species of butterfly there. There will be 1,600 troops in the Central African Republic by the end of Saturday, French President Francois Hollande said at the Peace and Security in Africa Summit in Paris. By Saturday evening, some of them had arrived in the northern city of Bossangoa. France's goal is for the nation to be able to hold elections once security is restored, in the same way that France helped Mali return to democracy, Hollande said. France's intervention in the Central African Republic is for humanitarian reasons, not to fight terrorism, he said. There have not been many incidents of violence in the country Saturday, Hollande added. The start of the French soldiers' new operation in the CAR capital was announced Friday morning by Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on the French radio station RFI. About 185 miles south of Bossangoa, Bangui has also been rocked by two days of clashes. Many have flocked to the city's airport, hoping to find safety there. ""We estimate at least at 400 to 500 people have been killed so far in Bangui and the killings continue,"" Peter N. Bouckaert, emergencies director for Human Rights Watch, told CNN Saturday. ""Two hundred and eighty bodies were recovered as of yesterday, but the Red Cross tells us there are more bodies on the streets that they are working to recover."" Medecins Sans Frontieres said Friday that at least 92 bodies had been brought to the morgue of a hospital where its staff is working. Another 170 people have been treated for injuries, including gunshot, machete or knife wounds, it said. Opinion: Why Central African Republic is slipping close to catastrophe . Air sorties . A French Defense Ministry statement early Saturday said three helicopters and hundreds more troops had arrived in Bangui. French troops have been out on patrol in a bid to restore calm to the city, which remains tense, as well as working to safeguard French nationals and secure the airport, the statement said. Aerial sorties have also been launched above the capital to signal the French forces' presence to armed forces thought to be opposed to them. Back at the Catholic Church compound in Bossangoa, people scattered, screaming, as the unfamiliar boom of a low-flying jet swept over them. The horror soon turned to laughs of jubilation, however, with shouts of ""The French! The French!"" Desperate for help from the outside world, they hoped the sonic boom was a sign from the French forces that they would soon be there too.

"(CNN)Two U.S. jets this week intercepted six Russian planes that neared U.S. airspace off Alaska and Canadian planes intercepted two Russian bombers that approached Canadian airspace, NORAD reported. A U.S. official told CNN's Barbara Starr that officials in Washington think the incidents were related to the visit by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who talked to Canadian officials Wednesday and President Barack Obama on Thursday. The United States promised Ukraine $46 million in nonlethal aid for its battle with pro-Russian militants. On Wednesday evening, two Alaskan-based F-22 fighter jets intercepted two Russian IL-78 refueling tankers, two Russian Mig-31 fighter jets and two Russian Bear long-range bombers, according to Capt. Jeff Davis of the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). More than six hours later, early Thursday morning, two Canadian CF-18 fighter jets intercepted two Russian Bear long-range bombers in the Beaufort Sea, Davis said. Those Russian planes came within about 40 nautical miles of the Canadian coastline, he said. Though the planes did not enter sovereign territory, the statement said, they did enter the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone west of Alaska and the Canadian ADIZ, according to a statement. U.S. official: Spy plane flees Russian jet, radar . The ADIZ is a zone of airspace which extends about 200 miles from the coastline and is mainly within international airspace, according to the statement.  The outer limits of the ADIZ go beyond U.S. sovereign air space. Dutch fighter jets intercept 2 Russian bombers in their airspace . State aircraft of sovereign nations are not required to file flight plans. NORAD said it has intercepted more than 50 Russian aircraft in the last five years.

"With arms around each other's shoulders, Wu Yebin and An Wei strolled past rows of food booths and game stalls along the main road cutting through their small village in northern China one recent Friday morning. Looking like two buddies soaking in the sights and sounds of the village fair, the young men wearing matching rings blended in perfectly with the local crowd. Their story, however, stands out: They are an openly gay couple living in the Chinese countryside, where homosexuality remains largely taboo. ""They sought medical treatment for me and hired a shaman to exorcise me,"" recalled Wu of his family's reaction when he came out. ""I had to comply -- but at the same time I found information on homosexuality online and shared with them. ""The more they learned, the more accepting they became,"" he added. It took his parents several years to come around, but Wu and An -- who had met online and quickly fallen in love -- now live together and run a roadside convenience store next to the Wu family home in rural Hebei province. As news of advancements in gay rights in other countries spreads, the two partners in life and business have been thinking more about cementing their own relationship. ""I hope to see same-sex marriage become legal in China one day,"" An, 32, said. ""We'll go get the license right away to enjoy all the rights like married straight couples."" ""It's going to happen,"" Wu, 29, chimed in. ""I bet next year."" Not everyone is so optimistic though. A lesbian couple in Beijing recently saw their marriage application rejected by local officials and video of their futile attempt made the rounds on the Internet. Activists also complain about periodic government crackdowns, citing a recent case in May. In the central city of Changsha, a 19-year-old activist leading a street rally against homophobia was jailed for 12 days. Local police accused him of ""holding an illegal protest"" in a statement. ""They aren't just targeting gay groups,"" said Xiaogang Wei, a prominent gay rights advocate who heads the Beijing Gender Health Education Institute. ""The authorities are increasingly worried about the organizational capability of various rights groups, especially when we band together, because it could challenge their political power. ""Sometimes we have to take to the streets to raise the visibility of our cause,"" he added. ""It stirs discussion and debate, which could eventually lead to more understanding and acceptance."" Homosexuality is not illegal in China and the Communist government has long removed it from the official list of mental disorders, but activists and experts agree that prejudices and discrimination persist. ""Gay people still can't make their voices heard and they have no representation in the legislature,"" said Li Yinhe, a renowned sociologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Science. In China, LGBT citizens seek acceptance . Li conducted China's first comprehensive surveys on gay men and published her findings in a popular 1992 book. For more than a decade, she has been calling on national legislators to legalize same-sex marriage but sees a prolonged uphill battle ahead. ""This is an issue affecting a minority group and ranks really low on the government's agenda,"" she said. Opposition to a different kind of ""gay marriage,"" however, has become a priority for many activists. Unlike in the West, experts say the vast majority of gay people in China -- especially men -- stay in the closet and marry the opposite sex. Noting the lack of hostility toward homosexuality throughout Chinese history, Li explains that the Confucian concept of carrying on the family line is ""the only thing akin to religion in traditional Chinese culture. ""That's why so many gay men are put under tremendous pressure to get married and have children, especially in the countryside."" An had three girlfriends and almost tied the knot with the last one. Wu was married to a woman for 40 days -- and regrets have dogged him since. ""Sometimes when I lie on bed, I think of my ex-wife and still feel guilty,"" he said, recalling how much she cried during their brief sexless marriage. ""My momentary lapse of judgment ruined her life: Even though I never touched her, it'd be hard for her to find an ideal husband as a divorcee."" State media has cited one estimate putting the number of Chinese women married to gay men at more than 10 million. Sociologist Li calls those unions ""tragedies"" and has counseled many women in such marriages. While a nationwide support network has emerged to help so-called ""gay wives"" -- or ""tongqi"" in Chinese -- break free, observers note a small but growing number of young gay men in big cities marrying lesbians to placate families and maintain their lifestyles at the same time. Wu and An are no fans of such arrangements, and predict personal and financial complications. After he met An, Wu started tweeting on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter with more than 300 million users. By telling his own story and re-posting news on global gay rights campaigns, Wu hopes to inspire more closeted gay Chinese to come out. Remembering his own days of feeling lonely, helpless and even suicidal, Wu points to his experience as evidence of progress and hope in gay acceptance in China -- even in the most unlikely families and places. Back at the village fair, Wu and An -- whose rural hometown has no cinemas let alone gay bars -- paused for a ""face-changing"" opera performance as an actor quickly switched colorful masks on stage without revealing his identity. After cheering the entertainer, the two young men who have taken off their ""masks"" in real life moved on to buy groceries as meat and vegetable sellers greeted them as old friends. ""Many people say they admire us -- they say we did something amazing,"" Wu said. ""We are just two ordinary people who came out to our families so that we can live with our loved ones."" And maybe one day, get married.","Wu Yebin and An Wei live in rural China where homosexuality remains largely taboo .

"Accused serial strangler Antonio Rodriguez was convicted Thursday of three counts of murder and sentenced to three life terms, according to the office of Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams. Common Pleas Court Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart found Rodriguez guilty of three counts of first-degree murder following the non-jury trial that started Monday. Rodriguez also was convicted of three counts of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and abuse of a corpse. ""My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Elaine Goldberg, Nicole Piacentini, and Casey Mahoney,"" Williams said in a statement.  ""I cannot begin to imagine the pain you are going through, but I hope this verdict will give you some sense of justice."" ""The city of Philadelphia is a little bit safer tonight now that Antonio Rodriguez will be spending the rest of his life behind bars,"" Williams said. Nicknamed the ""Kensington Strangler,"" for the neighborhood where the crimes occurred, the now 23-year-old Rodriguez was arrested after DNA testing linked him to the attacks. In February 2011, Rodriguez appeared at a preliminary hearing where two police detectives read the sexually explicit confessions he gave regarding three women who were killed and sexually assaulted between November and December 2010. Rodriguez was convicted of killing Casey Mahoney, 27; Elaine Goldberg, 21; and Nicole Piacentini, 35. During the strangling spree, a 33-year-old woman was pulled into an alley and may have been the victim of the same attacker, police said. Despite being choked, punched and hit on the head with a brick, she escaped her assailant, who fled from the scene, according to the police report.

"President Barack Obama will ease sanctions imposed against Cuba under the U.S. embargo after Cuba agreed to release American aid worker Alan Gross. The agreement will deliver the most sweeping changes in the U.S. policy toward the nation that lies just 100 miles off the U.S. coast since the U.S. embargo on Cuba started in the early 1960s. Most Americans - including President Obama - weren't alive when the embargo went into effect. So get up to speed on the last five decades of American foreign policy toward Cuba. Why did the embargo start in the first place? The U.S. began imposing sanctions against Cuba after Fidel Castro seized power in 1959 and soon after nationalized more than $1 billion in American assets on the island. That's two years before Obama was even born. The U.S. ratcheted up sanctions on Cuba in 1960 and 1961 with President John F. Kennedy making the embargo official in 1962. Diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba broke off in 1961 as tensions between the two nations increased after Cuba signed a trade agreement with the Soviet Union. Relations remained mostly frozen throughout the Cold War. Today, Cuba remains an autocratic regime - Fidel Castro's brother Raul is president - with a poor record on human rights and a track record of silencing dissent and restricting the rights of its citizens. What kind of restrictions does the embargo currently impose? The embargo not only keeps American companies from doing business in Cuba, but also prohibits most Americans from traveling directly there or spending money as tourists. American citizens can face up to a $65,000 fine for spending money in Cuba, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The embargo also limits the amount of individuals can send to family living in Cuba. So what's changing? Both countries will work toward reestablishing embassies. The U.S. will ease travel restrictions, making it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba and do business there. U.S. and Cuban banks will be allowed to start building relationships and that means American travelers will be able to use their credit and debit cards when visiting. Americans returning from a trip to Cuba can now return with up to $400 in Cuban goods, a quarter of which can be spent on alcohol and tobacco. Think Cuban cigars. Is U.S.-Cuba prisoner swap an ice breaker? And in return, Cuba will free 53 political prisoners and significantly relax its restrictions on Internet access. Gross had been arrested after delivering satellite phones and other communications equipment to Cuba's small Jewish population. So why doesn't Obama just end the embargo altogether? He can't. Only Congress can end a trade embargo, which is enshrined into law. But according to White House officials, the President can ease certain restrictions under his executive authority. This is the third time Obama has acted to ease the embargo. But policy changes in 2009 and 2011, which eased travel restrictions for Cuban-Americans and later for academics and religious groups, didn't come close to the scope of Wednesday's landmark agreement. Cuba Fast Facts . Does the U.S. have international backing to keep the embargo in place? Barely. Over the last two decades, the United Nations General Assembly has voted each year against the embargo, calling on the U.S. to reverse its policy. Only Israel has joined the U.S. in voting against the resolution. What's the political climate like in the U.S.? It's shifting and more political leaders and Cuban-Americans have been calling for changes in the U.S.'s policy toward Cuba in recent years. Cuban refugees in the U.S and their descendants have historically been the most vocal group in calling for a tough U.S. policy against Cuba. But nearly 7 in 10 Cubans now favor reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba and about half want the U.S. to end the embargo, according to a Florida International University poll this summer. That has changed the climate of politics in the Miami-area and throughout Florida where most of the Cuban-American community resides, a shift that is sending ripples throughout the country. What have politicians been saying about Cuba recently and what's the Pope got to do with it? Former Secretary of State and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has called for an end to the embargo, calling it ""Fidel Castro's best friend."" And President Obama stopped short of calling for an end to the embargo, but made it clear in 2013 that the U.S. policy needs to change. ""The notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today, in the age of the Internet and Google and world travel, doesn't make sense,"" Obama said at a November 2013 fundraiser in Florida. ""We have to continue to update our policies."" A month later, Obama shook hands with Castro at Nelson Mandela's funeral in South Africa in a moment that played on TV screens around the world. Since then, negotiations have continued and even the Pope weighed in. He recently wrote letters to both Obama and Castro encouraging compromise. But a pair of potential 2016 Republican presidential candidates from Florida have emphatically defended the embargo. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who announced Tuesday his decision to ""actively explore"" a 2016 run, said this year the ban should actually be strengthened, not lifted. And Sen. Marco Rubio, whose parents fled Cuba after Fidel Castro's takeover, has called the embargo ""the last tool we have remaining to ensure that democracy returns to Cuba one day."" How has Gross' detention impacted the debate? Gross' imprisonment in 2009 set off a series of diplomatic exchanges between the two countries that involved prominent U.S. politicians. Sen. Patrick Leahy, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, led congressional delegations to Cuba in 2012 and 2013 to secure Gross' release that included in 2013 three Democratic Senators, a Republican Senator and two Democratic congressmen. That same year, 66 senators wrote President Obama urging him to ""act expeditiously to take whatever steps are in the national interest to obtain [Gross's] release."" And in November, Sens. Jeff Flake, a Republican, and Democrat Tom Udall traveled to Cuba in another attempt to negotiate Gross' release. In 2011, former President Jimmy Carter also made an attempt as did former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, whose efforts were backed by the State Department. Sounds like a lot of political capital has been poured into this effort. How much has Cuba been impacted by the embargo? Cuba said in 2011 that the economic damage of the U.S. embargo has topped $1 trillion in its five decade history. The embargo's crippling effects on the Cuban economy prompted Raul Castro, the brother of the country's famed dictator, to beef up efforts to end the embargo once he took the helm in 2008. While Cuba was sustained by a serious trading relationship with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War, the Cuban economy took a hard hit with the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991.","Obama will ease sanctions imposed against Cuba for more than 50 years following the release of Alan Gross .

"(CNN) -- Don't ask Jerry Seinfeld about race. In a recent interview with Buzzfeed on ""CBS This Morning"" the comedian was asked about the fact that most of the guests on his Web series ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee"" have been white males. Seinfeld's initial response was ""It really pisses me off."" ""People think [comedy] is the census or something, it's gotta represent the actual pie chart of America,"" he said. ""Who cares?"" With his Super Bowl commercial, Seinfeld is back on the radar, but his comments come at the same time as debate about diversity in comedy. ""Saturday Night Live"" hired its first black female cast member in years after an outcry over the show's lack of diversity. Gawker writer Kyle Chayka writes that by Seinfeld saying, ""I have no interest in gender or race or anything like that,"" the comic ""seems to suggest that any comedian who is not a white male is also not funny, though he's also likely fed up with the amount of bad comedy he's been forced to sit through in his (waning) career."" ""Which is too bad, because Seinfeld is downplaying the work of everyone from Richard Pryor and Bill Cosby to Aziz Ansari, Mindy Kaling, and Eddie Huang, who are all in various stages of their own sitcoms that just might turn out to be the next 'Seinfeld,' "" Chayka writes. It's not the first time Seinfeld has faced criticism regarding racial issues. When his hit NBC series ""Seinfeld"" ended in 1998, the Los Angeles Times had a feature about how it was a ""nonevent"" for many in the black community because it had never seemed to capture the black audience because of a perceived lack of diversity. ""Observers said that the lack of 'Seinfeld' fever among blacks is mainly attributable to the almost total absence of minority characters on the New York-based sitcom,"" reported Los Angeles Times writer Greg Braxton. ""Some supporting characters -- including an attorney modeled after defense lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. -- have been featured in the last few seasons, but many said the show is still seen as a program that excludes minorities.""","Seinfeld questioned about lack of diversity on his Web series .

"As authorities spent weeks looking for accused killer Eric Frein in eastern Pennsylvania, he apparently was using his laptop to access open wireless connections and gain access to the Internet. According to an application for a search warrant filed by the Pennsylvania State Police, Frein had a Lenovo Thinkpad and two portable storage drives with him when the 31-year-old survivalist and military buff was captured last week at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, Pennsylvania. Authorities want to know what is on the laptop and on Saturday asked a judge for permission to search the computer. Frein told authorities he used the laptop and unsecured Wi-Fi accounts during the nearly seven-week long search, the court document says. A crew from CNN affiliate WNEP drove down the road near where he was taken into custody and found a few homes that could have provided the open access. One of the websites he could have accessed provided links to listen to police radio traffic, WNEP reported. The application for the warrant also describes how authorities had already searched a computer from Frein's home and discovered some disturbing Internet searches that went back to November 2012. The searches included: ""how to escape a manhunt,"" ""can police track cell phone"" and ""ballistics trajectory calculator."" Frein is charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in a September 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove. He's accused of killing Cpl.

"As soon as passengers arrive at the Rovos Rail station in Pretoria, South Africa, it's clear this won't be a typical train journey. No crowds, just fellow guests -- and only a few dozen of them -- heading on a three-day trip to Cape Town. Inside the meticulously restored building, champagne flows freely and ceiling fans turn leisurely. Occasionally the resident peacocks squawk as they preen around the platform, until they scatter with the arrival of the steaming locomotive. Yes, steaming, as if it was headed to Hogwarts, because that's what this pretty much is: a storybook rail safari through Africa. Rovos Rail offers a series of journeys across South Africa and beyond that allow passengers to encounter the region's spectacular scenery and some of the big beasts that roam it. Itineraries include trips between the South African cities of Pretoria and Durban that take in the Nambiti Conservancy (a Big Five retreat in KwaZulu-Natal) or to Victoria Falls via Botswana, Zimbabwe and the Hwange National Park wildlife sanctuary. Hot tub on rails . The trains are billed as the most luxurious in the world. That's hard to dispute. In the 16-square-meter (172-square-foot) Royal Suite, there's a double bed, richly upholstered armchairs and a full Victorian bath for lounging in the tub and watching the world roll by. The room for this short trip carries a price tag of 28,600 rand ($2,570) a person, but there's a seven-square-meter Pullman for half that, or a Deluxe Suite that lands somewhere in between. There are few modern nuisances to distract from the landscape views. No televisions, no Wi-Fi. Cell phones are discouraged and laptops forbidden outside of suites. ""We don't want any work being done in public,"" Rovos founder Rohan Vos tells passengers before they board. ""Ambiance and good conversation, that's what this train is all about."" To encourage this, the journey from Pretoria begins with high tea. The observation car is at the rear of the train. One portion is glassed off to protect the smokers, who have a tendency to wander off when they leave the train to grab a puff. It's not the prime place to be in any case. It's best to claim a spot at the very rear of the car, which is gloriously exposed so passengers can sit on a long bench or lean over the railing to claim uninterrupted views of the goldfields, the Karoo and eventually the mountains and winelands that surround Cape Town. Dinner gong . It's good to take it easy at high tea. Before long a gong sounds to call guests to the dining cars for a seven-course meal, each with a wine pairing. The food leans heavily toward local fare, both game and produce, all of it meticulously prepared. The Cape Town journey is one of the shortest, but includes two stops. The first is at Kimberley, the diamond mining town known for the ""Big Hole,"" the largest excavation in the world, a mile wide and going down seemingly forever. The other stop is in Matjiesfontein, in the middle of the Karoo. The entire town is a national heritage site, preserving the Victorian village that was founded as a railway rest stop but became a health spa once frequented by South Africa's elite. Although the train is sometimes pulled by a more modern locomotive, the oldest of Rovos Rail's carriages date to 1930, two years before Agatha Christie imagined the Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, sleuthing across Europe. Most were once owned by South African Railways, and were bought as rusting and decrepit shells. Before leaving Pretoria, it's worth taking a look at the original carriages, if only to appreciate how beautifully restored they are. As much as Rovos Rail envelops its passengers in a time warp, they're not shielded from all modern headaches. The growing pains of South Africa's rails mean delays can and do happen. ""I ask you to please accept the fact that we are never on time,"" Vos quips. ""However, we will get you to Cape Town this week, and that's what matters."" On Rovos Rail's longer, international journeys into Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania, the logistics of African travel can interfere. Slow tourism . The train stops for border posts (waits can be lengthy) and poorly maintained tracks in some regions keep the speeds slow. Despite all that, this is the best imaginable way to make an overland trip. The 15-day route from Cape Town to Dar es Salaam is a train lover's dream, taking a meandering route from the Cape through the heart of South Africa, up to the Madikwe Game Reserve and then onto Zimbabwe for an overnight stay at the Victoria Falls Hotel. Crossing the Zambezi River on its landmark bridge is like living on a movie set, the mist of the falls thundering upward on one side, the dark rocks of the gorge plunging down on the other. The train then crosses the length of Zambia, sometimes churning, sometimes crawling until it reaches Chishimba Falls in the rarely visited Northern Province. Here, hikers can explore the sacred cave behind the falls, where the nature spirit Chishimba is believed to live. This is a place of prayer and offerings, so the Zambia Tourism Authority has strict instructions for visitors: ""Because of the sacred nature of the Falls, no sexual intercourse, arrogance and quarrelsomeness is allowed in the vicinity of the Falls."" Passengers should plan their time accordingly. This is literally a high point of the journey. The rest of the trip is a descent into the Rift Valley, winding through tunnels and along viaducts, with a stop for a game drive in Selous Reserve, the largest in Africa. Rovos runs this route five times a year, and it's their most popular option, according to Brenda Vos, Rohan's daughter who works in what's now a family business. Regardless of the itinerary, she says for many passengers the train itself is the destination. ""We want guests to get on board, and it doesn't matter where they're going.""

"""What, are you insane?"" That seems to be the response I get most from friends and family members when I tell them that I'd like another child one day. They are typically shocked not because I'm pregnant with my second child but because they've watched me suffer through hyperemesis gravidarum during both of my pregnancies. They know that pregnancy for me is never a glowing and magical journey. Rather, it is weekly trips to the emergency room, in-home IVs and nursing care, up to 13 medications with their assorted side effects and, of course, frequent vomiting -- sometimes as many as 20 times a day. Although I normally choose to greet my acquaintances' surprise with a simple smile and ""We'll see how I feel about it later,"" I decided to speak out after learning that Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their second child. The palace says Catherine is again suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, as she did during her first pregnancy. It might seem crazy to some that I would have wanted more kids after my first hyperemesis gravidarum battle, but I simply refuse to let it define my family planning. Hyperemesis gravidarum manages to rob its victims of many of the joys of pregnancy. Because you can no longer keep up with your usual obligations, you often have to share with your community that you are pregnant before you're out of the ""danger zone"" of the first trimester, making you vulnerable to having to tell people later if you've suffered a miscarriage. Since you are so sick, what should be a happy time for you and your family becomes a nightmare, as you are unable to help around the house or spend time with other children or your partner, and are oftentimes unable to work and contribute financially. Hyperemesis gravidarum even managed to take away the joy of feeling my daughter Hannah kick once I realized her movements were setting off the nausea. But what hyperemesis gravidarum can't take away is the last 10 years of joy I've gotten from being Hannah's mom. The moment Hannah came out, I looked at her tiny face and knew that every second of sickness, every expensive doctor's bill, every time I'd felt desperate and depressed and doubted myself as a mother, was worth it. And as soon as Hannah was out, I felt this pang of hunger that I hadn't felt in months. I turned to the nurse and asked when I could eat. About 30 minutes later, she brought me a plate of lasagna that I gobbled up and -- more important -- kept down.  The hyperemesis gravidarum was finally gone, and the only thing left was my adorable baby, who has grown into one of the strongest little people I know and one of my closest friends. I never once thought about the hyperemesis gravidarum when I watched her take her first steps, perform in her preschool play, sound out her first word, present her first science fair project, compete in her first gymnastics meet or any of the other incredible memories we've shared. The nine months of sickness I had with her in utero were nothing in comparison to the 10 years I've enjoyed as her mom. So even on my darkest days during this pregnancy, the ones where I am reduced to a smelly, tearful, nauseated lump on the couch, I've thought about those moments in Hannah's life and smiled, knowing that I am going to get to experience all of those again with this daughter come February 1. I belong to an online community of women who have survived or are currently suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, sort of a support group and resource community all in one. From time to time, someone will write a post saying they are at their wit's end, ready to give up, or feel like they are losing their mind. Within minutes, the responses will pour in: photos of recently born babies from hyperemesis gravidarum survivors, descriptions of a new milestone someone's little one has achieved and even tales from women still suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum of how much better they are feeling that particular week. I love when a few weeks later, the original poster comments on someone else's post to tell them how they survived those desperate times and found the strength to keep going. Surviving acute pregnancy sickness: My story . Although there were some moments where I wanted to give up, hyperemesis gravidarum has made me appreciate my life and my family so much more than I ever could have if I hadn't been sick.  Perhaps, next time someone asks me if I've lost my mind, I'll simply hold up a picture of my daughter and tell them ""absolutely not.""","Hyperemesis gravidarum causes extreme sickness during pregnancy .

"What do Harry Reid and Wil.I.Am have in common? Well, like Common (the rapper), they and dozens of other big-name celebrities are in Charlotte this week for the Democratic National Convention. Even though President Barack Obama's big acceptance speech was moved indoors due to weather concerns, Thursday night is expected to be the big night for stars to shine. Singer/songwriter James Taylor and recording artists Marc Anthony, Mary J. Blige and The Foo Fighters graced the main stage of the convention. And CNN's Shannon Travis was the first to report that Scarlett Johansson, Natalie Portman and Kerry Washington, all Hollywood royalty, have been secretly scheduled to speak the same night that President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will accept their party's respective nominations. R&B band Earth, Wind and Fire was also scheduled to perform, but canceled after the change of the convention location to a smaller venue. Actor Khalil Kain was spotted walking Uptown's crowded streets during the convention's kickoff event on Labor Day. Across from a vendor selling pro-Obama t-shirts and buttons, Kain told CNN that  Obama is ""the hardest working president I've ever seen."" Actress and activist Rosario Dawson joined CNN at the CNN Grill Monday and Tuesday night. She's making her away around the DNC on a mission to get more Latinos to vote in November. After leaving a VotoLatino policy forum, Dawson joined an immigration reform protest where undocumented immigrants were arrested, The Charlotte Observer reports. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux talked with CSI New York's Hill Harper about his personal relationship with Obama. Harper went to Harvard Law School with Obama and has known him for over 20 years. ""I've been impressed with the type of man he is, what he stands for."" Longtime Obama supporter and actor Kal Penn addressed the DNC in a comedic speech in which he created his own hashtag (#sexyface), and discussed his love for the president in a style mocking Clint Eastwood. ""Thank you, invisible man in the chair, for that. And for giving my friends access to affordable health insurance and doubling funding for the Pell Grant."" Kal Penn brings #sexyface to the DNC . Actors spotted on the convention floor this week: . -- John Leguizamo.

"Samuel L. Jackson took a Los Angeles entertainment reporter to task Monday after the reporter appeared to confuse the actor for Laurence Fishburne. ""You're as crazy as the people on Twitter. I'm not Laurence Fishburne!"" Jackson said during a live TV interview. ""We don't all look alike. We may be all black and famous, but we all don't look alike. You're busted."" The outburst momentarily stunned CNN affiliate KTLA's Sam Rubin, who had asked Jackson what the reaction was to his Super Bowl commercial. ""What Super Bowl commercial?"" Jackson replied. Rubin looked off camera, confused. He immediately owned up to the mistake, but Jackson dug in. ""You're the entertainment reporter for this station and you don't know the difference between me and  Laurence Fishburne? That must be a very short line for your job outside there,"" he said. Rubin apologized repeatedly, at one point slapping himself in the face in jest. Jackson kept the mood light. ""I'm the other guy,"" he said. ""There's more than one black guy doing a commercial. I'm the 'What's in your wallet?' black guy. He's the car black guy. Morgan Freeman is the other credit card black guy. You only hear his voice, though, so you probably won't confuse him with Laurence Fishburne."" Rubin later issued a more formal apology. ""I indicated to Samuel that I'd seen him during the Super Bowl, and he thought that I had confused him with the commercial Laurence Fishburne had done for a car company. Of course a 'Captain America' ad had also run during the Super Bowl, but I immediately felt so dumb, I didn't bring that up -- and he gave me the shellacking that was well deserved,"" the reporter said. Jackson is set to appear in the upcoming sequel ""Captain America: The Winter Solider."" ""I pride myself on the fact -- that unlike a lot of people who do this kind of work -- more often than not, I really do know what I'm talking about. But I didn't 30 minutes ago, and I'm really embarrassed about it, and I very much apologize to Samuel L. Jackson and anyone else who was offended for what was a very amateur mistake,"" Rubin said.","KTLA's Sam Rubin asks Jackson about the reaction to his Super Bowl commercial .

"Abducted. Sold. On the brink of freedom. Converted to Islam and married off ... despite the claims and counterclaims the fate of more than 200 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram on April 14 remains as unclear as ever. On October 17, Nigerian officials announced they had reached a ceasefire deal with Boko Haram that included the girls' release. Hassan Tukur, principal secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan said the deal followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group in Chad. ""We have agreed on the release of the Chibok schoolgirls, and we expect to conclude on that at our next meeting with the group's representative next week in Chad,"" he said. The announcement revived hopes the girls' would be released and reawakened the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag on Twitter. But analysts questioned the veracity of the government's claim and Boko Haram remained silent on the ceasefire -- and active in northeastern Nigeria, where it carried out more attacks and abductions. Finally, on November 1, a video appeared of the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau saying no ceasefire been reached. As for the girls, Shekau said they had converted to Islam and had been married off, saying with a chuckle in the video: ""They are in their marital homes."" So did Nigeria's government truly believe it had reached a truce with Boko Haram? CNN's Isha Sesay has covered the girls' abduction since they were taken from Chibok and traveled to Nigeria after last month's announcement they were to be released. Sesay says indications are that talks certainly had been taking place. ""From people I've spoken to on the ground, it does seem that there was some effort under way to free the girls,"" she said. But Sesay says some sources believe the Nigerian government may have been dealing with the wrong people. In an article for CNN last week, analyst Darren Kew also pointed out that many Nigerian journalists had questioned whether the man said to be negotiating on behalf of Boko Haram's leadership was a genuine representative of the group. In his video, Shekau certainly indicated that he was not, denying knowing the man and adding: ""We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him."" After the Boko Haram leader's message, Nigeria's government again reiterated that negotiations had taken place, saying Shekau's comments contradicted assertions made in conversations with Nigerian officials. ""We've heard about the video, and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you cannot expect otherwise,"" a spokesman said. ""Nigeria has been fighting a war, and wars don't end overnight."" What clues are there as to the girls' whereabouts? This is the crucial unanswered question. CNN's Nima Elbagir visited Chibok in May and met with a girl who had managed to flee from Boko Haram the night of the abduction. The girl told Elbagir how she made a dash for freedom after militants loaded them into trucks and drove them into the nearby Sambisa Forest. President Jonathan also said the girls were in the forest, which at that time was an Boko Haram stronghold. Sesay says that belief had persisted for a long time but the militants -- and therefore the girls -- were no longer thought to be in that area. ""The feeling among Nigerian government officials I have spoken to is that the girls were broken into groups and have been dispersed along the Chad, Cameroon and Niger borders -- that they're in those border areas,"" she said. What about Shekau's claim the girls have been married off? On October 27, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report on Boko Haram violence against women and girls in Nigeria after interviewing kidnap victims including 12 of the Chibok girls. ""The victims were held in eight different Boko Haram camps that they believed to be in the 518-square-kilometer Sambisa Forest Reserve and around the Gwoza hills for periods ranging from two days to three months,"" the report said. ""The women and girls told Human Rights Watch that for refusing to convert to Islam, they and many others they saw in the camps were subjected to physical and psychological abuse; forced labor; forced participation in military operations, including carrying ammunition or luring men into ambush; forced marriage to their captors; and sexual abuse, including rape."" HRW documented eight cases of sexual violence by Boko Haram combatants saying ""most cases of rape occurred after the victims were forced to marry."" Sesay said the report suggest that the girls have likely been married off to Boko Haram combatants, who are believed to number around 10,000. ""If indeed Shekau's statements are true, it's probably likely that they have been married to Boko Haram fighters or to Boko Haram supporters,"" she said. Who would fight for Boko Haram? Human Rights Watch said witnesses had described the abduction of men and boys -- especially those of fighting age -- by Boko Haram. ""The men and boys are often given the option of joining the group or being killed. Other men appeared to have been targeted for abduction because of their specific skills or occupation, which filled a need in the insurgents' camp,"" the group said in its October report. But not all combatants are forced. ""One thing that I keep hearing when I'm in Nigeria is the question of 'Who is Boko Haram?' says Isha Sesay. ""Is it ideologues? Is it young people from those very communities who are almost like mercenaries who become involved because they are going to be paid and make some money? ""According to some security experts I spoke to they're not all Nigerians, some of them are from those neighboring countries and some of them are paid fighters."" Where does support for the group come from? The notion of support for Boko Haram is complicated, says Sesay. ""When Boko Haram first sprang up, they rose with an agenda of trying to address the inequality between the Muslim north -- which has been under invested in and has high levels of poverty and lower levels of education -- and the rest of the country. It was about social ills -- that's what they originally came onto the scene professing."" But in 2009, the struggle became violent. Police killed Boko Haram's founder Mohammed Yusuf, and he was replaced by current leader Abubakar Shekau. ""When they were a 'social ills campaign,' so to speak, they had some amount of support among ordinary Nigerians who felt that here were people who were speaking out on their behalf, saying they needed more support from the government and they'd been long ignored,"" Sesay said. ""Things took a turn when they became a violent extremist group that began smashing and burning and murdering people. And I think in the north east -- particularly in those three states that are under a state of emergency -- it's just fear -- it's just absolute fear. ""People have fled their homes, there are large camps for internally displaced persons camps scattered around the country with thousands of people in them. ""The instability that this has brought to the north in terms of its economy and its day-to-day life can't even be quantified. So I think by and large in the north, I don't hear of civilian support for Boko Haram.""","Nigeria's claim of a truce with Boko Haram raised hopes for release of kidnapped girls .

"Get dialing for your reservation now: Noma in Copenhagen has been named the world's best restaurant at a ceremony revealing the planet's top 50 dining venues. To raucous cheers, high fives, hugs and kisses, team Noma took to the stage in a packed London venue in jubilant scenes that wouldn't be out of place at the World Cup in Brazil later this year. Noma's top honor in the prestigious San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurant  Awards -- viewed as the Oscars of fine dining -- was the fourth win for minimalist Danish pioneer of foraged menus. The award was presented late Monday at a ceremony in central London attended by some of the world's leading chefs. ""It's too (expletive deleted) crazy!"" said Noma's head chef, Rene Redzepi, picking up the award. ""Thank you for believing in us. ""In the last year (after the restaurant was awarded second place) my staff and I looked into each others' eyes and said 'let's just really really work hard.' We made a plan and said 'let's make this the best year we've ever had.'"" ""But to have this is a whole surprise, none of us expected it."" The list, now in its 12th year, is dominated by European venues, but there were prizes for restaurants from around the world, including Asia's first top 20 entry. The biggest climber was Lima, Peru, restaurant Central, which jumped from No. 50 last year to No. 15 this year. The highest debut entry was Gaggan from Bangkok, which came in at No. 17. Highly influential . There were few changes in the list's top 10. Last year's winner, Spain's El Celler de Can Roca, was bumped to second place, with Italy's Osteria Francescana holding steady at number three. Despite the repeat victory for Noma, it's still yet to match the record of Spain's El Bulli, which claimed four successive wins before head chef Ferran Adria closed its doors in 2011. Other winners in the top 10 were, in fourth place New York's Eleven Madison Park, followed by Spain's Mugaritz, Brazil's D.O.M., London's Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, Spain's Arzak, Chicago's Alinea and The Ledbury, another London restaurant. Noma, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, was praised for its ""fresh approach and energy."" The restaurant's menu serves diners with a series of ""snacks"" largely sourced from the Nordic landscape -- dishes that include sea urchin toast and a beef tartar that includes ants. Most of the winners -- a total of 28 -- were from Europe, with Spain claiming seven top 50 positions. Nahm, a Thai restaurant in Bangkok that earlier this year was named Asia's best, made it to number 13 in the list -- the region's highest entry. Organized by UK-based Restaurant Magazine and sponsored by Italian drinks manufacturers San Pellegrino and Acqua Panna, the awards are seen as highly influential in the fine dining industry. Noma's first win in 2010 is credited with catapulting the restaurant to international stardom. Reputedly, the day after winning, it received enough online reservations to fill its 45 seats for a decade -- thankfully, it only takes bookings for a few weeks in advance. Some observers say the awards now hold greater sway over a restaurant's financial success and bookings than coveted Michelin star rankings, often transforming them into major travel destinations. 'Beauty contest' ""This is the big one,"" contest chairman Richard Vines told CNN ahead of the awards. ""Although you can argue about the list, everyone wants to be on it."" Vines said the list isn't a rival to Michelin's ""systematic"" assessments, describing it as a spontaneous ""beauty contest for restaurants."" The list was decided by votes compiled from 900 restaurant industry figures. The winning names were closely guarded ahead of this year's ceremony after details were leaked prior to announcement in 2013. British chef Fergus Henderson received a lifetime achievement award at this year's event. Henderson's St. John restaurant in London has championed ""nose-to-tail"" eating that utilizes every part of an animal. San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants for 2014 . 1.

"A small plane carrying six people, one of them Vittorio Missoni, a director of Italy's famed Missoni fashion house, is missing off the coast of Venezuela, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol Torres said. The search for the missing aircraft continued Saturday, an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Missoni confirmed in a statement that Vittorio Missoni, son of fashion house founders Ottavio and Rosita Missoni, was on the plane with his wife. ""The small plane they were traveling on has disappeared. This is all the information currently available,"" the company statement said. Vittorio Missoni, 58, runs the company with his siblings, Luca and Angela. The plane was carrying four Italian nationals who were on vacation, Reverol said in a statement Friday. The Venezuelan Interior Ministry identified the two other Italians as Guido Foresti and Elda Scalveuzi. A pilot and co-pilot also were on board. The plane left Los Roques, an archipelago and resort, Friday morning bound for the international airport outside Caracas, about 90 miles away, Reverol said. Italian authorities are in touch with their Venezuelan counterparts and the families of those missing, said a spokesman in the Italian Foreign Ministry's media office. The ministry called on the Venezuelan authorities to do all they can to locate the missing plane and those on board, he said. Missoni, which boasts such celebrity clients as Katie Holmes, Cameron Diaz and Nicole Richie, is a high-end fashion label known for its patterned knitwear and signature zigzag stripe. The private company, based in Milan, has estimated annual sales of between $75 million and $100 million. The brand, first created in 1953 as a knitwear workshop in Gallarte, Italy, has gone on to expand from apparel to housewares, a fragrance line and a chain of hotels. Stefano Tonchi, editor-in-chief of W magazine, called the Missonis ""one of the most important Italian fashion families,"" crediting their move to Milan in the late 1960s with helping make the northern Italian city the fashion hub it is today. Vittorio Missoni and his siblings took over the brand in 1996 with an eye toward marketing to a younger consumer. The fashion house partnered with Target in 2011 to produce a more budget-friendly collection for the discount retailer, which prompted Target's website to crash due to the high demand.","Missoni: Company director Vittorio Missoni and his wife are missing off Venezuela .

"(CNN)  -- E. Lynn Harris, the author who introduced millions of readers to the ""invisible life"" of black gay men, was a literary pioneer whose generosity was as huge as his courage, friends said Friday. E. Lynn Harris touched fans with his courage and his kindness, friends say. Harris, 54, died Thursday night while on a business trip to Los Angeles, California, said Laura Gilmore, his publicist. Harris wrote a series of novels that exposed readers to characters rarely depicted in literature: black, affluent gay men who were masculine, complex and, sometimes, tormented. Keith Boykin, an author and friend, said Harris encouraged the black community to talk openly about homosexuality. ""We have a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy in the black community,"" Boykin said. ""E. Lynn Harris encouraged people to ask and to tell."" How Harris broke ground . In books like ""Invisible Life,"" ""A Love of My Own,"" and his New York Times best-selling memoir, ""What Becomes of the Brokenhearted,"" Harris virtually invented a new genre: books that depicted black gay men living double lives. Though Harris wrote primarily about black gay men, some of his biggest fans were black women. His books became staples in black beauty salons, bookstores and book clubs. ""It was hard to go on a subway in places in New York or D.C. and not see some black woman reading an E. Lynn Harris novel,"" Boykin said. Harris was an unlikely literary pioneer. He was a former IBM executive who decided to write about his life. He started off in 1991 selling books from the trunk of his car to African-American beauty salons and bookstores. He eventually became one of the nation's most popular writers with an estimated 4 million of his books in print. Tina McElroy Ansa, author of ""Taking After Mudear,"" met Harris at the beginning of his literary career when he was selling his first book ""Invisible Life."" She said they were both so poor they only had enough money to buy each other's book. Ansa said she took Harris' ""Invisible Life"" home and was stunned by the time she reached page 20. She came across a scene where Harris depicted two black men playing in the snow with one another. She immediately dropped the book, called Harris and told him she had never read such a scene before. ""I had never seen homosexual love in African-American men portrayed that way,"" she says. ""It was playful, loving, and it wasn't hidden."" Years later, when Harris became successful, he thanked Ansa for her early encouragement. ""He gave me a string of pearls,"" Ansa said. In 2000, Harris told the magazine Entertainment Weekly how important ""Invisible Life"" was for him. ''When I wrote ""Invisible Life,"" it had to be the first book out of me -- it helped me to deal with my own sexuality,'' Harris said. ""'For me, my 20s and early 30s were spent just hiding and running, because there was no one to tell me that my life had value and the way I felt was okay.'' Standing room only at his book events . ""It's heartbreaking; he had such a generous spirit,"" said Tananarive Due, author of ""Blood Colony."" ""When I was just starting out, he flew me to an event out of his own pocket and put me up just because he thought more people should know my work,"" Due said. Harris was as generous with his fans as he was with his friends, some said. They describe an author who held dinner parties for aspiring writers at his home, loved meeting and hugging fans at book readings, and never seemed to let his fame change him. ""You could get trampled at an E. Lynn Harris reading,"" Ansa said. ""People loved him."" Due said Harris would answer up to 200 e-mails from his fans each day. She said Harris had been a cheerleader in college ""and a spirit of joy followed him through his life."" ""He genuinely loved being around people and remembered names,"" Due said. ""I remember seeing him at an event in Florida, and one woman in the crowd raised her hand and he said, 'Oh, Mary, you were here for my hardcover book signing.'"" Nonetheless, Harris had his share of personal pain. He was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas. In his 2003 memoir, he wrote about enduring abuse by his stepfather and an attempted suicide in 1990. And he had critics. Some said Harris was a mediocre writer who stumbled on a winning literary formula. Boykin says Harris was stung by some of the criticism. ""He always said 'I'm not a James Baldwin,'"" Boykin said, referring to the openly gay black author from the 1960s. ""He was writing accessible literature for the masses."" Boykin said Harris received most of his criticism not from outraged straight critics, but people within the black community. ""He was hurt by some of the criticism from some black gay men who felt he wasn't portraying them accurately and others who thought he was telling too much,"" Boykin said. In a 2003 Detroit Free Press interview, Harris said he resisted becoming an advocate for gay rights. ""It's such a small part of who I am, "" he said. ""It's what I do when I'm with my partner that puts this label on me. Most of my friends are straight. I tend to have a regular life, if you will."" Due said there has traditionally been a lot of pain associated with homosexuality in the black community. Harris took a little of that pain away with his life and his books. ""He really helped let the air in,"" Due said. ""He helped us all breathe a little better.""","Pioneering author broke taboos in the black community .

"(CNN)As claims of responsibility go, it is remarkably complex and perhaps asks more questions than it answers, hinting at the messy rivalry perhaps engulfing the jihadi world. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi's 12-minute message declares brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi to be -- in the group's eyes -- ""heroes"" who ""were assigned and accepted and fulfilled"" a task. It claims that much of what remains of al Qaeda's command was somehow involved in choosing the Charlie Hebdo magazine as a target. Several times, it evokes the name of Osama bin Laden, and his successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri -- names that, in the current focus on ISIS' rampage across the Middle East, seem almost to hail from a time of jihad past. A vital part of the claim is its insistence that Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who attacked the kosher grocery store, was not part of their operation, but his attack coincided with theirs as ""good fortune."" Coulibaly left a long video in which he pledged Bayat, or allegiance, to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS. This hints at the growing and deeply troubling ""rivalry"" of sorts between ISIS and the older brand of jihad -- al Qaeda. While it seems at first bizarre that two groups with fundamentally similar goals would conflict, the differing worlds of al Qaeda and ISIS have been apparent for some time now. Al Qaeda's franchise in Syria, al-Nusra Front, is hit by U.S. airstrikes along with ISIS, and both are described as terror groups by the U.S. government, but the al Qaeda affiliate does at times clash with ISIS for territory and resources. Last spring, al Qaeda's leader, al-Zawahiri, distanced himself from the newer, more savage hotheads of ISIS, a move that guaranteed -- for now -- their paths would continue to diverge. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's message Wednesday doesn't spell out how to connect the dots concretely between the Kouachi brothers' disturbed cries they were working for al Qaeda in Yemen and the Yemeni jihadis themselves -- that's something investigators have to work on to prove. Are there real and genuine logistical links between that Paris street and the radical cells training in the desert? But it does make some intriguing claims that are partially backed up by suggestions from some officials. The al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula statement claims that the late Anwar al-Awlaki was somehow involved operationally in the plan to target Charlie Hebdo. That is a hugely potent statement. Al-Awlaki, a recruiter and radical preacher for al Qaeda and an American citizen of Yemeni heritage, has long been dead -- killed by an American drone strike in 2011. Said and/or Cherif Kouachi were in Yemen in 2011, according to witnesses and officials, although investigators are still working out their exact movements, with Said possibly there as early as 2009 when it is alleged he roomed briefly with Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, the ""underwear bomber"" who targeted a plane to Detroit in 2009. Were al-Awlaki the organizer of the attack -- someone who laid on the logistical support, financing or chose the target as the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula statement suggests -- then the Kouachi brothers would have been dormant for three years before launching their attack on January 7. Investigators will be desperate to know if there was any further contact between 2011 and the Paris attacks -- whether the orders and logistics were in place by 2011, or further assistance or instructions came closer to the moment. Were it the former, this would be a truly chilling sleeper cell -- idle for years, and then, at a moment's notice, deadly. Above all, Wednesday's long and florid statement shows an al Qaeda desperate not to be eclipsed by its newer -- and at times, in the gruesome jousting of this world -- more radical cousin, ISIS. The names and faces of their leaders, alive and dead, live on, particularly that of al-Awlaki, who, it is said, ""threatens the West both in his life and after his martyrdom."" It's a chilling sign al Qaeda may very much be a current and real danger.","Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claims responsibility in Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris .

"(CNN)Six months after more than 200 Chibok schoolgirls vanished into the night, the #BringBackOurGirls campaign has faded. When the social media phenomenon of signs asking for the release of the missing girls took off in May, celebrities like First Lady Michelle Obama and Nobel Prize recipient Malala Yousafzai posted their photos, joining people from around the world. But as weeks became months and prospects of the schoolgirls' release seemed slim, the social media campaign slowly dwindled. But one man, Alasholuyi Kehinde, did not stop fighting to bring the missing girls home. Almost every day, for 186 days, the Lagos, Nigeria resident took a photo of himself holding up a sign pleading with the world not to forget about the Chibok schoolgirls. A father of three and marketing professional, Kehinde felt a responsibility to advocate for the missing girls and their families. Now, Nigeria has reached a ceasefire agreement with the Islamist terror group Boko Haram, which took credit for kidnapping the girls back in April. The girls are expected to be released shortly, although Nigerian government spokesman Doyin Okupe says ""it is a process. ... It is not a question of hours and days."" With the end of the kidnapping ordeal in sight, Kehinde shares with CNN why he didn't give up hope when so many others did. CNN: When you first started taking photos, did you know you were going to take a photo everyday? Kehinde: I never knew I would still be carrying the Bring Back Our Girls placard six months after the schoolgirls were abduction. I had thought, the girls would be back soon, especially when a couple of countries were pledging support to help rescue them. Day 20 was when I started taking photos because it was so shocking and heartbreaking. Now we're up to day 186 and the story is the same, the girls are still not back. CNN: What inspired you to keep participating in the #BringBackOurGirls campaign? Kehinde: I believe the Chibok parents whose children were abducted need our support during this agonizing time. I am a father of three kids. If I am away from my kids for two or three days, I always feel like there's a vacuum. So, I felt like we must advocate for these parents. We must join our voices with theirs and demand for the safe return of their abducted children. CNN: Did you tell others about what you were doing? Kehinde: I did get awesome support from people all over the world through various social media platforms. They kept encouraging me to keep holding on, and to not give up when many others have since given up. CNN: How did the people in your community respond when the girls were first abducted? Kehinde: Initially, there were some who didn't believe such a thing could happen. Some people just couldn't fathom more than 200 innocent schoolgirls being violently taken all at once. That was huge. It was unbelievable. The realization dawned on many when the government confirmed the abduction to be true. CNN: Do you think people in your community still care? Kehinde: The support for the parents of the abducted schoolgirls in my community is awesome. We are all united in our demand. We are asking and pleading with the Nigerian government to please do more to ensure the safe release of the abducted schoolgirls. CNN: What are your thoughts about the government's effort to get the girls back? Kehinde: I believe Nigerian government has been doing everything possible within its limit to ensure the girls are safely rescued.

"I'm about to fly from Santa Fe to New York, and I'm terrified. Once in New York, I will teach a class on creativity based on my book ""The Artist's Way."" While I am eager to share my toolkit with a new audience, I am not eager to fly. For a week before flying, I sleep poorly, ""rotisserie-ing"" in my fears. My friends notice that I am miserable. When I tell them I have a fear of flying, they respond, ""But flying's safe. Safer than driving to the airport."" Their rational reassurance does nothing to curb my fear. My mind spools out dire scenarios: The plane will have difficulty on takeoff or landing; an engine will fail or catch fire; a terrorist will somehow make it through security and reroute the plane like 9/11. For days before I am due to fly, I tell myself to pack. But my mind freezes at the prospect. Finally, I make a list of everything I need to take. Item by item, I pack. How easy it would be to pack a bomb, I think. I try to push this aside, but it persists. Not flying isn't an option . As an author who teaches seminars, I have flown for years. With more teaching came more flying and with more flying, an ever-increasing fear. I have never had anything bad happen when I was flying, as far as I know. Not even close. My worst scenario about five years ago involved terrible turbulence. As the plane shimmied and shook, I clutched my armrests and prayed, ""Dear God, please end this turbulence. Please let us find smooth air."" My prayers were earnest but went unanswered. The turbulence continued for nearly the whole flight. ""How was your fight?"" my host asked, meeting me at the airport. ""It was terrible. Really turbulent,"" I replied. ""Well, you made it safe and sound,"" my host said, glossing over my terror. ""We're glad you're here."" A familiar feeling takes hold . In four days, I would have to fly again, returning home. I put this return trip out of my mind, focusing on my days of teaching. There were tools to teach and anecdotes to share. My fear of flying had no place in the curriculum. It wasn't until I was driving to the airport days later that I felt my familiar fear taking hold. ""It went well,"" said my host. ""I hope you'll come back next year."" I smiled politely, remembering my turbulent trip. I certainly didn't want to repeat it. As we approached the airport, I lost my ability for polite conversation. ""Cat got your tongue?"" my host asked. ""I'm afraid of flying,"" I reluctantly confessed. ""Very afraid of flying."" My host repeated the usual reassurance: ""Why, flying is safer than our driving to the airport."" ""I know that,"" I said, ""But it doesn't help."" And it didn't. The flight home was smooth, but I was braced for turbulence. I spent a long three hours dreading the bumps that did not come. An inspiration fueled by fear . When I got home safely, my publisher called. ""Tell me your teaching went well?"" he asked. ""It did,"" I said. ""It's the flying that's hard."" ""Why, flying is safer than driving to the airport,"" he assured me. ""I know, I know,"" I said. ""My fear isn't rational. I think it has to do with not having control. Flying, you put your life in your pilot's hands. That takes an act of faith."" ""Why don't you write me a little book on the fear of flying,"" he asked. ""Maybe writing would help you."" Who wants to confess an irrational fear, much less in print? ""I feel like such a baby,"" I complained to my friends. But I agreed to do it, and an assignment was an assignment. And as the time neared for my next flight, I found myself watching my fear with a new objectivity. Afraid to even pack, I prayed for the willingness to begin. Making my packing list, I felt calmer. Executing it early, I felt good. ""Maybe there's something to be said for prayer,"" I caught myself thinking. Writing down specific prayers . And so I wrote out prayers for each step of my journey, asking in particular for freedom from turbulence. Determined to fly fearlessly, I asked for help. Unlike my neighbors on the flight, I did not order a drink or take a pill. Instead, I prayed. And when I did so, I felt an unfamiliar calm stealing over me. My neighbor noticed my calm. ""What are you doing?"" I was asked through a double scotch. I opted for candor. ""I'm praying,"" I said. ""I'm drinking,"" said my neighbor. ""Teach me to pray."" And so, I led a prayer and then another. My neighbor exclaimed, ""I do feel better!"" My mind ticked back to my assignment. I thought of the prayers I use. You do not need to believe in anything specific. Even if you don't believe, acting as if you do can bring you calm. Before takeoff prayer . Dear God, please help our pilot. Please help me to trust his wisdom and skill. Please help me to let go. Let our flight be smooth and uneventful. Let us land without mishaps. Amen. Prayer for turbulence . God, please guide us to smooth air. Please, please, end this turbulence. Quiet my nerves and give me faith. Thank you for your help. Amen. Landing prayer . Dear God, . Please give us a safe landing. Please see that the gears work smoothly. Lock them firmly into place. Let us hear the mechanisms working. Let us trust the hydraulics. Bless our ears. Amen. One more calming suggestion . Using my tips to pray, pack early and tell myself to postpone my fear until tomorrow (when I tell myself to postpone it again), I recently took a trip to Tel Aviv. That entailed eleven hours of airtime, almost all of it turbulent. Instead of my usual fear, I found myself trusting our pilot and our plane. I visualized each bump like a wave on water. While not relaxed enough to sleep, I was relaxed enough to read. This brought me to another tip: Buy tabloids. Celebrity gossip is engrossing. Celebrity cellulite can make you forget turbulence.","Knowing flying is safer than driving has never calmed Julia Cameron's fear of flying .

"President Barack Obama is ordering the most sweeping overhaul of the immigration system in decades, despite Republican claims he is acting illegally by moving unilaterally to shield five million undocumented immigrants. Obama rejected accusations by conservatives that he is offering a free pass to undocumented immigrants and warned in a prime-time address that he would bolster border security and make it harder for unauthorized outsiders to get into the country. ""Today our immigration system is broken and everybody knows it,"" Obama said. ""It's been this way for decades and for decades we haven't done much about it."" Obama is pressing ahead and making broad changes to the immigration system without the consent of Congress, which has failed to pass a comprehensive reform bill.  The announcement prompted an angry response from House Speaker John Boehner. ""By ignoring the will of the American people, President Obama has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left,"" Boehner said. ""Republicans are left with the serious responsibility of upholding our oath of office."" A key element of Obama's plan is to instruct immigration authorities to target those undocumented immigrants who are dangerous rather than law-abiding undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and residents and others. He said they will go after ""felons, not families.  Criminals, not children.  Gang members, not a Mom who's working hard to provide for her kids."" ""We'll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day,"" he said. The changes will offer those who qualify the chance to stay temporarily in the country for three years, as long as they pass background checks and pay back taxes. But they will not be offered a path to eventual citizenship or be eligible for federal benefits or health care programs. And, in theory, the measures could be reversed by a future president. ""If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you're a criminal, you'll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up,"" Obama said. The President argued that ordering a mass amnesty would be unfair but mass deportation would ""be both impossible and contrary to our character."" Republicans are slamming Obama's use of executive authority as a mammoth presidential power grab. But Obama said he was acting in a manner consistent with action taken by Republican and Democratic presidents. ""To those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer:  Pass a bill."" Officials insist that Obama's moves are deeply grounded in law and constitutional precedent, despite claims by Republicans that they represent an unlawful overreach of his authority as president and his oath of office. ""The actions you see here reasonably sit within his powers,"" one senior administration official said. ""I think that they are bold and they are aggressive but they are in keeping with precedent."" Congressional Republicans are weighing their response, juggling ideas that range from a government shutdown to holding up Obama's nominees in the Senate. And in the states, some Republican officials had already raised the possibility of lawsuits against the president. The most far-reaching changes in Obama's order will offer papers and work authorization to up to four million people who are undocumented parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, as long as they have lived in the U.S. for five years or longer. Obama will also remove the upper age limit of 30 years old from a program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) or Dreamers that allows those brought illegally to the country as children to stay, offering relief to thousands more people. The program will cover anyone who arrived in the country before 2010 and will extend a previous two-year guarantee of relief to three years. But White House lawyers concluded the president did not have the power to offer parents of those covered under DACA permits to stay in the country and work, a move that will disappoint some immigration reform lobby groups. In one concession however, parents of the so-called ""Dreamers"" will be removed from priority lists for deportation. Officials said that the broad sweep of the immigration measures were within Obama's powers because he was directing authorities to prioritize which groups of the 11.4 million undocumented immigrants in the country should be deported. ""Deferred action is not a pathway to citizenship. It is not legal status. It simply says that for three years, you are not a law enforcement priority and are not going to go after you,"" said one senior official. ""It is temporary and it is revocable."" Officials said law enforcement officials made similar decisions each day about which categories of offenders to target with prosecution and the president was simply charting a new way to apply existing immigration laws. The new approach, which will begin to be phased in next spring, will include a more robust effort to target gang members, suspected terrorists, and felons. It will also focus more sharply on undocumented immigrants who have recently crossed U.S. borders. This is a bid to slow the flow of illegal immigration, the officials said. New resources are also expected to be announced to secure borders, following claims that enforcement is lax and contributed to the flow of thousands of undocumented child migrants into the U.S. earlier this year, which sparked a hot political controversy. In moves likely be applauded by the business community, the administration will also reform immigration rules to make it easier for science and technology students to study in the U.S. There will also be a new program to attract entrepreneurs to come to the U.S. if they can show they have sufficient investors. But the president got mixed reviews among leaders in border states. ""In the face of Washington gridlock, the president stepped up for hard-working families across America. This is the right thing to do, and it's time for Congress to finish the job,"" said California Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., a Democrat. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said Obama should have sought a bipartisan solution. ""He is once again taking brazen, unilateral action that will only further exacerbate the border problem,"" the Republican said. Texas Gov. Rick Perry said the president's action will lead to more illegal immigration. ""It is time for the president and Congress to secure our border, followed by meaningful reforms. There is no more time for political grandstanding,"" he said. The changes that Obama announced, however, fall far short of the reforms that could be enacted were Congress to pass a comprehensive immigration bill. The president has no power to put undocumented immigrants on the long road to citizenship. He cannot grant permanent residence permits known as Green Cards, and all of his changes could be struck down by a future president. Officials insisted that Obama's moves were consistent with immigration actions ordered by presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, for decades. The magnitude of the numbers involved here, however, surpass anything any president had done before.","Speaker Boehner slams Obama for ""legacy of lawlessness""

"There were no genetic tests 400,000 years ago, so our ancient relatives didn't know as much about themselves as we know about them now. Scientists have reconstructed a nearly complete mitochondrial genome of an ancient human relative, whose remains were found in Sima de los Huesos (""pit of bones"") in northern Spain. It is the oldest DNA to be recovered from an early humanlike species, authors of a study wrote in the journal Nature. The ancient species that has revealed some of its genetic secrets, via bone fragments from a femur, is probably not directly linked to your family tree though. ""It's quite clear that this is not a direct ancestor of people today,"" said Svante Paabo, a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and senior author of the study. Instead, he said, this representative of an early humanlike species, called Homo heidelbergensis, could be an ancestor of both Neanderthals and another group called the De nisovans. The genetic relationship to Denisovans, discovered through this DNA research, is surprising because the Homo heidelbergensis remains found in the cave have many Neanderthal-like features. The only remnants of Denisovans come from Siberia -- a long way from Spain. ""It's sort of an open question really what this means, and I think further research into the nuclear genome of these hominins will address that,"" Paabo said. How they did it . Paabo and colleagues used a new method for sequencing ancient, degraded genetic material to put together the 400,000-year-old specimen's mitochondrial genome. It is the oldest DNA ever found outside permafrost conditions -- in other words, it was not permanently frozen. ""The retrieval of such ancient human DNA is a major technical achievement, and promises further recovery of such material from other fossils in this time range, both in the Sima and elsewhere, where we would not previously have expected it, or looked for it,"" said Chris Stringer, researcher at the Natural History Museum in London, who was not involved in the study. Mitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms. DNA stored in the mitochondria is passed to children through the maternal line only (i.e., only moms can pass it on), so it's only a small snapshot of inherited genes. Genetic material in the cell's nucleus comes from both parents and gives a fuller picture of genetic heritage. To study genetics of our ancient predecessors, researchers have an easier time studying mitochondrial DNA because there are hundreds of times more copies of it in each cell. ""It's a much bigger chance to find some fragments of this preserved,"" Paabo said. The method that researchers used involves separating the two strands of the DNA double helix. They then make a ""library"" from each of the two strands. If part of one strand is damaged, its analogue on the other strand -- which is made of complementary genetic partners -- may be intact. ""That is sort of the big trick involved,"" Paabo said. After sequencing the mitochondrial DNA, researchers then compared the result with genetic information about Neanderthals and Denisovans. Since nuclear DNA encompasses more information about a person's inheritance, a nuclear genome sequence from Homo heidelbergensis may reveal even more clearly how it is connected to other ancient humanlike species, he said. But retrieving the nuclear DNA sequence will be challenging, study authors wrote. Just to get the mitochondrial DNA sequence, it took about two grams of bone -- less than 0.1 ounce -- even though hundreds of copies of this DNA are in every cell. Still, Paabo said, the sequencing technique his group used ""opens a possibility to now do this at many other sites, and really begin to understand earlier human evolution."" Relationship to other species . Researchers thought initially the mitochondrial DNA of the Homo heidelbergensis specimen would share a common ancestor with Neanderthals. Neanderthals lived in Europe beginning as much as 300,000 years ago, Paabo said. (Homo sapiens, our species, first appeared in Africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.) Instead, researchers discovered through the DNA that this specimen is closer to the Denisovans, a group related to the Neanderthals. A likely explanation is that in Eastern Eurasia this species gave rise to Denisovans, and in Western Eurasia they were the ancestors of Neanderthals, Paabo said. But more research needs to be done to verify that theory. Humans, Neanderthals related to yet another group . Little is known about the Denisovans. Although some of their remains were found in southern Siberia, their genetic signature is only found today on islands in the Pacific. Paabo was also the senior author on a 2012 study in the journal Science analyzing the Denisovan genome. That research suggested that human ancestors and the Denisovans' ancestors must have branched off from one another as much as 700,000 years ago -- although that number is vague. Still, it seems that the Denisovans must have mated with indigenous people in Papua New Guinea and Australia, Paabo said. About 3% to 5% of the DNA of people from Melanesia (islands in the southwest Pacific Ocean), Australia and New Guinea as well as aboriginal people from the Philippines comes from the Denisovans. On the other hand, everyone who lives outside Africa today probably has some Neanderthal DNA in them, Paabo said in 2012. The bottom line, Paabo said, is that the relationships between these early human relatives -- Homo heidelbergensis, Neanderthals and Denisovans -- are not clear-cut. ""It's going to be a more complex history that one will eventually clarify with the help of DNA,"" he said.

"When the shooting started at her high school near Portland, Oregon, early Tuesday, student Jaimie Infante didn't recognize the sound of a gunshot. She thought maybe somebody had dropped a book. In reality, a lone gunman had opened fire at the school, killing one student and forcing others to flee. An assistant principal told students to go into lockdown mode. ""At the end he said: 'This is not a drill,'"" Infante told CNN. A teacher, who suffered non-life-threatening injuries, was treated at the scene. The suspected gunman is dead. According to multiple law enforcement officials, the shooter was a student at the school. The gunman appears to have died from a self-inflicted wound, the sources told CNN. Speaking to reporters, Troutdale Police Department Chief Scott Anderson said he could not confirm how the shooter died. He identified the student killed as 14-year-old Emilio Hoffman, a freshman. Anderson met with the student's parents Tuesday afternoon and ""they want you to know that Emilio was a great kid and he was loved by all,"" he said. Officials believe they know who the gunman was, but they are ""not confident enough"" to reveal details yet, Anderson said. He added: ""This is a tragedy that affects our whole community. This is not supposed to happen to any school or to any child, but we will get through this together."" 'Could have been much worse' The shooting happened at about 8 a.m. (11 a.m. ET) at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, about 12 miles east of Portland. The city has a population of 16,400 people. When it started, student Hannah League ducked into a classroom, where she and others huddled in a corner with no lights -- hiding. ""I heard these pops and I thought they were firecrackers, but then I saw a teacher run out with his side kind of bloody,"" League told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""You don't think something's going to happen like that -- especially to your school. It's kind of, like, crazy,"" she said. Details about what led to the shooting weren't immediately available. The gunman is believed to have used a rifle. Anderson said the shooter entered the building that houses the school gym. Hoffman was shot and killed in a locker room. The shooter was found in a separate restroom, Anderson said. He thanked officers for their quick response. He also thanked injured teacher Todd Rispler, who initiated the school lockdown despite being hurt. ""Without the quick and well-executed response, this tragedy could have been much worse,"" the Reynolds School District said in a statement. Anxious parents waited for news that their children were safe. One couple, Craig Tuholski and Tawnjia Reimer, were talking with CNN affiliate KGW, about how agonizing the wait for news was, when Tuholski's cell phone rang. ""Is that Chris?"" Reimer asked before letting out a sigh of relief. ""Oh, thank God."" ""That's what we were waiting for,"" Tuholski said after hanging up. About an hour after the shooting, Oregon State Police said the area was secure and the situation was contained. Obama: 'Levels of gun violence off the charts' The shooting, the latest in a long string of school shootings, sparked reaction nationwide. ""Our hearts go out to the Reynolds HS community. How many more students must we lose before committing to reduce gun violence in our schools?"" Secretary of Education Arne Duncan asked on his Twitter account. Speaking in Washington, President Barack Obama said the nation should be ashamed of its inability to get tougher gun restrictions through Congress in the aftermath of mass shootings that he said have become commonplace in America. ""Our levels of gun violence are off the charts. There's no advanced, developed country on Earth that would put up with this,"" he said in response to a question about gun violence. Most members of Congress are ""terrified"" of the National Rifle Association, the President said, adding that nothing will change until public opinion demands it. ""The country has to do some soul searching about this. This is becoming the norm, and we take it for granted, in ways that as a parent are terrifying to me,"" Obama said.

"Washington (CNN)In his upcoming State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama will call on Congress to simplify a tax code he deems overly complicated and weighted toward wealthy Americans, administration officials said Saturday. The moves -- likely to meet resistance from Republicans in Congress -- are meant to pay for the long slate of new programs the President began laying out two weeks ago designed to bolster the middle class, including offering two free years of community college to qualified students. Obama's aides have been seeking ways to expand a robust economic recovery beyond top earners, who have been buoyed by record closes on Wall Street. Despite reams of positive economic news, most Americans still say economic conditions in the country are only fair. And, if they see improvement, they aren't crediting the White House. ""The middle class has yet to experience the prosperity shown in the recovery, and what you'll see Tuesday night is the vision for finishing that job,"" a senior administration official said. Obama is set to propose Tuesday a $500 tax credit for married couples who each hold jobs; the intention, officials say, is to help alleviate the costs of child care and commuting that lead some spouses -- usually women -- to determine it makes more financial sense to stop working. He'll also spell out ways to simplify the way taxpayers apply for education and child care credits, including increasing the top child care credit to $3,000. The total cost for the new provisions: $235 billion, according to administration officials, who spoke anonymously ahead of the plan's official unveiling. For the first time since becoming president, all of Obama's changes would need to be approved both by a GOP House and a Senate with a new Republican majority. Looking to increase capital gains rate . To pay for the changes, the administration is proposing about $320 billion in new revenue over the next decade. Obama wants to wring more taxes from investment income -- capital gains and dividends -- which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary earnings. Since wealthy Americans are more likely to derive income from investments, they'd bear the overwhelming weight of a higher rate on that type of profit. The tax rate for capital gains now stands at 20% for the highest-earning Americans. Officials said Saturday that Obama will call for that rate to increase to 28% for those taxpayers. He will ask lawmakers to close a loophole allowing capital gains on inherited funds to go untaxed -- a so-called ""trust fund"" loophole the White House says allows billions of dollars in capital gains to go untapped by the government every year. ""This proposal is doing what it is intended to do, which is to make sure that the large, accumulated, unearned wealth of the wealthiest Americans is actually subject to tax,"" an Obama administration official said. ""We are quite confident that we can do this in a way that achieves that objective while in fact helping middle-class families by putting those resources to better use."" The arguments against raising tax rates on investment income are well established: opponents argue it poses a ""double tax"" scenario, since the corporate profits that drive stock prices are already subject to taxes. And they stress some portion of investment gains is driven by inflation. But Republicans aren't necessarily opposed to altering how investment income is taxed: last year's proposal from the top Republican on the House tax writing committee, Rep. Dave Camp, called for applying ordinary income tax rates on 60% of capital gains and excluding the other 40% altogether. That put the top rate at 21%. In his speech Tuesday, Obama also plans to all for a new fee on large financial institutions which administration officials estimated would bring in $110 billion; Camp's plan called for an excise tax on large banks. ""I would say that a number of the ideas that the President is outlining in this new proposal do have --already have -- clear congressional bipartisan support,"" a senior administration official said Saturday. Republicans were dismissive of the tax initiatives unveiled Saturday evening. ""This is not a serious proposal,"" Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan, told CNN. ""We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler, flatter tax code, not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending."" Obama has spent the last two weeks offering up an advance look at his State of the Union address, including the community college proposal, a plan to expand high-speed Internet and reducing rates of federally backed mortgages. The early look is meant to introduce Americans to each scheme individually, said administration aides, who determined the yearly laundry-list of plans -- combined with updates on America's foreign policy -- wasn't digestible during a single prime-time event. That doesn't mean, however, the speech will necessarily be any shorter than the 65-minute address Obama delivered last year. ""It will still be a healthy speech in terms of breadth and length,"" one official said. Why Obama's going to India after his State of the Union speech .","Republicans criticize tax initiatives .

"In the aftermath of the presidential election, Republicans have been inundated with advice to moderate, equivocate, and even abandon their core principles as a necessary prerequisite for winning future elections. That is absurd. America already has one liberal political party; there is no need for another one. Make no mistake: Despite losing an election, conservative ideals still hold true. Government spending still does not grow our economy. American weakness on the world stage still does not lead to peace. Higher taxes still does not create prosperity for all. And, more government still does not grow jobs. Politics: Jindal stays quiet on 2016 House bid . The Republican party does have a lot of work to do. But changing our principles is not a winning strategy. We need to modernize, not moderate. Here are seven lessons Republicans should learn in order to move forward. 1. Stop looking backward. We have to boldly show what the future can look like with the free market policies that we believe in. Conservative ideals are aspirational, and our country is aspirational. 2. Compete for every single vote. The 47% and the 53%. And any other combination of numbers that adds up to 100 percent. President Barack Obama and the Democrats can continue trying to divide America into groups of warring communities with competing interests, but we will have none of it. We are going after every vote as we try to unite all Americans. 3. Reject identity politics. The old notion that ours should be a colorblind society is the right one, and we should pursue that with vigor. Identity politics is corrosive to the great American melting pot and we reject it. We will treat all people as individuals rather than as members of special interest groups. 4. Stop being the stupid party. It's time for a new Republican party that talks like adults. It's time for us to articulate our plans and visions for America in real terms. We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments. Enough of that. Opinion: It wasn't only minorities voting Obama . 5. Stop insulting the intelligence of voters. We need to trust the smarts of the American people. We have to stop dumbing down our ideas and stop reducing everything to mindless slogans and tag lines for 30-second ads. We must be willing to provide details in describing our views. 6. Quit ""big."" We are not the party of big business, big banks, big Wall Street bailouts, big corporate loopholes, or big anything. We must not be the party that simply protects the well off so they can keep their toys. We have to be the party that shows all Americans how they can thrive. We are the party whose ideas will help the middle class, and help more folks join the middle class. We are a populist party and need to make that clear. 7. Focus on people, not government. We must stop competing with Democrats for the job of ""Government Manager,"" and come up with ideas that can unleash the dynamic abilities of the American people. We need to lead the way with policies that can create prosperity. We believe in organic solutions, not big government solutions. We need a bottom-up government that fits the digital age. Right now we have an outdated centralized government trying to manage a decentralized economy. Politics: Jindal slams Romney for 'gifts' comment about minorities, young voters . There are many challenges facing our country. For example, our education system seems to be in the Stone Age and miserably outdated. It's time to update traditional public schools, charter schools, home schools, online schools and parochial schools. Let the dollars follow the child instead of forcing the child to follow the dollars, so that every child has the opportunity to attain an education. Our energy policy is outdated as well, stuck in old ideological arguments which harm our ability to create a more sustainable future where energy independence can actually be achieved. We have to change that. We need an equal opportunity society, one in which government does not see its job as picking winners and losers. Where do you go if you want special favors? Government. Where do you go if you want a tax break? Government. Where do you go if you want a handout? Government. This must stop. Our government must pursue a level playing field. At present, government is the un-leveler of the playing field. This is a pathway forward for the Republican party, one that honors our principles, the American people, and also, will help us win elections.","Bobby Jindal: Republicans have been inundated with advice to abandon core values .

"(CNN)A special team of hotshot Corvette restorers has dealt a blow against an evil sinkhole that desecrated the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. This week General Motors and Chevrolet unveiled the 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil -- the first of three damaged cars that will be restored from a disaster that stunned Corvette fans around the world. Remember? Back in February, a freakish sinkhole appeared inside the museum, swallowing eight beautiful machines with an estimated value at about $1 million, the museum said. When the cars were hauled out of the hole, only three were deemed unscathed enough for restoration. Hey, this is a big deal. Experts call the Corvette the most collected car in America. GM says it's the ""world's longest-running, continuously produced passenger car."" The Blue Devil is no ordinary Corvette. Even though it's only 5 years old, it's been dubbed a ""supercar"" and ""legendary"" with a top speed of more than 200 mph. The sleek demon went on display for the first time on Monday during a ceremony at the big Specialty Equipment Marketing Association show in Las Vegas. It's not often car restorers get a chance to rescue a vehicle this special. This job was handled by a 10-member team with a less-than-sexy handle: GLS -- Global Logistics Services. ""We need to come up with a better name -- like the Corvette Restoration SWAT Team!"" laughed GM spokesman Monte Doran. It may feel like a big win for the Corvette Nation against the forces of nature -- but now may be a bit too soon to crow about it. ""That car really had very little damage done to it, compared to all the other cars in the sinkhole. It was a relatively easy restoration,"" Doran said. That news will please CNN commenters who joked that the damage to the cars could be ""buffed out"" -- as easily as paint scratches. The biggest challenge, he acknowledged, will be the 1 Millionth Corvette, the 1992 convertible which was the millionth 'Vette to come off the assembly line. Fixing a hole . But what about that hole? This coming Monday, work is set to begin to fill the 30-foot-deep sinkhole which ruined the museum's bright yellow, red-spired Skydome. Estimated cost of the eight-month project: $3.2 million. ""They'll be bringing in equipment and moving cars out of the room, before they start work on the sinkhole,"" said museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli. The museum had initially considered leaving the hole unfilled as a permanent display -- perhaps because the disaster has been good for business. In the months since the earth opened up and snatched these precious cars from our midst, visitors to the museum have increased by 71% over the same period last year, she said. Folks have been able to see the hole safely through a glass window. Also on display, are five cars that were pulled from the hole -- but were too wrecked to be restored: . -- A 1984 PPG pace car . -- A 1993 ruby red ""40th Anniversary Corvette"" -- A 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 Corvette . -- The 2009 white ""1.5 Millionth Corvette"" -- A 1993 ZR-1 Spyder . But visitors said they wanted more. So the museum has started selling jars full of dirt from the sinkhole for $10 a pop. ""They asked for it,"" Frassinelli said. ""The dirt has little bits of fiberglass in it from the cars."" The road ahead for the remaining two salvageable cars is a bumpy one. A 1962 beauty dubbed the ""Black Corvette"" is just too old for GM to handle. The company says it no longer has the institutional knowledge required to properly put it back in shape. That job is expected to be done by a hand-picked restoration specialist team, Frassinelli said. ""We haven't identified who's fixing it yet."" GM has accepted the challenge of restoring the worst-damaged of the salvageable cars: the 1 Millionth Corvette. It ""has much, much more damage than the Blue Devil,"" Doran said. It's ""going to be a much harder, much longer process. Simply because the car is older so it's hard to get replacement parts. We don't have all the expertise in house that we do with current Corvettes like the Blue Devil."" One of the biggest decisions is how many of the parts on the car should be replaced. ""One of the guys in design calls it a 'respectful restoration,' "" Doran said. ""You want to keep as much of the original components as you possibly can to preserve the history of the car."" Restoration on the 1 Millionth Corvette is set to begin in January, Doran said, and the job is expected to take about six months. Chevrolet's total contribution to the museum: $250,000. An agreement with GM allows the museum to keep the insurance money for the Blue Devil and Spyder -- which are both owned by GM -- in addition to paying to fix the Blue Devil, the 1962 Black Corvette and the 1992 1 Millionth, Frassinelli said. Meanwhile, the Blue Devil will be back home soon. Packed with loving care in a special enclosed truck by special handlers, Doran said it is expected to head to the museum around Saturday. When it gets there, workers will roll it back into the holy church of the Corvette Nation, where for generations to come, visitors will talk about how it survived the Great Corvette Sinkhole of 2014.","GM unveils first restored Corvette from National Corvette Museum sinkhole disaster .

"(CNN)For expert car restorers at General Motors, a wrecked, supervaluable 1992 Corvette represents a tall mountain to climb. Of the three repairable Corvettes that fell down a sinkhole at Kentucky's National Corvette Museum in February, the 1 millionth Corvette -- a white convertible -- will be the hardest to bring back to its former glory. Of the eight cars swallowed by the hole, only three have been deemed salvageable. On Wednesday, General Motors and Chevrolet showed it off to the media at a special facility in Warren, Michigan, before restorers begin what's expected to be a long restoration process. The sweet machine is pretty banged-up. Chevy says it's the most valuable of the three cars. Car and Driver lists its worth at $750,000 or more. At age 22, the car is old enough that it will be hard to find or create replacement parts. Plus, restorers will be forced to try to salvage as much of the original components as possible to preserve the history of the car. Experts call the Corvette the most collected car in America. GM says it's the ""world's longest-running, continuously produced passenger car."" Recently, restoration on the first of the three salvageable cars --  a 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil -- was completed. The museum said last month that the third fixable vehicle, a 1962 black Corvette, is just too old for GM to handle. The company said it no longer has the institutional knowledge required to properly put it back in shape. That job is expected to be done by a hand-picked restoration specialist team, the museum said. Five of the eight damaged cars were deemed too beat-up to be restored: . • A 1984 PPG pace car . • A 1993 ruby red ""40th anniversary Corvette"" • A 2001 Mallett Hammer Z06 Corvette . • The 2009 white ""1.5 millionth Corvette"" • A 1993 ZR-1 Spyder . As for the 1 millionth Corvette, it's expected to be back as close to mint condition as possible by June.

"April, the cruelest month: Time for tax deadlines and tax policy follies. Hence, the resurrection of the so-called Buffett Rule. Named after Warren Buffett, who said it was an outrage that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, the proposal is designed to ensure that the really rich -- those with annual reported taxable incomes of more than $1 million -- pay an ""effective tax rate"" of 30%. The idea is another attempt by President Barack Obama to restore some measure of progressivity to the tax code. Baffled and blocked by the mythical Joe the Plumber, Obama has been unable to restore the top marginal tax rate on those reporting more than $250,000 a year to their pre-George Bush levels, a top rate of 39.6% from its current 35%. That seemingly modest proposal was a centerpiece of Obama's landslide 2008 election campaign. It has gone nowhere. Neither will the Buffett Rule. Why? Because the idea has three fatal flaws. 1. The Buffett Rule is moot. It's dead on arrival. The rule has no chance of getting through the House, even it can get through the Senate.  And if history is any guide, any form of tax increase, on anyone, will not bring votes to any person or party in November, so there are no political points to score here.  Ask Joe the Plumber. The practical political fact sits alongside some pressing fiscal facts: America is running massive deficits. Our spending is too high. Our revenues are too low. We are a Greece waiting to happen. Meanwhile, inequality of all forms is getting worse. We need to do something, not nothing. Empty April symbolism is nothing. 2. The Buffett Rule won't help solve the real problems. It won't help the fiscal problem because it is a drop in the bucket. The most optimistic projections are that the rule might raise $50 billion a year. That's unlikely, because people plan around tax increases, but even if we get it, it is about 3% of the projected $1.5 trillion deficit. The rule could only be meaningful if it were some kind of first step. But first step toward what? History shows that marginal tax rates were raised on the very highest bracket to 94% in the midst of World War II. History also shows that almost no one paid tax in this bracket. Why do it then? Because a top rate of 94% made lower rates of 50% and 70% look more palatable. Is the Buffett Rule a first step toward lowering the 30% flat rate to those making more than $250,000, or raising other middle-class taxes? It is hard to see anything very good happening here. 3. The Buffett Rule, even if enacted, won't work because it won't really affect Warren Buffett! The really, really rich in America don't pay high taxes because they don't report high incomes.  And they don't report high incomes for perfectly legal reasons. As I have been writing for decades now, the really, really rich, including Robert Kiyosaki's ""Rich Dad,"" follow the three simple steps of Tax Planning 101: Buy, borrow and die. By buying assets that rise in value without producing cash, the really, really rich benefit from ""unrealized appreciation"" that need not go down on any tax form. This is key to the business and investment strategy of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. When the really, really rich want to consume, they borrow, also tax-free under the income tax. To cash it all out, the really, really rich die, like we all do -- and then the so-called stepped-up basis on death means that their heirs can sell off assets and pay off debts, tax-free. We can and should attack Tax Planning 101 and make the really, really rich pay some tax. We should address the tax benefits of unrealized appreciation and, even more so, of borrowing. We can do so, surprisingly simply, by a progressive consumption tax, as I and others, like Robert Frank and Greg Mankiw, have advocated for years.  That's real reform that would really affect Warren Buffett. As such, I suppose it must wait until April passes.","The Buffett Rule is designed to make sure those who make over $1 million pay more tax .

"The first frosts of winter have already dusted the spectacular city of St. Petersburg with a powder of glistening ice. The air outside feels sharp and crisp. Russians hurry along the elegant boulevards, wrapped up tight against the biting cold. Russia's winter, its annual deep freeze, has begun. But this year there's more than just a bitter chill in the air. For the past nine months relations with the West have become decidedly frosty too. On the face of it the problem is Ukraine. The West backed a popular uprising there in March, which toppled a Kremlin-friendly government. Infuriated, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, annexed the strategic Crimean Peninsula, where it has a key naval base. Since then he has been accused of fuelling a separatist rebellion in the mainly Russian-speaking east of the country. That unrest has already cost more than 4,000 lives. The United States and Europe have imposed costly sanctions and travel bans. It threatens more. On the international stage, Russia has been excluded from the G8 group of industrialized nations. At the recent G20 summit in Brisbane, President Putin was cold-shouldered by his Western counterparts. But the Russian leader appears unmoved, his Ukraine policy unchanged. One fascinating explanation for the failure of Western sanctions and rebukes to change this vast country's behavior may be in the mindset, the world view, of its strongman president. I'm one of the few Western journalists to have sat down with Vladimir Putin. I met him at his residence outside Sochi in 2008, just after Russia's invasion of Georgia. I asked him back then if he could guarantee that Russian troops would not invade other former Soviet states, like Ukraine. He reacted quite angrily, saying he objected to my question. It was Russians, he said, who should be given guarantees that no one attacks us. The comment sheds light, I think, on how Vladimir Putin sees the world outside the walls of the Kremlin. For him, Russia is under constant threat from the West. NATO expansion into former Eastern Bloc nations has eroded Russia's security. The prospect of Georgia joining the western military alliance, let alone Ukraine, is unthinkable for him. The Cold War, from this perspective, has never really ended; we're still living in the 1980s. The West, in particular the United States, still strives to ""subjugate"" Russia. President Putin repeated this just a few days ago in Moscow. Sanctions are an inevitable consequence of Russia's resistance to this subjugation. Ukraine was the motive, but if it had not been Ukraine it would likely have been something else. From a Western perspective, this seems like a cynical distortion of the facts, a Kremlin ploy to confuse and obfuscate. But it may help explain why Russia is doing what it is doing, and why sanctions are not changing -- and may never change -- Kremlin policy. It may also help to explain why, at a time of growing economic hardship, Russia's president remains so utterly popular at home. His world view is theirs too. Like the harsh cold of the coming Russian winter, confrontation with the West is inevitable and must be endured.","Putin accused of fuelling separatist rebellion in mainly Russian-speaking east of Ukraine .

"(CNN)It started right on New Year's Eve with one prominent businessman posing a simple question to a few of his close friends and fellow business leaders:  ""How can we make sure that young people will see this movie?"" According to Bill Lewis, co-chairman of investment banking at Lazard, that simple inquiry quickly led to an initiative supported by more than a score of African-American business leaders in New York. The goal? To provide funding that would let tens of thousands of New York City middle school students see the film ""Selma"" for free. Now, African-American business leaders in two dozen other cities have taken up the challenge of #SelmaforStudents, with the hope that nearly 300,000 middle and high school students across the country will have seen ""Selma"" in its first week. What is it that so quickly and powerfully united these business leaders?  What is it about ""Selma"" that struck a chord, leading them  to launch this ""first-of-its-kind"" initiative? It was not driven by a studio or even by the film's high profile producer Oprah Winfrey, who expressed surprise, excitement and pride at hearing of the plan. Instead, as Lewis and others expressed to me, it was their own response to seeing the film that compelled such personages as Charles Phillips, CEO of Infor, Ken Chenault, the CEO of American Express, Tony Coles, former CEO of Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Ursula Burns CEO of Xerox, Edith Cooper, Goldman Sachs' Global Head of Human Capital Management, and 22 others to shape, develop and implement their plan in a series of email exchanges over one weekend. Without question, ""Selma"" resonates strongly at a time when our country is gripped by race-related protests.  For many African-Americans, the civil rights challenges of 2015 have served as a sobering reminder of the ongoing salience of race and racism in American life. The movie provides a sense of historical context for these ongoing struggles, but more importantly, reminds us of the sacrifices that made possible the success we enjoy today. The leaders who created the initiative are direct beneficiaries of those early sacrifices, and they know it.  Most serve on boards of civil rights organizations and African-American and other cultural institutions and are leading philanthropists for causes that elevate African-American history and struggle. The push to expose students to ""Selma"" speaks to their desire that young people today be aware of our rich history and the continuing advocacy still needed for racial equality. It provides an opportunity for young people to reclaim and engage a critical--though distant, for them-- part of African-American history.  And it also allows these leaders to acknowledge the arc of their own journey. Many have suggested that the television miniseries ""Roots"" shaped a generation, prompting African-Americans to openly engage the history and devastation wrought by slavery and compelling our country to confront its original sin. ""Selma"" has the potential to play a similar role, engaging young people with a history that has powerful resonance for the challenges and struggles we confront today, and bringing to life the courage, the determination and humanity of a generation of African-Americans on whose shoulders we all stand.","Sherrilyn Ifill, Darren Walker: Black leaders funding drive to pay for students to see ""Selma""

"(CNN)Tens of thousands of people in the southern tip of Malawi have been cut off by deadly floods, leaving them without food, clean water or access to health care, aid organizations have warned, while many others have been displaced. Conflicting accounts from the southeast African nation put the number killed at anywhere from dozens to more than 170. Gift of the Givers, an African nongovernmental organization specializing in disaster response, said Malawi was facing ""probably the greatest flood disaster in the history of its existence."" In a Facebook post Saturday, the organization said 173 people were confirmed killed -- and warned of worse news to come. ""The death toll is expected to rise as it is believed that 183 people have been swept away from one village alone,"" the group said. ""Massive destruction to agriculture, roads, bridges and general infrastructure including power facilities has complicated the situation due to prolonged power outages."" Malawi President Peter Mutharika on Wednesday put the number of dead at 48. Declaring a state of emergency in the areas affected, he said an estimated 70,000 people had been forced from their homes. He appealed for international assistance, saying: ""Tents and food are urgently required. Rescue operations are also a priority."" Gift of the Givers said that 200,000 people had been displaced and 11,000 homes damaged. A day earlier, the U.N. humanitarian affairs agency, OCHA, put the number displaced at about 100,000. Medecins San Frontiers, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said Friday that around 20,000 people in the country's southern tip ""remain cut off from the rest of the country without food, health care and ways to prevent possible outbreaks."" The current flooding is due to weeks of heavy rain exacerbated by Tropical Cyclone Bansi, Gift of the Givers said. However, another storm due to arrive Sunday -- Tropical Cyclone Chedza -- could present even more of a threat. Chedza ""is expected to be far more destructive than Cyclone Bansi bringing more heavy rains and greater flooding,"" Gift of the Givers said. Flood rescue and medical teams have been put on standby in case of the worst, it said. The organization said Malawi's military had already rescued more than 4,000 people, with the fear that many more are trapped in inaccessible areas. Floodwaters up to 6 feet deep have submerged homes and bridges, making access to some areas possible only by helicopter, MSF said. Humanitarian relief is slowly arriving in the district of Chikwawa, where the waters have started to recede, MSF said. But other communities downstream in the Nsanje district, are still in trouble. ""The floods are behaving like a slow tsunami with the river swelling progressively downstream towards the south and Mozambique,"" says Amaury Gregoire, MSF's head of mission in Malawi . ""Most of Nsanje and East Bank are submerged under two to three meters of water, which has transformed these vast plains into a giant lake engulfing houses and bridges. Even though these areas are prone to floods, old people I talked to could not remember events of this magnitude."" The floods have destroyed crops that many people rely on and swept away their meager possessions, raising fears for the future once the waters recede. There's also the risk of outbreaks of disease, MSF said, as those who have fled the floods seek refuge with friends or relatives, as well as in camps. MSF has been distributing mosquito nets and water treatment kits, and building latrines to try to limit the spread of disease. ""The little mud houses are very crowded, and, with most wells and boreholes contaminated by the floods, people are living in precarious, unsanitary conditions,"" said Gregoire. Gift of the Givers warned of the danger of a cholera outbreak, as well as other waterborne diseases, thanks to the lack of clean drinking water and contamination with sewerage. The U.N. World Food Programme said Friday it was preparing to move stocks of food to the affected areas. This will include more than 100 metric tons of high-energy biscuits, enough to meet the immediate food needs of some 77,000 people, said Elisabeth Byrs of the WFP. Malawi, with a population of 13 million, is one of the poorest countries in the world. More than 40% of children have low growth for their age as a result of under-nutrition, Byrs said. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau and Christabelle Fombu contributed to this report.","Flooding in Malawi has forced 200,000 people from their homes, aid organization says .

"A massive cleanup effort was underway early Sunday at an Istanbul park where hours earlier Turkish riot police cleared protesters camped out in what has become ground zero in anti-government demonstrations targeting the policies of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. At least 29 people were injured in clashes Saturday as police sealed off Taksim Square and took Gezi Park, Istanbul Gov. Huseyin Avni Mutlu said in remarks carried on Turkish television stations. Police pushed protesters onto side streets, where on one street many -- with their faces covered with masks because of tear gas and smoke -- appeared to reorganize. Chanting ""long live Taksim solidarity,"" the demonstrators began moving back toward the square and park. In turn, authorities fired tear gas and a water cannon down the street to try to disperse them. The move came after police warned demonstrators who have occupied Istanbul's last remaining green space for more than two weeks to depart voluntarily or face being ejected. By early Sunday morning, most protesters had dispersed and the cleanup was underway, according to CNN's Arwa Damon, who was reporting in the area. Calls for political reforms . The protest that began over Erdogan's plan to turn the park into a mall quickly devolved into large anti-government demonstrations that have seen calls for political reforms. What's driving unrest and protests in Turkey? Erdogan, who has been defiant of protest demands, said earlier in the day at a rally with supporters in Ankara that if protesters did not leave on their own, they would be forced out of Gezi Park. ""If it is not emptied, from now on, this country's security forces will know how to empty that place,"" he said. A few minutes later, police used loudspeakers to order the protesters out of the park, saying it was their last warning. But the demonstration continued as the sun began to set, with hundreds of people packing the square, some of them wearing gas masks, others linking arms in solidarity and anticipation. During his speech, Erdogan said the demonstrators were not meeting him halfway. ""We have reached out with our hands,"" he said. ""However, some people returned their fists in response. Can you shake hands with those who reach out with a fist?"" And he ridiculed the protesters' assertions that they are environmentalists, calling them ""thugs"" instead, and citing their honking of horns as evidence of their insincerity. ""This is called noise pollution,"" he said. A dozen of his Justice and Development AK Party buildings have been damaged and burned, he said, accusing ""outsiders"" of staging the demonstrations. He accused demonstrators of inciting sectarian violence by attacking a woman who was wearing a headscarf, kicking her, dragging her on the ground and snatching away her head cover. He accused some demonstrators of having entered a mosque while wearing shoes, drunk alcohol there and written insulting slogans on the walls -- acts forbidden by Muslims -- but said authorities had been patient. Erdogan said the courts will handle such incidents. Letters from Turkey, with pride . He said he did not understand the concerns about the park, since no contracts have been signed and no construction has begun. ""There is nothing yet to protest,"" he said. 'Every kind of hypocrisy' Erdogan accused social media for spreading misinformation, the national media of lying and the international media of displaying ""every kind of hypocrisy"" in its reporting, but he expressed gratitude for the crowd's support. He praised his government's performance over the past 10 years, citing a rising standard of living, a stock market that has broken records, a quintupling of the central bank's reserves, plans to build the world's biggest airport and the construction of a third bridge scheduled to begin carrying traffic in four lanes in either direction over the Bosporus in 2015. Erdogan said maintaining the park as a green space was not the real goal of most of the demonstrators, four of whom have been arrested. ""What is the issue then?"" he asked. ""It is to take down the AK Party government."" Except for a few who are genuinely concerned about the environment, the demonstrators are upset about Turkey's growing strength, he said, adding that more than 600 of his police had been wounded in the clashes. ""No one can scare us off,"" he said. Erdogan delivered his message to a supportive crowd, amid a carnival atmosphere and heavy police security. During his comments, some of his supporters waved the red-and-white Turkish flag as well as the orange, white and blue flag of Erdogan's AK Party. The festive mood contrasted sharply with the scene here overnight, when Turkish riot police sprayed rowdy anti-government demonstrators with water cannon and fired tear gas at them, arresting nearly a dozen people in the third consecutive night of clashes in the capital. Erdogan vs. protesters . The unrest began nearly 500 kilometers (311 miles) away, in Istanbul, nearly three weeks ago, when a small group of people turned out to protest government plans to bulldoze the city's Gezi Park and to replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of a 19th-century Ottoman barracks. Protesters said the plans represented a creeping infringement on their rights in a secular society. Turkey was founded after secularists in the early 20th century defeated Islamic Ottoman forces, and many modern-day secularists frown on Ottoman symbols. The protests broadened into an outpouring in the square and throughout the country as security forces cracked down on demonstrators. The images, seen worldwide on social media and TV, sparked criticism around the world as well as in Turkey, a NATO member and a U.S. ally. The unrest also signaled political danger for Erdogan, a populist and democratically elected politician serving his third term in office. Erdogan has been criticized -- even by his allies -- for using heavy-handed tactics in his governance and for trying to impose changes without first seeking public input. The park plan represented the final straw for many Turks, who accuse the government of trying to impose its will whenever and wherever it wants. On Friday, Erdogan met with protesters in Ankara and then said he would suspend plans to build the mall in Istanbul pending a court decision on the protesters' objections to its construction. If the judicial ruling is not in line with what Gezi protesters want, a popular vote will be held. Erdogan also agreed to investigate claims of excessive use of force by police during the protests, some of which have turned violent. Tayfun Kahraman, a city planner speaking on behalf of the Taksim Solidarity protest movement, thanked Erdogan and his ministers for accepting their demands for a meeting. ""We will closely follow his promises and the process. Unfortunately, four people died in the incidents. We still feel the pain of their death."" Despite conciliatory statements from both sides, protesters defied the pleas of their prime minister and remained encamped Saturday in the park where the demonstrations started 19 days ago.

"(CNN)You go for some target practice, look down the firing range and see at the other end that one of the targets is -- your brother, an old photo of him. National Guardswoman Valerie Deant was devastated to see her brother Woody's image pierced by police sniper bullets, she told NBC6 in an exclusive report. But his photo wasn't the only one of an African-American being used for target practice last November. There were six bullet-riddled mugshots of black males at the range. Racism? No, says North Miami Beach Police Chief J. Scott Dennis. Two of his snipers were using them for target practice -- one of them is Hispanic, and the other a black male of Haitian descent. Their target, a row of black men, which the snipers left behind at the stand, was one of many. There are also groups of white males, Hispanic males and white women. Picking the target carefully . There are 22 images in all, including a white man holding a gun to a white woman's head and one of now-dead al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. ""The same target inventory has been used for more than a decade,"" Dennis said in a statement. The idea is to have an array of photos with faces that look similar, so the sniper can practice exactly picking out the right target and avoid killing the wrong person in a real-life situation, Dennis said. The department uses mugshots of people they arrested 10 to 15 years ago, and Woody Deant was one of them. Deant told NBC6 that he was booked after a deadly drag race. He has walked the straight and narrow ever since, he said. ""I can sympathize with the family discovering their brother's photo on the target,"" Dennis said. Dennis became aware of the family being upset in late December and ordered an investigation. It turned up no violations of law or department policy. But things will change. ""We realize how important this issue is during today's climate,"" Dennis said. Snipers will no longer use mugshots of people they have arrested, but instead will buy practice pictures from commercial vendors. And they are instructed from now on to destroy their targets after they're done.","A woman was devastated to see her brother and other black men as targets, NBC6 reports .

"A top Nigerian military official believes he knows the whereabouts of girls kidnapped last month, but he says the nation's military will not use force to try to rescue them, a state news report said Monday. ""We want our girls back. I can tell you that our military can and will do it, but where they are held, can we go there with force?"" asked Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh. ""Nobody should say Nigerian military does not know what it is doing; we can't kill our girls in the name of trying to get them back."" His comments were reported by the News Agency of Nigeria, a state-run news service. Badeh continued: ""The good news for the parents of the girls is that we know where they are, but we cannot tell you. ""We cannot come and tell you the military secret, just leave us alone, we are working to get the girls back,"" he reportedly said. In response to the news, Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby told CNN U.S. officials were not able to confirm the report. More than 200 schoolgirls were kidnapped in northern Nigeria last month by Boko Haram, an act that drew international condemnation. The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok. The Nigerian military suffered an embarrassing setback when it retracted a report that nearly all the kidnapped girls were released. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing. Nigerians and others have accused their government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night. Boko Haram translates as ""Western education is a sin"" in the Hausa language. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram's attacks have intensified in recent years. Kidnapped girls: How you can help .

"Brussels (CNN)Soldiers stood guard outside the Jewish Museum in central Brussels on Saturday, as Belgium joined France in deploying its military alongside police to counter the threat of potential terror attacks. Security has been stepped up across Europe in the wake of last week's shootings in Paris and a sweeping Belgian counterterror operation two days ago that left two suspects dead in the city of Verviers. An attack at the Jewish Museum in Brussels last year by an accused gunman suspected of having joined ISIS in Syria left four people dead. Soldiers in camouflage gear and police could also be seen by the Great Synagogue of Europe in Brussels and some roads in the area were closed to traffic. Troops have been deployed in Belgium's largest city, Antwerp, to protect its Jewish district. The move follows a series of police raids that authorities said targeted a terror cell on the brink of carrying out an attack against police officers. Defense Minister Steven Vandeput told a news conference that besides Jewish sites, a number of embassies in Brussels were being protected, including those of the United States, Israel and Britain. Belgium has deployed 150 troops so far in Brussels and Antwerp, he said. That number could be increased by another 150 in the coming days and could be extended to other cities in Belgium, depending on police requests. The military personnel are supporting the police and are under their command, Vandeput said. Belgium's security council is expected to review the national threat level and security measures next week. Vandeput told journalists it was the first time in 35 years that the military had been deployed on the streets of Belgium. Overall, authorities made 17 arrests related to the Belgium threat -- 13 in Belgium and four at two locations in France. Three people remained in custody and two were released under strict conditions Saturday in Belgium, the prosecutor's office said.  The others were released. In addition, Belgium is seeking the extradition of two Belgian nationals arrested in France. In a sign of the widening scope of the threat, police in Greece said they are conducting an investigation in connection with the Belgian terror plot. A police spokesman would not specify whether anyone had been taken into custody, saying, ""We are not in a position to comment at this point."" Meanwhile, France has deployed more than 10,000 troops alongside thousands of police officers as it responds to the deadly attacks in Paris last week, in which 17 people were killed. A total of 122,000 police officers, gendarmes and military personnel are deployed as part of the security plan, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Friday. There are 12 people in custody in the Paris region in connection with the investigation there, according to the Paris prosecutor's office. A number have been arrested and then released. Two men in their early 40s were also arrested Friday in Berlin on suspicion of links to ISIS, police said. They did not appear to have been planning attacks in Germany and the police operation had been planned for some weeks. European counterterrorism agencies are scrambling to assess the potential terrorism threat from people with suspected links to Islamic extremists. As many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people could be ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, a Western intelligence source told CNN. European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies identified an ""imminent threat"" to Belgium, and possibly to the Netherlands, the source told CNN. ""There is a tremendous amount of concern over sleeper cells in Europe,"" said a Western official with direct knowledge of the situation. However, the Netherlands said it was not raising its terror threat level, currently at ""substantial,"" the second-highest level -- where it has been since March 2013. ""That means there is a realistic threat, but no concrete or specific information of an attack in the Netherlands,"" said Edmond Messchaert, a government spokesman. One of the two gunmen who attacked France's Charlie Hebdo magazine, Said Kouachi, was buried overnight in his hometown of Reims, France, his lawyer, Antoine Flacaquier said. Said Kouachi's wife was there, but no other family members -- and there was no imam present, Flacaquier told CNN affiliate BFM on Saturday. Kouachi was buried in an unmarked grave, Flacaquier said. His brother Cherif Kouachi's widow, Izzana Kouachi, had requested that both brothers be buried in Gennevilliers, on the outskirts of Paris. The Gennevilliers mayor's office told CNN that the city was obliged by law to bury Cherif Kouachi there, as he was a resident of the city. But a spokesman for the mayor, Jean-Francois Boye, said that it would not do the same for Said, because he lived in Reims. The two suspects killed in Belgium were shot during a police raid on a building in the eastern city of Verviers on Thursday, Belgian authorities said. A third suspect was injured and taken into custody in the operation. Authorities have not yet confirmed their identities. Federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said Friday that 13 people were arrested in a dozen ensuing anti-terror raids overnight. ""This group for what we know now was specifically targeting Belgium police and planned to kill Belgium police on the streets or in buildings where Belgium police is housed,"" he told CNN. ""We always have to take into account that there is a possibility that people who go to Syria and come back have plans to commit terrorist attacks. When possible, we try to monitor and we try to follow up these people and especially those who we think could be a threat, but like I said, a zero threat is impossible."" He said the Belgian authorities were already doing all they could to manage the threat. The suspected terror cell, which included people returning from Syria, planned to target police officers, Van Der Sypt said. Police said they recovered weapons, bomb-making materials and police uniforms. Two people suspected of involvement with the alleged terror cell in Verviers were detained trying to cross from France into Italy through the Frejus tunnel, a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said. The attacks in Paris began on January 7, when Said and Cherif Kouachi raided Charlie Hebdo magazine, killing 12 people. A day later, gunman Amedy Coulibaly -- who purportedly was affiliated with ISIS -- shot a policewoman in the south of Paris. Coulibaly killed four more people he had held hostage at a kosher supermarket. Police shot him and the Kouachi brothers dead on January 9. Security officials have since been working to track those with links to the three attackers. How the Kouachi brothers were radicalized . Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, claimed responsibility Wednesday for the Charlie Hebdo shooting. One or both the Kouachi brothers are thought to have traveled to Yemen. Sectarian turmoil in Yemen is bolstering al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's (AQAP) local recruitment, and buying it space for attacks against the West, according to one Western diplomat. AQAP's claimed involvement in the Charlie Hebdo attack has turned the spotlight on Yemen and potential connections between jihadists there and in France. A Yemeni official briefed on security matters told CNN that two Frenchmen had been detained a few months ago as they tried to leave the country. They were ""suspected of offering logistical support to AQAP in the south,"" the official said, adding that they were not thought to be offering to fight. He said officials were assessing whether to charge the men or what their next step would be. ISIS, the extremist Islamist group that controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, may present an even greater threat. Officials are monitoring groups of men who have returned from fighting in Syria. It is believed ISIS directed operatives to return to Europe to launch attacks in retaliation for airstrikes against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, according to the official. Several European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, are participating in the air campaign against ISIS in Iraq. ISIS runs large training facilities in Syria, has deep pockets, and access to thousands of potential European recruits.

"Washington (CNN)With the Senate expected to vote soon on the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, the State Department is now giving eight federal agencies two weeks to weigh in on it. The State Department on Friday notified those agencies have only until February 2 ""to provide their views on the national interest with regard to the Keystone XL Pipeline permit application,"" a department official told CNN Saturday, adding that the department ""continues its review"" of the pipeline's permit application. The State Department is involved because the pipeline originates outside U.S. borders, and is reviewing whether TransCanada Corp.'s 1,179-mile project is in the national interest. The U.S. government's review had been delayed pending a decision by the Supreme Court of Nebraska, one of the states it would run through. That court recently ruled the pipeline could proceed. So now it is up to the State Department to make its recommendation. The setting of the deadline for such entities as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Commerce and Interior departments could be a key indicator as observers wait for the administration to make a final determination of its position. The White House has said it was waiting for the State Department's recommendation before making its opinion known. Proponents of the pipeline got a boost this week with the release of a new CNN/ORC poll showing a majority of Americans favoring construction of the pipeline, which would bring Canadian oil to the Gulf of Mexico for refining. The survey said 57% supported it going forward and 28% opposing. Earlier this month the Republican-majority House of Representatives passed a bill to force construction, arguing it would create jobs and help guarantee energy independence. With Republicans now in control of the Senate, they have also made the Keystone a priority and promised a vote soon. The Senate resumes debate this coming week, with all 54 Republicans there expected to support it along with as many as nine Democrats. ""It is well past time, some six years past time as far as many of us are concerned. And we would like to see this pipeline moving,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters last week. ""At the end of the day what we're talking about with Keystone XL is jobs."" The White House has threatened that President Obama would veto the measure because Congress is trying to circumvent the current process, and it is unclear if Congress would be able to muster two-thirds of each house to override a veto. ""The President will make the decision that is best for the United States, that process is not finished yet. When it is done, a decision will come. Congress is trying to front run the process for politics,"" White House Senior Counselor Dan Pfeiffer said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" CNN's Eric Bradner contributed to this story.","The Senate is expected to vote soon on the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline .

"NASA has given the people of Earth a rare treat: A color mosaic that captures not only Saturn, but also the tiny dots of Earth and other planets in the background. The panorama, released Tuesday, was captured by the Cassini spacecraft on July 19, when the sun slipped behind the ringed planet. Earth appears as a bright blue dot to Saturn's lower right, just above Saturn's outer, halo-like E-ring. Venus is a dot to the upper left, with Mars appearing as a faint red dot above and to the left of Venus. This is the first image in which Saturn, its moons and rings, and Earth, Venus and Mars are all visible, NASA said. The image -- a panorama of 141 wide-angle pictures -- covers 404,880 miles across Saturn and its ring system. Cassini images showing both Saturn and Earth are rare because the sun is so close to Earth, that targeting the blue planet would damage Cassini's sensors, NASA says. The July 19 image was possible because Saturn blocked out the sun. Lonely, young planet drifting in space without a star . Space-minded earthlings might remember that July 19 was ""Wave at Saturn"" day. The Cassini team, knowing it would be capturing the Saturn-Earth images, invited people to take photos of themselves waving to the sky while the spacecraft took Earth's picture. Cassini was never going to see people gesturing from the tiny blue speck, of course, but that wasn't the point. People shared more than 1,400 images of themselves from that event, and in August, NASA released a collage of those pictures assembled to look like -- from a distance -- a portion of Earth's Western Hemisphere. The Cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997 and has been in orbit around the sixth planet from the sun since 2004. NASA hopes to have it continue to get more pictures and other data of Saturn, its rings and moons through 2017. Diamonds may be produced on other planets, including Saturn .","Image is Cassini's first showing Saturn, rings, moons, Earth, Venus and Mars at same time .

"Tokyo (CNN)How we view robots -- and the inevitable robotics revolution that we've been promised for so long -- depends largely on our background. For me, as an American, robots will be inherently linked with Star Wars as a kid, but later with the unstoppable android that was the Terminator. So, while I can dream of a cute, trashcan-sized companion, the fantasy is also coupled with an inherent fear that it may one day rise up and attempt to exterminate me. For many Japanese people, robots were a staple of pop culture growing up. From Osamu Tezuka's Astro Boy (known here by his original name, which translates as Mighty Atom) in the 1950s and 60s, to the towering, martial robots of the ""Gundam"" and ""Evangelion"" universes, to name but a few, robots have long held a special place in the collective imagination. Robot pioneers . So it really is no surprise that the country is on the leading edge of robot technology, and a visit to the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, known as Miraikan (Future Hall) in Tokyo really drives home the point. Here, visitors can interact with ASIMO, the Honda-developed android that can run, perform tasks, and interact with people. Honda first unveiled ASIMO a decade ago, and even today it remains a futuristic vision of what robotics may one day hope to achieve on a consumer scale. Miraikan also houses other, interactive automatons that show glimpses of what life might be like in 15, 20, or 30 years. There's Otonaroid, who looks like a young Japanese woman with silicone skin, flowing hair, and blinking eyes. And then there's Kodomoroid, an android newscaster that reads headlines to museum visitors, and Telenoid, a creepy-looking communication device that allows you to ""speak"" to friends or loved ones who are far away -- and feel as if you are sitting with them. You can hold and hug the Telenoid, and it hugs you back with its little stubs for arms. While giant fighting space robots may be a while off -- although engineers are reportedly planning a moving, 60 ft tall Gundam -- Japan is betting big that robots will have a greater place in our lives in the years to come. Help at home . From housework helpers which can ease the burden of a range of daily chores -- like Twenty-One, the multipurpose home care droid currently under development at Tokyo's Waseda University. With a humanoid upper body and wheeled base, it boasts a dexterity and mobility that would be helpful in any number of tasks, including assisting the elderly. Shigeki Sugano and his team have the vision of putting robots in everyone's homes. He tells me it will be decades before robots are mass-produced the way cars are today, but what is being developed today could well become commonplace in the future. Twenty-One is a great example of how Japanese researchers are thinking of helping the country's aging population. Androids -- humanoid robots --  may also one day soon act as companions and helpers to the elderly as Japan looks at its current demographic crisis and uses technology in inventive ways to combat a shrinking, aging population. Nursing homes could also benefit from ""wearable,"" exoskeleton robots, like Cyberdyne's HAL-5,  that can assist with mobility. Thanks to technological advances, including those in ""emotion recognition functions,"" robots are becoming a lot more sympathetic and ""human"" for want of a better term, and thus accepted. Last month, Japanese telecom company SoftBank showcased Pepper, ""the first robot to read human emotions,"" according to the company's CEO, Masayoshi Son. Elsewhere, national emergencies like the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi reactor have driven home the point that there remain myriad situations for which we soft, fragile humans are ill-equipped. Economic boon . Japan's robot revolution is not only underway, but has the backing of the country's government, which sees it as a potential antidote to decades of sluggish GDP growth. Last month, Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that he is bullish about the future of robotics, after photo ops at a Saitama nursing home and a Tokyo robotics factory. He's expressed a desire to ""set up a council on making a robotic revolution a reality in order to aid Japan's growth,"" and set a benchmark of tripling the robot market to ¥2.4 trillion ($24 billion). Abe also declared his hope that there will be a  high profile ""robot Olympics"" in 2020, a companion piece to the human version, which will be held in Tokyo that year. The Robolympics (as they should clearly be called) will act as a showcase for advancement in the fields of robotics and engineering. ""In 2020, I would like to gather all of the world's robots and aim to hold an Olympics where they compete in technical skills,"" Mr Abe told Jiji Press agency. ""We want to make robots a major pillar of our economic growth strategy."" Already ingrained in the country's cultural conciousness, the robots of today will hopefully encourage and inspire the next generation of  designers, programmers and engineers, in the way that I was inspired by Star Wars, and countless Japanese youths, by their rich robot anime and manga culture.

"Former teen idol David Cassidy must spend the next five years on probation after pleading no contest to a drunken driving charge in Los Angeles on Monday. A judge also ordered Cassidy, 63, to spend 90 days in alcohol rehab, but since he's been in a residential program since his arrest in January he will be able to check out soon and resume his entertainment career, his manager said, . In fact, the former ""Partridge Family"" singer has gigs booked starting in North Carolina next month. Cassidy was arrested after a California Highway Patrol officer stopped him for making an illegal turn at a red light near the Los Angeles International Airport in January. The singer-actor blew .19 -- twice the legal level -- on an alcohol test administered by the officer who stopped his rented Chevrolet Impala, according to a California Highway Patrol statement. It was his second DUI arrest in six months and third since 2011. 'Partridge Family' dispute led to Cassidy drinking relapse . His manager told CNN several days after his latest arrest that Cassidy's drinking was the result of stressful questioning he had just undergone by lawyers about a legal dispute regarding ""Partridge Family"" profits. ""David just completed a stint in rehab and was doing very well in sobriety,"" manager Jo-Ann Geffen said. ""He was in Los Angeles to attend depositions by Sony Pictures Television, respondents in a lawsuit filed by Cassidy in 2011 over what he claims are monies long due him from 'Partridge Family' merchandise, home video, etc.,"" she said. ""After attending his and his manager's depositions, it appears as if the pressure led to a brief relapse."" On the TV series, Cassidy played the eldest of five children of a widowed mother (Shirley Jones, who was then Cassidy's real-life stepmother). The family, all musicians, traveled to gigs in a brightly repainted school bus. When the show was canceled after four seasons, Cassidy launched his own pop music career, filling concert halls with screaming teenage girls attracted to such hits as ""I Think I Love You.""

"Taliban gunmen wearing police uniforms attacked the largest jail in a northern Pakistani province early Tuesday, allowing about 200 inmates to escape, authorities said. Around 35 of the escaped prisoners are high-profile militants, said Pervaiz Khattak, the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province where the attack took place. During the fighting that followed the assault at the prison in the city of Dera Ismail Khan, four police officials and five militants were killed, said Shoukat Yousafzai, the provincial information minister. There were 483 prisoners at the time of the attack, and a total of 200 have gone missing, according to Mushtaq Jadoon, the Dera Ismail Khan police commissioner. Militant group claims responsibility for Iraq prison attacks . The gunmen cut off the prison's power supply, then launched the attack from all sides, said Malik Qasim Khan, an adviser to the chief minister on prisons. Multiple explosions were reportedly heard. Jadoon said that the attackers announced the names of the people they wanted to free after they entered the jail and whisked the people away. The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Locals said they heard chants of Allah O Akbar, ""God is great"" and long live  the Taliban soon after the explosion and firing. Taliban spokesman Shahidaullah Shahid said the group freed around 300 prisoners, a claim that Pakistani army officials denied. Shahid described the operation as a success. Inayatullah Tiger,, a bomb disposal squad official, told CNN that forces have defused 350-kilogram bombs planted in various parts of the jail.  Suicide jackets, other bombs and explosives-laden chemical drums have also been defused and weapons have been recovered, he said. 1,200 inmates break out of Benghazi prison .","About 200 inmates escape, 35 of them high-profile militants, an official says .

"A Mexican man was sentenced Monday to 30 years' imprisonment in a border agent's 2010 shooting death linked to the federal government's ""Fast and Furious"" gun-tracking operation, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. District Court in Tucson. Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, 37, had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in October 2012 in the slaying of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. The judge also sentenced Osorio-Arellanes to five years of supervised release. ""We are not celebrating,"" Terry's family said in a statement. ""Today we recognized justice has been served and we believe the 30 year sentence imposed on this particular defendant is an appropriate sentence...  We remain hopeful that all suspects in this murder will be brought to justice."" Osorio-Arellanes was the first conviction in a case with a connection to the ""Fast and Furious"" operation the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives began in 2009 with the purpose of tracking around 2,000 weapons intended for drug cartels. Osorio-Arellanes admitted that on the night of December 14, 2010, he and four others were looking for drug traffickers to rob of marijuana. The group encountered Terry and other Border Patrol agents along Arizona's border with Mexico, and a gun battle broke out. What was 'Fast and Furious,' and what went wrong? In his plea agreement, Osorio-Arellanes agreed the shot that killed Terry was fired by a member of his group, although he did not claim to have personally fired the shot or blame someone else specifically for the crime. The Terry case has been controversial because two rifles from the ""Fast and Furious"" operation were found at the scene of his death. But U.S. officials have not produced evidence proving that Terry was killed with either of those guns. Osorio-Arellanes was wounded and arrested at the scene.  As part of the deal, prosecutors agreed not to seek the death penalty and dropped other charges against him. Other suspects have been apprehended, the U.S. attorney's office reported. Lionel Portillo-Meza and Ivan Soto-Barraza have been captured in Mexico. These defendants are charged with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, attempted interference with commerce by robbery, use and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, assault on a federal officer and possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The indictment also alleges the defendants assaulted Border Patrol agents William Castano, Gabriel Fragoza and Timothy Keller, who were with Terry during the firefight. In a related case,  Rito Osorio-Arellanes, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery and was sentenced to eight years in prison in January 2013.

"(CNN)For Ashley Bridges, life was good. She and her boyfriend, Jonathan Caughey, were in love and along with her young son Braiden, they were excited to become a family. The only distraction was her aching knee, which began bothering her in spring 2012. Bridges described the ""multiple trips"" to the doctor's office. ""The first appointment was like, 'I think there's something wrong with my knee. It's achy sometimes but then it goes away.' "" The doctor told her it was probably just arthritis or bursitis. Then she went back a couple of months later and was told it's ""something you're going to have to live with."" This went on for over a year until finally Bridges, who lives in Menifee, California, could not walk anymore and was referred to a specialist in October 2013. But before she made it to the specialist, the pain became so intense she had to go to the hospital. ""I had excruciating pain in my knee and my toes went numb. So I went to the hospital and they did an X-ray,"" she said. They had just wheeled Bridges back to the waiting room to wait for the results when they rushed her back into a room and said the doctor needed to speak with her. The doctor came in and said, ""You have bone cancer."" A cancer known as osteosarcoma. She was just 24 years old and in shock from the news. Bridges couldn't believe what she was hearing, . ""I was like, no. 'Cause who thinks of when their knee hurts that they have bone cancer?"" Bridges still gets emotional when she talks about how long it took to get her eventual diagnosis. ""I'm angry,"" Bridges said, tears welling in her eyes, ""but there's really nothing we can do about it now. The doctor that I went to repeatedly and repeatedly telling him something wasn't right probably cost me my life. This is a very aggressive cancer. I could have had more time."" Bridges underwent surgery to replace her knee and remove the majority of her femur. The doctors also said she should start chemotherapy immediately, but there was a very big risk. Bridges was already 10 weeks pregnant with a baby girl. ""They told me what would likely happen to Paisley, that you know, she most likely wouldn't make it and I just knew. It wasn't a choice to me. It was like this is what needs to be done. She's first. I'm not going to kill a healthy baby because I'm sick. There's nothing wrong with her. Her life is just as important as mine if not more important. I mean as a mother my job is to protect my kids."" Unwavering in her decision to delay treatment -- a choice that could ultimately cost her life -- she knew Caughey and her mother would support her no matter what. Bridges' mother, Renee Thomas, said her daughter has always been strong-willed and this decision didn't surprise her. ""I always tell her it's not over 'til it's over,"" she said. ""You never know. We might get that miracle"" But after giving birth to Paisley in July, a full body scan revealed the cancer had spread throughout Bridges' body, even into her brain. ""When they told me that, I think oh my gosh, I am really dying. I'm not going to beat this. And then I am sad for about a week and then I get back to OK, well it's not over yet. And then I'll be good and then I'll get some more bad news that it spread through my whole entire body. And then that will knock me down for about a week and then I'll bounce back."" But Bridges admits it's hard to be in pain all the time. Bridges' doctors say she has months to live, but she still has goals. ""I am really pushing for Paisley's first birthday. This is what I do. I do October, OK, I just got to make it to Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving comes around -- OK, let's just go to Christmas. Then Christmas comes and Braiden's birthday is in March, so I'm going to make it to Braiden's birthday. I'm just going to keep setting little goals for myself and we'll see."" 24-year-old cancer victim inspires after death . After the terminal diagnosis, Bridges and Caughey moved their wedding date up a couple of months to this past November. Bridges brightens when she talks about her wedding day. Braiden, 6, got to walk her down the aisle. ""It just went by so fast. If I could sum that day up it would just be magical. Magical. Loved it. Loved seeing all my friends, my family all together."" Lindsey Natzic-Villatoro, owner of Love Song Events and Photography, planned the wedding in just a few weeks and has become a source of support for Bridges and her family. She also has photographed Bridges' recent milestones -- from her pregnancy and the newborn to her engagement and holiday pictures -- documenting many of life's firsts. Natzic-Villatoro, a mother of three, sees Bridges as the perfect example of what motherhood is all about. ""I think that this has helped express to others who have never had children the depth of actually a mom's love -- the selflessness. It's just like the best example that she has shown the entire world. So for that, she is definitely one of the most bravest people that I've ever met."" For Bridges, the memories and photographs are invaluable. ""It means everything. My kids are going to have these memories. My husband's going to have these. And my kids are going to be able to look at these forever."" When asked about what her legacy might be, Bridges softly breaks down and says, ""I want my kids to know how much I love them and how much I fought for them."" When the cancer you beat comes back .

"Essex, England (CNN)With a flick of her wrist, the drum beat begins. The familiar deep sound of the tom-tom drum echoes around the makeshift studio. But this is a musical performance with a twist. For a start, the ""studio"" is actually a converted barn deep in the English countryside. The woman playing the ""instrument"" is Grammy Award-winning musician Imogen Heap. And the drum she's beating doesn't exist. Pioneering the fusion of wearable tech and music, Heap is in a completely different octave thanks to what she calls her Mi.Mu Gloves -- gloves that put the power to create an entire musical composition right at her fingertips. ""In the past the only way that I could interact with the computer (to make music) was by using a mouse and a keyboard and this is very two-dimensional,"" explains the musical trendsetter. ""I wanted to be able to have something which ... was directly from (the) brain -- to quickly be able to manipulate sound just by intuitive gestures."" While visiting MIT's Media Lab in 2009, Heap met Elly Jessop, an engineer developing her own musical gloves using gestural data. Heap's mind exploded with ideas and she soon set about putting together a team of musicians, makers, hackers and technologists to bring her ideas to life. Fast forward five years and the dream is finally becoming a reality. Known for her distinctive fusion of soft acoustic sounds, electronica and tech, the British-born artist hopes the gloves will also help bring her music to fans in a more tangible way. ""The gloves help me embody those sounds which are hidden inside the computer, for me to physicalize them and bring them out so that I can play them and the audience members will understand what I am doing -- rather than fiddling around on a keyboard and mouse which is not very clear -- I could just be doing my emails."" How it works . Each glove is loaded with a myriad of sensors, buzzers and buttons that all send a chorus of information wirelessly back to computer software. It then interprets each gesture and produces sounds. ""It has sensors in the fingers that sense the bend of your finger, all of them, including the thumb, some motion sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers,"" explains Kelly Snook, a Mi.Mu engineer, who has been working on the gloves project since its conception almost six years ago. ""It takes all the information about your hand and the posture that you are making -- where your hand is positioned and how fast you are moving it -- and it sends all that information to the computer and then allows you to, on the computer, tell your music software what to do with each gesture."" She adds: ""It has little buzzers in your wrist that ... (vibrate) when you've done something or you are in this mode. It's all wireless and it's all very seamless."" Music and movement have forever had a symbiotic relationship. But with these gloves, Heap hopes to take her stage performances a step further. ""Movement for me is key,"" she says. ""I have a body and I have a mind and in my mind I have music. And it's a very shapely, sculptural thing that's going on. ""With the gloves I've almost got infinite mobility and so many different ways that different actions can cross over each other and therefore make something I wouldn't have thought of -- I can almost jam with myself,"" she laughs. ""So movement and playing with music with my hands, almost like a potter, is now becoming a reality with these gloves that I've been developing with my team."" Musical revolution? The gloves are already making waves among technologists and musicmakers eager to get their hands on them. Initially, the project looked to KickStarter for crowdsourced funding, and while they didn't make their target, the campaign introduced the team to a group of like-minded engineers and hackers, who still wanted to help fund the bespoke gestural gloves. They now collaborate with the team by providing data and feedback from use of their own pair. ""We found 15 people who were willing to invest quite a lot of money at this early stage and help us develop them further. (They) have their own gloves and they range from people interested in robotics, to music therapy, to storytelling, to musicians, to sound engineers and animators -- all kids of different people,"" says Heap. And the gloves look set for international stardom as they've even caught the attention of pint-sized pop princess Ariana Grande, who recently spent some time with Heap and ordered her own gloves to bring on tour next year, according to the thrilled Mi.Mu team. The team is quick to point out the idea isn't particularly new -- gestural music devices have been around for decades. But they hope they can spur the musical innovation forward. Snook says: ""We are not the first to do this, nor will we be the last. We've just been really passionate about doing it for music and doing it on stage and breaking down the barriers between the audience and the performer and making it much more intuitive the way the performer can communicate what they are doing electronically. ""Similar to when the electric guitar came on the scene, music really changed because of that one liberating instrument and so what's exciting to me about the glove project is the way that we could be seeing that complete shift in music making and performance."" Heap adds: ""The gloves have certainly changed the way I make music. I'm not going to say it's going to change the world. It's certainly part of a big movement of wearable tech and I really hope that we can move forward the game.""","Imogen Heap is a Grammy-Award winning artist beloved for her fusion of music and tech .

"(CNN)Two University of Virginia fraternities that threatened they would not sign a new safety agreement with the school have now ""reluctantly"" signed under pressure, each organization said. Signing the new agreement means they will abide by new rules the university instated following a tense discussion over sexual assault and binge drinking at fraternities, sparked by a now-discredited article in Rolling Stone magazine depicting a gang rape at one fraternity house. In the article, a then-first-year named Jackie described a rape by seven members of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at UVA in September 2012. But Charlottesville police have since said that there is no indication that Jackie was raped at the fraternity house. Two days after the article came out in November, but before it was widely criticized for factual errors, UVA suspended all fraternities and sororities, allowing them to reopen social activities in January only under the new terms. Those new safety measures include having security at parties, sober brothers, keys to each room, monitors at the stairs and eliminating pre-mixed drinks. But Alpha Tau Omega and Kappa Alpha Order released statements on their national fraternity letterhead stating they would not sign the new agreement. Late Friday, up against the deadline, they relented. ""It is extraordinarily disappointing to see a university of this caliber sacrifice the ideals of freedom of association and due process on the altar of public opinion,"" the chapters said in a joint statement. ""The University has made it clear in writing today that our organizations will remain suspended if we do not sign the new FOA immediately and have rejected our requests for an extension to continue discussing our concerns."" All of the university's 31 Greek organizations have now signed the agreement. Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity slammed in the article, was the first to sign, the university said. Alpha Tau Omega and Kappa Alpha Order said that they will keep fighting the new rules. ""The fact that our chapters are signing the [agreement] does not alleviate the coercion, duress or other wrongdoing of the University through this entire process. Given the University's poor handling of this matter, we are now exploring the right to pursue any legal remedies."" While police have seemingly cleared Phi Kappa Psi, they have not ended their investigation. They have also not said if they believe Jackie may have been raped elsewhere. Rolling Stone apologized for the inaccuracies in the article, which was written by freelance journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely, and launched an investigation of its own. The magazine editor acknowledged that the writer didn't contact some of the witnesses, and none of the accused.","Alpha Tau Omega and Kappa Alpha Order had refused to sign University of Virginia agreement .

"(CNN)No charges have been filed against a man who shot the police chief of a small town in Oklahoma four times, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation says. Sentinel Police Chief Louis Ross was shot Thursday morning after he entered a house looking for the person who allegedly phoned in a bomb threat to a Head Start center, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. Ross was shot by the man living in the house, KFOR said. The chief had just donned a protective vest, which is credited with saving his life, the OSBI said in a press release. His condition was not available Saturday night. ""The man who shot and wounded the Sentinel police chief will not be arrested at this time,"" the release said. ""OSBI investigators have extensively interviewed the man. Facts surrounding the case lead agents to believe the man was unaware it was officers who made entry."" ""We almost lost a good man,"" Sentinel Mayor Sam Dlugonski told KFOR. Sentinel, population 900, is about 100 miles from Oklahoma City. The OSBI said somebody called 911 about 4 a.m. Thursday to report a bomb had been placed in the Head Start center. While a bomb squad searched the building and didn't find any explosives, the chief and deputies went to the home where they thought the bomb threat originated, the OSBI said. ""They made entry, cleared the first bedroom, started to clear the second bedroom, he opened fire on police and shot our chief three times in the chest and once in the arm,"" Dlugonski told KFOR. The resident, who was not hurt, surrendered to police after the shooting. In a press release issued Friday, the OSBI said it had determined the bomb threat call did not originate from the man's house. Dlugonski said the caller used the resident's name, KFOR reported. KFOR reported that officers entered the house without a search warrant. One Sentinel resident said he understood why the shooting happened. ""This is country, this ain't Oklahoma City,"" Jimmy Rhoades told KFOR. ""You're taught from a young age that if somebody comes into your house to shoot."" Ross was wearing a protective vest loaned to him by a Washita County deputy, the OSBI said. ""The vest saved Ross's life,"" the OSBI said.

"A body found along a river in suburban Seattle is that of ""August: Osage County"" actress Misty Upham, a Washington coroner said late Friday. The cause of her death is still under investigation, the King County Medical Examiner's Office said. According to the medical examiner's office, the 32-year old actress died October 5. A member of Upham's family found her body during a search for the actress, according to police in Auburn, Washington. It lay at the bottom of a steep embankment near the White River. Even before her body was identified, a purse containing Upham's ID had been found with the remains, police said. Upham, 32, was last seen October 5 walking from her sister's apartment in Muckleshoot, Washington, according to a statement sent to media outlets by her father, Charles Upham. She was reported missing the following day. Actress' disappearance baffles family . Her father said she had bipolar disorder and bouts of depression and anxiety, but he didn't think she was suicidal. ""The truth is Misty is not stressed over money or career. Her career is going great,"" he wrote Sunday. ""As her father I do not fear she committed suicide. I feel that she has been hurt by accident or someone has put her in harm's way.""

"(CNN)We're used to seeing police dashboard videos of speeders, car accidents or worse. But the Dover Police Department in Delaware is turning the camera on its force to show that police are human, too -- and sometimes they just want to shake, shake, shake, shake, shake. A dashcam video of Dover Police Master Cpl. Jeff Davis cruising in his police vehicle and grooving to Taylor Swift's ""Shake It Off"" was an instant hit on Friday. The video was shared nearly 2,000 times in less than 24 hours from the department's Facebook page and drew positive feedback from around the world. The goal of the video is to show a different side of police to counter negative perceptions of law enforcement, Dover Police Cpl. Mark Hoffman said. ""We're trying to humanize police officers. People tend to look at us as robots with uniforms and gun belts so we wanted to a show a lighter side of our force,"" he said. ""I think it's important for people to see police in that light."" The video was shot as part of the Dover Police Department's social media community outreach. To celebrate reaching 10,000 Facebook followers, the department launched a series called ""Dash Cam Confessionals,"" debuting with Davis's rendition of ""Shake It Off."" Hoffman suggested ""Shake It Off"" and Davis was more than happy to oblige. He already knew the words, thanks to his 10-year-old daughter, a Taylor Swift fan. ""When you drive around in a car all the time listening to Taylor Swift you get to know all the words and like her songs,"" the 19-year veteran of the force told CNN. In the video, Davis appears to pause periodically for passing vehicles. In reality, the video was shot in two takes in a secluded parking lot in Dover. ""It was fun thing, a nice thing to do with everything that's going on with police. With all the negative publicity it's nice to show a positive side of police,"" he said. Judging by the response so far, he thinks it's working. ""I think people are liking the fact of seeing police in a different view.""","Dover Police Department says goal of video is to show human side of police .

"Just about any woman who watched Huma Abedin publicly declare her decision to stick with her husband, embattled New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, had to feel sympathy for her. How could you not? No wife, already facing her husband's sexually explicit digital relationship with another woman (yet again!), wants to face the prying eyes of the public, too. But while women pretty unanimously feel for her, they have dramatically different reactions about whether she's doing the right thing, judging from the responses of several women I interviewed from across the country Wednesday. ""I think she's a good wife ... and she's a loyal wife,"" said Lydia Montgomery, a married mom with two grown sons in Chanute, Kansas. ""I think it's great that she's backing him."" ""These days it has become too easy to just walk away when someone shows their character flaws or doesn't live up to their end of the marriage contract,"" said Dee, a married mom with one son who only wanted to use her first name. ""I think she's decided that keeping her family intact and holding up her (end) of the marriage is worth the pain she's facing right now."" Opinion: The public humiliation of Huma Abedin . On the other side are women who think Abedin is making a terrible mistake, women like Andrea Kristina, a divorced mother with a teenage son who says she put up with ""bad behavior"" from her ex-husband for years. ""Standing by your man when he repeatedly humiliates you by getting himself into trouble doesn't make you a strong woman,"" she said. ""Leaving him and respecting yourself will."" Pam Selker Rak, a married public relations professional in Pittsburgh, said while she believes the decision to stay or leave is a personal one that only Abedin can make, she doesn't think the former aide to Hillary Clinton should have backed Weiner publicly. ""I'm not convinced she is projecting the best message by standing behind someone who hasn't earned her confidence and loyalty,"" Rak said. In the middle of the ""Is Abedin doing the right or wrong thing?"" debate are women who say we simply don't know what is going on in their relationship, so who are we to judge? ""We have no idea what transpired,"" said Rebecca, a single woman without children who asked to be identified by her first name. ""I know Huma is a smart woman and hasn't made this decision lightly, especially with a child in the mix."" All the criticism, especially from women who argue she is not standing up for herself and not asserting her power, really struck a chord with some women. ""I've seen people online call her a chump and call her desperate and (ask) what's her problem,"" said Jessica Dukes, a freelance writer in New York and mom of two young children. ""I don't see the course that she's taking as weak and capitulating. I see it as taking the harder path that requires even more strength."" Why we act on stupid impulses . ""I understand from a political perspective that you should be looking at (Weiner's) qualifications for a job, but I don't feel that anybody should be judging a woman based on how she handles infidelity in her marriage,"" said Meg Watt, a married mom with two teenage daughters in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Imani Gandy, a senior legal analyst with RH Reality Check, a reproductive and sexual health website, and editor of This Week in Blackness, thinks the focus -- for women -- should not be on Abedin, but on Weiner. ""I would like to see feminist women focusing on the fact that his behavior is inappropriate and not on the fact that she's being strong enough or being feminist enough by deciding to take her marriage vow seriously."" As women debated, online and off, about whether Abedin is making the right move, the conversation moved to ""What would you do if you were in her shoes?"" ""I always think that if that were me, I could never stand by him, but when it came down to it, who knows?"" said Jennifer Merritt, a married digital editor in New York. Women who know what Abedin is going through said no one can know how they would react. A woman who wanted to remain anonymous said she learned her boyfriend was sending naked pictures of himself to random women who were soliciting sex. She broke up with him, and after he sought professional therapy, gave him another chance, but ultimately the ""trust was gone"" and the relationship ended. Opinion: Why does Abedin put up with Weiner? ""I will say that people are very quick to judge those women who choose to stay in relationships with men suffering from this disgusting habit, which clearly is the result of a deeper issue,"" she said. ""I hope for Huma's sake that Anthony has stopped his habit, but I do not think he deserves to be mayor."" Another woman, who also did not want to be identified, told CNN her sexting and infidelity nearly broke up her marriage: ""I hurt my husband very badly. I can never undo it but I can stand by his side now and not screw it up again."" Abedin's background as a top adviser to former Secretary of State Clinton also became a point of discussion among women. Abedin certainly watched Clinton, her mentor, deal with sexual allegations against her husband, former President Clinton. ""I imagine she certainly has a lot of experience in navigating these sorts of situations regarding infidelity,"" said Gandy. Montgomery said Abedin's critics might speculate that she has political motives, but she disagrees. ""She's got a family now and her career is on the back burner somewhat, and it's all about her love and supporting her husband, and building and keeping that family,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Many wept. Some prayed. But after their smoke-filled plane rattled to an emergency landing, passengers had a new lease on life, as they exited a JetBlue flight Thursday via inflatable chutes. ""I'm just happy to be alive,"" said passenger Jarrod West, who slid down holding his black Chihuahua. ""I don't think I'll be mean to anybody ever again."" Four people were injured in the incident; one was taken to hospital, CNN affiliate KCAL reported. A loud pop initiated the brush with disaster, said West and other passengers who spoke with KCAL from the airport in Long Beach, California. Flight 1416 had left Long Beach Airport about 15 minutes before and was over the ocean, carrying 147 passengers and crew headed for Austin, Texas. Then the right engine ""blew,"" JetBlue told KCAL. A signal alerted pilots that an engine was overheating, fire department spokesman Jake Heflin told KCAL. The pilots deployed extinguishers. Thick smoke filled cabin . Actor Jackson Rathbone was on the flight with his wife and child. ""Our right engine exploded and our cabin filled with smoke,"" he posted to Twitter. It grew so thick that passengers could no longer see the people seated next to them, said passenger Jonathon Hubbard. West realized he would have a hard time breathing soon, but oxygen masks did not drop down, he said. So, flight attendants went around deploying them by hand. Fortunately, not far from its departure airport, the plane made a sharp turn back toward it, Rathbone said. The actor is known for his role as Jasper Hale in the ""Twilight"" movie series and stars in the TV series ""Aim High."" Tears as plane rattles . As it cruised back over land, the plane began to quake, and passengers broke into tears, afraid for their lives. ""Everyone was crying,"" passenger Dean Delbaugh said. ""I thought this was it."" His wife, seated next to him, clung to him. Rathbone was also flying with his family. ""I recited the Lord's Prayer as I held my son and my wife in my arms,"" he posted to social media site whosay. Then flight attendants prepared the passengers in the event of a hard landing. ""The flight attendants were yelling 'brace, brace' and they kept repeating it and repeating it on the top of their lungs,"" West said. Happy to be alive . But the pilot brought the scare to an end by setting the plane, which FlightAware.com identified as an Airbus A320, gently onto the runway. ""He put it on the numbers. He did good,"" West said. ""He came by afterwards and said 'hello' to everybody. All of us were hugging him and saying 'thank you.'"" Passenger Jonathan Hubbard was sitting in the exit row and wasted no time. ""I took the exit door and just threw it out the plane and just jumped out,"" he told KCAL. An inflatable chute was waiting to catch him. JetBlue spokeswoman Jessica Felipe said everyone evacuated the plane by using emergency slides. ""I grabbed my son and jumped down the inflated ramp, my wife following,"" Rathbone tweeted. ""We left all our personal effects onboard. Who cares. We were alive."" Passengers were led to a room, where they were debriefed, Rathbone said. KCAL reported that those wishing to continue to Austin were put onto a later flight. There was no statement on the Flight 1416 incident on JetBlue's website. But on the day of the incident, the airline announced CEO Dave Barger would step down, effective in February. The statement did not connect the decision with the mishap. In August, a JetBlue engine caught fire in San Juan, Puerto Rico, sending passengers and crew down the emergency slides. Rathbone and his family went home to celebrate their living through Thursday's scare with a wine and champagne tasting, he said on whosay -- they opened a half-dozen bottles.

"Ian McLagan, a fun-loving keyboardist who played on records by such artists as the Rolling Stones, Lucinda Williams, Bruce Springsteen and his own bands -- the Small Faces and its successor, the Faces -- died Wednesday, according to a statement from his record label, Yep Roc Records. He was 69. The cause of death was complications from a stroke, according to Yep Roc. Kenney Jones, the Faces' drummer who later joined the Who, expressed his sadness in the statement. ""I am completely devastated by this shocking news and I know this goes for Ronnie (Wood) and Rod (Stewart) also."" The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer's resume was varied and eclectic, his soulful and often joyous organ fills heard on such albums as the Stones' ""Some Girls,"" Lucinda Williams' ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"" and John Mayer's ""Battle Studies."" A rousing live performer, he played with Bob Dylan and Springsteen and was scheduled to tour with Nick Lowe this winter. His death comes on the heels of that of another Stones sideman, saxophone player Bobby Keys, who died Tuesday. McLagan established his abilities while touring with the Small Faces and the Faces. The latter band was particularly known for its good-time habits, like demolishing hotel rooms in classic rock 'n' roll fashion. ""You couldn't go from one town to another and not walk into the identical room in every town,"" he explained to CNN in a 2004 interview. ""So we hurt them."" The Small Faces were heroes of Britain's youth and had a great deal of success there, though just one of their songs, 1967's ""Itchycoo Park,"" cracked the Top 10 in the United States. When lead singer Steve Marriott left the band in 1969, the height-challenged group reformed around the much taller Rod Stewart and Ron Wood and dropped the ""Small"" from its name. The Faces' hits included ""Stay with Me"" and ""Cindy Incidentally."" McLagan, known as ""Mac,"" was born in Hounslow, Middlesex, England, in 1945. He joined the Small Faces in 1965 and the band had a four-year run of hits, including ""Sha La La La Lee,"" ""All or Nothing"" and ""Afterglow of Your Love,"" the latter from their UK No. 1 album, ""Ogden's Nut Gone Flake."" The post-Marriott Faces were known for such albums as ""A Nod Is as Good as a Wink to a Blind Horse"" and ""Ooh La La,"" but it was their marathon live performances that really made their reputation -- sometimes unfairly. ""We had the reputation of big drinkers, but we paced ourselves,"" McLagan told CNN. ""We all knew our limits. ... I'm now fighting this reputation of being sloppy, but listen (to the music)."" The band tried to juggle group dynamics with Stewart's soaring solo career, but the writing was on the wall when the singer left in 1975. Wood joined the Stones and McLagan became an in-demand session musician. McLagan recorded a handful of albums on his own, including ""Troublemaker"" (1979), ""Bump in the Night"" (1980) and ""United States"" (2014), and in recent years led the Bump Band from his adopted hometown of Austin, Texas. When he wasn't in Austin he was on the road, a place where he was always happy. Describing the travels of the Small Faces in the '60s -- when touring was pretty much a do-it-yourself affair -- he couldn't help but wax fondly. ""A favorite memory keeps coming back: it's just us in the car, going to gigs,"" he told the Los Angeles Beat in 2012. ""We used to smoke, listen to music, laugh and giggle, and had the best time! We'd get to the gig and we'd play music, then we'd leave the gig and we'd listen to music. Then we'd go back to the hotel and we'd play music, then we'd listen to music. It's all we did, and it was fabulous! You can't have a better life."" People we've lost in 2014 .","Ian McLagan was a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame keyboardist .

"(CNN)The International Criminal Court opened an inquiry into attacks in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigation against Israelis. In a statement Friday, the court's top prosecutor said the decision follows the Palestinians' signing of the Rome Statute. In doing so, they officially become ICC members on April 1, giving the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. ""There are no timelines provided in the Rome Statute for a decision on a preliminary examination,"" the ICC said in a statement. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the inquiry as an ""outrage,"" saying the court is overstepping its boundaries. ""The Palestinian Authority is not a country and therefore it is not the court's place, also according to its own rules, to carry out an examination like this,"" Netanyahu told the Jerusalem Post. The United States also said it ""strongly"" disagreed with the court's decision. ""As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,""  the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. ""We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,"" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as ""Palestine."" ""The Office considers that, since Palestine was granted observer State status in the UN by the UNGA (General Assembly), it must be considered a ""State"" for the purposes of accession to the Rome Statute,"" it said in a statement. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office will ""conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality."" The latest war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza left more than 2,000 people dead last summer. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subjected to counter-charges as well.","An inquiry allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to file charges .

"(CNN)Charles Frederick Warner, who was convicted for the rape and murder of an 11-month-old girl, was executed Thursday, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. His was the first execution in Oklahoma since a controversial lethal injection, which was widely seen as botched, in April. Warner was convicted in 2003 for the first-degree rape and murder of his then-girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter in the summer of 1997. He was executed at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, about 130 miles east of Oklahoma City. Warner was pronounced dead at 7:28 p.m. CT (8:28 p.m. ET). ""Justice was served tonight as the state executed Charles Warner for the heinous crime of raping and murdering an infant,"" said Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin. A reporter from the Associated Press, Sean Murphy, was among the witnesses. He recounted Warner's last words. ""They poked me five times. It hurt. It feels like acid,"" Warner said, according to Murphy. ""I'm sorry for all the pain that was caused. I'm not a monster. I didn't do everything they said I did. I love people. I love my family. I love Jesus,"" Warner said. He thanked his mother and sister for their support, and said to ""tell my baby girl she means the world to me."" According to Murphy, the execution began at 7:10 p.m. CT (8:10 p.m. ET). Once it started, Warner said: ""My body is on fire."" ""No one should go through this. I'm not afraid to die. We's all going to die,"" he said. Other than his statements, Warner did not appear to be suffering and did not show any obvious signs of distress, Murphy told other reporters. Before the execution, a spokesman with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections had said that Warner was scheduled to be executed using a three-drug combination of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine that is still not FDA approved, is supposed to render the prisoner unconscious. Vecuronium bromide is a paralytic, which is meant to paralyze all muscle movement and stop respiration. Potassium chloride's role is to activate nerves and induce cardiac arrest. Warner's attorney, Dale Baich, had filed a motion with the U.S. Supreme Court asking for a stay and asked the court to review Oklahoma's lethal injection policies in general. The court denied the requests. ""Of particular concern is the use of midazolam, which has been involved in several extremely problematic executions, including the gruesome and horrific execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma and the two-hour prolonged death of Joseph Wood in Arizona in July 2014,"" Baich said. Warner was originally scheduled for execution on the same night as Lockett -- April 29, 2014 -- but the execution was called off after the state took 43 minutes to execute Lockett, a controversial event that was witnessed by media and state officials. Witnesses said Lockett was convulsing and writhing on the gurney, as well as struggling to speak, before officials blocked their view. The execution was halted, but Lockett eventually died.

"The noodles were not just tasty. They were addictive. A Chinese noodle vendor in northern Shaanxi province has been detained for 10 days after admitting he added powdered poppy plant — from which opium is made --- to his dishes to keep customers coming back, Chinese media has reported. The owner said that he bought 4 catty (2kg) of the substance for 600 yuan ($98) in August. He said he added it to his food to make it taste better and to improve his business, the Huashangbao paper reported. The opium-laced noodles came to light after police stopped a vehicle driven by a 26-year-old man and tested him for drugs not long after he had consumed a bowl of the noodles. The man was detained for 15 days on charges of drug abuse and was not released until family members told police how they had also eaten at the same restaurant and tested positive for the drug. The paper said the risk of becoming a drug addict from the laced noodles, even if eaten continuously for a long period of time, was unlikely. It added that lacing food with opium poppy was not uncommon in China, with similar cases in 2010 and 2012.

"Washington (CNN)Hundreds of people gathered Saturday to show their support for law enforcement following nationwide protests of controversial police incidents in Ferguson, Missouri; New York City and other areas. The group endured cold temperatures at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in downtown Washington, D.C. and marched more than a half dozen blocks toward a ""Sea of Blue"" rally at the U.S. Capitol. Organizers put together the event to try to counter some of the anti-law enforcement sentiment expressed in the nationwide protests. Terrance Gainer, former sergeant at arms for the U.S. Senate, told the crowd that ""of 40 million encounters police will have with the public, 98.5 percent"" of them are ""good and great,"" and said cops should empathize with minority groups, who sometimes complain about their treatment at the hands of police. ""We all have something in common,"" Gainer said. ""We can't forget who we are, and lose that in the job we have to do, which sometimes is very, very troubling,"" Gainer said. Many speakers remembered loved ones killed in the line of duty. Event co-organizer Kelly Wince, whose husband is a police officer, told CNN that all professions include some bad actors, but most police are ""good officers"" who put themselves in danger protecting the public. ""My husband leaves every night and I never say goodbye, I say 'stay safe' and 'I love you,' because I don't know if he's coming home tomorrow."" Wince said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities said Friday that they will begin digging for evidence of graves at a California ranch that once was home to the infamous ""family"" of convicted killer Charles Manson. Authorities said they will start digging at Barker Ranch, Charles Manson's hideout. Soil testing to determine the possible presence of buried bodies was inconclusive, authorities said Friday, so ""exploratory excavation"" will be done this month, Inyo County Sheriff Bill Lutze said. The dig will be carried out ""to either confirm or put to rest speculation that bodies may remain there from the Charles Manson era,"" Lutze said in a written statement. In March, search crews found indications that human remains may lie within a few yards of Barker Ranch, the onetime hideout of the Manson family. The sites were identified by trained dogs, and testing equipment from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory also indicated the possible presence of remains, said Sgt. Paul Dostie of the Mammoth Lakes, California, police department. The excavation will take place at sites where cadaver dogs gave mixed indications and soil testing was inconclusive, Lutze said. ""There was no consistent response from the dogs that searched, and no conclusive findings from the soil samplings tested by top experts in the field,"" he said. ""Therefore, I believe the only way to determine once and for all whether there are bodies buried at Barker Ranch from the time of the Manson family is to proceed with limited excavation in a very few areas."" He said four methods of testing were used at five sites on the ranch. No site was identified by all four methods as possibly having remains, but positive findings by one method were corroborated by another at some of the sites, the sheriff's department said. The excavations will begin May 20 and continue through about May 23, although additional days will be added if needed, he said. Barker Ranch is National Park Service property and will be closed to the public during the excavation, the sheriff's department said. Media access will be limited, but daily briefings will be provided. After Dostie's dog and another dog, from NecroSearch, a nonprofit organization that specializes in finding clandestine graves, indicated the possible presence of human remains, testing equipment from Tennessee's Oak Ridge laboratory indicated two likely grave sites and a third possible grave site, Dostie said. Manson and four others were convicted of murder and other charges in connection with a two-night spree in August 1969 that included the slaying of actress Sharon Tate. The slayings -- and Manson and his family members -- transfixed the nation. Manson is serving a life sentence at California's Corcoran State Prison. CNN sent letters to him and to co-defendant ""Tex"" Watson, asking whether there were victims buried behind Barker Ranch. Manson did not reply, but Watson did, writing in a letter: ""I was the first family member to go to the desert after the murders and also the first to leave. I say this only to let you know that no one was killed while I was in the desert. But I don't know what took place after I left. I don't think there were any more killed, I hope not! I have absolutely nothing to hide."" CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","NEW: Digging to begin this month at old Manson family ranch .

"(CNN)A veteran journalist and former CNN great has passed away. Stuart Loory, 82, died Friday in his home in Brooklyn, New York, after battling cancer. In addition to working as a correspondent, Loory oversaw CNN bureaus in Washington and Moscow. He later became a vice president of Turner Broadcasting System. But it hardly sums up his life, which was about following his passion for a good story to various points on the map. ""Stu was an excellent journalist and a great friend,"" CNN founder Ted Turner said Saturday. ""He was instrumental in helping to launch the first Goodwill Games in Moscow, a loyal executive and leader at 'CNN World Report' and, of course, was well-known as one of the finest bureau chiefs at CNN, running the first Washington, D.C.  bureau and later opening the Moscow bureau. He will be sorely missed."" ""He was the consummate journalist,"" said his son, Josh Loory, who also became a news producer. Stuart Loory got his start in the mid-1950s as a newspaper reporter at the Newark Evening News, which is no longer in print. In 1958, he moved to Vienna, Austria, on a Pulitzer travel fellowship, and took the family with him, his son said. Josh was 3 months old then. In the course of his father's career, he would attend eight different schools in 12 years as they hopped between Moscow, Washington, New York, Chicago and Atlanta. ""The people that he knew and the circles that he traveled in were absolutely amazing,"" his son said. Josh Loory remembers sailing with former Secretary of State and diplomacy icon Henry Kissinger. Before coming to CNN, Loory ran various operations for major daily newspapers. He reported on the White House for the Los Angeles Times. ""He covered the end of the (Lyndon) Johnson administration and the (Richard) Nixon administration,"" his son said. ""Loory was included on (Richard) Nixon's 'enemies list' of political opponents,"" according to his biography on the website of the University of Missouri, where he taught from 1997 on after leaving CNN. He had a passion for science, which he wrote about at The New York Times. ""He covered every manned space flight from Mercury through Gemini,"" his son said. Later, Loory covered NASA space shuttle flights for CNN. Before making the switch to TV journalism for CNN in 1980, he was managing editor of the Chicago Sun-Times. CNN sent him back to Moscow. Former CNN News Group Chairman Tom Johnson said, ""He never backed away from asking heads of state the most difficult questions. I saw that firsthand in White House press conferences with President Johnson, and in the Kremlin with both Presidents Gorbachev and Yeltsin. ""Stuart was instrumental in obtaining exclusive CNN coverage with Russian television as President Gorbachev resigned from office. He also was instrumental in arranging exclusive CNN-Russian television‎'s first interview with Boris Yeltsin after Yeltsin took office."" In the bitter cold of Moscow, Loory once reported wearing a huge hat and received a message telling him he'd look better if he left it off. Loory answered with a funny TV report advocating for his giant, bushy Russian fur hat. Loory faced danger on the job, as when he covered the civil rights movement in Alabama in the 1960s. ""In Montgomery, he witnessed the beating the Freedom Riders got,"" said another son, Adam Loory. ""He said someone helped him get away from the melee by saying, 'Take off your tie and glasses and follow me.' When he realized he was leaving the scene, he said, 'Take me back, I have to follow the story.' Back at the bus station, he found John Lewis on the ground bleeding and helped get him to a hospital."" Josh Loory said his father was a family man -- and an all-round journalist. He wanted to look out for the downtrodden, Josh Loory said.  ""He liked to shine the light of the media where it needed to be shined."" He is survived by his wife and three children.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Shiite rebels took responsibility Saturday for the abduction of the Yemeni President's chief of staff in downtown Sanaa. Ahmed bin Mubarak, top aide to President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, was abducted by gunmen Saturday morning, security officials said. Houthi rebels ""were forced to seize Mubarak and this was an important step to cut the way of any coup attempt on the peace and transition deal,"" said a statement by the rebels' political faction, Ansarullah. Hadi appointed bin Mubarak premier back in October, but the rebels rejected the nomination. A senior media adviser to the Houthi movement in Yemen, Osama Sari, told CNN that the presidential chief of staff had been detained by the Houthis as a message to the President. Sari added this was because the President wanted to introduce a new constitution without the approval of the Houthis. A Yemeni official close to the presidential administration also told CNN that the presidential chief of staff had been detained by armed men linked to the Houthi tribe. The official said they believed the detention was linked to disagreement over the constitution. ""This is force for political gain, a ridiculous show of muscle flexing,"" the official said. The abduction comes amid rising tensions in the Arabian Peninsula country following the rise of Shiite Houthi rebels. Houthis swept into the capital last year, sparking battles that left more than 300 dead in a month. In September, Houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government. Since then, its members have installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions. Adding to Yemen's turmoil is al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terror group that has been exploiting and stoking the instability. On Saturday, the Houthi media outlet, Al Maseerah, repeated the group's claim of responsibility. The rebels further elaborated on their motives for the abduction in their statement. ""Surely there are series of steps the resistance forces will conduct to stop those powers from negligence and to stop their criminal activities against the people, today and in the future,"" the rebels' statement said, posted on Facebook. ""President Hadi must understand the sensitivity of the current situation and not be an umbrella for corrupt and criminal powers,"" the statement added. The UK ambassador to Yemen and the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa called for bin Mubarak's immediate release. ""Very concerned about the kidnapping of Dr Ahmed Bin Mubarak. Few have done more to support the 2011 Revolution and ideals,"" Jane Marriott, the British ambassador to Yemen, said on Twitter. The ""Revolution"" refers to months of demonstrations and crackdowns that led to civilian deaths in 2011. Toward the end of that year, then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh resigned, and powers were transferred to then-Vice President Hadi. Hadi was elected President in February 2012.. He was the only candidate on the ballot. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed from Yemen. CNN's Jason Hanna also contributed to this report from Atlanta.

"After a daylong manhunt, authorities have taken into custody an enlisted man they say stabbed a fellow service member on a Virginia naval base, a U.S. Navy captain said Friday. Capt. Michael ""Jake"" Johannson, commanding officer for Naval Support Activity Hampton Roads, announced that the suspect --  Petty Officer 3rd Class Wilbur Harwell -- was apprehended ""without incident"" in Virginia Beach. The Navy captain did not detail how Harwell traveled the 20 miles east from where the stabbing occurred at the Portsmouth annex to Virginia Beach, though he noted he believes the suspect was alone at the time. ""It's a good news story how it ended,"" Johannson said. But he  acknowledged that things had been much worse earlier in the day, starting with a stabbing around 8:30 a.m. in front of the private military store, or exchange, at the base. This followed an alleged altercation between the 26-year-old Harwell and another enlisted officer, whom Johannson identified as Petty Officer 2nd Class Justin Powell. Powell was ""stabbed several times,"" according to the Navy captain. Navy officials -- with the assistance of federal, state and local authorities -- sprung into action after learning of the violent incident, both to look for Harwell and to ensure that the surrounding area was secure. That included a major hospital there, the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, which authorities at one point indicated they would evacuate patients. ""We locked down the base as soon as we knew there was a stabbing incident,"" Johannson said. The commanding officer urged the public to send their thoughts and prayers for Powell, a Sarver, Pennsylvania, native who joined the Navy in 2007. Johannson said early Friday evening that Powell was in critical condition at a nearby hospital after undergoing surgery. About 4,300 military and civilian personnel work at the medical center, which is across the Elizabeth River from Norfolk. It is the oldest continuously operated hospital in the Navy, according to its website. It serves about 420,000 military members, families and retirees in the Hampton Roads region, home to one of the largest concentrations of military power in the world.

"Tourists staying at a Los Angeles hotel bathed, brushed teeth and drank water from a tank in which a young woman's body was likely decomposing for more than two weeks, police said. Elisa Lam's corpse was found in the Cecil Hotel's rooftop water tank by a maintenance worker who was trying to figure out why the water pressure was low Tuesday. Lam's parents reported her missing in early February. The last sighting of her was in the hotel on January 31, Los Angeles Police said. Detectives are now investigating the 21-year-old Canadian's suspicious death, police Sgt. Rudy Lopez said. It was not clear whether the water presented any health risks to those who consumed it. Results on tests on the water done Wednesday by the Los Angeles Public Health Department were expected later in the day. The hotel management has not responded to CNN requests for comment. Video appears to show four cisterns on the hotel roof. People who stayed at the Cecil since Lam's disappearance expressed shock about developments. ""The water did have a funny taste,"" Sabrina Baugh told CNN on Wednesday. She and her husband used the water for eight days. ""We never thought anything of it,"" the British woman said. ""We thought it was just the way it was here."" What she described was not normal. ""The shower was awful,"" she said. ""When you turned the tap on, the water was coming black first for two seconds and then it was going back to normal."" The hotel remained open after the discovery, but guests checking in Tuesday were told not to drink it, according to Qui Nguyen, who decided to find a new hotel Wednesday.

"(CNN)Juniper and Violet are best friends who are both battling the same rare form of cancer. They also shared a dream to visit ""the happiest place on Earth"" -- Disneyland. Violet's wish came true in December 2013, thanks to Make-A-Wish Foundation. When the nonprofit group granted 3-year-old Juniper's wish in October, they offered Violet the chance to share the news to her beloved friend. Violet, now 4, jumped at the idea, appearing in a heartwarming video posted on YouTube. The video has been viewed more than 100,000 times since being posted on Thursday, and it's drawing unusually positive comments for the video platform, which is notorious for its anonymous, at-times snarky commenters. Dressed in the same glittering Cinderella costume she wore on her own Make-A-Wish trip, Violet twirls around her bedroom, bubbling with excitement. ""You're going to Disneyland!"" she squeals. Danielle Ouellette, Juniper's mother, says her daughter cheered when she saw the video. ""She was super excited to see Violet and she knows what Disneyland is, so she got really excited,"" she said. The girls met in November 2013 and became treatment buddies at Seattle Children's Hospital while battling retinoblastoma, a cancer that forms in the eye's retina. Violet lives in Gig Harbor, Washington, and Juniper lives in Everett. The girls formed an instant bond when they first met, Violet's mother, Shenay Spataro, said. Hospital staffers became accustomed to seeing the girls playing together, Spataro said. ""They just hugged each other for so long. Danielle [Juniper's mother] and I were both in tears,"" she said. The girls bonded over their love of Disney characters. Violet always wanted to meet Mickey Mouse and Juniper is a huge Minnie Mouse fan. When Make-A-Wish decided to grant Juniper's wish to go to Disneyland, asking Violet to break the news seemed the obvious choice. The foundation grants 14,000 wishes each year, with Disney engaging in one of every two wishes the nonprofit grants. ""The two tiny voices of a 3-year-old and a 4-year-old paint the perfect, simple picture of what we do at Make-A-Wish every day: give hope and strength to kids battling life-threatening medical conditions, helping them feel better and sometimes, even get better,"" Josh deBerg, a spokesperson for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, told CNN. Ouellette says Juniper's trip to Disneyland helped her heal after the emotional and physical toll of her cancer treatment. ""During her cancer treatment, Juniper shut down,"" she said. The cancer treatment destroyed her right eye, and she grew embarrassed after being fitted with a prosthetic. But Juniper regained her confidence during her trip. ""She was so excited at Disneyland to share who she was with everyone. We couldn't ask for better closure."" Violet and Juniper are both in remission. They continue to have magical play dates together.","Violet and Juniper have been battling cancer together since November 2013 .

"(CNN) -- One of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century has been put to rest: DNA analysis of bone fragments has proven that two of Czar Nicholas' children believed to have escaped were killed with their royal family during the Russian Revolution. Czar Nicholas II, from left, daughters Olga, Maria, wife Alexandra, kids Anastasia, Alexei and Tatiana in 1917. The chemically damaged and burnt remains were found in the Romanov family's makeshift grave outside the city of Yekaterinburg, Russia, in 2007. In 2008, scientists used bone and tooth fragments to identify the remains as those of the two missing children of Czar Nicholas II: 13-year-old Crown Prince Alexei, the emperor's only son and heir to the throne, and his sister Grand Duchess Maria, about 19. Researchers wanted to confirm their findings by comparing DNA from the remains with that of living Romanov relatives. The results of the DNA analysis were published online Tuesday in the journal PloS One. The Romanov family, the last Russian monarchy, was executed in 1918 by Bolsheviks in the basement of a home in Yekaterinburg, about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) east of Moscow. Several of their staff members and servants also were killed. Nicholas' reign had ended when he abdicated the throne in 1917 at the time of the Russian Revolution. The remains of the family were discovered in 1991, during the last days of the Soviet Union. In 1998, those remains -- of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and three daughters -- were interred in a cathedral in St. Petersburg that contains the crypts of other Russian royalty. At the time, many thought that Alexei and Maria might have escaped -- leading to hopes among royal supporters that one or both Romanovs were still alive. But clues left by one of the family's assassins led investigators to the grave where the remains of Alexei and Maria were unearthed in 2007. The drama surrounding the Romanovs has been the subject of many books, movies and documentaries. Several women have claimed that they were Anastasia, Nicholas' youngest daughter, contending that they escaped the executions. The body of one impostor, Anna Anderson, was cremated when she died in 1984. DNA tests showed she was not related to the Romanov family.","Researchers compared DNA of remains with that of living Romanov relatives .

"The first speech Eric Holder gave after he announced his upcoming resignation was fittingly at an event hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus, where the nation's first African-American attorney general said he's most proud of his efforts to protect voting rights laws. ""This work has been a top priority since I took office,"" he said. After the Supreme Court rolled back key provisions of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby v. Holder last year, a decision Holder called ""deeply flawed,"" the Justice Department aggressively challenged new laws that popped up in states around the country -- including North Carolina, Wisconsin, Ohio and Texas -- where lawmakers imposed more requirements, including a voter ID, to be allowed to vote. At the event on Friday, Holder reminded the predominantly black audience of the progress that has been made since the passage of the Civil Rights Act 50 years ago, but he insisted that more has to be done. ""I want you to know that my commitment to this work will never waver, and in the meantime there remains, I think, a great deal that needs to be done,"" he said. Holder's role in civil rights issues has been central to his tenure. Changes in criminal justice system . He has also undertaken to improve the strained relationship between police and communities of color and worked to reduce sentences for some drug offenders, alter police officers' protocol for searches and arrests, restore felons' voting rights and improve the treatment of felons after their release. Friday, he announced a new initiative focused on reducing the number of teens who enter into the juvenile justice system. ""We are striving to eliminate mistrust and to build strong relationships between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve so that we can defuse tensions that simmer just under the service in too many cities and towns across our country and that too often give rise to tragic events like those that captured our national attention, just last month in Ferguson, Missouri,"" he said. Holder instructed the Justice Department to launch a federal review of the actions by local police in the shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson. African-American leaders praised the outgoing attorney general. ""Attorney General Eric Holder has been the best qualified attorney general in the United States. His leadership, courage and his unrivaled commitment to justice for all people, especially communities of color, will certainly be missed. The progress the Department of Justice made under his leadership, most especially on civil rights, is unlike anything we have seen in generations,"" the NAACP's Hilary Shelton said. 'Good riddance' While the first African-American attorney general serving under the first African-American President has been praised as a bold enforcer of equality by some, he has been described by others as a tactical partisan who disregards the Constitution. The  many challenges of replacing Eric Holder . Congressional Republicans have accused Holder of using the Justice Department to defy the 2013 Supreme Court ruling that struck down a component of the Voting Rights Act, and they investigated him over Operation Fast and Furious, a botched gun-smuggling program. Weapons from that operation were later used in a gun battle that left U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry dead. In June 2012, the House voted to hold Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over documents linked to that operation. Commitment to racial justice . Some will also remember Holder for speaking about race when President Barack Obama didn't. When the community of Ferguson was desperate for answers and change, Holder gave a personal account of being stopped by a cop as a result of racial profiling. ""He was the driving force and the primary face of the administration on racial issues,"" said Tanya Clay House, with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights. These issues run deep for Holder. His sister-in-law was one of two black students who integrated the University of Alabama. He was also part of an activist group in college that forced Columbia University to change the name of a student area to Malcolm X Lounge, according to Errol Louis, the host of ""Inside City Hall"" in New York, in a CNN opinion piece. Holder was also instrumental in the national shift to accept -- or not discriminate against -- same-sex marriage. He decided he would not defend the federal ban on same-sex marriage, prompting a domino effect of courts striking down state bans. During his resignation announcement with the President Thursday, Holder vowed to continue the work he started. ""I will continue to serve and try to find ways to make our nation even more true to its founding ideals,"" he said. Holder said he will remain in office until his successor is approved.

"You may have heard it before: Billions of years ago, Mars probably looked more like Earth does now, with clouds and oceans and a much thicker atmosphere. It may even have had some type of microbes. But now it's a barren, frozen desert. So what happened? Where did the air and water go? That's what the spacecraft NASA launched Monday is being dispatched to find out. It's called MAVEN -- short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution -- and it's the first mission dedicated to studying the red planet's upper atmosphere. ""We expect to learn how the modern Mars works, really in detail. To see its climate state, to understand how the atmosphere is lost to space -- how Mars may have lost a magnetic field -- to take that information and map it back in time,"" said NASA's James Garvin. MAVEN lifted off shortly before 1:30 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, starting a 10-month trip. By late afternoon, it was more than 14,000 miles from Earth en route to a September 22, 2014 rendezvous with Mars. The solar-powered probe is about the length of school bus -- 37.5 feet (11.43 meters) -- and will weigh about 5,410 pounds (2,454 kilograms) at launch. What killed Mars? New spacecraft will find out . ""MAVEN will fill in a very big gap in our understanding of the planet by exploring the upper atmosphere and its influence on the Martian environment,"" principal investigator Bruce Jakosky, from the University of Colorado, says on his NASA webpage. He says he's ""excited that we're providing one step along the path of answering questions about whether life ever existed on Mars."" Jakosky's team will use the spacecraft's three instrument suites in hopes of determining three things about Mars: . • The composition of its upper atmosphere . • How fast it's losing what's left of its atmosphere . • The history of the atmosphere . MAVEN won't make a cool, daring landing like the Mars Curiosity Rover, which has been roaming Mars for more than a year now. Instead, it will orbit between a low of about 93 miles (150 kilometers) above the surface to a high of about 3,728 miles (6,000 kilometers). It also will make five dives, flying as low as 77 miles (125 kilometers) in altitude. NASA says the mission will cost $671 million.

"A 36-year-old Dane called Morten Storm says he was the man who led the CIA to Anwar al Awlaki, the al Qaeda cleric killed in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen last year. And he says he did it with a computer thumb-drive that secretly contained a tracking device. Among the evidence he's produced: recorded telephone conversations, passport stamps showing multiple trips to Yemen, correspondence with Awlaki, and a recording of a conversation with an unidentified American - who acknowledges his role in the pursuit of Awlaki. Read more: Anwar al-Awlaki: al Qaeda's rock star no more . The Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten has published details of his story over the past few days, after reviewing documents and tapes of the conversations Storm provided. The Danish Intelligence Service PET won't confirm or deny Storm's account; CNN has yet to reach American officials for comment. Storm appears to have led a life of many parts -- committed jihadist, family man and outdoor sports enthusiast. In fact, he helped run a UK-based enterprise called Storm Outdoors -- on which his instructor's profile speaks of his time ""living with the Beduins in the Deserts in the North of Yemen."" Read more: U.S. drone killing of American al-Awlaki prompts legal, moral debate . There is firm evidence that Storm, a former biker and petty criminal, moved within jihadist circles after converting to Islam in the late 1990s -- becoming known as Murad Storm. One video clearly shows him at a rally of militant Islamists in London in 2005, listening to a speech by the extremist preacher Omar Bakri Mohammed. According to Jyllands-Posten, Storm was by then on the radar of the PET because of his links with Islamist militants. The following year, he says, he changed sides, becoming a double-agent run by the PET. Meeting Awlaki . According to Storm's account, he first met Anwar al Awlaki at his father's house in 2006, while studying in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. Storm was attending Al Iman University -- which was renowned for militancy and where Awlaki himself taught. ""We talked freely to each other,"" Storm told Jyllands-Posten.

That was before Awlaki was arrested and spent some 17 months in a Yemeni jail, accused in connection with an al Qaeda plot. It was while Awlaki was in jail that Storm says he underwent a transformation. At some point in the winter of 2006, Storm approached the PET and offered his services. He says he was introduced to British intelligence and the CIA, and was a given a handler by PET. Jyllands-Posten says it has confirmed the identity of that handler.

They knew that I could reach him, and find out where he stayed."" When Awlaki was released from prison Storm was able ""to bring materials and electronic equipment to him,"" using money provided by Danish intelligence. Al Qaeda's shopping list . Storm says the CIA wanted to plant a tracking device in the equipment he was taking to Yemen, but it was becoming more difficult to reach Awlaki, who by 2009 was in hiding in remote Shabwa province. Storm's last meeting with the militant cleric - by now perhaps al Qaeda's most influential propagandist - was in September 2009, he told Jyllans-Posten. Storm stayed at the house of an al Qaeda sympathizer. At a desert hide-out, Awlaki asked Storm to acquire solar panels or a transportable fridge which could be used for cooling explosives components. ""We also discussed the terrorist attacks. He had some plans that would hit large shopping centers in the West or elsewhere with many people with poison attacks,"" according to Storm's account. Storm's passport includes an exit stamp from Yemen dated September 19, 2009. A few weeks after he returned to Copenhagen, Storm says he met CIA and PET officials. Read more: Al Qaeda cell leader killed in family dispute . He was shown satellite photographs of the area where he had met Awlaki and identified the house where he had stayed. A short time later, Yemeni forces launched an assault on the house, killing its owner. But Awlaki had gone. Jyllands-Posten is in possession of an e-mail purportedly from Awlaki to Storm, dated January 17, 2010. ""Do you remember the guy you lived with? It is now confirmed that he has been killed,"" the cleric wrote. The newspaper says it also has taped telephone conversations between Storm and PET agents. The USB gambit . According to Storm, it was more than a year before another attempt was made to track down Awlaki. Storm recounts a two-day meeting in April 2011 with PET agents at a hotel in Helsingor, overlooking the Baltic Sea. It was decided it would be too dangerous for Storm to return to try to meet Awlaki, but he would travel to the Yemeni capital and then send a USB stick to Awlaki via a messenger.

In June 2011, he made a five-day visit to Sanaa, followed by a longer one in July. Storm says he was given three rendezvous on different days - one of them at a KFC in Sanaa. Read more: 21,000 people now on U.S. no fly list, official says . It was a typical precaution on the part of Awlaki and al Qaeda. At the third location, the messenger passed him a list from Awlaki of what he needed. The USB stick, with encrypted messages, became their means of communication. At one point, Awlaki asked what was being reported in the West about alleged plans by AQAP to use the poison ricin. At about the same time, the New York Times reported: ""American counterterrorism officials are increasingly concerned that the most dangerous regional arm of Al Qaeda is trying to produce the lethal poison ricin, to be packed around small explosives for attacks against the United States."" One typed message from Awlaki included a personal request, perhaps illustrating the close relationship the two had forged. ""My wife needs some stuff from Sanaa so can your wife buy it for her?"" he asked. Read more: State Department calls family of American killed in drone strike . Storm says he was recalled to Europe in August 2011, and met with both CIA agents and PET officials in Malaga, Spain. He claims he was told by ""the American"" that there was plenty of reward money should Awlaki be killed. In September 2011, Storm says he received a message from an intermediary, who took the USB stick back to Yemen. ""I heard later....that the messenger had come to the shopping center, had the USB connector and was driven away in a Toyota Land Cruiser,"" Storm told Jyllens-Posten. Three weeks later, Anwar al Awlaki was dead. U.S. officials maintained that a separate intelligence stream had led them to Awlaki's location. Storm didn't believe them. Falling out with the Americans . ""I am convinced that the CIA seized the messenger..... but the Americans apparently won't recognize that it was an agent of PET and the small country, Denmark, which led to the detection of Anwar,"" Storm told Jyllands-Posten. According to the newspaper's account, a meeting was set up at the Hotel Marienlyst in Helsingor a week after Awlaki's death in an attempt to mollify Storm. The newspaper has obtained a nine-minute recording of that meeting - made by Storm on his cell-phone. Storm is heard talking to a man with an American accent by the name of Michael, who acknowledges Storm's work for the PET and CIA. Read more: Official: Drone attack kills Al-Awlaki's son in Yemen . ""He was my mentor. He was my sheikh, he was my teacher, he was a friend of mine. But (because) of the evil in him, I took the step,"" Storm told the American. 'Michael' says at one point: ""I want you to understand - this is a team - it was all a team effort - a team from my organization - from me, who are here with you guys, from Jed (apparently Morten Storm's previous U.S. contact)......"" He adds that Storm's contribution was known to senior U.S. officials - adding: ""I'm talking about the President of the United States. He knows you, he knows you.

"There are things that I admire about Rupert Murdoch. He has maintained a lifelong commitment to newspapers, long after it became clear that they were no longer profitable. He has a feistiness at 81, when he could be happily sitting on a yacht somewhere. He now spews his opinions on that newfangled social network called Twitter, and since he's the undisputed kingpin of News Corp., who's going to stop him? But over the weekend, Murdoch sent out a tweet that went beyond outrageous to offensive, truly offensive. He played off the worst kind of historical libel against Jews. And while he later tweeted a semi-apology, it's not clear he understands the magnitude of his hurtful words. Watch: Murdoch's 'Jewish Press' Rant--More CEOs Spewing on Twitter . The subject was the violence flaring in the Middle East, with Israel mounting airstrikes in Gaza after a long series of rocket attacks by the Hamas government. The message: . ""Why is Jewish owned press so consistently anti-Israel in every crisis?"" That's right, he said Jewish-owned press, reviving the old canard about Jews controlling the media. Who, exactly, is he talking about? Watch: Petraeus overkill or permissable pandering? Well, there's the Jewish heritage of the Sulzberger family, which owns The New York Times and Murdoch sees as a rival. Beyond that, most major media outlets are owned by public companies: Comcast (NBC), Viacom (CBS), Disney (ABC), Time Warner (CNN), Tribune (Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times), Gannett (USA Today). The Graham family, which owns The Washington Post, isn't Jewish. And isn't there something rich in a complaint about media ownership by the man who controls Fox News, the Fox broadcast network, 20th Century Fox, the New York Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London, the Sunday Times, Sky News, HarperCollins and other properties? Beyond that, it's hard to take ethical lectures from a man who presided over a phone-hacking scandal in London that -- whatever his knowledge of it -- prompted him to close the longstanding News of the World tabloid and has led to the arrests of several of his former lieutenants. Watch: Orgy of advice on getting away with Petraeus-like affair . What's more, Murdoch has never been shy about interfering in his newsrooms -- cozying up to politicians ranging from Ed Koch to Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair -- so maybe he expects others to shape news coverage in the same way. Murdoch's Fox News portrayed Mitt Romney as a more viable candidate than he turned out to be. But the heart of Murdoch's indictment is far more troubling. He is suggesting that Jewish Americans have a hidden agenda in which their religion trumps their commitment to journalism. Since Murdoch finds these outlets allegedly dominated by Jews to be anti-Israel, perhaps he thinks they are of the self-loathing variety. In a tweet on Sunday, Murdoch seemed to defend his use of the phrase: "" 'Jewish owned press' have been sternly criticized, suggesting link to Jewish reporters. Don't see this, but apologise unreservedly."" The wording is too cryptic to know for what exactly he's apologizing. Watch: Why Romney's 'gifts' comments diminish him . Earlier, Murdoch had tweeted that Israel's position was ""precarious,"" adding ""watch CNN and AP bias to the point of embarrassment."" Media mogul or not, he's entitled to criticize other coverage as he sees fit. But it's hard to evaluate his complaints since his 140 characters contain not a single example of questionable reporting. The Middle East is a minefield for even the most scrupulous journalists. A photo of a wounded Palestinian often brings complaints that Israel is being treated unfairly and its casualties not highlighted. A story on Israelis wounded by Hamas rockets often causes grumbling that the Palestinian plight is being unfairly minimized. Murdoch is obviously strongly pro-Israel, which may mean he bristles at any coverage that doesn't sympathize with Benjamin Netanyahu's government. One thing, however, is clear: Murdoch has undermined his own credibility by lashing out at what he calls Jewish-owned organizations. He should follow the advice that editors routinely give employees: Think hard before you tweet, for words, like weapons, can wound.","Howard Kurtz: Rupert Murdoch tweeted asking why Jewish owned press is anti-Israel .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Nobel laureate biologist James Watson was suspended Friday from his longtime post at a research laboratory and canceled his planned British book tour after controversial comments that black people are not as intelligent as white people. James Watson won the 1962 Nobel prize for discovering the structure of DNA. Watson has apologized for the controversial remarks. He failed to appear to a book signing at a London bookshop Friday afternoon, and organizers of his planned Sunday evening talk at Newcastle's Center for Life said they had been informed Watson would not appear because he was already on a flight home to the States. The board of trustees at New York's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which Watson has led for nearly four decades, said they had suspended his administrative responsibilities pending a review of his comments. Watson, 79, an American who won the 1962 Nobel prize for his role in discovering the double-helix structure of DNA, apologized Thursday for his remarks -- but not before London's Science Museum canceled his talk there, planned for Friday evening. The museum said Watson's words had ""gone beyond the point of acceptable debate."" The controvery began with an October 14 interview Watson gave to the Sunday Times, which quoted him saying he was ""inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa"" because ""all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours, whereas all the testing says not really."" Watson also asserted there was no reason to believe different races separated by geography should have evolved identically, and he said that while he hoped everyone was equal, ""people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true."" The biologist apologized ""unreservedly"" Thursday for his comments and said he was ""mortified"" by the words attributed to him. ""I cannot understand how I could have said what I am quoted as having said,"" Watson said during an appearance at the Royal Society in London. ""I can certainly understand why people, reading those words, have reacted in the ways that they have."" ""To all those who have drawn the inference from my words that Africa, as a continent, is somehow genetically inferior, I can only apologize unreservedly. That is not what I meant. More importantly from my point of view, there is no scientific basis for such a belief."" Watson was expected to sign copies of his new book, Avoid Boring People: Lessons from a Life in Science, at Blackwell bookshop in central London Friday afternoon but failed to appear. Soon afterward, a spokeswoman for the Center for Life in Newcastle, where Watson was expected to speak Sunday night, said they had been told Watson was canceling all speaking engagements and was already flying home. Center spokeswoman Julia Hankin said they were disappointed. ""We welcomed the opportunity to discuss his controversial comments,"" Hankin said. ""We had hoped for a rigorous and lively debate."" Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, the institute on New York's Long Island which Watson has headed since 1968, confirmed it had suspended his responsibilities as chancellor ""pending further deliberation by the board."" It said the board publicly disagreed with the comments attributed to Watson in the Sunday Times. Late Thursday, The 1990 Trust, a British civil rights group, called for a boycott of Watson's books and pressure to be put on venues to cancel his planned appearances. Watson's remarks to the Sunday Times were but the latest controversial comments from the eminent biologist. In 1997, Britain's Sunday Telegraph quoted Watson as saying that if a gene for homosexuality were isolated, women who find that their unborn child has the gene should be allowed to have an abortion. During a lecture tour in 2000, he suggested there might be links between skin color and sexual prowess and between a person's weight and their level of ambition. And in a British TV documentary that aired in 2003, Watson suggested that stupidity was a genetic disease that should be treated. E-mail to a friend .

"DNA tests have confirmed that human remains found buried beneath an English car park are those of the country's King Richard III. British scientists announced Monday they are convinced ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that a skeleton found during an archaeological dig in Leicester, central England, last August is that of the former king, who was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Mitochondrial DNA extracted from the bones was matched to Michael Ibsen, a Canadian cabinetmaker and direct descendant of Richard III's sister, Anne of York, and a second distant relative, who wishes to remain anonymous. Experts say other evidence -- including battle wounds and signs of scoliosis, or curvature of the spine -- found during the search and the more than four months of tests since strongly support the DNA findings -- and suggest that history's view of the king as a hunchbacked villain may have to be rewritten. Ibsen said he reacted with ""stunned silence"" when told the closely-guarded results. ""I never thought I'd be a match, and certainly not that it would be so close, but the results look like a carbon copy,"" he told reporters. The skeleton was discovered buried among the remains of what was once the city's Greyfriars friary. After centuries of demolition and rebuilding work, the grave's exact location had been lost to history, and there were even reports that the defeated monarch's body had been dug up and thrown into a nearby river. Read more: Richard III: The king and the car park? The remains will be reburied in Leicester Cathedral, close to the site of his original grave, once the full analysis of the bones is completed. Richard III's body was found in a roughly-hewn grave, which experts say was too small for the body, forcing it to be squeezed in to an unusual position. Its feet had been lost at some point in the intervening five centuries, but the rest of the bones were in good condition, which archaeologists and historians say was incredibly lucky, given how close later building work came to them -- brick foundations ran alongside part of the trench, within inches of the body. What was initially thought to be a barbed arrowhead found among the dead king's vertebrae turned out instead to be a Roman nail, disturbed from an earlier level of excavation. Archaeologists say their examination of the skeleton shows Richard met a violent death: They found evidence of 10 wounds -- eight to the head and two to the body -- which they believe were inflicted at or around the time of death. Read more: Back from the grave, King Richard III gets rehab . ""The skull was in good condition, although fragile, and was able to give us detailed information,"" said bioarchaeologist Jo Appleby, who led the exhumation of the remains last year. The king had suffered two severe blows to the head, either of which would have been fatal, according to Appleby. The injuries suggest that he had lost his helmet in the course of his last bloody battle. Appleby said there were also signs that Richard's corpse was mistreated after his death, with evidence of several ""humiliation injuries,"" which fitted in with historical records of the body being displayed, naked, in Leicester before being laid to rest. Richard Buckley, the lead archaeologist on the project said the unusual position of the skeleton's arms and hands suggested he may have been buried with his hands tied. Investigators from the University of Leicester had been examining the remains for months. Others got their first glimpse of the battle-scarred skull that may have once worn the English crown early Monday when the university released a photograph ahead of its announcement. Read more: Will Richard III discovery rewrite history? Turi King, who carried out the DNA analysis, said it was a ""real relief"" when the results came through. ""I went really quiet. I was seeing all these matches coming back, thinking, 'That's a match, and that's a match, and that's a match.' At that point I did a little dance around the lab."" King pointed out that ""in a generation's time, the DNA match would not have been possible, since both individuals used in the tests are the last of their line,"" a fact echoed by Ibsen, who told CNN before the results came through that ""they caught us just in time."" The initial discovery of the remains provoked much debate in Britain as to what would happen with the body, if it were proven to be that of Richard III, with many calling for a state funeral at Westminster Abbey, and others backing a burial in York Minster, in keeping with the king's heritage as a member of the House of York. Opinion: Richard still the criminal king . But on Monday those involved in the search said he would be reinterred in Leicester Cathedral, the closest church to the original grave site in a memorial service expected to be held early next year. Canon Chancellor David Monteith said it was important to remember that as well as being the subject of important historical and scientific research, the skeleton also represented ""the mortal remains of a person, an annointed Christian king,"" and as such should be treated with dignity. Supporters of the infamous king, including members of the Richard III Society, hope the discovery will now force academics to re-examine history, which they say has been tainted by exaggerations and false claims about Richard III since the Tudor era. Screenwriter Philippa Langley, who championed the search for several years, told CNN she wanted ""the establishment to look again at his story,"" saying she wanted to uncover the truth about ""the real Richard, before the Tudor writers got to him."" ""This has been an extraordinary journey of discovery,"" Langley said. ""We came with a dream and today that dream has been realized. This is an historic moment that will rewrite the history books.""","DNA evidence says remains found under parking lot are those of Richard III .

"(CNN) -- Pfizer is recalling an additional 38,000 bottles of the cholesterol-fighting drug Lipitor after reports of an odor linked to the packaging bottles, the drug company said in a statement. The recall will affect Lipitor 40 mg tablets (atorvastatin calcium) distributed in the United States. The company said the bottles were supplied by a third-party manufacturer. ""We have thoroughly evaluated the root cause, which is episodic exposure of the bottles to low levels of TBA (tribromoanisole) as they are shipped or stored,"" Pfizer said. The company said the rate of odor complaints was fewer than three per million bottles. Earlier this year, Pfizer recalled of more than 190,000 bottles of Lipitor due to similar odor-related complaints. ""Research indicates that a major source of TBA appears to be 2, 4, 6-tribromoanisole(TBP), a chemical used as a wood preservative,"" the company said. ""Although TBP often is applied to pallets used to transport and store a variety of products, Pfizer prohibits the utilization of TBP-treated wood in the shipment of its medicines."" Pfizer said a medical assessment found the risk of health consequences to patients appears to be minimal. According to the Food and Drug Administration, reports of drug contamination have been linked to a ""moldy or musty"" odor in food and wine products. ""Currently available data indicate that serious adverse health effects have not resulted from ingestion of drugs or foods contaminated,"" the FDA said, with such compounds at the levels of contamination that have been reported. But the agency noted another problem that could stem from contaminated drugs. ""Even if the health effects are minimal, [the] FDA is concerned that patients sensing an unusual odor that is not intrinsic to the product will stop taking their medication,"" the administration said on its website. Pfizer said it does not expect a product shortage resulting from the new recall. Anyone with questions can call 1-888-LIPITOR.

"(CNN) -- A gunman killed eight people and wounded 14 in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, on Monday morning, officials said. The state news agency TASR, citing the interior minister and police corps president, said seven people were killed in the shooting; a spokeswoman for University Hospital of Bratislava said one of the wounded had died. After being cornered by the police, the gunman shot and killed himself, Slovak Interior Minister Daniel Lipsic and Police Corps President Jaroslav Spisiak told reporters near the crime scene. The shooting took place in the Bratislava neighborhood of Devinska Nova Ves, TASR reported. The gunman, who was using an illegally obtained assault rifle, was carrying two other guns and ammunition, Spisiak said. Lipsic said a police officer was wounded in the shooting and was in a stable condition. Of the wounded, who were taken to hospitals in Bratislava, ""one patient is in critical condition, three more are in serious condition,"" Health Minister Ivan Uhliarik told TASR prior to the reported death of one of the victims. Uhliarik said the remaining victims were ""stabilized."" TASR reported a three-year-old child was among those wounded. Spisiak told TASR the police received a call reporting shots heard in one of the flats in the apartment building. When police arrived at the scene, the gunman was leaving. Four women and a man were found dead inside an apartment and another man was shot dead in the building's hallway. All six victims apparently were from the same family. The gunman then started firing on the street and at the police, who cornered him, Spisiak told TASR. A woman who apparently stepped onto her balcony as the shooting rampage was in progress also was killed. Her body was found later in the day by her husband, Lipsic told TASR. The gunman was not immediately identified.","Three-year-old child was among the wounded, news agency says .

"If Republicans don't wield their congressional majority next year to pass immigration reform legislation, a GOP takeover of the White House in 2016 will be ""difficult, if not impossible,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said during a CNN interview released on Sunday. Graham, a Republican who has long-favored comprehensive immigration reform, said he believes the GOP has hurt itself with Hispanic voters due to its resistance to reforming the current system. And without a major change, Democrats will get another four years in the Oval Office, Graham told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" ""If we don't at least make a down payment on solving the problem and rationally dealing with the 11 million [illegal immigrants believed to be in the U.S.], if we become the party of self-deportation in 2015 and 2016, then the chance of winning the White House I think is almost non-existent,"" he said. But Graham, who is mulling a 2016 presidential run, slammed President Barack Obama's executive action last month to safeguard as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants. He accused the President of ""acting in a rogue fashion"" for ""political reasons."" Republicans, though, need to ""do more than just fight the executive order,"" he added. Graham supports giving a pathway to citizenship to the so-called DREAMers -- undocumented immigrants who crossed into the U.S. illegally as children and have lived in the U.S. since. And in 2014, Graham showed the political viability of his position by successfully beating back a tough primary challenge in his conservative state by reaffirming -- rather than running away from -- his stance on immigration. ""If the Republican Party cannot muster the political courage to deal with the DREAM Act children in a fair and balanced way after we secure our border, that says a a lot about the Republican Party's future regarding the Hispanic community,"" Graham said. ""I don't believe most Americans would fault the Republican Party if we allowed children who have been here since they're babies to assimilate into society with a pathway to citizenship after we secure our borders."" Graham was one of the most ardent supporters of a bipartisan immigration bill he helped negotiate in 2013 that passed the Senate but did not get a vote in the House. The bill would have bolstered border security and created a path to citizenship for millions -- many of whom are now getting temporary relief under Obama's executive action. And while Graham's name didn't make the cut in the latest CNN/ORC poll, another candidate who supports immigration reform is leading a crowded field of potential Republican presidential candidates. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush snagged 23% of Republican support in the survey released Sunday. While Graham said Bush would be ""an excellent candidate"" who could win the presidency in 2016, he insisted the race for the Republican nomination is still ""wide open."" RELATED: Jeb Bush says he has 'no problem' defending expanding immigration . ""It's like preseason polling in football. You really don't know, do the pads connect? But I think it's good news for Jeb Bush at least initially,"" Graham said. Graham hasn't yet decided on a 2016 run, which he will consider more seriously next year, but he did tout his ""unique"" qualifications to be President in a period of tumultuous global affairs. ""I think over the last several years I've been more right than wrong when it comes to foreign policy, that the next President of the United States has got a world on fire,"" Graham said. ""I think I have a unique capability to do things like that."" Graham suspects China involved in Sony attack .","Sen.

"Tehran's police chief was deeply offended. ""It's obscene,"" he declared, and promptly arrested six young men and women who made a joyful fan video, dancing and lip-synching to the sound of Pharrell Williams' huge hit, ""Happy."" Clap your hands if this sounds like one of the most ridiculous stories you ever heard. The six Iranians, wearing colorful clothes, stylish sun shades and bright bandanas, dared to dance to the beat of ""Happy."" The women did not cover their heads with the required hijab. At times, the men and women danced together, which is forbidden and punishable under the law. But elsewhere -- when the police aren't looking -- Iranian men and women dance together and see nothing wrong with it. But the police found it offensive. Iran state media called it ""vulgar."" The backlash against the arrests was forceful, and before long, the police released the dancers, although the director of the video apparently remains in custody. The group describes itself as ""Tehran Pharell Williams Fans,"" which may strike the oversensitive authorities in the Islamic Republic as a highly subversive political affiliation.  The nefarious motivation for making the video was revealed at the end of the clip, which reads, ""'Happy' was an excuse to be happy. We enjoyed every second of making it. Hope it puts a smile on your face."" As the opposition National Iranian American Council noted, ""The irony that the Iranian youth were arrested for dancing to a song called 'Happy' seems to be lost on the Iranian authorities. The Iranian people cannot be forced to live in a world where (nuclear) enrichment is a right, but happiness is not."" More than 100,000 people have viewed the Iranian version of ""Happy,"" which stirred up a bizarre political storm. Tehran Police Chief Hossein Sajedinia boasted of taking less than six hours to round up the evildoers and lock them up, but not before parading them before the television cameras, a stern warning to other young people who might be getting any crazy ideas in their heads; no telling what may lurk in the minds of youngsters listening to Williams' lyrics. Williams tweeted, ""It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness."" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani posted his own tweet, apparently quoting a statement he made more than a year ago, ""#Happiness is our people's right. We shouldn't be too hard on behaviors caused by joy. 29/6/2013."" Yes, it all seems incredible silly. Behind the absurdity, ongoing tensions are shaping life in Iran. There is a boiling over of frustration among a large part of the Iranian population fed up with the restrictions imposed by the regime. The ""Happy"" video showed defiance from two groups who are chafing under the limits imposed by the authorities: young people and women. From the moment the Islamic revolution took power in Iran, women, who had enjoyed Western-style freedoms, started to endure new rules restricting their lives. The mandate to cover with a hijab stands as the most visible, ever-present and personally offensive of those rules. Every year for the last 35, the arrival of summer brings a battle between women pushing against the rules in the Iranian heat and regime backers fighting against the loosening of restrictions. A few days ago, a Facebook page went up called StealthyFreedom. In it, Iranian women of all ages are posting pictures of themselves free from the restrictive clothing. The pictures show women dancing, smiling, with their arms extended, as if reaching for freedom, commenting on ""the feeling of wind blowing through every strand of hair."" One wrote, ""I am a 68-year-old woman...I want to be free and comfortable in my own skin."" Another vows ""We will get freedom of dressing, singing, dancing. ..."" On Friday, a counterdemonstration took to the streets of Tehran, demanding that authorities crack down on dress code violations and enforce the code on women. Protesters carried signs that showed a sexy red stiletto shoe with a red line across it. Clothing connotes free expression to some, a grave threat to others. The battle over social freedoms mirrors the contest in the government, where more conservative members are pushing back against Rouhani, who is considered a moderate by the Islamic Republic's unique standards, and is trying to improve Iran's international relations and image abroad. The arrest of the dancers came just after Rouhani gave a speech about Internet freedoms in which he declared ""We must recognize our citizens' right to connect to the World Wide Web."" The President, who is not the most powerful leader in the country, asked ""Why are we so shaky? Why have we cowered in a corner ... lest we take a bullet in this culture war?"" The speech was supposed to be broadcast on national television, but it was not. One of Rouhani's aides reportedly blamed a former member of the Revolutionary Guard for blocking the speech from television. The Revolutionary Guard and the President both answer to the unelected Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. There is no word so far on how Khamenei feels about Williams' hit song and the dancers. No word, so far, on whether the Supreme Leader is happy.","Six Iranians are arrested and later released for making a fun video .

"Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister whose government was overthrown by a military coup more than a decade ago, appears to be back on top in Pakistan, election officials have said, despite claims by other parties of vote rigging. According to unofficial results disclosed Sunday from the country's violence-marred elections over the weekend, Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N), looks to have won most of the seats in the National Assembly. One of the country's leading industrialists and richest men, Sharif has been prime minister twice before and was overthrown in a coup when Gen. Pervez Musharraf seized power in 1999. Sharif was subsequently jailed before going into exile in Saudi Arabia. He returned to Pakistan in 2007. Read more: Nawaz Sharif, a veteran of Pakistan's political tumult . Support for the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), which completed a five-year term in power in March, appeared to have fallen away at Saturday's elections after it struggled to tackle the country's myriad problems of extremist violence, chronic power shortages and an enfeebled economy. Imran Khan, the former cricket star whose party was participating in general elections for the first time, said voting was rigged. ""Unfortunately, it's because the provincial governments were in power right up till 20 days before the elections, so they had plenty of time to place their people,"" said Khan, suggesting that police and electoral officials were ""used."" He said his party was gathering evidence of the irregularities. Khan, who was injured in a dramatic fall at a campaign rally just days before voting began, was considered to be a wild card in the election. Analysts saw him and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) as popular with members of the urban middle class, who support his call to end drone strikes in the country's restive tribal regions and his pledge to sweep away rampant corruption by ending foreign aid. Read more: From Pakistan's tribal region to Parliament . His party appeared to have secured enough votes to be a notable presence in parliament. And Khan said that despite the alleged voting irregularities, democracy had advanced in the elections. ""I'm very optimistic that the foundation of what we call the new Pakistan has been laid,"" he said. ""Pakistan will never be the same again."" PPP officials also complained of vote rigging in some constituencies in Sindh province and its capital, Karachi, during the elections Saturday, calling on the country's Election Commission to hold a new vote in the affected areas. Other smaller parties threatened boycotts over the alleged irregularities. Protests, led by Khan's supporters, took place in Karachi over the reported problems. The provincial government responded Monday by imposing a ban on gatherings of four or more people for rallies and protests, CNN affiliate Geo TV reported. Opinion: Pakistan vote the first step on a long road . Sharif and the PML-N appeared to be the main beneficiaries of the elections. In his stronghold of Lahore, Sharif said he was confident his party would form the next government. He said that he hoped his party won enough seats to form a government on its own but that he is willing to work with others to solve the country's problems. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tweeted his congratulations to Sharif and the PML-N on their ""emphatic victory."" Sharif had suggested that if elected, he would seek to improve relations with New Delhi. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their partition in 1947. Frosty relations resulting from the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, for which India blamed a Pakistani-based group, have thawed in recent years. President Barack Obama expressed a willingness to work with the next government that is formed in Islamabad. ""The United States and Pakistan have a long history of working together on mutual interests,"" Obama said in a statement. ""And my administration looks forward to continuing our cooperation with the Pakistani government that emerges from this election as equal partners in supporting a more stable, secure, and prosperous future for the people of Pakistan."" During campaigning, Sharif seemed to take a vague stance on issues of interest to the United States, like the fight against terrorism. Read more: Key moments of Pakistan's turbulent past . But analysts said they saw that as a political move to secure support from his conservative Islamic base. They noted that Sharif had worked well with U.S. officials during his previous two terms as prime minister during the 1990s. Afghan President Hamid Karzai called Sharif on Sunday to congratulate him, the Afghan government said. Violent extremism remains a significant problem in Pakistan, as underlined by frequent deadly attacks by groups like the Pakistani Taliban on people campaigning for the elections. Attacks over the weekend targeted polling stations. Karachi, the country's biggest city, and Balochistan, a restive province that borders Iran and Afghanistan, appeared to suffer the worst of the violence Saturday and Sunday. But the attacks failed to deter Pakistanis keen to have their say. Voter turnout was nearly 60%, the election officials said Sunday. Many people were voting for the first time. The Election Commission secretary, Ishtiak Ahmed Khan, said the election was free and fair across much of the country, despite the problems in Karachi. His view received qualified support from election observers from the European Union who reported that at the polling stations they visited, ""polling was generally rated as satisfactory or good."" The E.U. observers said in a statement Monday that a higher rate of problems was seen in Sindh, the province where the PPP and PTI had complained of irregularities. In Karachi, the observers said they ""undertook limited observation, during which they saw some serious problems in polling and were also restricted in their activities."" They said they identified some problems in the counting of votes across the country, with 9 out of 59 stations rated as ""poor or inadequate."" The national election marks the first transition between civilian governments in the nation's 66-year history. In March, the democratically elected PPP government finished serving a full five-year term. Pakistan has experienced three military coups and been ruled by generals for about half its history.","Sindh province clamps down on rallies after protests over vote rigging .

"Inside one of the many busy open markets in Kampala, rows of hanged trousers and dresses swing in midair, casting a shadow over the colorful stacks of unsorted clothes sitting on rickety wooden stalls. Amidst the hustle and bustle, bargain-hunting shoppers rummage through the large piles of printed t-shirts, short-sleeved blouses and retro jackets in search of a great deal. This is the Ugandan capital's version of a thrift store, fully stocked with second-hand garments from the West. Here, European-made clothing, American sports jerseys and designer labels are all offered at discount prices, turning second-hand markets like this into a prime destination for cheap garments. ""Things from U.S. and UK, London, they are nice,"" says Karol, owner of a local second-hand market stall. ""My customers keep on coming."" Short-term gain, long-term pain? The sale of Western cast-offs starts with charities in European and North American countries that earn money by offloading donated clothes they cannot find buyers for. The unwanted used clothes often end up in landfills. Increasingly, however, they are also being purchased by wholesalers, who then sort, label and package them into containers for export to different markets. A large portion of these previously owned clothes ends up in market stalls across Africa -- according to an Oxfam report, used garments account for over 50% of the clothing sector by volume in many sub-Saharan African countries. For customers in Kampala's bustling markets, however, this is no dumping ground. Instead, these clothes are as desirable as they are affordable. ""Yes, the price is right and the clothes are still looking good,"" says Brenda, a local shopper. In the beginning, it appears to be a win-win situation for everyone involved; Western charities receive much-needed revenue, African buyers with weak purchasing power get low-priced, well-made clothing, and merchants find eager customers for their merchandise. But some experts say that the mass influx of cheap hand-me-downs from the West could have a much more negative impact. ""The long-term effect is that countries such as Malawi or Mozambique or Zambia can't really establish or protect their own clothing industries if they are importing second-hand goods,"" says Andrew Brooks, lecturer at King's College London and co-author of a study called ""Unravelling the Relationships between Used-Clothing Imports and the Decline of African Clothing Industries."" ""Your t-shirt may be quite cheap for someone to buy, but it would be better if that person could buy a locally manufactured t-shirt, so the money stays within the economy and that helps generate jobs,"" he adds. Watch video: Cashing in on second-hand clothes . Big business . Analysts say textile industries are relatively easy to develop and, as success stories like South Korea showcase, can provide the first step in the ladder towards economic growth. A booming clothing sector is labor intensive, generates national revenues through taxes and, ultimately, can help end dependency on aid. But in Africa, the introduction of trade-liberalization policies and the opening of economies in the 1980s and 1990 allowed both second-hand and cheap new imports, especially from Asian countries, to enter markets across the continent. This undermined growth opportunities for many local industries and led to the closure of several African clothing factories, say experts. According to a 2006 report, textile and clothing employment in Ghana declined by 80% from 1975 to 2000; in Zambia it fell from 25,000 workers in the 1980s to below 10,000 in 2002; and in Nigeria the number of workers fell from 200,000 to being insignificant. Meanwhile, second-hand became a highly lucrative industry across African markets. Whilst exact continent-wide figures are hard to come by, global used clothing exports from OECD countries stood at $1.9 billion in 2009, according to 2011 U.N. Comtrade data. Yet Brooks claims the figure is an underestimation, largely because of the widespread smuggling of used clothes that occurs in many countries, as well as trans-shipments that are not documented in official statistics. ""The best estimate that probably gives the value of the global trade of second-hand clothing would be about $3 billion,"" he says. ""Obviously, that's the import cost and once things are sold on retail, [it's] probably twice that,"" he adds. Read this: 'Africa's tallest building' set for $10 billion tech city . Hard to compete . For many people across Africa's fashion industries, this curtails local new-clothing production and prevents their sector from growing. Designer Sylvia Owori, who's been in business in Kampala for more than a decade, says it's very difficult to rival the second-hand market. ""Probably 90% of the clothing people are buying in the whole country are second-hand clothes,"" says Owori. ""It's a multimillion dollar industry -- so, as a small fish, how are you going to start to compete with that?"" To deal with the problem, a number of African countries have banned imports of second-hand clothes in recent years as part of efforts aimed at protecting their national textiles industries. Amongst them are the continent's two biggest economies -- South Africa and Nigeria -- while many more are also debating restrictions. But there's also another threat to the local industries: Chinese imports that are even cheaper than the Western hand-me-downs and locally made clothes. Read this: 'China can transform Africa' ""One of the problems is that these local clothing industries are often more expensive than clothing that's produced in Asia,"" says Brooks. ""So if you ban second-hand clothing sometimes this gets replaced with imports of clothing from China or elsewhere in the Far East."" Back in Owuri's shop, the designer says she is resigned to the reality of her competition. She adds, however, that she looks forward to the day that homegrown businesses like her own prevail. ""As much as I don't like second-hand clothes to be in the market, I don't have an alternative,"" she says. ""I cannot make enough clothes to support a population of 33 million. So we need to actually first grow the manufacturing and production side of the business locally for us to say, 'OK, all the other stuff can't come in.'"" Brooks says that whilst used t-shirts, jeans and dresses can satisfy a basic need for affordable clothing, they ultimately help keep people in poverty. ""Second-hand clothing maintains the status quo,"" he says. ""It doesn't help the poor get richer, it just keeps things as they are at the moment.""","Previously owned clothing is big business in Africa .

"(CNN) -- New Jersey authorities are investigating an announcement made over a public address system at a southern New Jersey Wal-Mart telling ""all blacks"" to leave the store. Shortly before 5 p.m. Sunday, an unidentified male accessed the public address system at the Turnersville, New Jersey, Wal-Mart Supercenter Store, Gloucester County prosecutors said. ""All blacks need to leave the store,"" the voice announced. Store management contacted the Washington Township Police Department, which opened an investigation in conjunction with the county prosecutor's office, Deputy Police Chief John Dalesandro said. ""The incident is being investigated by both law enforcement agencies as a suspected bias intimidation crime,"" local authorities said. Wal-Mart corporate spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said the company is ""just as appalled by this as anyone."" He emphasized that Wal-Mart, the world's largest public corporation, is working with law enforcement officials in investigating the incident. ""Whoever did this is wrong and acted in an inappropriate manner,"" Lopez said. ""Clearly this is unacceptable."" Both police and prosecutors are reviewing security camera video from the store. Any of the 25 in-store telephones could have accessed the public address system, although not all phones are within range of surveillance cameras, authorities said. Dalesandro said there is no word yet on whether tapes of the announcement will be released to the public to help identify a possible suspect by voice. ""We don't think it was an associate, but we are working with police to make that proper determination,"" said Wal-Mart's Lopez. Also, authorities confirm that some of store's telephones can be accessed by customers. Some of the store's telephones could be accessed by customers, authorities confirmed. Law enforcement officials said Wal-Mart is acting to limit the public address feature to a smaller number of in-store telephones. Lopez confirmed the New Jersey store is updating its intercom systems and said the company is looking at Sunday's episode to see if there are any lessons for the retailer's other 4,000-plus American stores. ""Some of our customers are upset at us, and I understand why they're upset,"" Lopez said. He said he agrees the burden lies on Wal-Mart to ""do due diligence,"" he said his company can be an easy target for negative publicity, cautioning that the responsibility for the announcement ""rests on the individual.""

"COVINGTON, Louisiana (CNN) -- The suspect in the shooting of a woman killed during a Ku Klux Klan initiation has at least a seven-year history of Klan activity, according to an organization that tracks hate groups nationwide. Relatives describe Cynthia Lynch as having a deep need to feel wanted and eager to join groups. Raymond ""Chuck"" Foster, 44, was the founding Imperial Wizard, or national leader, of the Southern White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a Klan faction formed January 1, 2001, in Watson, Louisiana, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""During the next three years, the group developed chapters in three other states while maintaining a low profile,"" the Montgomery, Alabama-based center said on its Web site. By 2004, the Southern White Knights had chapters in Savannah, Georgia; Homosassa Springs, Florida; and Marion, Ohio. Its founding chapter relocated to Denham Springs, Louisiana. The group disbanded in early 2005, the center said. Foster faces second-degree murder charges in the death of Cynthia Lynch, 43, of Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Watch how an initiation rite went wrong » . Authorities said Lynch was recruited over the Internet and took a bus to Slidell, Louisiana, where she was met by two Klan members. The three went to a campsite in the woods near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans, where they met other members of the group. Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Jack Strain gave CNN this account of what happened: . During the initiation rite, members of the Klan group, which calls itself the Sons of Dixie, shaved Lynch's head. After 24 hours of drills, including chanting and running with torches, she asked to be taken to town. An argument began, and the group's leader, Foster, allegedly pushed her to the ground and shot her to death without warning. Lynch wanted to leave the campsite because she was homesick, investigators concluded after talking to Lynch's family in Tulsa. After the shooting, ""Foster, we believe, removed a knife from his pocket and rolled over the victim and began a process of trying to remove the bullet from her body ... because he was trying to destroy evidence where law enforcement would not be able to piece these things together,"" Strain said. Other members of the Sons of Dixie helped cover up the slaying for Foster, their leader or ""Grand Lordship,"" Strain added. The attempt to conceal the killing included burning the woman's personal items, Strain said. The Southern Poverty Law Center said it is unaware of any Klan group operating under the name Dixie Brotherhood or Sons of Dixie, names that have surfaced in media reports of Lynch's death. However, the organization said it is aware that last year, a new Klan group calling itself the Dixie Rangers Knights of the Ku Klux Klan formed in Walker, Louisiana, about 80 miles from where the slaying took place. ""It's unclear at this point if the Dixie Rangers and the Dixie Brotherhood/Sons of Dixie are one and the same,"" the center said. The FBI said Thursday that it is assisting local authorities in the case. The FBI's top agent in New Orleans said the agency usually doesn't monitor specific groups but will look into whether federal laws were violated. ""The FBI is working closely with local law enforcement authorities investigating this recent incident,"" Special Agent in Charge David W. Welker said. He added that the FBI would ""aggressively investigate"" any leads. Sheriff's investigators said they received the initial tip from a convenience store clerk. Two of the group members went into the store and asked the clerk whether he knew how to get bloodstains out of their clothes, Strain said. The clerk told them no and called the sheriff after they left. Officials tracked down the two members and arrested them. Authorities established telephone contact with other members of the group who were still at the campsite and let them know law enforcement officials were on their way. They surrendered without incident. Foster was elsewhere in the woods, but he also surrendered, the sheriff said. The woman's body was found under loose brush along a road several miles from the campsite. At the campsite, investigators found Confederate flags, KKK banners, five Klan robes and an Imperial Wizard robe. Foster was taken to the St. Tammany Parish jail, and no bail has been set, authorities said. Seven other suspects were jailed, charged with obstruction of justice. Bail for each was set at $500,000. On Wednesday, sheriff's investigators searched a house Foster had rented for the past five years in Bogalusa. They found Klan paraphernalia, documents and computer files. Among the seized documents were membership applications, titles and a chain of command for group members . ""We recovered various documents out of that home that are giving us an indication of the organizational structure and the organizational guidelines of the group,"" Bonnett said. Fred Oswold, chief of criminal investigations for the sheriff's office, said that the Sons of Dixie group is small and that those arrested make up most of its membership. ""So far, we have learned that they were a small group, but they were fairly organized,"" said Oswold, who said his agency is working with the FBI to learn more about the group. CNN's Katie Ross contributed to this report.","NEW: Chuck Foster started Southern White Knights in 2001, group says .
