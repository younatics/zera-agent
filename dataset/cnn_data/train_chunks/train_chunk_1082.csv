"An artist from Texas has created clothes that play music when a converted Sony Walkman is rubbed across the surface of specially made 'sonic fabric.' Sound designer Alyce Santoro developed the denim-style sonic material by weaving cassette tape through polyester thread. She then converted an old Sony Walkman into a sonic fabric reader and when the reader is rubbed over the fabric it creates futuristic-sounds, which Santoro describes as 'like scratching five records backwards at once.' Scroll down for video . Texan artist Alyce Santoro has created clothes that play music when a converted Sony Walkman is rubbed across the surface. She calls the denim-style material 'sonic fabric' and its made from weaving cassette tape through polyester thread . Remove the faceplate. Find the playhead and remove excess plastic using small needlenosed pliers. Remove the head using a scredriver or tweezers. Get a small piece of wood - Alyce uses half of a wooden clothes peg. Glue the wood to the playhead but don't glue down the play button. Plug in headphones, press play and put the Walkman upside down on top of the fabric. Drag it over the material to create the sound. Santoro has now launched a range of neckties made from her sonic fabric that are hand-sewn in Manhattan by designer Julio Cesar. The sonic fabric works because the spools of cassette tape are magnetic. When the head of a tape player is rubbed over this magnetic material the sound is amplified. The fabric retains it's magnetic properties throughout the weaving process. Santoro originally designed the material to be a piece of art but has since used it in bags, dresses and now ties. Early versions of the fabric contained tapes from Miles Davis and The Beatles, as well as wildlife recordings. Santoro began by trying to knit with the fabric but said it was too loose and flimsy to work with. She then asked a weaver friend to try using the tape on a loom at the Rhode Island School of Design. The sonic fabric is 50 per cent polyester thread and 50 per cassette tape. The sonic fabric works because the spools of cassette tape are magnetic. When the head of a tape player is rubbed over this magnetic material a sound is amplified through headphones or a connected amp . Sonic fabric is woven on a 1940's dobby loom at a textile mill in New England. The Dobby loom has a special shuttle capable of handling the cassette tape . Santoro said: 'The product astounded both of us. 'We never expected such a beautiful, tightly-woven, functional material.' Sonic fabric for larger projects is woven on a 1940’s dobby loom at a small family run textile mill in New England. The loom has a special shuttle capable of handling the audiobook cassette tape. When the 1/8inch wide strands of cassette tape . get folded as they go into the loom they are squashed into the the fabric. About 20 . strands are squashed into an inch of polyester fabric. Santoro said that an average-width tape head is . capable of picking up maybe 5 or 6 strands of tape at a time. The large spools of tape used in the weaving process are taken from audiobook tapes from nearby companies. Santoro has now launched a range of neckties made from her sonic fabric that is hand-sewn in Manhattan by designer Julio Cesar. Larger projects are weaved on a loom at a textile mill in New England . Because the audiobook tapes are . recorded with a single note, the fabric makes a single clear tone that can . be adjusted according to the speed at which the player is rubbed along . the fabric. Santoro's idea for the fabric was inspired by the small strands of cassette tape that were tied to sailboats she used to race when she was younger. The strips of tape were used to see which direction the wind was travelling in and Santoro said the material was ideal as 'tell-tails' because 'it is light and very sensitive to the wind, it’s extremely durable, and it dries quickly.' She said she used to imagine that if . the wind hit the tell-tails just right, the sounds of whatever had been . recorded onto the tape could be heard wafting out into the air. Santoro was then inspired by the colourful flags hung by Tibetan Buddhists. Santoro designed the first sonic shaman-superhero dress for a show in 2003, pictured. It was made by weaving together 100 individual cassette tapes. Santoro has previously used tape spools by Miles Davies and The Beatles, as well as audiobook cassettes in the material . Tibetan prayer flags are made of colorful squares of cotton fabric imprinted with the images of mantras, or sacred sounds. They are hung outdoors where the breeze blowing through them can 'activate' the built-in sounds. She designed the first sonic shaman-superhero dress for a show in 2003 and was made by weaving together 100 individual cassette tapes. That same year Santoro made . percussionist Jon Fishman a 'musical suit' that he played live on stage . with his band Phish during a show in Las Vegas. The tape used in this project was made from Fishman's tape collection including Prince, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and more. Santoro's idea for the fabric was inspired by the small strands of cassette tape that were tied to sailboats she used to race when she was younger. Santoro used this inspiration for her sonic fabric sailboat sails art installation, pictured, at the Museum of Contemporary Art in San Diego . Santoro said: 'It would be thrilling to work with other sound artists and musicians around the world to literally weave together our sonic experiences during these times of powerful transformation in the realms of society, politics, and the environment. 'The resulting fabric could be shared and made into anything imaginable by anyone interested.' Santoro also makes sailboat sails as art installations from the material. She told CNN that she has collaborated with a designer friend on a line of small, wearable accessories. Julio Cesar hand sews neckties, small bags, and other custom pieces for anyone who would like to have a functional work of conceptual art that can be used as part of 'everyday life'.","An artist from Texas has developed the 'sonic' fabric from polyester thread and spools of old cassette tapes .

"A convicted conman who evaded authorities for more than a year lived like a monk and dressed like a hippie to look after his sick mum in northern New South Wales, his lawyer claims. Peter Foster - who helped purchase two apartments for the wife of former British prime minister Tony Blair in 2002 - was arrested on Tuesday near Byron Bay and will not be reunited with the 83-year-old matriarch for at least 18 months. The 52-year-old was caught after police received a tip-off from a media organisation, which had been secretly filming him for some time while he was living at a house at Ewingsdale. Scroll down for video . Peter Foster, 52, was arrested in Byron Bay on Tuesday afternoon (pictured here in 2007) Foster disappeared in September last year while awaiting a Federal Court decision about whether he flouted a 2005 ban from the weight-loss industry after he conned $6 million from 90 investors in the SensaSlim scam. He was found guilty and sentenced in his absence to a three-year jail term, with at least 18 months to be served behind bars. The convicted conman had previously fled police in Fiji and Vanuatu, but his latest time on the lam was spent living incognito on NSW's north coast. He gained weight, grew his hair long and dyed it blonde, sported a grey beard and blended in with the region's hippies. Footage shows the man with long grey hair, a ragged beard, and barefoot . Footage shows officers arresting the wanted man, who has let his hair and beard grow long and grey . He was arrested in bare feet under some shrubby trees on a bush property. Foster faced Tweed Heads Local Court on Wednesday, pleading guilty to assaulting police and resisting arrest. Defence lawyer Terry Fisher told the magistrate Foster had been 'living like a monk' for a year, and just wanted to see him mum. 'He's a bit shell-shocked at the moment, but his main concern is that he gets reunited with his mother because he's been looking after his mother for the last 11 months,' Mr Fisher told reporters outside the court. Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry . He looked dramatically different on Tuesday when he was captured by a number of officers on the NSW coast . Asked why Foster chose northern NSW as the location to care for his mother, he said it was because the area was one of the most beautiful parts of Australia. 'He's from the Gold Coast, so I suppose he wanted to reside there like just about everybody else in Australia,' he said. But police have offered their own version of Foster's most recent movements. They say he had been hiding out in northern NSW for at least the past month, but until a tip-off from what they called a 'community source' did not have a specific location for the fugitive. Footage from his arrest on Tuesday shows officers surrounding the wanted man before pinning him to the ground . In 2002 Cherie Blair, wife of of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the Australian conman . During his time in Britain, he befriended Carole Caplin, Cherie Blair’s fitness 'guru' which is how he came to get close to the Blair family . Police said they had no information to suggest Foster had been caring for his mother at the 'substantial' and 'wealthy looking' Ewingsdale property where officers say he was living with another man. Foster will now be taken to Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in Queensland to begin what will be at least another 18 months behind bars. His dishevelled appearance during his arrest was a stark contrast to the sharp figure he cut while promoting his worthless Bai Lin Tea slimming products in Britain more than 30 years ago. The 52-year-old self-confessed ‘international man of mischief’, became the central figure in the infamous 2002 Cheriegate scandal. In footage to be aired on Tuesday's A Current Affair, police wrestled Foster to the ground and one of the officers was heard warning his colleagues: 'He's got a gun.' In fact, Foster was unarmed. He was quickly subdued and dragged away to a police van – but the first stop was not a police cell. Foster was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US . Cherie Blar, pictured with Carole Caplin, who at the time was in a relationship with Peter Foster . Instead, the fugitive was taken to hospital after he suffered what a police spokesman described as 'a turn', the nature of which was not known, while being arrested. Foster failed to appear in court for the sentencing hearing late last year and was judged to be in contempt of court, after which he remained ‘on the run’ for a year, he is certain to be ordered to serve added jail time. The man who made millions of pounds by selling franchises for weight-loss products – which were found in scientific tests to be ineffective – first made headlines in Britain in the 1980s when he dated models and even took one on a six-month tour of Europe in a Rolls-Royce. Later he began an affair with fitness 'guru' Carole Caplin who was friends with former British prime minister Tony Blair's wife, Cherie. It was through Miss Caplin that he agreed to help the-then Labour Prime Minister’s wife to purchase two flats in Bristol for a discounted price. It resulted in Mrs Blair sending him an email saying he was ‘a star’. When she learned of his notoriety, she tearfully admitted her mistake in public. Foster has boasted to the Daily Mail that he has been in prison in Britain, the US and Australia but insisted he had never been convicted of fraud. Rather, he said, he had been found guilty of advertising misdemeanours.","Peter Foster was arrested in Byron Bay - on NSW's north coast - on Tuesday .

"Pakistan has appointed a female judge to its national sharia court, which hears cases under the country's Islamic legislation,  for the first time in its 33-year history. Ashraf Jehan, 56, who was serving as an additional judge at the high court in southern Sindh province, made history as she took the oath in Karachi on Monday. 'It was a historic oath-taking ceremony today when an able lady judge had joined the Shariat Court,' Agha Rafiq Ahmed, the chief justice of the Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan, told AFP. Milestone: Chief justice of Pakistan's national sharia court Agha Rafiq (right) Ahmed takes the oath of the court's first female judge Ashraf Jehan (left) The court was established in 1980 during the rule of military dictator Ziaul Haq as part of a sweeping Islamisation of Pakistan's institutions. It examines the country's laws to check them for conformity with Islamic injunctions and hears appeals under religious legislation known as the 'Hudood Laws', which run parallel to the penal code. 'There was no bar in the constitution to make a woman the judge of Shariat Court and there is no discrimination between men and women,' Ahmed said. The chief justice of the Shariat Court, who rarely speaks to the media, said he was pleased to comment on an historic moment. 'I took the initiative as it would send the message in the world that we are enlightened people and would dispel many misconceptions,' he said.","Ashraf Jehan, 56, made history as she took the oath in Karachi on Monday .

"A 17-year-old West Virginia girl was sentenced Wednesday for helping her friend stab and bury their high school classmate in the woods in 2012 as part of a teenage murder plot that captivated the nation with its ice cold senselessness. While Rachel Shoaf asked the court for its forgiveness just before she was handed 30 years in state prison, her chilling admission that they'd done it 'because they didn't want to be friends with Skylar anymore' still resonate, especially with Skylar Neese's father. 'She’s not sorry—she’s sorry she got caught,' said a shaken Dave Neese following the case's second, and last, sentencing. 'That’s the only thing she’s sorry for.' Rachel Shoaf pleaded guilty to murdering her friend Skylar Neese in July 2012 for no apparent reason other than she didn't want to be friends with her anymore. She was sentenced to 30 years in March (pictured) 'Absolutely not': The victim's father Dave Neese did not offer forgiveness and said 'she¿s sorry she got caught. That¿s the only thing she¿s sorry for' 'She¿s not going to get out when she goes up for (parole) anyway': Dave Neese said he was hoping for a 40 year sentence but wasn't concerned when the judge gave Shoaf (pictured) 30 years . Rachel Shoaf, along with her friend Sheila Eddy, lured 16-year-old Skylar Neese out of her house in July 2012, before stabbing her to death and hiding her body in a Pennsylvania wood. Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced in January to life as part of a plea agreement that makes her eligible for parole after 15 years. Shoaf pleaded guilty last May to second-degree murder in the July 2012 slaying. She'll be eligible for parole after 10 years. Dave Neese told wvmetronews.com that he and his family had been hoping for a 40-year sentence but said ten years wasn't going to make much of a difference. 'She’s not going to get out when she goes up for (parole) anyway,' he declared. At Neese's side was Monongalia County Prosecutor Marcia Ashdown, who believed justice has been done. 'I feel satisfied that we were able to accomplish a reasonable amount of justice for both of these girls. I feel satisfied that Dave and Mary (Neese) did not have to face the ordeal of a trial.' Before she was sentenced, Skylar's . father, Dave Neese, addressed the court, saying he was 'speaking on . behalf of my daughter because she can’t be here'. 'We . are no longer a family. You can see the faces of the killer, but you . can’t see Skylar’s face. You can’t imagine how Mary and I now feel,' Mr . Neese said, according to WV Metro News. 'The person sitting before you, Skylar's so called friend, took her away from us without any remorse or feelings,' Sheila Eddy, pictured in court in October, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her friend in March this year . Prosecutors said the pair plotted to kill their friend, Skylar, but a motive for the brutal murder has never been revealed. The nearest explanation came from Shoaf, who allegedly told police the girls no longer wanted to be friends with Skylar. Eddy refused to address the court other than to say guilty. Neese's father later said he found her silence 'unacceptable'. Her lawyer said it wasn't a signal of any lack of remorse. Michael Benninger said both Eddy and her family are 'eternally sorry'. according to the observer-reporter. What went wrong?: The three girls were said to be inseparable friends before Neese was stabbed to death because the two teens allegedly no longer liked her . Tribute: Sheila Eddy posted this tribute to Skylar Neese (on the left in each photo) on Twitter before being arrested for her murder . Prosecutors claimed Eddy and Shoaf . lured Skylar out of her ground-floor bedroom in Star City and drove her . to a secluded spot near the unincorporated West Virginia community of . Macdale. They said the girls then stabbed her to death at an agreed-upon moment. Authorities . said the girls covered the body of the University High honors student . with branches when they couldn't bury her, and left it in a wooded area . across the Pennsylvania border for months. The . break in the case came in January last year, prosecutors said, when . Shoaf finally cracked and told investigators what had happened and where . to find the body. Speaking . at Eddy's sentencing, Skylar's family revealed how their daughter's . friend had comforted them and joined in their grief to try and cover her . tracks. Skylar's aunt . Carol Michaud said: 'She came and acted as if she knew nothing. She . pretended and stayed with us and comforted us and swore she had no idea . what was going.To come to this day and admit she did just shows how evil . she can be.' Though Eddy's name was no secret in . the community, authorities didn't make it public until September, when . they transferred her case from juvenile to adult court. Skylar was initially considered a runaway and no Amber Alert was issued to publicly notify people of her disappearance. Last . year, the Legislature tweaked the state's Amber Alert process that had . limited it to cases where a child is believed to be abducted. The . revised law requires law enforcement to relay initial reports of any . missing child to state police, regardless if the person is a runaway. Amber Alert personnel would then decide whether or not to issue an . alert.

"The family of AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd have broken their silence for the first time since his controversial arrest in New Zealand last week. His son, Thomas Rudd, defended his father on Sunday night - four days after the legendary rocker appeared in court on charges, which also included possession of amphetamines and cannabis. 'All I will say is that my dad is a good guy. He's not perfect but wouldn't harm anyone,' he told Daily Mail Australia from Europe. Scroll down for video . In photos posted to social media AC/DC drummer can be seen posing with his three daughters Milla, Lucia and Tuesday . On Thursday, Rudd appeared in court with no shoes on, just hours after New Zealand police searched his house in Tauranga - 200km south-east of Auckland - on the North Island. Rudd was charged with procuring a man to murder two other men between September 25 and 26 and with threatening to kill on September 26. He was also charged with possession of amphetamines and cannabis. The procure to murder charges were withdrawn the next day. Crown Solicitor Greg Hollister-Jones ruled there was insufficient evidence to justify those charges. He still faces the threat to kill charge. Since then details have emerged of the reclusive musician's lavish lifestyle, which include claims of group sex from prostitutes and luxury cars, but photos on his daughter's social media page paint a very different picture of Rudd as a family man. The famous rocker, seen here with daughter Milla, has been charged with threatening to kill . In this photo from 2012 Rudd is surrounded by his five children and a woman believed to be his ex-wife . He has been ordered to stay in his house as part of his bail conditions, and security are currently posted outside . Images posted on Facebook show Rudd to be a loving father who is close to and enjoys the company of his children. In one photo from 2012, Phil Rudd is seen surrounded by five of his offspring at a birthday party as well as a woman believed to be his ex-wife. 'Beautiful family, your wife and kids are the sweetest people, glad to know you all,' one friend commented on the post. A more recent photograph from March shows Phil Rudd with a pair of sunglasses on smiling into the camera with his three daughters. While others, ranging from 2012 to earlier this year, show him posing with his arms around his children. Social media shows Rudd in many photos posing with his arms around his children, like this one with Steven, Milla and Thomas . Neighbours say Rudd, pictured here with Milla and another family member, is quite a private man . On Sunday, all remained quiet at the musician's home with promotional posters of his upcoming album plastered on his windows to stop prying eyes and cameras seeing inside . These happy snaps go hand-in-hand with the accounts of those who live next door to his waterfront home. Neighbour Prue Calwell said she had been over to Rudd's place a couple of times for a cup of coffee. 'He's a good neighbour... he's a pretty nice guy,' she told Daily Mail Australia as security guards remained outside Rudd's home on Sunday. 'He's very chatty and friendly. 'But he's pretty private. We don't see or hear anything [from his house].' Ms Calwell said she and her family only had a noise problem once when her son was woken up by drumming coming from the band member's house. On Sunday, all remained quiet at the musician's home with promotional posters of his upcoming album plastered on his windows to stop prying eyes and cameras seeing inside. He was granted bail under the condition he would remain at his Harbour Drive home in Tauranga until his next appearance on November 27 at the local district court.

"The United States has paid Pakistani television stations to run advertisements featuring President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, hoping to soothe public opinion in a country hit by protests against an anti-Islam movie made in California, the State Department said on Thursday. The U.S. embassy in Islamabad spent about $70,000 to run the announcement, which features clips of Obama and Clinton underscoring U.S. respect for religion and declaring the U.S. government had nothing to do with the movie, it said. The State Department says the embassy compiled clips of Obama and Clinton rejecting the contents of the movie and extolling American tolerance for all religions into a 30-second public service announcement that is running on seven Pakistani networks . Making the message clear: The minute-long video shows two clips from public statements made by President Obama (right) and secretary of state Hillary Clinton (left) condemning the Innocence of Muslims film . Audience: Running the clips with Urdu subtitles, the ad will be aired in Pakistan and will cost $70,000 . Viewing: Sitting in a dark room, a Pakistani man watches the advertisement sponsored by the US embassy in Islamabad on a local news channel . Burning: People burn a portrait depicting US President Obama, left, and an effigy of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, right during a protest against the anti-Islam movie entitled Innocence of Muslims . 'In order to ensure we reached the largest number of Pakistanis, some 90million as I understand it in this case with these spots, it was the judgment that this was the best way to do it,' State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told a news briefing. The U.S. announcement aired as Washington warned Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Pakistan, one of the mostly Muslim countries hit by a wave of anti-American demonstrations. In Libya, a deadly assault last week killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. The protests, which were sparked by an Internet video that mocked the Prophet Mohammad and swept through Yemen, Egypt and other countries, also prompted the U.S. government to withdraw non-essential personnel in Tunisia and Sudan. In Pakistan, protesters have demonstrated in more than a dozen cities. Anti-America: A protester holds a stick as he shouts anti-U.S. slogans in front of a burning cinema during an anti-U.S. protest rally to mark the Day of Love in Peshawar . Burned: Flames rise from a vehicle today after it was set on fire during a protest against the anti-Islam movie . Counter-terrorism analysts for the New York Police Department warned in a paper circulated on Thursday that the anti-U.S. and anti-Western protests would continue to spread, fueled most recently by a French magazine's publication of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Mohammad. The cartoons in France's Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly have provoked relatively little street anger thus far, although about 100 Iranians demonstrated outside the French embassy in Tehran. Nuland said the decision to buy the television ads, identified as paid public service announcements, was not unusual in countries where this is 'the norm for getting your message out.' 'I think the sense was that this particular aspect of the president and the secretary's message needed to be heard by more Pakistanis than had heard it, and that this was an effective way to get that message across,' she said. Bigotry: Protestors chant slogans during a protest against the anti-Islam movie today; the country's prime minister condemned the video as 'the worst kind of bigotry' Clash: A Pakistani protester throws a tear gas canister back at police during clashes that erupted as protestors tried to approach the U.S. embassy in Islamabad . A Pakistani protester reacts during clashes with riot police that erupted as protestors tried to approach the U.S. embassy in Islamabad today . She said it would take time to measure the effectiveness of the ads in Pakistan, where on Thursday and Friday, huge crowds again gathered to protest against the video. In the video, Obama . and Clinton's comments, which are from previous public events in . Washington, are in English but subtitled in Urdu, the main Pakistani . language. Tens of thousands protested against the film around the country after the government encouraged peaceful protests and declared a national holiday - Love for the Prophet Day. Demonstrations turned violent and three people were killed, including a driver for a Pakistani television station, who died after police opened fire on rioters torching a cinema in the northwest city of Peshawar during a protest. Clashes between police and thousands of stone-throwing protesters also occurred in Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. Ms Nuland said the aim was to get the messages to the . widest possible audience in Pakistan, where tens of thousands of . protestors angry about the film tried to reach the U.S. embassy before . being turned back by Pakistani police. She said embassy staffers had decided . the ads were the best way to spread the word. The seven networks have a . potential audience of 90 million people, she added. 'The . sense was that this particular aspect of the president and the . secretary's message needed to be heard by more Pakistanis than had . heard, and that this was an effective way to get that message out,' Ms . Nuland told reporters in Washington. The ads are not running in other countries, she said. In . the ad, Obama is seen talking about America's tradition of religious . tolerance and Clinton is seen saying that the U.S. government had . nothing to do with the video that contains vulgar depiction of the . Prophet Muhammad. Walking away: Two men are seen today in Pakistan walking away from fires, two of many set across the  country in today's widespread and continuing protests . Pakistani protesters push a container blocking the road to the U.S. embassy during a protest in Islamabad . Disrespect: A protestor wear mock of US flags on feet during a rally today . 'We absolutely reject its content and message,' Clinton says in the advertisement. A caption on the ad reads: 'Paid Content' and it ends with the seal of the American Embassy in Islamabad, . Nuland . said it was common practice to pay to air public service announcements . in Pakistan and noted that the embassy there had done it at least one . other time, in the aftermath of a deadly 2005 earthquake that hit the . country. In an email sent . after the ads began running Thursday, the embassy in Islamabad also . distributed a link to video of ordinary Americans condemning the . anti-Islam film, which appeared on YouTube.

In an . interview with The Associated Press, Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina .

"Belligerent North Korea was reported yesterday to have launched a refurbished Soviet-era submarine, capable of firing ballistic missiles that could easily reach its enemy neighbour, South Korea - and far beyond. Military and government sources in Seoul were quoted by South Korea’s Yonhap news agency as saying that the development raises further concerns about the North’s evolving missile and nuclear threats. The disturbing news comes as photos were released of unpredictable leader Kim Jong-un visiting a North Korean air force base where, the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported, he checked out equipment on a fighter jet and ‘gave instructions’ to pilots. Scroll down for video . Work on the 1958 Soviet vessel (above) to bring it up to standards capable of putting to sea and possibly firing ballistic weapons is being watched carefully by South Korea’s military . Despite walking with a stick, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un managed to climb into the cockpit of a plane . He climbed into the cockpit of one of the pursuit aircraft and congratulated the pilots for their skills. He even promoted four squadron leaders on the spot. News of Kim’s visit prompted a South Korean source to remark that the North’s pilots have little experience in air battles and are ‘seized with fear’ at the thought of taking on Seoul’s airmen who have access to far superior technology. Whether Kim’s visit - his ninth to air force units this year - and the launching of the nuclear-capable submarine was just ‘sabre-rattling’ or a severe warning of troubles ahead was not immediate apparent. But the work on the 1958 Soviet vessel to bring it up to standards capable of putting to sea and possibly firing ballistic weapons is being watched carefully by South Korea’s military. Kim congratulated the pilots for their skills. He even promoted four squadron leaders on the spot . The ‘new’ submarine, which was decommissioned by the former Soviet Union in 1990, is said to be 67 meters long with a beam of 6.6 meters. The 3,500-ton Golf II class submarine carries the R-21 liquid-propellant missile with a 1,180 kilogram warhead and a maximum range of 1,420 kilometres. News of the North’s submarine first emerged last month in a report by the US Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in the US. Another source was quoted by the Yonhap news agency today as saying that in a move to mount a missile tube on the refurbished submarine, North Korea has carried out dozens of tests on the ground and at sea. ‘According to the analysis of satellite imagery…a ground test facility for the SLBM (submarine-launched ballistic missile) launch has been up and running at the Sinpo shipyard,’ said the source. The source added that a dozen more tests would be required to perfect the technology. The source’s comments are said to be in line with what arms expert Joseph S.Bermudez Jr. said in a recent report that North Korea had built a ‘new test stand’ at its secret Sinpo shipyard to research and develop SLBMs. That test stand has a 35-by-30 meter concrete pad and stands about 12 meters high. ‘It would take one or two years before the North completes the test for the vertical launch of missiles from the sea,’ a military source in Seoul said today. The communist regime has more submarines than South Korea, but they are equipped with outdated weapons.","Unpredictable leader Kim Jong-un visited a North Korean air force base .

"Bloated beyond recognition, with his long hair dyed blond and sporting a grey goatee, notorious conman Peter Foster – a former friend of Cherie Blair – was dramatically arrested in Australia yesterday after a year on the run. His dishevelled appearance was a stark contrast to the sharp figure he cut while promoting his worthless Bai Lin Tea slimming products in Britain more than 30 years ago. The 52-year-old self-confessed ‘international man of mischief’, who later became the central figure in the infamous 2002 Cheriegate scandal, was pounced on by police at his hideout near the New South Wales holiday town of Byron Bay. Scroll down for video . Peter Foster, 52, was arrested in Byron Bay on Tuesday afternoon . Footage shows the man with long grey hair, a ragged beard, and barefoot . Footage shows officers arresting the wanted man, who has let his hair and beard grow long and grey . As they wrestled him to the ground one of the officers was heard to warn his colleagues: ‘He’s got a gun!’ In fact, Foster was unarmed. He was quickly subdued and dragged away to a police van – but the first stop wasn’t a police cell. Instead, the fugitive was taken to hospital after he suffered what a police spokesman described as ‘a turn’, the nature of which was not known, while being arrested. Foster is expected to appear before a Brisbane court in the next few days to face a sentencing hearing for his involvement in a weight loss scheme – he is banned from taking part in any such schemes in Australia. A Queensland judge has already decided he will go to jail for three years. But because Foster failed to appear in court for the sentencing hearing late last year and was judged to be in contempt of court, after which he remained ‘on the run’ for a year, he is certain to be ordered to serve added jail time. The man who made millions of pounds by selling franchises for weight-loss products – which were found in scientific tests to be ineffective – first made headlines in Britain in the 1980s when he dated models and even took one on a six-month tour of Europe in a Rolls-Royce. Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry . He looked dramatically different on Tuesday when he was captured by a number of officers on the NSW coast . Footage from his arrest on Tuesday shows officers surrounding the wanted man before pinning him to the ground . In 2002 Cherie Blair, wife of of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the Australian conman . Later he began an affair with Cherie Blair’s fitness ‘guru’ Carole Caplin. It was through Miss Caplin that he agreed to help the-then Labour Prime Minister’s wife to purchase two flats in Bristol for a discounted price. It resulted in Mrs Blair sending him an email saying he was ‘a star’. When she learned of his notoriety, she tearfully admitted her mistake in public. Foster has boasted to the Daily Mail that he has been in prison in Britain, the US and Australia but insisted he had never been convicted of fraud. Rather, he said, he had been found guilty of advertising misdemeanours. During his time in Britain, he befriended Carole Caplin, Cherie Blair’s fitness 'guru' which is how he came to get close to the Blair family . He was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US. Convictions in the past did not stop him continuing to be involved in the weight loss industry in Australia and he found himself behind bars again, this time in Queensland. On being freed, he became a silent partner in another weight loss scam and was due to be sentenced last year when he disappeared - only to post photos of himself enjoying kava in Fiji. Or so it seemed. But reports began to emerge that he had been seen in northern New South Wales - and now it appears that those reports had foundation, with his arrest near Byron Bay. Foster was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US . Having heard Foster boast of his ability to date beautiful women, his former lawyer Sean Cousins has described him as a ‘narcissistic psychopath’. When he heard that Foster had been arrested, Mr Cousins, who has claimed that the conman has threatened him over the phone, said last night that he was relieved. He told the Gold Coast Bulletin that he had always believed Foster was living near Byron Bay and not in Fiji as the conman had claimed with a series of internet photos allegedly showing him in the Pacific nation. ‘I think it is sad that it has taken police so long to find him,’ said Mr Cousins. ‘I understood that he had a friend rent a couple of houses for him and he has been hopping between the two for months.’ The Daily Mail revealed in 2002 that Cherie Blair had used Australian conman Peter Foster to obtain a discount on two luxury flats in Bristol for her. There were strong denials from the Blairs that they even knew Foster, but the lie was laid bare when on December 5 the Mail published a series of emails between Foster and Mrs Blair discussing the purchase of the flats. Cherie Blar, pictured with Carole Caplin, who at the time was in a relationship with Peter Foster . Foster, who was involved in an affair with Mrs Blair’s fitness ‘guru’ Carole Caplin at the time, told the Prime Minister’s wife he had managed to get a £69,000 discount, adding: ‘Let me know if I can be of service ... as I tell Carole, your pleasure is my purpose.’ He went on to tell Mrs Blair that the mortgage could be handled by his accountant who ‘will not charge you for his services as I will pay him through my company’. Mrs Blair replied that ‘you are a star’ and later, after meeting him at Miss Caplin’s gym, wrote to him on November 9 telling him that she could not thank him enough for taking the negotiations over for her and hoped they could ‘see each other again soon’. Downing Street initially stated that Foster was not, and had not been, a financial adviser to the Blair family. But after the Mail exposed the emails, Mrs Blair tearfully apologised for denying Foster’s involvement. No 10 said that if Mrs Blair had known of his past she would have been more circumspect. But Foster’s background had been well documented before Cheriegate. In 1994 he was fined £21,000 for a trading standards offence relating to his Bai Lin weight loss tea, and two years later he was jailed for breaching laws regarding distribution of slimming granules. He escaped from prison and went to Australia, where he was extradited to Britain. Later he was jailed in the US for another trading standards offence – and when he returned to Britain in 2000 he was jailed again, briefly, for using fraudulent documents to obtain credit for a slimming cream company.

"Despite celebrities and businesses threatening to leave France, Francois Hollande is determined to bring in the 75 per cent tax . France's highest court today gave Francois Hollande the green light to introduce a top tax rate of 75 per cent. After months of wrangling, the Constitutional Council said the controversial proposal by the Socialist president was within the law. It has already led to entrepreneurs and celebrities leaving France, but Mr Hollande is determined to see the policy implemented. Now companies will have to pay 75 percent tax on all annual salaries exceeding one million euros, the equivalent of £830,000. The Council originally rejected the measure in March, saying that it was against the law to levy taxes on individuals, rather than on households. But in a ruling published on Sunday, the council said a reformulated tax ‘conforms with (France’s) constitution’. Employers will now have to pay 50 per cent income tax on salaries they pay above €1m, or £830,000. Social charges will bring the effective rate up to 75 per cent. The tax will apply for incomes paid this year, 2013, and in 2014. Mr Hollande has admitted that he ‘dislikes the rich’, but insisted his new tax did not aim ‘to punish’ them. He said he hoped it will encourage companies to lower executive pay during tough economic times. But it comes as the French economy veers from crisis to crisis – all of them blamed on Mr Hollande’s mismanagement. The number of unemployed spiraled to 3.29 million this month, representing a year-on-year increase of 5.6 per cent. Beyond the sky-high job rate and rocketing cost of living, Europe's second largest economy fell by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter of this year. This was while Britain's economy grew by 0.8 per cent, and Germany’s by 0.3 per cent. So far Mr Hollande has steered France from crisis to crisis with unemployment rising and the economy shrinking, making him the most unpopular president in recent history . Mr Hollande is by far the most unpopular president in the recent history of France, according to all recent polls. His disastrous handling of the economy has seen hundreds of thousands regularly staging public demonstrations against him. Earlier this month, France was branded the new 'sick man of Europe' amid fears it may slip back into recession. 'France looks increasingly like the new sick man of Europe,’ said Markit’s Chris Williamson, while others warned that the 75 per cent tax rate will see more talent flooding out of France. In another devastating analysis this month, ratings agency Standard & Poor highlighted the risks to the French economy posed by weak economic growth, high unemployment, the rising national debt and ‘elevated’ levels of tax and spending.","Constitutional Court rules that tax on one million euro earners is legal .

"Topping hitlist: TV reality star Kim Kardashian was the most searched-for celebrity of 2011 . It's the all-encompassing litmus test that determines what's top and what's a flop in our digital society. Today, Google reveals its annual zeitgeist - the people, places and things that are clicking the most with UK internet users in 2011. Top of the most-searched celebrities is US reality star Kim Kardashian, whose profile was boosted further this year after marrying and then divorcing basketball player Kris Humphries in just three months. She rose to fame after appearing in reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians which launched in 2007 and follows the personal and professional lives of members of her family. Next behind her was Victoria Beckham, who gave birth to her and husband David's first daughter, Harper Seven, in July, followed by Harry Potter actress Emma Watson in third. Singer Amy Winehouse, who died earlier this year in tragic circumstances, comes in fifth. Ricky Gervais, undoubtedly buoyed by his notorious appearance as MC for the Golden Globes, was the only male to make into the top ten. The search giant also revealed the year's fastest-rising searches which was topped by a country mile by the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, who also featured in the top ten fasting-rising people section. The Royal Wedding was followed by the iPhone 5 and popular football computer game Fifa 12, revealing just how technology obsessed the world has become. Another American reality TV star, the late Ryan Dunn of Jackass fame, who died in a car crash, was the fastest-rising person ahead of singer Adele, while Breaking Dawn leads the fastest-rising movies list. Perhaps unsurprisingly, X Factor hit number 1 in the TV shows chart. Top searches in the UK were made up of Facebook, Hotmail, You Tube and eBay. Argos also made the list. There is also a list of the most . popular 'what is...' searches, in which AV - the Alternative Vote - . clearly baffled electors the most. Almost 20 million people took part in . the national referendum on the electoral system this year which saw two . thirds vote to keep the first-past-the-post system to elect MPs. This was followed, bizarrely, by people curious to know about . scampi, piles and truffles. However, searches for Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg declined faster than X-Factor winner Joe Mcelderry who has been dropped by his record label, and singer Alexandra Burke. Joyous occasion: The wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton was the fastest-rising search term on Google this year . Also revealed are the fastest rising travel destinations, sports terms, news, food and drink, music and top TV searches.

In fact, Mail Online is ranked in the top three 'destination' sites for news, TV and celebrities - all judged by where people go after Google searches, according to data from search experts Hitwise. Other British national newspapers failed to make the top ten - except for TV, where the Daily Mirror was placed tenth. No other online news outlets or TV channel sites made the top three in any of these categories. In searches for TV shows, Mail Online was second - just after the official X Factor site.

"Conman Peter Foster, who was dramatically arrested this week after a year on the run, was making millions of dollars running an online betting scheme from his Australian hideout, it has been revealed. As Australian television viewers were being treated to vision of his dramatic arrest, it emerged he had been using a false name to operate the business with a male friend who was sharing a rented house with him near the New South Wales resort town of Byron Bay. But Sports Trading Club has now taken its last bet with the arrest of Foster, who will be extradited across the border to Queensland to serve at least 18 months jail of a three year sentence imposed on him last year for contempt of court. Scroll down for video . Peter Foster, 52, was arrested in Byron Bay on Tuesday afternoon (pictured here in 2007) Foster appeared in a magistrate court earlier today charged with assaulting police and resisting arrest when police, tipped off by Channel Nine' s 'A Current Affair' television programme, jumped on him near the house he had been living in. Magistrate Jeff Linden formally accepted Foster's guilty plea but did not punish him, noting that an outstanding arrest warrant allowed police to take the fugitive to a Brisbane prison to serve the outstanding prison sentence . The 52-year-old conman - who sparked the 'Cheriegate' in 2002 when he helped Cherie Blair purchase two flats in Bristol at a discounted price - was said by his solicitor outside the court to have been caring for his ill mother, Louise Foster, in Australia for the past 11 months. Private detective Ken Gamble, who had been working with the television crew to track down Foster after many weeks of surveillance, said the conman and the other man (named in the programme as Peter Noble) had set up Sports Trading Club in such a way 'it was difficult to see who was operating it.' Footage shows the man with long grey hair, a ragged beard, and barefoot . Footage shows officers arresting the wanted man, who has let his hair and beard grow long and grey . Mr Gamble said he was pleased that Foster had been caught 'because he has stolen the dreams of mums and dads of Australia.' The arrest of the self-styled 'international man of mischief' made for compulsive viewing last night, with half a dozen detectives and uniformed police pouncing on Foster in a clump of bushes. It was in September last year that the Federal Court in Brisbane found Foster guilty of contempt for disregarding a 2005 ban on him being involved in the weight loss industry. The ban had been imposed after he conned A$6 million - about £3.5 million - from 90 investors in a nasal spray he claimed help people lose weight. When he failed to turn up at the Federal Court in Brisbane, he was sentenced to three years in jail, with at least 18 months of that to be served behind bars. Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry . He looked dramatically different on Tuesday when he was captured by a number of officers on the NSW coast . Footage from his arrest on Tuesday shows officers surrounding the wanted man before pinning him to the ground . Foster's solicitor's comment has put into question a number of photographs he posted of himself in October last year - a week after he had been sentenced to three years jail for contempt of court - purporting to show that he was in the Pacific nation of Fiji. The photographs showed him wearing a floral island-style shirt and lifting a coconut shell filled with kava. Photos also purported to show him reading the current edition of the Fiji Times and sitting near a televison set which had the current news programme playing. This morning solicitor Mr Fisher said outside the Tweed Heads magistrates court in northern New South Wales that Foster was still coming to terms with what he was facing. 'He's a it shell-shocked at the moment, but his main concern is that he gets reunited with his mother because he's been looking after his mother for the last 11 months. He's effectively been living like a monk.' But a news crew from A Current Affair took their camera through the house that Foster had been renting under the false name of Mark Hughes and found television screens displaying the online betting club and a number of mobile phones. In 2002 Cherie Blair, wife of of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the Australian conman . During his time in Britain, he befriended Carole Caplin, Cherie Blair's fitness 'guru' which is how he came to get close to the Blair family . Foster was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US . Cherie Blar, pictured with Carole Caplin, who at the time was in a relationship with Peter Foster . The photos convinced many people that they were too good to have been Photoshopped, but police who had been ordered to look for him following his failure to appear in court to hear the judge sentence him said they still believed he could be in Australia. There was no record of him leaving the country legally through an airport or a sea port, but Foster claimed he had made his escape by wearing a wig and using a false passport. During a fierce struggle police were heard telling him to 'let go of the gun' - his solicitor saying later that Foster had not realised he had grabbed one of the officer's weapons. 'My client's stated he was just simply grabbing at it - it could have been a torch,' said Mr Fisher. As he was being led to a police car, Foster was seen clutching at his chest and then dropping to his knees. Ambulance officers were called to check him over before his burly frame was lifted up onto a stretcher and he was taken to hospital for observation. Today, when he appeared before magistrate Linden, Foster was still wearing a hospital gown. But by the end of the week, the man who has boasted of being behind bars in the UK, Australia, the US and Vanuatu, will be back in a more familiar outfit - a prison uniform.","Peter Foster was arrested in Byron Bay, New South Wales yesterday .

"Not so long ago the very presence of a father in the delivery room was virtually unheard of, with dads-to-be pacing maternity unit corridors while midwives patiently guided a woman through the most gruelling — and joyous — moment of her life. Times have moved on. Now fathers are expected to play an integral role. But surely times haven’t moved on so far that the father — even a multi-millionaire pop star father — expects to be centre of attention on a global scale while his wife endures the agonies of labour? Scroll down for video . Williams sports his best boy-band grin to soothe wife Ayda as she lies in discomfort . No wonder, then, that Robbie Williams’ tasteless video diary (viewed by more than 17 million people on Facebook alone) and inane Twitter commentary from his wife’s bedside as she gave birth to their second child has triggered such a negative reaction. There cannot be a woman in the world whose deepest sympathies did not go out to Mrs Williams, aka Ayda Field, as the singer filmed her during her most private moments. We even saw her in red spangly Louboutin stilettos while her legs were in stirrups. Most husbands would be happy to let their labouring partners relax in a pair of comfy old slippers and a flannel night-gown. Not so Robbie, who seemed to be telling the world that Ayda was a sex object for his delectation, even while giving birth. Then we were forced to watch the pain of her contractions. Hard to stomach? Yes. But perhaps most bewildering was the way in which Williams turned the birth of his own baby into a series of clips — one showed the 40-year-old former Take That star doing a lengthy dance routine at his wife’s bedside — in which there was, very clearly, only one star. And that certainly wasn’t Ayda. Ayda plays along by twerking in the birthing suite but it's not long before she looks like she's in agony . Let’s be clear. I’ve no doubt at all that Robbie loves his wife to bits. As Sarah Vine wrote in the Mail yesterday, he is ‘clearly, deliriously in love’. But while his videos are no doubt intended to be affectionate, fun and tongue in cheek, there was no escaping the person they were intended to promote. While it might be comedy, it was also vanity. In an age when it seems a week does not go by without celebrities revealing their most private moments on social media, Robbie Williams appears to have trumped them all. ‘Will it get on my gown?’ Robbie quips as his long-suffering wife begins to give birth to their second child . After all, if the entry of a new life into the world is not sancrosanct, what is? Even those celebrities who have sold media rights to their weddings, or shared the most intimate confessions about their sex lives, must have cringed watching these videos — and hopefully seen how out of control self-revelation has become. To start with, Ayda’s contractions are mild enough for the 35-year-old actress to play along with his weak jokes. In the first clip, he sits uninterestedly staring at his laptop while she sets an inappropriately sexy tone with a half-hearted lap dance. She attempts to catch his attention by leaning over at 45 degrees to do a Miley Cyrus-style ‘twerk’ — not easy with a substantial baby bump. He dances, she suffers in agony as she goes into labour . ‘He is loving it. That computer is just hiding his erection,’ Ayda says, managing in one sentence to go along with her husband’s reduction of the birthing experience to ‘entertainment’ at its most lewd and crass. Another clip shows the singer limping along a hospital corridor with a drip as his wife follows. After that, we see him chirpily inform viewers who are ‘really concerned and worried and thinking about what’s going on’ that he, Robbie, is doing great. The bizarre videos, shot in a Los Angeles hospital, were interspersed with Williams’ witterings on Twitter, such as, ‘It’s ok, I’ve totally got this’ alongside a picture of him at his wife’s bedside, pulling his best boy-band grin, even while Ayda was clearly in pain and distress. But worse was to come. The next clip showed Ayda grimacing and puffing before her face disappears and all we can see is a pair of legs in the air as a doctor ducks down to check on the delivery then tells her to ‘push’. Is Robbie holding his wife’s hand? No. He is singing the hit Frozen theme tune Let It Go. Even long- suffering Ayda tells him to shut up. The only thing we did not witness in the creation of this new life, it seems, was the moment of conception itself. And perhaps the most bewildering thing of all? The uber-showman didn’t give his fans their obvious finale; we never get to see even a picture of his 8lb 2oz son. Of course, discretion about even the most private sexual matters seems impossible for many celebs these days. Kate Winslet has told us she has waxed her nether regions so much she now needs a pubic wig for some film scenes. Michael Douglas revealed he uses Viagra, and in her album released this summer, Lily Allen sang about her husband Sam’s unparalleled ability to delay sexual climax. Williams rather too candidly revealed that he and Ayda were ‘practising’ for a second child following the birth of their first, Theodora, in 2012. The list goes on. Conversations better kept private are now also broadcast over Twitter. The pair joke as Ayda shows off her Louboutins in the hospital . TV presenter Melanie Sykes could have sent Jack Cockings private texts at the start of their relationship. Instead she announced over Twitter to him — and around 140,000 followers — ‘I’ve got the raging horn, please take me.’ In a society where celebrities are now partly judged on the size of their Twitter following, they seem to feel the need to shout louder and break new boundaries. How depressing that the famous — and those who imitate them — are increasingly stuck in the developmental fishbowl of a four-year-old, with that ‘Look at me Mummy!’ desire to be centre of attention at all times. The irony of Robbie’s pregnancy video is that in August he took to Twitter to complain that pictures had appeared in a German Magazine of him playing at the seaside with his older child, Theodora. Robbie said he felt ‘sick and violated’. He still re-tweeted the magazine page to his 2.35 million followers. It doesn’t appear to occur to Robbie that he is personally invading his wife’s privacy by filming her. While no doubt at the start she’s capable of giving her permission, by the end she appears helpless and drugged up. Labour is the moment at which a woman is at the most vulnerable she will ever be. Yet instead of reassuring his wife, the former Take That singer simply tunes out her moans by turning up the volume on a succession of cheesy ballads. At one point, Ayda throws her head back in distress, with a look that says the only show she wants her husband to put on is a disappearing act. But Robbie is too busy miming and dancing to one of his hits to notice. Dismayed she is concentrating on her contractions rather than him, he taps her on the arm. Finding himself ignored again, he tells whoever is filming the scene to stop, before flouncing off. Is he joking around? Well. Not even the two people on the chairs behind him, presumably relatives, look vaguely amused. Never mind the little life waiting to emerge — it’s clear the biggest baby in this room is Robbie himself. The pair looking slightly more demure . As the birth draws closer, we see Robbie making a show of helping his wife, by holding a gas-and-air mask over her face to help her control the pain. The only surprise here is that the star doesn’t take a sniff of the gas himself. It might have been helpful to calm him down. The grisly denouement comes when a genuinely scared-looking Ayda, by now naked below the waist, covers her eyes with her hands as a doctor tells her he is going to have to break her waters with the gynaecological equivalent to a crochet hook — and announces it will be messy. Robbie exits stage right with the quip: ‘Will any of it go over my gown?’ It seems the star has not grown up at all since describing the birth of his daughter Theodora in 2012 as like ‘the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan’. It might be easy to dismiss Williams’ antics as the efforts of a limelight-hogging star to garner some publicity. While he remains a much-loved entertainer around the world, Robbie is not quite the mega-star he once was, in the UK anyway. But his social media posts are an extreme example of a disturbing trend to reduce life’s most intimate moments to nothing more than a cheap reality show. We’re turning into a nation of narcissists and voyeurs. This year we have already seen marketing executive Lyndsey Thomas, 34, from North London, commentating on the birth of her child live on Twitter. Then Josie Cunningham, who sparked huge condemnation for getting a breast operation on the NHS, sold tickets to the birth of her baby for over £10,000 each. So far the reaction to Robbie’s video has been decidedly mixed, with some fans saying they love the singer’s openness — while others argued he had only cemented his reputation as an attention-obsessed narcissist. But that won’t worry Robbie, who announces in the final clip after the birth: ‘No Moms were harmed during the making of any of these videos.’ Ayda sits blithely next to him, smiling again and looking understandably relieved it’s all over, adding she is still under the influence of the pain-relieving drugs. Once she has time to reflect on the experience of bringing her second child into the world, it remains to be seen whether she will continue to agree with him.","Williams sported his  boy-band grin to soothe wife Ayda as she lay in agony .

"Millions of YouTube viewers were shocked by the harrowing video of an 11-year-old Yemeni girl who claimed she ran away to escape an arranged marriage. But questions are now being raised about the authenticity of the claims by Nada al-Ahdal, who claimed she was only saved from the forced engagement after her uncle intervened. Yemen's leading children’s rights group Seyaj now believes portions of the girl’s story were made up, and her parents have been keen to stress that they never wished to marry her off. Scroll down for video . The truth? Questions are now being raised about the authenticity of the claims by Nada al-Ahdal, 11, of Yemen, who claimed she was only saved from the forced engagement after her uncle intervened . Family: A crunch meeting saw Nada (centre) face her parents (left) on camera with her uncle (right). An agreement was fixed that means Nada, her parents and uncle are going to move in together . But in a crunch meeting that saw Nada face her parents, the girl tearfully asked a mediator, Yemen Women's Union president Ramzia Al-Eryani: ‘Why do you believe them and don't believe me?’ In the dialogue captured on CNN cameras, Ms Al-Eryani said ‘We need to protect this child.’ She added: ‘I don't care about what's best for the mum or dad or uncle, just what's best for the girl.’ Following the meeting, which saw Nada and her uncle maintain that her story was definitely true, an agreement was fixed that means Nada, her parents and uncle are going to move in together. Ms Al-Eryani had been appointed Nada's temporary legal guardian until the dispute was settled. Ahmad Algorashi, president of Seyaj, had said on Saturday that his organisation did not believe Nada's parents tried to force her into marriage - a view shared by the Yemen Women's Union. The drama follows the release of the video, dated July 8 and filmed by one of the girl’s friends, which saw Nada tell the camera: 'Go ahead and marry me off - I'll kill myself. Horrifying: The drama follows the release of the video, dated July 8 and filmed by one of the girl's friends, which saw Nada tell the camera: 'Go ahead and marry me off - I'll kill myself' Claims: Nada poses on July 21 after she threatened to kill herself if her family tried to force-wed her . 'Don't they have any compassion?' I'm better off dead. I'd rather die.' She continued: 'It’s not [the kids'] fault. I’m not the only one. It can happen to any child.' 'Why do you believe them and don't believe me?' Nada al-Ahdal . 'Some children decided to throw themselves into the sea, they’re dead now. They have killed our dreams, they have killed everything inside us. ‘There’s nothing left. There is no upbringing. This is criminal, this is simply criminal.' In the video filmed in a car, she explained why she does not want to leave her family home, saying: 'I would have had no life, no education’. 'I ran away from marriage,' she told CNN in an interview after the video had been viewed millions of times. 'I ran away from ignorance. I ran away from being bought and sold.' The schoolgirl, one of eight children, was taken in by her uncle Abdel Salam al-Ahdal, when she was aged three. In the middle: In a crunch meeting that saw Nada face her parents, the girl tearfully asked mediator, Yemen Women's Union president Ramzia Al-Eryani (pictured) why she didn't believe her story . But it is claimed that when a Yemeni expatriate living in Saudi Arabia asked her parents if he could marry her, they were said to have readily agreed. Whether Nada's claims are true or not, the practice of marrying young girls is . widespread in Yemen. 'We need to protect this child' Ramzia Al-Eryani, Yemen Women's Union president . It has drawn the attention of international rights . groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages. Yemen's gripping poverty plays a role in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice, as poor families find themselves unable to say no to bride-prices in the hundreds of dollars for their daughters. More than a quarter of Yemen's females marry before the age of 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry. Tribal custom also plays a role, including the belief that a young bride can be shaped into an obedient wife, bear more children and be kept away from temptation.","Nada al-Ahdal claimed she was only saved after her uncle intervened .

"As I sat in the audience at the award ceremony, my heart was thumping and my palms were moist with anticipation. I was about to find out if all my hard work had paid off. Moments later, when the name of the winner was announced, I felt that familiar surge of elation. Yet it was not me getting up to accept the prize for the Year Two science project. It was my seven-year-old daughter, Lily. But it was me who had stood over her to make sure it was up to scratch. Now, as Lily accepted her book token from the head teacher, it was all so familiar. After all, this was how it had been for me. I had won my first prize for English when I was around the same age, and after that I was hooked, landing one every single year until I left school. Scroll down for video . Under pressure: Tanith and her daughter Lily, who she used to push to do well at school . For me, these accolades were the public signs of success that lit the way to getting a place at a top university and making it possible for me to fulfil my ambition of becoming a journalist and author. Now, it looked as though Lily was following in my footsteps - or so I thought. But when I found her after the ceremony, my daughter was in floods of tears, wanting to hand back her prize. She was unable to explain why, other than to say she hated all the fuss. It had never been my intention to pressurise my child. As a high-flyer who had done well at school, I'd expected her to work as hard as I had done. There was one key difference. As a child, I was left to my own devices by my parents. These days, schooling is so much more competitive that I felt I had to intervene to make sure Lily did her best. But that success came at a personal cost. Instead of letting Lily have playtime, our time together became an endless round of workbooks. I couldn't even bake cakes with her without wanting to teach her about weighing and measuring. However, though I was driven from a young age, my daughter simply wasn't. Innately modest, Lily didn't want to excel at everything. The pressure to do so meant she didn't want to try at all. Worse, she started to see me less as a mother and more as a ring-master. She stopped looking me in the eye and became irritable and secretive about school. Homework became the flashpoint. For someone like me, who generally did twice as much as the teacher asked, it was frustrating to see her trying to get away with doing next to nothing. I wanted to give her the benefit of my experience, but Lily heard my suggestions only as criticisms. It was not that I wanted to be pushy, although it may have looked like it from the outside as I forked out for Kumon maths courses and £75-an-hour tutors. All work and no play: Homework became a flashpoint for Tanith and her daughter and they had no fun together (posed by models) When none of that worked, in desperation I consulted a parenting counsellor, thinking she would meet Lily and get to the bottom of it for me. But after listening to me on the phone, she said it wasn't my daughter she needed to see. It was me. At her office the following week, she diagnosed the problem. 'You seem very stressed', she told me. 'Do you think that might be the cause of some of Lily's resistance?' I could only agree. Although I worked from home as a writer, to be with Lily and her younger sister, Clio, I was still competing in the pressurised media industry and had to work round the clock. The most stressful time coincided with the period between school pick-up and bedtime. Just as I was trying to defuse Lily's tantrums over homework, I was getting calls that couldn't wait from editors. No wonder the tension levels at home were rising. I even wrote a book called How to be an Amazing Mum - When You Just Don't Have the Time. And while it contained lots of practical tips, like how to put together a school lunch-box in less than a minute, looking back I can see it was also a cri de coeur. All the time-saving tricks in the world couldn't stem the constant feeling that my brain was about to burst. Yet still my workaholic tendencies and need for success, kept driving me. In the space of a single year, when Clio was four and Lily seven, I published no fewer than three books. To keep up, I started viewing breaks as a chance to catch up on work, rather than immerse myself in my family. But in my drive to provide materially for my girls, I was missing the fact that it was not just me who was paying the price for my career. My daughters were, too. Too much, too soon: Many young children are feeling stressed out thanks to their pushy parents . Now I'd had my eyes opened to the effect my work was having on my children, I started to look at life through their eyes. I imagined how frightening it must be for a child, who relies on its parents for everything, to see their care-givers so overwhelmed. It was painful to admit that doing what I thought was best for my girls was harming them. Indeed, animal and human studies find that when parents are stressed, their offspring are stressed, too. Baby rats, for example, are more fearful if their mothers are too busy to lick them and calm them down. In humans, babies who sense their mothers' anxiety feel more pain from injections, studies have found. Nor does our shortage of time make the periods we do have with our children more special. One analysis found that when parents try to make up for lost time, they're more bossy and intense. No wonder children's charity YoungMinds estimates nearly one million children aged five to 15 have mental health problems such as anxiety. The bleak truth, is that no matter how good our intentions, stress and overwork make us poor parents. Counsellor David Code, author of Kids Pick Up On Everything: How Parental Stress Is Toxic To Kids, wanted to get to the bottom of why affluent, well-educated people, who followed parenting guidebooks to the letter - and showered their children with love - were not necessarily producing emotionally healthy children. He had assumed that when kids developed behavioural problems, it was these problems that made the family tense. On closer inspection, he discovered a family was often tense before the child developed an emotional issue. Code believes the most important thing we can provide for our children is a calm environment. But in order to get off the carousel of being constantly busy, I had to understand the reasons I became a workaholic. I started to wonder why whatever professional heights I reached, nothing was ever enough. When I looked back on my past, I realised that the top marks I'd got at school had just been distractions from the misery that followed my parents' bitter divorce. I was thankful Lily did not have that void to fill. She's lucky to have a secure childhood under the protection of two parents who always try to put her needs first. But unless I found a better balance, I realised I was creating more problems. Children of workaholics tend either to copy them - or are so scared off by seeing what it does to their parents they don't even want to try. Sitting back: Now Tanith has learnt to not to push her daughter to follow in her footsteps as a writer . So I had to change. When Lily moved to secondary school, we sent her to an excellent state academy instead of continuing with private education, reducing the financial pressure on our family and allowing me to work less. I took steps to lighten up our relationship, have more fun and spend more time together in which we did nothing very much. I tried a technique called Lovebombing, devised by the psychologist Oliver James, to reset the emotional temperature between us. It involved spending time alone with Lily, and offering her unlimited love in order to re-establish trust between us. British parents spend £6 billion a year on private tuition for their children . The idea is that by freeing her from being constantly controlled, it would take us back to the closeness we had before resentment set in. It involved going away for the weekend with Lily and letting her decide what we did. Of course, it sounds mad to give a child total freedom, because parents are taught that in order to make children behave, we have to give them more rules, not fewer. But it's only for a short space of time, and Lily made perfectly reasonable requests. Last year, she decided on a weekend at a hotel in Brighton. She wanted to walk on the pier, and eat candy floss and fish and chips on the beach. Later, she wanted to stay up late and cuddle up with me in our hotel room while we watched two of her favourite movies. I left my laptop at home and turned my mobile off - and it was quite simply the best weekend ever. The impact of our time away was immediate and dramatic. It was as if the wall that had gone up between us had been dismantled and we could see one other again. Since I stopped pushing her, Lily's motivation has come back and, now 12, she is succeeding in her own way - by playing the violin - not in mine. For all those prizes I won in the past, I realise there is no award that comes close to the elation of being the mother of a happy child.

"Kieran Chung practises his dribble in the back-garden ice rink his godfather had built for him . Kieran Chung longed to be an ace at ice hockey, but struggled to get to his local rink to practise. So his godfather decided to give the ten-year-old an early Christmas present – by building a private rink of his own. Robert Vickers spent £15,000 putting the 5m (16ft) by 11m (36ft) practice area in the garden of Kieran’s home. Mr Vickers, 61, a sales director of a plastics company, used a large gazebo to hide the construction work and told his godson they were building a garage. When it was ready they blindfolded Kieran before revealing the surprise. Mr Vickers said: ‘When we took it off, his face was a picture. He couldn’t grasp what he was seeing at first. He kept repeating, “I’ve got my own private ice rink, haven’t I”? 'There were tears in his eyes as he tried to take it all in. Until then, didn’t have a clue it was even possible. 'Now when he has friends over, they don’t spend time on the Xbox. They get out on the ice and have a skate on the rink, because you can walk straight out onto it from the house. 'Now the Christmas holidays have arrived, we will really be making the most of it.' Mr Vickers said he was inspired to build the rink by his own son who is bound to a wheelchair because of muscle dystrophy. 'Having a son in a wheelchair has made me realise that you have to do what you can for kids while you are here. 'Once today is gone, it will never come back. I simply get a buzz out of seeing kids and smiling while they are being so active. I’m happy if Kieran and his friends are happy,' he added. The all-weather rink is made of specially treated white plastic tiles and is '85 per cent' like skating on ice, the family said. And having a practice area at his home in Nuthall, Nottingham, has already paid off for Kieran, who plays for the Nottingham Tiger Cubs. His skating skills have improved so much he has been picked for several team trials. Ten-year-old Kieran and his friends have been making good use of the rink now that the school holidays have started, his godfather said . Kieran with his godfather Robert Vickers who said he was happy to gift him the ice rink for Christmas . Mr Vickers, who fears skating is becoming a lost skill as town centre rinks dwindle, said: ‘Now he can practise for hours after school, instead of travelling seven miles to the nearest municipal rink.’ Another mother keen for her children to master the art of skating built her children a rink in Southport. Emma Brain, a special needs teacher, unveiled the back-garden rink to her three children last week. The 43-year-old said: 'I drew the curtains back, and unveiled the rink. 'As you can imagine there was a lot of screaming. They couldn’t wait to get their skates on and get straight out onto the ice.’ Managing Director of Dundee-based company Home Ice Rink, which installs the small rinks in back gardens said the trend for home entertainment is growing. 'Household mini rinks are getting more popular each year, especially at Christmas time when parents want to give their kids something special. ‘Some of our customers have converted their basements, set up a mini hockey rink in their front gardens, or put just a few tiles on the decking in the yard. ‘They have all sorts of reasons for installing them – as unique gifts for children, somewhere to practice ice dancing, or just something fun for their kids to play on when friends pop over. When you have an ice rink at home, the door bell never stops ringing.’","Kieran Chung was struggling to find somewhere to practise ice hockey .

"With her toothy grin, large brown eyes and friendly expression, this preening female looks like a natural in front of the camera. But it seems when the crested black macaque pushed the camera button and took her first ever ‘selfie’ - a picture which would be viewed millions of times on the internet - she may have been frightened. ‘That’s not a big smile,’ explains award-winning British wildlife photographer David Slater, whose camera the macaque commandeered to take her picture. Scroll down for video . This is me in the jungle: The iconic 'selfie' of a female crested black macaque that captured the hearts of millions on the internet . ‘She saw herself reflected in the lens and primates will bare their teeth when they see another they don’t recognise. It may signal that she is not sure what to do.’ The picture was snapped when David, 49, followed a troupe of around 20 primates on an expedition in the tropical forests on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Yet it has now become the subject of a copyright battle, with David threatening to sue a website that is allowing the image to be downloaded for free - claiming it is the work of the animal, not David. The pictures were taken in 2011, when David, of Coleford, Glos, rose at dawn every day to try to capture the macaques in their local habitat. But it turned out to be a case of monkey-see, monkey-do, as the primates, which boast blazing reddish eyes and spiky hairdos, quickly took David’s job in hand. At the end of the second day, the animals got so used to David, they started coming up to groom him, looking for insects in his hair and inspecting his camera equipment. Why the long face? Ol' Red Eyeys looks a bit down in the mouth for this perfect selfie . David, a professional photographer for 15 years, says: ‘These lovely little primates are particularly inquisitive and intelligent. They have amazing human-like characteristics, not least their “punk” hairdo. ‘But their red eyes seal the fascination for me; they are unnerving when they make eye contact with you - a memory of our ancient ancestors, perhaps? They started to get quite mischievous, jumping all over my equipment. At first the click of the lens scared them away, but they soon came back.’ He anchored the camera to a tripod, and then lay on the floor holding it so they could not carry it off. For the next half an hour, he let the monkeys fool around in front of the lens for the ultimate selfie session. David says: ‘Sure enough they put their muzzles right into the lens and starting snapping away. It was like the joy of seeing your new baby learn to play with a toy. It was totally fun.’ Me and my primates: David Slater and a macaque hold hands for the photographer's own selfie . Time for lunch: I know these taste good - but how do you open it? Just as in the human world, most of the selfie-snappers were females - macaques live in groups of up to 70, dominated by one alpha male. The photoshoot came to an abrupt end when the male head of the clan decided his harem had monkeyed around enough. ‘He jumped on my back and gave me a thump,’ says David. ‘They have formidably large teeth, so I decided to call it a day.’ When he looked through the pictures, David knew he had something special. Although hundreds of shots were blurry, four were perfectly in focus. When he released the pictures, he immediately got emails from people saying they had made them smile. But it was only when the selfie craze took off about 18 months ago, that the pictures became iconic as a reflection of how similar to us animals can be. David says: ‘They show these monkeys are as fascinated with their own image as we are.’ The main threat to the crested black macaque is man hunting them for food. They are trapped as black-market meat and served as a delicacy. Girls just wanna have fun: The inquisitive monkeys father around the camera is Sulawesi . There are estimated to be between 4,000 and 6,000 on the island, a fall of 80 per cent in the past 40 years. Indeed, while David was in Sulawesi he came across a close relative of the crested black macaque, a booted macaque, whose hand was stuck in a painful trap. ‘I got him released for a 20p packet of cigarettes as a bribe. The value of these monkeys’ lives is astonishingly low,’ he says. As well as the one-in-a-million shot that every wildlife photographer dreams of, David had hoped the pictures would raise awareness of the how endangered these animals are. But the selfies have instead turned into an international legal row. Because monkeys can’t own copyright, the images have been added to Wikimedia’s bank of free images - and both the macaques and David miss out on royalties of tens of thousands of pounds. David says the income should come to him - with a share going to a conservation project to protect these endangered creatures. But despite the fight, David says: ‘One day I would like to meet them again. I owe them all a big thank-you.’","David Slater, 49, followed black crested macaques around island of Sulawesi .

"A woman who admitted drowning her three young children in her Long Island bathtub five years ago has given birth to a fourth child while incarcerated in a secure psychiatric hospital, the I-Team has reported. Leatrice Brewer, 33, was found not guilty because of mental disease or defect in the 2008 deaths of her children, and has been held ever since at the secure Mid-Hudson Forensic Psychiatric Center in New Hampton. Her case returned to the public eye recently because she is trying to collect $350,000 from a settlement that the childrens’ fathers won from Nassau County in wrongful death lawsuits. But now Innocent Demesyeux, the father of two of the three children Brewer killed, says he has been contacted by a lawyer trying to find an appropriate placement for the newborn Brewer had while in custody. Fourth child: Brewer (pictured) has reportedly given birth to another child at a secure facility. Mentally-ill Brewer, 33, was found not guilty of the deaths of her three children . 'She told me Leatrice had a baby while she was in that facility,' Mr Demesyeux said in an interview. It is unclear who the new baby’s father is, or under what circumstances Brewer became pregnant. The state Office of Mental Health, which oversees Mid-Hudson, declined to comment, citing privacy laws. Attorney Tom Foley, who represents Mr Demesyeux, said 'it's outrageous' that Brewer was able to conceive a child while incarcerated. 'This person's supposedly in a secure facility and she gets pregnant. This is the woman who had no idea what she was doing when she murdered her children.' Happy . children: Brewer drowned Jewell Ward (left), six, and Michael Demesyeux . (right), five, as well as their one-year-old brother Innocent (not . pictured) Mentally ill: Leatrice Brewer admitted she drowned the children in the bathtub of her apartment in New Cassel, on Long Island about 20 miles east of New York City, in February 2008 . Because she was technically found not responsible for the children's deaths, lawyers say she may be able to claim some or all of the $350,000 estate their fathers won. However, even if the judge rules she can collect, Brewer is not expected to see any of the money: there is a $1.2 million security payment listed against her for the cost of psychiatric counseling and other services she has received since her arrest, lawyers have said. Another option the court could consider is to award some or all of the money to Brewer's baby as her heir. It is unclear who currently has custody of the newborn. After Nassau Surrogates Court Judge Edward McCarty decides whether Brewer is entitled to collect, he must make a similar ruling about the children's two fathers. If he finds that the men effectively abandoned their children, they may not be entitled to any money, lawyers say. Baby: Innocent Demesyeux (pictured), the father of two of the three children Brewer killed, says he has been contacted by a lawyer trying to find an appropriate placement for the newborn . The judge has scheduled a hearing on the matter on November 6. Brewer's case drew has drawn attention to the actions of Nassau County's social services agency, whose caseworkers visited the mother's apartment two days before the killings and found no one home but neglected to schedule an immediate follow-up visit.

"My daughters Lily and Clio were barely conceived before I found out what sex they were. For both, I had private scans at 12 weeks, not only because I wanted to check if they were healthy, but also to find out their gender. So by doing so, have I committed the alarming-sounding new crime of ‘moral kitsch’ - as author Ian McEwan would have it – and consigned my daughters to a ghastly 'pink fate’? Speaking at the Hay Festival at the weekend the Booker Prize-winning novelist, who has penned books such as Atonement and On Chesil Beach, strayed into the subject of discovering a baby's gender before it is born. Tanith Carey With her daughter Clio. She found out Clio's gender at 12 weeks in a bid to mentally prepare for meeting her child . While discussing how he decides upon the . sex of his characters, according the The Times the author said that his son and . partner are expecting a child and: 'were absolutely clear that they did . not want to know the sex of their child'. McEwan, who has been married twice and has two sons, added: 'It is above all a . person. Knowing in advance this social identity which confers a pink and . blue fate almost seems like a form of moral kitsch, because what you . are celebrating is a person. So I rather take the same view of my . characters, if it falls out it is a woman or a man then I go that way.' Novelist Ian McEwan bemoaned the trend for parents finding out the sex of their baby before it is even born, at the Hay Festival on Sunday . While I have huge respect for McEwan, I fear he is confusing fiction and real life here. He may be able, as he points out, to swap the genders of the characters in his books at will. But creating real families out of flesh and blood does not hang on a writer’s whim. The ‘is it a boy?’ slash ’is it a girl?’ moment may also make for great drama on Downtown Abbey.But after 26 hours in labour, ending in an emergency C-section, giving birth to my older daughter, Lily, the last thing I needed as any more cliff-hangers. One of the things that kept me going through those agonising hours was looking forward to meeting the daughter I had already bonded with in the womb. So it’s unfair of McEwan to paint parents who find out their child’s sex as conferring them to a simple pink or blue fate. There is evidence that both the Greeks and Egyptians – and no doubt the cave men before them – came up with elaborate techniques to try to guess an infant’s gender. Furthermore, being one of two sisters, with no little boys in the family, I was also aware that having a son would be a completely different parenting experience, one I would have to prepare myself for. Do you agree with Ian McEwan that finding out the sex of your baby is a form if 'moral kitsch'? Not because I wanted to stock up with toy trucks and footballs to stereotype him. But because brain scans conclusively show that male and female brains develop in different ways, and at different rates, from birth. I knew that if I were going to become . mother to a son, I would have to find out how. Nor can I deny that I . wanted daughters. If nature had decided the opposite, I knew I would . have needed time to adjust. The . second time around there was also the need to get Lily, then three, . used to the idea that a little sister would be joining the family, not . little brother. And, of course, into the bargain, we also saved hours of . boring debates on boys names and endless old wives’ guessing games. When . my girls arrived, I still dressed them in gender neutral white. As they . have grown up, Lily, now 12, and Clio, nine, made their choice about who . to become – not me. I . do not regret my decision to find out their sex for one moment. Those . first months of bonding between mother and baby are so essential there’s . not a moment to waste. Tanith and her daughter Clio, now seven, as a baby . Tanith Carey and her daughter Lilly, now 12, when she was a baby and right, Ian McEwan, 65, who slammed people who discover the sex of their unborn child . When my mother gave birth to my younger sister in 1973, before the days of scans, my father told me that she so wanted a boy, they were worried about how she would bond with her new daughter. Knowing both my children would be girls before birth gave me a head start I will always be thankful for.

"The concern is that if an anaesthetic is given to a young child, it could damage brain cells . Whenever a young child has an operation, it’s a worry for their parents. But studies are now giving another reason for concern: youngsters who’ve had a general anaesthetic may be more likely to suffer behavioural problems and learning disabilities. A growing body of research shows that going under a general anaesthetic before the age of four raises the risk of cognitive problems and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One paper found that children who’d had two general anaesthetics were 50 per cent more likely to develop learning difficulties. Questions about how sedatives affect the brains of young children are now so pressing that anaesthetists in the UK, U.S. and across the world are joining forces to find answers. In life-threatening situations, surgery on children is unavoidable. But one of the goals of the joint research initiative, called Smarttots, is to clarify the advice and help parents decide whether to delay routine surgery on their off-spring. This includes operations for hernias, birthmark removal, circumcisions and tonsil removal, and to insert tubes to drain ear infections. Although the NHS’s official policy has not changed, the UK’s Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists says several hospitals are already delaying some non-emergency surgery on young children to avoid any possible risk. Among the studies raising concern is a recent paper by the Mayo Clinic in the U.S., which links anaesthesia to behavioural issues. It found that ‘multiple exposures to anaesthesia before the age of two are a significant risk factor for the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder’. This follows research published in the journal Anesthesiology in 2009, which found children who had two general anaesthetics before the age of four are 50 per cent more likely to develop disabilities in reading, writing and maths. The study also found the number of times the children were sedated and how long for was a factor. If a child was under for an operation lasting less than two hours, there was no risk. However if a child had three or more operations, there was a much greater likelihood of learning problems. Dr Caleb Ing, an anaesthetist at Columbia University in the States, looked at the outcomes of 2,868 children born between 1989 and 1992. More than 320 were sedated for operations or diagnostic surgery before they were three. He found that children who received anaesthesia early in life were 87 per cent more likely to have language problems and nearly 70 per cent more likely to have cognitive problems at the age of ten, compared with those who had not been sedated. Just one exposure to anaesthesia was associated with more of a risk. He also discovered that not all of the brain was affected in the same way. Language and abstract reasoning suffered the most, while behaviour and motor skills weren’t affected. Although it is still not known exactly how anaesthetics work, they are believed to act in the same way on children and adults — by blocking the signals passing along nerves. The concern is that if an anaesthetic is given to a young child — whose brain is still developing — it could damage brain cells. There are similar worries about older people. Last year a French study suggested that over-65s who’d had a general anaesthetic in the previous two years were more likely to develop dementia. A recent study carried out at the Mayo Clinic in the U.S. found children who'd had two general anaesthetics were 50 per cent more likely to develop learning difficulties. The study also found if a child's operation lasted less than two hours there was no risk, while three or more surgeries increased the chances . One theory is that the anaesthetic may contribute to brain inflammation, thus encouraging the production of amyloid plaques — clumps of protein that are linked to Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Mike Roizen of the International Anaesthesia Research Society says: ‘Every time you have an anaesthetic in surgery there is a risk.’ But he adds: ‘There may be a special risk for children under the age of four. That is obviously a really important time for the development of kids’ brains.’ Under present UK guidelines, parents are not told about the latest concerns about sedating children unless they specifically ask. Some doctors are starting to question if they should legally discuss the issue with families so they can make a more informed decision. However, many experts believe it’s too early to change the policy, especially as many childhood surgeries are impossible to avoid, and delaying an operation could be more serious for a youngster’s health. For example, holding off ear surgery might cause hearing difficulties that could slow down a child’s ability to talk and listen — which could have a long-term impact on their learning. Anaesthesiology professor Vesna Jevtovic-Todorovic, who has pioneered research into the effect of sedatives on children, says if non-emergency surgery can be delayed until after the child is four without causing serious harm, then it is justified. She has also called for doctors to minimise, where possible, the number of times children are sedated and how long for, to reduce any potential impact. Several hospitals in the UK are already delaying some non-urgent operations, including hernias, tonsil removal and birthmark removal, to reduce the risks . ‘The momentum of the data suggests that the concern is a potentially real one,’ she says. Because of the ethics of research on youngsters, and the difficulties in measuring cognitive levels in very young children, the number of studies is still low. However, seven studies of young primates have found ‘emerging evidence’ that their brains are more vulnerable to damage from anaesthetics than adults. Researchers believe that anaesthetics cause more damage in the young because their brains are at a crucial stage of development, when the cells are trying to make many new connections. Dr Merle Paule, at the National Center for Toxicological Research in the U.S., has been looking at the effects of ketamine — a sedative often used on children — on the learning ability of young rhesus monkeys. She says: ‘Earlier research showed that exposing young rat pups to ketamine caused learning problems when they became adults, but we wanted to see what would happen with primates. ‘The learning of concepts such as matching — see a triangle and match it with another triangle from among other symbols — took much longer in the ketamine-treated monkeys.’ The impact appeared to be long-term, she added. ‘Even after basic concepts were learned, the ketamine-exposed animals performed less accurately than animals in the control group. ‘Six years after their ketamine treatment, they’re still showing below-normal brain function.’","One study found children who'd had two general anaesthetics were 50% more likely to develop learning difficulties .

"Over the years, I have used many weapons in my battle against frizz. There have been the straighteners and the steaming tongs, which looked — and felt — like medieval instruments of torture, not to mention the bucketloads of serums, quenching masks and elasticisers, all promising to transform my fine, fly-away hair into sleek, glossy locks. Yet it seems the search for perfect hair is still so elusive that, in the 21st century, we are resorting to physics. Indeed, if Professor Stephen Hawking ever designed a hairbrush, the Brilliant Shine Ionic Brush would be it. Scroll down for video . A brush with genius? Tanith with the Ionic gadget . This battery-powered brush works by sending out an invisible beam of microscopic particles, which claim to fight static build-up, to your hair. At first glance, it looks like a normal hairbrush. However, in the middle of the head is a hole, inside of which are two tiny sets of bristles, which emit a cloud of negatively charged atoms, or ions. Air-conditioning, pollution and man-made fibres can all cause a build-up of static electricity in hair, as can brushing and towel drying — making it difficult to keep your style neat and under control. Ionic Brush — made by BaByliss and selling for £30 — is said to help because the ions neutralise the static charge, thus smoothing the hair. So far the reception has been rapturous. One reviewer described it as ‘a blow-dry in a brush’. Another hailed it as a ‘brush with genius’. A husband, who bought the product for his wife on the Amazon website, even credits it with improving his marriage, declaring: ‘A happy wife is a happy life.’ The Babyliss brush claims to work wonders by changing the . static charge in your hair and stops it going frizzy . So does the brush live up to the hype? I admit straight away that science was never my strong point at school. But even I could discover an interest in particle physics if it means no more bad hair days or expensive blow-dries. The claims that this brush changes the static charge in your hair and stops it going too frizzy seems fine, but considering my fine, wavy hair seems to defy the laws of Nature, could it work for me? The handle contains a compartment for two AA batteries, which I fit right away. As I have no idea what to expect, I press the ‘on’ switch with some trepidation. British women spend ten minutes a day, or ten days a year, brushing their hair . At first nothing seems to happen. A yellow light appears to indicate the brush is working, but it is eerily silent. There is none of the usual vibrating, heating or twirling you expect from hair gadgets. I inspect the ionic generators more closely and press the brush to my ear — and realise it is making a very faint crackling noise. When I begin brushing my hair, all doubts disappear. Normally my hair is so dry and coarse that I have to drag a brush through it, but this glides effortlessly through to the ends. My tresses seem instantly softer and smoother without the help of any sprays or serums. I won’t say it’s ‘a blow-dry in a brush’, but my hair certainly has no right to look this good after so little effort. I am so intrigued that I turn ‘mad scientist’ to test the  theory behind the brush. Using a balloon left over from my daughter Clio’s ninth birthday party, I frantically rub the side of my head to generate an electrical charge and get my hair standing on end. The brush even conquers this frizz. Still, so much for the lab. What about real life? When I put the brush to the test again the next morning, I find it helps master my bed-head quicker than usual. Tanith (pictured) is a fan of the brush, and says: 'This gadget still costs less than a good-quality bristle brush, and it definitely saves loads of money on hair serums and smoothers' Tanith ran rigorous tests to see just how good the brush is. She used a balloon to frantically rub the side of her head to generate an electrical charge and get my hair standing on end - which the brush managed to calm . In the evening, I have to attend  an event at a posh restaurant. After a hard day rushing around, my hair is far from red-carpet ready. When I first used the brush, my hair had been blow-dried eight hours earlier. This time it has a different effect, reinstating the soft curls I had in the morning and making them look sleeker and smoother. Clio, who loves watching me do my hair, pays me the ultimate compliment by telling me, completely unsolicited, that I look like I’ve been to the hair salon. I’m thrilled. A few days later I wash my hair again and leave it completely as nature intended. As expected, it goes to frizz, the default position if my locks are not teased, coerced and forced to behave. They then look even worse — bushy as well as frizzy — after I get caught in a shower while walking the dog. Tanith (pictured) with the right half her hair brushed with BaByliss brush and the left half not. Tanith says: 'I pass my hands over my hair, it feels as smooth as if I'd been plastering it in a conditioning mask' When I get home I brush them with my new secret weapon for five minutes. This time, it still manages to smooth down my hair, but it can’t create the shape or volume of a blow-dry. However, when I pass my hands over my hair, it feels as smooth as if I’d been plastering it in a conditioning mask. One of the downsides of the brush is that it would be easy to leave it switched on in the rush of getting ready to go out, and the batteries would run down. But at £30, this gadget still costs less than a good-quality bristle brush, and it definitely saves loads of money on hair serums and smoothers. Long ago I learned that I can never feel truly in control of my life unless I am in control of my hair — and every little helps. For that reason alone, the Ionic Brush is a welcome addition to my armoury.","The BaByliss battery-powered brush could be the end of bad hair days .

"Just for kids? Myleene Klass and her daughter Hero, in April 2011 . Pity the friends and family of Myleene Klass. Not only do they get a choice of one lump or two when they visit her house for tea, they also get a choice of milks — soy, skimmed or the bikini model’s own. ‘Come on, it’s normal’, announced Myleene, 35, who has breastfed both her young daughters Ava, aged five, and Hero, two. ‘I made everyone try mine. It tastes just like those probiotic yoghurt drinks. Sweet — not as sweet as condensed milk.’ While most people would raise their eyebrows at the suggestion that stirring their host’s breast milk into their tea is ‘normal’, Myleene’s comments have highlighted how, in some quarters, breast milk is no longer considered just for infants. There is, of course, the inevitable ‘yuck’ factor about the idea of drinking a bodily fluid that does not come pasteurised in a carton, like cow’s milk. Not to mention the feeling that turning a mother’s milk into just another food commodity cheapens and dishonours it, betraying the unique bond between the parent and her child. But the unique combination of antibodies, living cells, enzymes, hormones and fatty acids in human breast milk has persuaded some enthusiasts that it is a superfood we just can’t afford to ignore. Because, cringe-inducing as it might be, a growing number of adults are drinking breast milk, convinced that the health-giving benefits it provides infants with could prove an elixir of life for grown-ups, too. In the U.S. its health-giving properties are taken so seriously that patients with cancer, digestive disorders or immune problems can obtain breast milk on prescription from a milk bank. All over the world, studies are being carried out to see how it can help with more advanced illnesses. In Australia, scientists use it to source stem cells to help in the possible treatment of diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. Meanwhile, in Italy, components are being cultivated as possible ‘brain nutrients’ to boost mental function in cases of dementia, stroke or brain injury. There are also trials underway in California for a breast milk-based acne cream. But while studies are looking to isolate some of breast milk’s amazing properties, there is growing concern about the unregulated market that is growing up around it on the internet. Since the first website offering breast milk for sale started in 2010, the trade has steadily grown, with thousands of pounds worth of unchecked samples now bought and sold every day. Bikini model Myleene Klass said breast milk tastes like 'a probiotic yoghurt drink' In Britain, there are 17 officially accredited NHS milk banks, to which lactating women can make donations to help mothers unable to produce milk of their own. But rather than give away milk for free, many mothers are using community forums, including Facebook, to make some quick cash. A quick glance at one British-based website shows dozens of women, from Essex to Newcastle, willing to sell breast milk — fresh or frozen — for around £6 for 200ml. Supplies are not just bought by mothers who are unable to breast-feed, or who want to return to work and are no longer able to commit to the gruelling schedule breastfeeding demands. There is also demand from women and men who claim it will help combat medical conditions, as well as fans of a dubious culinary trend for using breast milk in products like cheeses and ice creams. The women who sell their milk online are mothers like Claire Thompson, 21, from Glasgow, who last year sold supplies to make extra money while on maternity leave from her admin job and looking after her baby. ‘I had one call from a lady who wanted my breast milk for her husband, who she said was suffering from multiple sclerosis,’ says Claire. ‘Apparently, the nutrients and antibodies in breast milk can help people with MS, but just the thought of it made me feel a bit queasy, so I said no.’ But while some people see it as a panacea to all ills, there is also a risk of infection. In samples donated to milk banks in the U.S., one study found 3.3 per cent of donors had samples rejected after their blood tests showed up syphilis, HIV and hepatitis B and C. Kim Updegrove, director of a U.S. milk bank, warns: ‘Women are convinced that breast milk is somehow different from blood, and that there aren’t any risks in sharing it with another woman’s baby. In the U.S. the health-giving properties of breast milk are taken so seriously that patients with cancer, digestive disorders or immune problems can obtain breast milk on prescription from a milk bank . ‘But it’s an incredibly risky practice. Breast milk is a body fluid. Would you consider cutting open a vein and giving a direct transfusion?’ Disturbingly, websites trading in breast milk make no provision for screening of donations. Experts at Cancer UK say that it’s particularly important that samples are screened for anyone who is tempted to take breast milk in an effort to repair their immune system after chemotherapy. A spokesman said it would be ‘crucial to make sure it was tested for any viruses’. Quite separately, breast milk has also become the latest trendy ingredient in the continuing search for increasingly outré foods. The internet is overflowing with recipes for everything from breast milk crepes to rice pudding. Businesses selling breast milk products include a trendy Covent Garden ice cream emporium, The Icecreamists, which recently launched ‘Baby Gaga’ ice-cream — a dessert made from human breast milk, mixed with vanilla and lemon, then frozen and served in a martini glass with a rusk. It was briefly banned by Westminster council because of health concerns, but has now been reinstated. Child development expert Dr Rebecca Chicot of the Association of Infant Mental Health doubts that products made with human milk have much benefit for healthy adults, other than novelty value. She says: ‘Human milk has been honed over thousands of years to provide babies with optimum nutrition. It also contains antibodies and human growth hormones, which babies need in order to support their immune system and promote their best growth. Breast milk has also become the latest trendy ingredient in the continuing search for increasingly outré foods . ‘However, ice cream and certainly cheese production involves processing the milk, so it’s unclear if it will still retain the properties in fresh breast milk. In any event, adults will not specifically “need” the ingredients found in breast milk as they have got mature immune systems.’ Breastfeeding expert Charlotte Young, founder of milkmatters.org.uk, believes that a lot of our squeamishness over adults drinking breast milk simply derives from the idea breaking cultural norms. ‘Most of us in the UK are happy to drink cow’s milk — from a random muddy cow in a field, but not the same species, which is a bit odd. Yet some Asian cultures find our mass consumption of dairy products, like cow’s milk and cream, icky. ‘I am more concerned that women selling breast milk for profit could result in fewer voluntary donations to the NHS. Premature babies who could otherwise be saved with it, may have to go without.’ Retired midwife and breast-feeding specialist Clare Byam-Cook, author of What to Expect When You’re Breastfeeding, says it’s disturbing that breast milk is no longer respected and reserved for its natural purpose. In addition, she worries that the breast milk trade is fuelling the idea that all healthy women are overflowing with milk, and that there is something wrong with those who are not. Trendy Covent Garden ice cream emporium, The Icecreamists, recently launched ¿Baby Gaga¿ ice-cream ¿ a dessert made from human breast milk, mixed with vanilla and lemon, then frozen and served in a martini glass with a rusk . ‘Lots of mothers hardly have enough milk to feed their babies as it is, let alone to sell online,’ says Clare. ‘Just like prize dairy cows, some women are genetically blessed with that ability. Others can only produce small amounts. Selling your milk online is a way for some women to boast that they’re good at something other mothers struggle with. There is a lot of competitiveness out there.’ Clare believes the mass market in human milk also distracts from the real issue: that not enough women are breastfeeding in the first place. ‘In this country, 65 per cent of babies are bottle-fed by the time they are six weeks old. Twenty per cent of women never try,’ she says. Furthermore, by diverting breast milk from the very infants it is meant for, we could also be interrupting the bonding process. After all, the simple act of a mother breastfeeding her child not only gives her child the healthiest start in life, the release of the hormone oxytocin in the mother’s body also creates a bond between them — something that should surely be sacrosanct. Indeed, across civilisations and throughout history, breastfeeding has been considered to be the most intimate of acts; one which many mothers find deeply moving and personal. As Clare says: ‘Let’s not forget that breast milk is, first and foremost, for babies. It’s a shame to commercialise something so precious and important in our children’s lives.’ The story of the Immaculate Conception may be familiar to churchgoers the world over. But it doesn’t usually involve an anteater. This rare biological phenomenon is the talk of the town in Connecticut, where a female anteater called Armani has given birth despite not having mated for 18 months. As the anteater’s gestation period is just six months, staff at the LEO Zoological Conservation Center were initially baffled by the arrival, thinking it something of a miracle. They have since discovered that Armani had an ‘embryonic diapause’ whereby an egg fertilised during her mating period was put ‘on hold’ in her uterus. Fortunately, the infant anteater Archie has suffered no ill effects for his time in storage.","Some believe it is a superfood we just can't afford to ignore .

"From her coveted seat on the sidelines of this week’s hottest catwalk show, businesswoman Teodora Mihaylova surveys the models with a discerning eye. As the co-owner of two children’s hair and nail parlours, she takes fashion very seriously. The cut of a jacket, the hue of a shoe, the just-so accessories, nothing escapes her notice. In the spirit of a true fashionista, practicality is not an issue for her. It’s all about the label — and most importantly — being seen in that label. Scroll down for video . Strutting their stuff: On the catwalk at Global Kids Fashion Week . But Teodora, from West London, is not looking for clothes for herself. She is researching looks for her children Sienna, who’s just 18 months old and Alex, who’s four. ‘My kids are my trophies. I love to see them well-groomed and well-dressed,’ she announces proudly. She confesses to spending around £3,000 a year — more than she spends on herself — kitting them out. She once spent £250 on a pair of kids’ designer shoes, only to see them wrecked the first time her son wore them. ‘Of course, they don’t know anything different,’ she says. ‘They do grow out of them so quickly — and the clothes don’t last long — so for me, it is more about the logo than the quality. Some people may not even realise if my kids have a Ralph Lauren jumper on. But it’s the kind of thing I notice.’ It’s this thinking that is fuelling the current boom in children’s fashion, evidenced this week by Global Kids Fashion Week, Britain’s first designer fashion week especially for children. Here, well-turned-out little girls and their mothers paid up to £110 for a prime, catwalk-side vantage point. Designs on fashion: Youngsters decked out in the latest looks for the premiere Kids' Fashion Week . Stylish youngsters: The child models strut their stuff  in front of celebrity mums and fashion forward children . Important targets: The luxury children¿s wear market is valued at £6.5¿billion in the UK alone . The opening-day audience was a veritable who’s who of the mummy fashion elite. Model Jodie Kidd and her sister Jemma were in the front row with their respective children, Indio, 18 months, and Mae, three. Others famous names to attend included Kate Moss’s make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury and Jamie Oliver’s wife Jools, a children’s wear designer. In order to get the child’s perspective on this fashion circus, I took my eight-year-old daughter Clio. The moment we stepped out of the cab, she was mobbed, like a mini A-lister, by fashion bloggers wanting to take her picture outside. I was disturbed to think how quickly our children could be tricked into thinking the right clothes can instantly confer celebrity status. As she looked around inside, Clio was lured by the sight of the mini nail bar — aimed at a new type of child, chillingly branded ‘sweetly sophisticated’. Here tiny tots as young as 18 months old were getting their nails painted with washable non-toxic polishes designed so their mummies don’t have to worry if they stick their fingers in their mouths. But, of course, it was the catwalk where all eyes were focused. The very first Global Kids Fashion Week launched by AlexandAlexa showcased top designers A/W designs and drew celebrities like Jodie and Jemma Kidd to the front row . The show had a fun and playful vibe as the professional child models claimed the runway as their own wearing designers such as Oscar De La Renta, Paul Smith, Gaultier and Missoni .

Jemma and Jodie Kidd attended with their own fashion conscious little ones and stopped to pose for photographers after the show . Children have always been a reflection of their parents. But rather than . reflect our values, nowadays it seems that many parents are more . worried about whether they reflect their taste in fashion — or spending . power. If there is anything that illustrates how parenting is becoming a matter of style over substance, it’s Global Kids Fashion Week. But while it’s fine to sell the idea . to adults, who are old enough to know better, is it fair to sell the . same dream to children, who are so much more vulnerable and desperate to . fit in? The organisers are savvy enough to . head off any accusation that their event might sexualise young children. There is not even the slightest hint of lip-gloss and just a sprinkle . of glitter in the girls’ hair. There are no little ones clacking down . the catwalk in heels. Instead it’s Doc Martens and Mary Janes. But it is . still a blatant commercialisation of childhood. Research has found that children start . recognising logos at 18 months. By the age of ten, the average child . has already memorised 300 to 400 brands. Among eight to 14-year-olds, 92 . per cent are specific about which ones they want to buy. John Galliano (left) and Marc Jacobs (right) are just two of the estabilished designers who took part . Kate Mack-Biscotti (left) and Jottum (right) sparkle in party wear including pink faux fur and metallics . Scotch R'Belle collection had a 'back to nature' feel with delicate fabrics and  more muted colours layered up, incorporating various cultural influences . Even before children’s designer wear . got the stamp of approval from the over-excited reception to this event, . children were already saying they needed the right labels to make them . feel ‘special’, ‘make them popular’ and ‘protect them from bullying’. The PR pitch for this show continually . tries to stress this event is all about ‘playfulness’, ‘fun’, and . ‘dressing up.’ But as I remember it, didn’t dressing up as a child used . to be about pretending to be a knight or a cowboy, not mimicking . grown-up label slaves? Isn’t this obsession with brands really all about . money? Educational expert, Sue Palmer, author . of the book, Toxic Childhood, says: ‘What’s fun for adults  and . teenagers isn’t necessarily good for children. ‘The earlier you are hooked on . fashion, the more likely you are to be a fashion victim in the future, . desperately searching for an off-the-peg identity rather than developing . a rounded personality of your own. ‘Apart from “best clothes” for special . occasions, children need outfits that allow them to play freely; . clothing in which to run, jump, climb and generally mess about.’ After the show, Clio’s verdict on . fashion remained mercifully child-like: ‘Some of the clothes were nice, . but I’d spend too much time worrying what to wear if had them — and I’d . like to do other things, like play with my friends.’ As pressure mounts for the next . generation to be fashion plates, I hope all our children stay strong . enough to reject the life of a mini-fashionista in favour of a . childhood. ■ Tanith Carey is author of Where Has My Little Girl Gone?

"A newborn baby boy was found dead on a moving conveyor belt at a waste recycling plant after he was thrown out with the rubbish, an inquest heard today. The body was discovered by a horrified worker operating a picking line at Associated Waste Management in Shipley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire. At the time, the worker was separating mixed household and business waste including glass and paper. The body was discovered by a horrified worker operating a picking line at Associated Waste Management (pictured), Shipley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire. It is thought the baby was born four weeks premature and was alive when his mother gave birth - but he died shortly afterwards. Doctors believe he had been dead for a few days before he was discovered. Police who investigated the tragedy  sent leaflets to more than 35,000 local households that had rubbish collected that day in a bid to trace the mother. They also liaised with hospitals and quizzed 15 women as potential suspects but all were found to have given birth to healthy babies or were never pregnant at all. Inquiries revealed a second baby had been found at the same plant 18 months earlier. She was not identified and there was no DNA profile to match her and the boy. Today the hearing was told officers were unable to identify the boy. His cause of death is also unknown as his body had suffered numerous fractures before being found. The discovery was made at 10pm on September 18 last year as workers were dealing with collections from Bradford Council, Leeds Council and private refuse companies. Gary Normington, a recycle plant worker described how he saw what he thought was a body. He told the Bradford hearing: 'I took a second look and then saw what I thought was a head. I shouted to stop and a colleague pulled the cord to stop the conveyor belt. I said something like ""It's a baby."" I heard someone say ""Is it"". I then started to feel sick. 'I went to sit on the stair well. I then saw the site managers. I said ""are you sure?"" I said ""yes."" I knew it was obviously human when I saw its head and eyes.' He added: 'That image will stay with me for a long time.' Inquiries revealed a second baby had been found at the same plant, pictured, 18 months earlier . Richard Winterbottom, the site manager, told the inquest: 'We accept waste from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday. The rest of the time is spent processing the waste. We have 300 tonnes delivered each day by 50 wagons.' Mr Winterbottom told the inquest that legally the site must process the waste within 24 hours of it being deposited by the wagons. The wagons deposit the waste at the site, at which point it is weighed and dropped in a processing area before going through numerous machines which siphon off larger objects. He said: 'It goes in a large magnetic machine that lefts metal items and separates them. It goes through a large washing machine.' The waste then passes through a machine called Trommel which separates the materials by size so that the larger objects can be sorted by hand on a conveyor belt. This is the start of the recycle process. If it is not suitable for the conveyor it goes to land fill.' Det Supt Jim Harrison of West Yorkshire Police said officers made contact with the local health authorities in West Yorkshire which included Leeds, Wakefield, Bradford, Calderdale and Keighley. Various people came forward saying they had seen pregnant women on their street who they had not seen in recent months. He added: 'As we suspected the child was prematurely born or close to full time, we deemed it was likely that we would potentially, from inquiries, be able to find females that the local authority had concern for or were in the midwifery department - females pregnant but disengaged or had given birth and had not further contact with.' 'Once we had established where all the refuse was collected, from analysts we were able to establish every single property that had rubbish collected that day. 'Fifteen females come into the enquiry and we were able to eliminate every single one as having a non -pregnancy or having given birth to a healthy child.' DS Harrison told the inquest that DNA tests were carried out to find links to the baby's parents - however only a partial profile was found. The DNA results were run through local West and North Yorkshire databases and the investigation will remain open in the hope that someone will come forward. Coroner Oliver Longstaff recorded an open verdict saying: 'The basis of the evidence shows that the death appeared to have occurred at least a few days before the baby was found. Where the baby died we do not know. One of the things I have to determine if I can is whether the baby was a still birth or live. 'On the balance of probability it is my cautious view that it is slightly more likely that this baby was born alive than dead. 'The cause of death remains undetermined because of the state the body was in when it was found.'","Baby boy was discovered by horrified worker in Shipley, West Yorkshire .

"From giving up smoking to avoiding soft cheese, there has never been any shortage of advice for mothers-to-be about how to protect their unborn babies. Even so, pregnant women have been startled by a new list of household items they have been told to avoid, which includes everything from new furniture to non-stick frying pans. Experts at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who drew up the guidance, have admitted they erred on the side of caution and suggest women should be made aware of the risks in case they want to reduce their exposure to potentially harmful materials, which can build up over time. Concerns: Pregnant women have been startled by a new list of household items they have been told to avoid, which includes everything from new furniture to non-stick frying pans . Many experts have criticised the authors for scaremongering, without a proper assessment of the evidence for the items on their hit list. They add that the concentrations of chemicals in products are so tiny they are highly unlikely to cause harm to a foetus. ‘Everything we are exposed to — even water and the oxygen you breathe — contains a chemical,’ says Alastair Hay, professor of environment toxicology at the University of Leeds. ‘We are able to metabolise the things we are exposed to and get rid of them. ‘I’m not denying there could be a problem with some chemicals in various products, but we just don’t have any evidence.’ However, Michael Coleman, professor of toxicology at Aston University, applauds the report. ‘It’s patronising to say we shouldn’t tell people about the potential risks just because we’re not certain,’ he says. ‘If a chemical managed to get into a woman’s system she might well be able to fight it, but when a baby is in utero — I wouldn’t say it’s defenceless, but it’s not far off.’ So, should mums-to-be shun everything from non-stick frying pans and new cars to housework and make-up? NON-STICK FRYING PANS . This week’s report advised pregnant women to avoid cooking with non-stick pans. The concern is over perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), which are used to make materials that are resistant to oil, water and stains. Studies have suggested these chemicals may affect a baby’s growth. Last year, researchers from Atlanta’s Emory University published a study of information from 447 women living in England between 1991 and 1992 who gave birth to daughters. They found that girls exposed to high levels of PFCs in the womb were smaller than average at birth, but went on to be larger than average by the age of 20 months. Dr Michele Marcus, the study’s lead researcher, speculated that PFCs may affect how a child metabolises fat, making them more likely to gain weight. Another study from Denmark found that girls exposed to PFCs in the womb were more likely to be overweight by the age of 20. Levels of PFCs in the environment have lowered since these studies were carried out because they’re not used as much in products, and experts are split over the risks posed to babies. To stay on the safe side, if you are pregnant you may want to use stainless steel, glass, ceramic or cast-iron pots and pans — and avoid microwaving food in its packaging because PFCs are sometimes used to line the cardboard. HOUSEWORK . It's often said pregnant women become house-proud in the run-up to the arrival of a new baby. But the Royal College guidelines advise mothers to get someone else to do the housework because of the chemicals in some household cleaning products and air fresheners. One factor may be gases called volatile organic compounds — or VOCs — that are released from chemicals. In 2008 researchers at Bristol University found that children whose pregnant mothers used lots of cleaning products, such as bleach, were 41 per cent more likely to suffer wheezing and asthma by the age of seven. John Henderson, professor of paediatric respiratory medicine at the university, who led the study, said that irritant effects from VOCs may cause inflammation in a child’s airways. ‘It’s difficult to separate the effects in pregnancy from the effects of exposure after birth because many of the mothers continue to use the cleaning products afterwards. ‘But if you are using cleaners that are strongly scented it’s a good rule of thumb to minimise use during pregnancy and ensure you’re in a well-ventilated environment.’ NEW CARS . When a new addition is on its way, it’s common to buy a new family car to accommodate the baby seat. But even these are on the hit-list amid fears that the fumes breathed in when you inhale that new car smell are riskier for pregnant women and infants. However, there’s little evidence that this is worth worrying about. ‘There will be solvent exposure — that’s what you can smell — but it’s difficult to see how it would be harmful,’ says Professor Coleman. ‘The air conditioning will filter out certain things and most people have the windows open at some point while driving. ‘Unless you’re buying a new car every day I’m not sure it would cause a threat.’ SOFT FURNISHINGS . New curtains for the nursery may seem like a lovely way to prepare your home for a new baby. But the Royal College warns that stain-resistant carpets and upholstery contain a type of perfluorochemical — the chemical in non-stick frying pans that may affect foetal development. In 2007, scientists at John Hopkins University analysed 300 umbilical cord blood samples and found babies who had been exposed to PFCs while in the womb had slightly lower birth weights and smaller head circumferences at birth. However, the authors urged caution at these findings. ‘The differences are small and their impact on health uncertain,’ says Benjamin Apelberg, the report’s lead author. Pregnant women who want to be cautious could consider avoiding buying stain-resistant carpets, sofas and fabrics, even though experts are divided about the risks. FOOD PACKAGING . If you've switched to organic food since becoming pregnant, the Royal College says it may not be worth your while. ‘Pesticides are so rigorously regulated that human exposure via food residues is usually minimal, even in non–organic products,’ its report concludes. However, they advise mums-to-be to avoid plastic packaging and tinned foods, because these may contain the chemical bisphenol A. In 2010, the European Commission announced a ban on the use of bisphenol A in baby bottles because of fears the compound could affect the development and immune system of infants. However, critics say that this was an over-reaction. ‘There’s been a long discussion about bisphenol A and it has been reviewed by lots of regulators and governments,’ says Colin Berry, emeritus professor of pathology at Queen Mary University. ‘There’s no evidence exposure causes harm to humans. In fact, it’s important to remember these chemicals have great benefits. ‘Bisphenol A is used to line tins and it stops the metal leaching into the food. People are going to be exposed to vanishingly small amounts.’ If you’re worried by this small risk, buy fresh food instead of packaged. PAINT FUMES . Many mothers might be tempted to decorate a nursery to prepare for their new baby’s arrival.  But scientists advise against using paints, especially solvent-based ones, while you’re expecting. ‘Chemicals in these paints will be absorbed into the bloodstream when you breathe in the fumes,’ says toxicologist Professor Hay. ‘They can have an effect on the nervous system, causing symptoms such as dizziness and headaches. ‘Whether they would have any effect on a developing child isn’t known and there would need to be a high concentration of it. ‘But it would be a sensible precaution not to use solvent-based paints while pregnant.’ The NHS advises women to avoid all painting until at least the 14th week of their pregnancy as a precaution, and not use any solvent-based paints until after the birth. Always paint in a well- ventilated room. MAKE-UP . The average woman uses 12 make-up and skincare products every day, according to the Chemical Safe Skincare Campaign. This mix alone can contain up to 175 chemicals — including some that have been linked to risks for unborn babies. One key area of concern is phthalates, which are found in four out of five products. They are common in foundation, face cream, lipstick and nail varnish to give a smooth texture and long-lasting effects. Some experts think phthalates have endocrine-disrupting properties, meaning they can change hormones in the body. Parabens, also widely used in cosmetics, have  been shown in some tests to copy the effect of the female hormone oestrogen. ‘There’s a lot of interest in the effect of endocrine disruptors on low sperm count in men,’ says Professor Coleman. ‘The thinking is that it might be linked to exposure when they were in their mother’s womb.’ However, he says: ‘The skin is a good barrier. The chances of a paraben getting into the body through the skin are low.’ So, there’s no need to banish all make-up if you’re having a baby. If you have lingering concerns, some beauty products are paraben-free. Cosmetics giant Johnson & Johnson has recently announced that it’s phasing out phthalates and parabens from its adult and baby products. PAINKILLERS . Should you take painkillers during pregnancy? Pregnant women have been advised to avoid ibuprofen because research suggests it may raise the risk of miscarriage. The Royal College points to studies that suggest paracetamols in early pregnancy can boost the likelihood that a baby boy’s testes do not descend and infants will develop asthma. However, their experts stress that the numbers affected are very small and that the occasional use of paracetamol is unlikely to do harm. They add that many painkillers come in a smooth coating made of phthalates, which may disrupt hormones in humans. To avoid the risk, look for a painkiller that does not have a shiny coating and use it at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.","Pregnant women have been given list of household items told to avoid .

"They may have been hand- written scrawls, but school reports could once be relied on for a blunt assessment of a pupil’s progress. Now it has emerged that thousands of primary and secondary school teachers are relying on computer software to do the work for them. The software, which costs up to £350, allows them to produce reports in seconds by simply giving the child’s name and ability, then clicking on bland stock phrases. Worrying: Are parents being short-changed by computer generated reports? One software package, ReportBox, is used in just under 300 primary schools in the UK. The company says about 3,000 teachers are using it. All they have to do is cut and paste the names of their pupils into a blank box. The software, designed by an ex-teacher, even guesses the gender of the child, based on their names. They then get access to 15,000 frequently used comments. For example, if a child is of higher ability, the demo shows the report would read that he or she ‘enjoys all aspects of art and is able to put excellent imagination and attention to detail to good use.’ Middle or lower ability children would get remarks such as: ‘Ben enjoys all aspects of art and is able to produce some good paintings and drawings. In order to perfect these he needs to pay closer attention to detail and take more care with work.’ Up to half of children in some areas of the country failed to get into their preferred secondary school yesterday. Tens of thousands of 11-year-olds missed out on their top choices as the best state schools received more than 1,000 applications each. In some areas, hundreds of pupils did not get into any of the six schools on their application forms and will be forced to travel to less popular comprehensives. Council data shows the rejection rate is driven by competition for the best grammar schools and a new generation of academies and free schools. Experts believe an exodus of cash-strapped middle-class parents from the private sector is also fuelling demand. In Buckinghamshire – a grammar school region – 45.8 per cent of pupils failed get their first-choice secondary. In London 41.6 per cent of children in Westminster and 43 per cent in Wandsworth did not get their favoured secondary school. Across the capital the figure was 29.4 per cent on average. Janette Wallis, of the Good Schools Guide, said: ‘Competition for places at the most popular state schools is at fever pitch. ‘Increasing numbers of parents who would in rosier times have sent their  children private are now joining  the throngs.’ ReportBox costs £99 plus VAT to help write reports for up to 100 pupils and £299 plus VAT for an unlimited number of students. One deputy head said it meant she and her colleagues didn’t have to ‘spend all weekend’ writing reports. Another wrote in an online review: ‘While my colleagues speak of being up at 2am writing reports, mine took just over three hours to sort out, not 33 hours!’ But critics described it as ‘lazy’ and said parents were being ‘short-changed.’ Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘This is a very lazy way of writing reports. ‘The schools are educating the children on behalf of the parents and have a duty to inform them. I know, where a teacher has a lot of pupils, it’s a bit of a chore. ‘But it’s his or her responsibility to provide detailed, personal information to the parent – not just summon up these general phrases. ‘Parents have a right to receive particular information about their child, not computer generated generalisations.’ Another software package, called The Report King, is designed so that all teachers have to do is type in ‘l’ for lower achiever, ‘m’ for medium achiever or ‘h’ for high achiever. They are then offered a selection of suitable stock remarks to choose from. It claims the system ‘conforms fully with the expectation of Ofsted, your local authority, head teachers and parents’. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, denied it was a ‘lazy’ way to write reports. ‘It would be if everyone was  getting the same reports, but that’s not the case with the software now,’ he said. Mr Lightman said that the ‘vast majority’ of secondary schools also use report writing software, for example SIMS Teacher Comments from Capita. Capita’s website estimates the software saves teachers 30 minutes per report.

"A multimillionaire football chairman at the centre of a racism storm has admitted calling Chinese people 'chingalings' in a bizzare new interview while trying to defend his actions. Dave Whelan, chairman of Wigan Athletic, is already under fire over remarks he made in another interview where he reportedly said that at some point every Englishman had called a 'Chinaman a chink'. The 78-year-old is also alleged to have added that 'Jewish people chase money more than everybody else.' Scroll down for video . Wigan Athletic chairman Dave Whelan, who is facing a fresh racism storm after he admitted calling Chinese people 'chingalings' In an attempt to draw a line under under the allegations of racism, Mr Whelan gave an interview in the Jewish Telegraph, where he apologised profusely for his remarks and said he had nothing but respect for Jewish people. He also talked about the high regard in which he held Jewish people and mentioned how 'two Jewish boys' had shown him the ropes in market trading at the end of his playing career. However, when asked by the newspaper whether he himself had ever used the term 'chink' when referring to Chinese people, he replied: 'When I was growing up we used to call the Chinese 'chingalings'. 'We weren't being disrespected (sic). We used to say, ""we're going to eat in chingalings"". 'The Chinese weren't offended by that. That was the name everyone in Wigan called it (the first Chinese cafe in Wigan).' It is now understood that the Football Association is looking into Mr Whelan's remarks and is deciding whether to take action. But his latest comments prompted criticism from the Chinese community who say the term 'chink' and 'chingaling' are highly offensive. Mr Whelan had previously come under fire for remarks he made in another newspaper interview while defending the appointment of Wigan's new manager Malky Mackay, who is also facing an FA investigation into alleged racist and homophobic text messages . Michael Wilkes, a spokesman for the British Chinese Project told the Guardian: 'For many in the Chinese community these words hold deep emotional resonance, as they are often used in conjunction with racial violence, harassment and hate crimes. 'Therefore, to say that ""there is nothing wrong"" with using such terms or that Chinese people 'aren't offended' by their use, demonstrates a dangerous level of ignorance. 'We have noticed that Mr Whelan has truly gone out of his way to apologise to the Jewish community, it is a shame that the same level of apology hasn't been extended to the Chinese community.' The former owner of JJB Sports, who is thought to be worth around £200million, has already been asked to respond to an FA misconduct charge over his original comments as he was trying to defend the appointment of Malky Mackay as the club's new manager. Mr Whelan, who is thought to be worth around £200million is the founder of the JJB Sports chain and bought his hometown club in February 1995 . Mr Mackay is also the subject of an FA investigation into allegedly racist and homophobic text messages sent during his time at Cardiff City. Both he and Mr Whelan deny being racist. Cardiff owner Vincent Tan, who sacked Mackay last December, branded Mr Whelan a 'racist' following his appointment of Mackay and subsequent controversial remarks. Mr Whelan has said he would resign if the FA 'even suggest I'm guilty' of making racist remarks. Shortly afterwards, two of the team’s sponsors ended their arrangement with the club, with kitchen appliances firm Premier Range describing its position as ‘untenable’. But a spokesman for Mr Whelan later said: ‘The quotes were taken out of context and twisted.’ The former Blackburn and Crewe Alexandra player bought his hometown club in February 1995, overseeing an incredible rise from Division Three to win last year's FA Cup. Wigan currently sit 23rd in the Championship standings and have yet to win since their new manager's appointment.","In an interview Dave Whelan admits calling Chinese people 'chingalings'

"Spender: Andrey Goncharenko, a shadowy oligarch, pictured with a companion, has bought and sold mansions in London's most prosperous areas . At £120 million, it is the most expensive town house sold in Britain. Now a Mail on Sunday investigation can reveal that Hanover Lodge, in exclusive Regent’s Park, has been bought by a shadowy Russian businessman as part of a £250 million shopping spree over three years that has left him with four landmark London properties. Andrey Goncharenko’s moves in the London property market have been obscured by a series of offshore companies, but, along with the palatial Grade II* listed Regency mansion, he also owns 50 St James Street, Mayfair, which sold for £70million; a mansion in Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead, sold for £41million; and 102 Eaton Square in Belgravia, sold for £15million. Goncharenko is regarded as an obscure figure even in the secretive world of oligarchs, and the source of his wealth is unclear. He has never appeared in the Forbes Rich List and his rise to oligarch status has been as shadowy as it was labyrinthine. However, he has grand plans to spend at least £1.2million gutting the 33,000 sq ft Hanover Lodge, which was renovated at huge expense by its previous owner, Conservative peer Lord Bagri. Despite being described as ‘humourless’ by one associate, Goncharenko has been spotted on the French Riviera, rubbing shoulders with the Russian elite, and has a reputation as something of a party animal. In 2011, he was reported by a top social affairs columnist in Russia to have arranged a party at the Le Palm Beach casino in Cannes and flew in performers from The Box nightclub in New York. In 2012, he was at a charity auction hosted by supermodel Natalia ‘Supernova’ Vodianova, in aid of her Naked Heart Foundation, which aims to build playgrounds for underprivileged children. At the auction, Goncharenko bought a painting of Supernova herself by US-based artist David Datuna for £460,000. He is yet to settle the bill. Anastasia Zalogina, president of the foundation, said: ‘I can tell you that so far he has paid 50 per cent of this amount, but he did not refuse to pay the rest. We are in constant touch with him and we are expecting him to pay in full one day. I do not know his reasons for the delay.’ This failure to pay in full is all the more remarkable because in that same year Goncharenko bought Hanover Lodge and 50 St James Street. The Eaton Square property would appear to have been bought in cash, as Land Registry documents show no mortgage lender. According to the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, Goncharenko married a woman called Marina. He is named on company records as a Russian national. Marina is understood to be active in London’s booming art gallery scene and runs a gallery in Moscow. A report in society magazine Tatler said Marina ‘prefers to be friends with artists rather than to make money’. Although she did not reveal the identity of her husband, she said: ‘As long as I have a source of money away from the arts field, I will use this [to] support something eternal.’ Grandiose plans: Hanover Lodge, the £120 million Grade II* listed mansion in London's Regent's Park . Palatial: The grand interior of Hanover Lodge features gold walls and chandeliers with floor-to-ceiling windows . Goncharenko’s own interest in art first came to the fore in 2006 when he set up various arts and cultural foundations with Marina, who also set up an arts-focused company in the UK. Goncharenko’s identity came to light following a dispute between various estate agents over a ‘finder’s fee’ following his Lyndhurst Road purchase. The tax tribunal, which confirmed the purchase had gone through, revealed that Goncharenko was ‘very annoyed’ after being gazumped on another prime London property. When he was told the Lyndhurst Road property was available, later that night he drove past and offered to buy it for £43million, according to tribunal papers. The tribunal heard this was an astonishing offer, ‘considerably in excess of the value of the property’. With two swimming pools, the double-fronted house boasts seven bedrooms and has been refurbished to the tune of around £10million. Bought by Goncharenko in 2011 for £41million, it has recently been put back on the market for £46.5million. In 2012, he bought a £460,000 painting of Russian model Natalia Vodianova but has yet to settle the bill . Equally extraordinary are his grandiose plans for Hanover Lodge. Lord Bagri bought a 150-year lease on the property, built in 1827, from the Crown Estate for £5.9million in 1994 and hired Quinlan Terry, the favourite architect of the Prince of Wales, to transform it into a palatial home. Goncharenko wants to substantially expand the property, increasing the size of its underground swimming pool, as well as adding a spa, with steam room, sauna, water jets, massage room, gym and yoga room, and a private cinema. Goncharenko also has expensive plans for 50 St James Street. The building was originally run by fishmonger’s son William Cockford, whose head for figures was matched only by his capacity to fleece the aristocracy. He ran it as the Crockford’s club and gambling den for 40 years – it is even rumoured to have an escape tunnel. The grand house then became the louche Devonshire Club for 108 years, until it closed in 1976. It subsequently operated as a casino, before closing in 2009. Until recently, there were plans for 50 St James Street to revert to its origins as a gentlemen’s members’ club, replete with a spa, 14-bedroom hotel, and two restaurants. Goncharenko’s origins remain cloaked in mystery but he is understood until recently to have been a senior executive of Gazprom Invest Yug, an offshoot of the controversial Russian oil and gas giant Gazprom. Lawyers for Goncharenko said he stepped down in 2013. Respected Moscow business newspaper Kommersant said that Andrey, along with his father Nikolay, owned 83 per cent of a firm called Plamya. Plamya was involved in the building of a huge £1.5billion trading and exhibition centre, Lotus-City, on the outskirts of Moscow, which sold last year for an undisclosed sum, according to the newspaper. A source told The Mail on Sunday that the deal is likely to have taken the Goncharenkos into the financial big league. Lawyers for Mr Goncharenko said he had made his money through property development, road haulage and forestry, and had made ‘significant profit’ in the 1990s.

"Paul Hollywood now has a glittering TV career, but ten years ago, he couldn't afford to pay his creditors . Television breadmaker Paul Hollywood has a half-baked sense for business, according to a string of unhappy creditors left out of pocket after his first bread company went bust. Liverpool-born Hollywood – star of The Great British Bake Off – set up his company in 1999 after leaving luxury hotel Cliveden, where his skills and charm had won him plaudits  and media attention. But Hollywood Bread got into financial difficulties within two years. Liquidators were appointed in April 2003 and the company had debts of £262,000 when it was dissolved in December 2005. One of the companies his firm owed money to was Bradleys bakers, of Ashford in Kent, which had to write off £2,400. Managing director Graham Linkins said: ‘In all the coverage I’ve seen about Paul Hollywood, I’ve never read that ten years ago he had a business that went bust. ‘About three years ago, I walked into my front room and saw him on the TV and said, “That b*****d owes me money.” ‘He is not particularly revered within the industry, despite his celebrity.’ Steve Foster, former head baker at Hollywood Bread, said: ‘He was a very good, fun-loving character and we got on well, but when his TV career took off that took him away from the business more than it should have. ‘I have not kept in contact with him because of the money issue. I was owed £800. After a while,  I gave up trying to recover the money because I was not getting anywhere with him.’ And former shop manager Gordon Kolb said: ‘The irony was that the business finally crashed on April Fools’ Day, which now seems pretty funny really. But at the time losing out on £1,100 wages was not funny. ‘I have asked him for the money since but he just told me I had to speak to the liquidators.’ Since separating from wife Alex, 49, two months ago after falling for a fellow presenter on the US version of the TV show, Hollywood, 46, has been staying in a converted potting shed in Ickham, Kent. Hollywood presents the Great British Bake Off with Mary Berry (pictured). His creditors said they couldn't believe it when they saw the man who owed them money, on TV . The baker has branched out to present the American version of the beloved show. He is said to be romantically involved with his co-star  Marcela Valladolid (left) And despite buying a £135,000 Aston Martin DB9 last month, Hollywood doesn’t own the £800,000 house where Alex and their son Josh, 11, live. He sold it to a financier in 2006, shortly before setting up his current firm the Paul Hollywood Artisan Bread Company. A spokesman for Paul Hollywood said: ‘I can confirm that in 2003, in common with many businesses, Hollywood Bread went into voluntary liquidation. 'The majority of creditors were compensated. ‘This was not due to neglect – Paul had little TV work at that time – but rather the economic climate and a change in the circumstances surrounding the location of the site involved.’","Great British Bake Off star liquidated Hollywood Bread in 2003 .

"Known as a master of the occult, Dennis Wheatley became one of the world’s most successful authors by injecting his thrillers with a strong dose of the macabre. Now he has been unmasked as a real ‘spook’ whom the secret services commissioned to write an anti-communist novel aimed at Arab readers. He was paid in cash for Of Vice And Virtue, published in English and Arabic at the height of the Cold War by a government keen to resist communism in the Middle East. Agenda: Dennis Wheatley has been unmasked as a real 'spook' whom the secret services commissioned to write an anti-communist novel aimed at Arab readers . And he was so worried he would be mugged when he left the Foreign Office he had the banknotes sewn into his suit. Wheatley enthusiast Charles Beck, who owns the only known English and Arab versions of the 1950 book, said: ‘Logic dictates that this may well have been MI6. Eastern Intrigue: The Arabic version of Wheatley's Of Vice and Virtue, which was published at the height of the Cold War . 'I found it extraordinary that our Government was promoting Islam to counter communism back in the 1950s.’ The plot centres on a Russian diplomat who tries to defile a young Arab girl. After killing him, she is charged with murder. But she is cleared by a magistrate who cites a verse from the Koran that says ‘every woman has the right to defend her honour by any means’. Mr Beck tracked down the English typescript last November when Wheatley’s own collection of his works came up for auction. A couple of months later, he obtained . the only known Arab edition. It had been in the possession of members of . Wheatley’s family, who had extensive links with MI5. Wheatley, who died in 1977 aged 80, was a prolific author. His Gregory Sallust series was one of the main inspirations for Ian Fleming’s James Bond. Bloomsbury Reader is to republish all of Wheatley’s works, many out of print for years.","Author was commissioned to write anti-communist novel Of Vice And Virtue .

"Pippa Mann can remember exactly what passed through her mind when her racing car somersaulted into the air at almost 200mph in Las Vegas. In the split-second before landing, recalling what she had been taught about surviving crashes, she took her hands off the steering wheel, closed her eyes and forced her body to relax. Even by the high-risk standards of racing, it was a horrifying accident – a 15-car chain collision last October that caused the death of Pippa’s closest friend in racing, Briton Dan Wheldon. Pippa, Britain’s most successful female driver, was in one of those 15 cars and suffered catastrophic injuries when she was enveloped in the ensuing fireball. Survivor: A year after the crash and Pippa Mann is recovering . The accident could easily have taken the life of the pretty 29-year-old, whose car was sent hurtling into the air, caught fire and landed upside down. But it is not in her nature to dwell on what might have been. The first British woman to qualify for the world-famous IndyCar racing series – the American rival to  Formula 1 – Pippa is used to putting emotion to one side and assessing every situation coolly. A year after the crash, she is recovering and resuming her racing career, as well as looking forward to her  wedding in December. But the death of Wheldon affected her deeply. ‘Dan was a team-mate and a great guy,’ she says. ‘Losing a friend was a big shock and it was very difficult to deal with, something separate from my crash strangely enough. Dan will be missed. His death affected everyone.’ Still, the tragedy has not diverted Pippa from her passion. ‘You couldn’t do it if you were scared of crashing. It’s racing and you are going to come together with other cars, and sometimes it’s going to go wrong. It’s a part of it,’ she says. She vividly remembers every detail of the crash on the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Her remarkable reactions were those of someone who lives with danger on a daily basis. ‘I pulled my hands off the steering wheel because otherwise at that speed you will break your arms, and I thrust them back to my belts on my chest. Fatal: The crash that killed Mann's best friend Dan Wheldon . ‘Although the hand was covered with a fire-proof glove, the fireball that came into the car while I was upside down had a blow-torch effect on one small area of my right hand. After the car stopped, I could not open my eyes because they were closed by the debris that had come in while I was upside down, and I could not undo the belt because of the pain in my hands. I just waited for the medical team.’ The burns to her little finger were so severe that most of the soft tissue was dead and surgeons were forced to cut away the flesh before they could begin the task of rebuilding her hand. In the space of just over a week, Pippa had three operations. At that stage, she had little idea of the extent of her injuries. ‘It didn’t sink in until I came out of the third surgery,’ she says. ‘I was in so much pain that they put me on horse tranquillisers.’ That final bout involved removing a tendon from her right forearm, blood vessels and skin from close to her right elbow, and a nerve from the ring finger on her right hand. Pippa says: ‘You get used to injuries. I have had a broken hand before – you have surgery, then therapy and three weeks later you are back in the car. It hurts, but is no big deal. It goes with the territory. 'But with this injury, I could barely move my hand. I never doubted my future, though.’ From the moment she stepped into a racing kart aged 12, Pippa – who is only 5ft 5in – has broken through both gender and pain barriers to pursue her career. Taken as a child to watch a Formula 1 race at Silverstone by her father Clive, she was bitten by the racing bug and by the age of 14 was taking part  in national karting championships. However, Pippa found that her arrival was not welcomed by all of her fellow – male – competitors. ‘I realised that the bumpers on karts were not just there for safety,’ she laughs. ‘They were also used by my competitors to let me know they were there and what they thought about me racing. Tragic: Dan Wheldon is pictured here holding son Sebastian alongside wife Susie holding Oliver, with the Borg Warner Trophy . ‘I returned the favour and so created space around me. I had to develop a thicker skin. It is not the size of the person in the fight that matters, but the size of the fight in the person.’ A lone female in her age group, Pippa learned swiftly that a minority of male drivers would never afford her the respect she warranted. ‘Any female racing driver will tell you if you drive hard, fair and well you will get respect from 95 per cent of your competitors but there will always be those exceptions. ‘You think, “Oh dear, here we go again.” These drivers will put you into the pit wall, so you just have to drive faster than them so that they cannot catch you.’ Pippa left Britain for Italy at 17 to pursue a career in professional karting. After three years, she returned to Britain to switch to racing cars before moving to the United States in 2009. A year later, she became the first woman to take pole position in a race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and won her first race in Kentucky. Last year, Pippa stepped up to the higher-ranked IndyCar Series and took part in the prestigious 2011 Indianapolis 500, which was won by Wheldon. The accident that claimed his life occurred five months later during the Las Vegas Indy 300.Pippa blames advances in technology for the crash because it encourages teams, drivers and officials to overlook the dangers of driving too fast, too close. She says: ‘It was not because someone did something stupid but because circumstances came together and fate decided to remind us that racing is dangerous.’ Recovering has been a slow process. When Pippa first returned to the gym after Christmas, she says her forearm was ‘deathly weak’. It took until the summer to build the strength back up. During her long recovery she also discovered that her funding had dried up. To stay involved in racing, she started hosting racing tours, mentoring aspiring female drivers and doing some radio commentary on races. But last month Pippa was back in the driving seat for the first time since the accident when she was given a ride in the Auto GP World Series. Nobody would blame her for being scared but she insists: ‘There was no anxiety. That was the longest break I have had from driving and it was driving me potty. ‘The hand is not a problem at all – it just does not look pretty. It functions, but no one will be asking me to do hand-modelling in the future.’ Pippa is also busy planning her wedding to her fiance, American race engineer Robert Gue. The pair met in 2009 at a racing function and are marrying in Indianapolis, where they live, in December. ‘I had to break my own rule, which was never to go out with someone from the  racing paddock. ‘Every female racing driver will tell you that the paddock is like high school – nobody has got anything better to do than talk about whom they are dating. ‘If you want to be taken seriously you try to steer clear of all that stuff as much as you can. Dating someone in racing will probably see you lose a bit of respect.’ Despite her protestations, she is immensely grateful to Robert for his support over the past year. ‘Having a stable relationship has helped me come through what has been a really difficult time,’ she admits. Pippa is determined to get back into IndyCar racing, but for now Formula 1 is off the agenda, not least because she believes the barriers for female racing drivers remain higher in Europe than in the US. She says: ‘In IndyCar, there have been successful female drivers and that paves the way for others. I am starting to see it change in Europe. It looks like it is a little bit better for female drivers, but there’s still a long way to go.’ And Pippa remains philosophical about the risks. ‘Motor racing is dangerous and things can go wrong. But it’s the same as life – you can get knocked down stepping into the street.’","Pippa Mann, the first woman to qualify for the world-famous IndyCar racing series, suffered catastrophic injuries .

"At time it might have seemed something of a gamble. But an unknown bookie ended up with a £100 million art collection after agreeing to be painted by artist Lucian Freud as payment for debts from betting. When he died, Alfie McLean is said to have owned 23 Freud canvasses and several more by fellow artist and Soho denizen Francis Bacon – who had also become a close friend and client of the bookie through his  gambling habits. Over a period of 40 years, Freud painted about 20 portraits of McLean and his family. Favourite: The Lucian Freud painting is of Alfie McLean's two son's Sam and Paul which Mr McLean's wife Wilma lists as her favourite painting by the artist . Mr McLean began life as a trainer and small-time bookie on Northern Ireland's greyhound tracks and built up his businesses to include a chain of bookmakers' shops. He first met Freud about 40 years ago at a racecourse after striking  up a conversation about vintage Bentley cars. Freud – who died last year and left £96 million in his will – had a lifelong fascination with horses and soon opened an account with his new bookmaking friend and began to run up losses. The first portraits of Mr McLean – known to Freud as 'The Big Man' – were painted in exchange for the bookie writing off gambling debts of just a few thousand pounds. Alfie was discreet about his friendship with the great painter, except for giving one of his racehorses the cheeky name of Freud Bacon . But the two men's friendship seemed not to have been affected by their financial dealings – Freud was fascinated by Mr McLean and was often his guest at race meetings and sporting occasions such as Ulsterman Barry McGuigan's world title fights in the Eighties. In return, McLean was discreet about his friendship with the great painter, except for giving one of his racehorses the cheeky name of Freud Bacon. Mr McLean's widow, Wilma, said: 'My husband was very interested  in Lucian and his art. They became very good friends. I met Lucian three times in London. He never came over here. He was a nice man and painted my sons Sam and Paul.' Freud preserved the sons' anonymity by simply calling the 2001 picture The Two Brothers From Ulster. Mr McLean died aged 77 in 2006 and left £118 million in his will. But  it is not thought to contain the bulk of his extraordinary art collection, believed to be worth about £100 million, as he gave it to his children before his death. Mrs McLean said: 'I do love art but I don't own the paintings any longer. 'The collection is all gone. They all belong to the children now. That was what Alfie wanted and they would have inherited them anyway. 'I believe they are kept in safe storage now but I do not go into that. I do not really see the pictures. The collection is for the younger ones and I have not seen them in a few years. I gave them the pictures before my husband died. 'There were around 20 of them. I think . my favourite one was with my husband and my eldest son Paul. Paul had . his hand on Alfie's shoulder. Unlikely muse: At the time it might have seemed something of a gamble. But Alfie McLean ended up with a £100¿million art collection after agreeing to be painted by artist Lucian Freud as payment for debts from betting . Popular: Artist Lucian Freud who ended up painting a total of 23 paintings for bookie Alfie McLean as payment for gambling debts . 'It was painted in Lucian's studio about 30 years ago. He did not offer to paint me, which was a relief. I was hoping he wouldn't. Alfie quite enjoyed posing for the paintings. The two of them got on pretty well.' Freud began painting his bookie after he signed up with New York art dealer William Acquavella in 1992 – and immediately confided in him that he had a problem. Acquavella said: 'When I took him on, he said to me, “I've got a bookie – and I've got a bill with him.” 'So I had dinner with Alfie and I said, “Alfie, what does he owe you?” He says, “£2.7 million.” I said, . “OK, thanks.” We had to work this out.' The bookie's children all still live  in Ballymena, County Antrim, where Mr McLean was raised. Sam and Paul, who runs the family bookmakers, live within yards of each other in comparatively modest homes – although Sam's generous driveway now boasts a brand new Maserati, a rare Mercedes sports car, a Mercedes SUV and another people carrier. Their sister Catherine also lives in Ballymena, but in a flat close to the town centre. A local source, who has met both Freud and Mr McLean but did not want to be named, said: 'I believe Alfie and Lucian Freud were both members of a Bentley owners' club and met at some outing in England a long time ago. 'Lucian, who was a fanatical gambler, then pricked up his ears when he realised this man was a bookmaker from Ballymena and started betting with McLean.' A friend added: 'Freud ran up  massive debts, but apparently found Alfie McLean an irresistibly huge and ugly man. 'Freud painted people as he saw them, and that was not necessarily in a flattering light. 'Lucian introduced him to Francis Bacon, who was also a gambler.'","Alfie McLean was given paintings by Freud as payment for gambling debts .

"The time is 8.30am and I'm crouching under the hand-dryers in the ladies' loo at Waterloo Station frantically trying to dry my hair. I've got a meeting in 15 minutes and for the third time this week I've left the house with my hair soaking wet, plastered to my face and dripping down my neck. In my quest for long hair, there is no indignity I will not endure. The manufacturers of a new shampoo and conditioner, Fortified Amino Scalp Therapy (Fast), make the quite extraordinary claim that if you use it every single day, it can boost the rate of hair growth by up to 99 per cent in a month. Scroll down for video . The manufacturers of a new shampoo and conditioner, Fortified Amino Scalp Therapy (Fast), make the quite extraordinary claim that if you use it every single day, it can boost the rate of hair growth by up to 99 per cent in a month, Frances tried it out and here are the results from before (left) and after (right) For a working mum whose usual haircare routine is a twice-weekly wash and blow-dry at home, committing to a daily shampoo is daunting, and I'm finding it hard to fit it into my morning schedule. But I am desperate. My short hair makes me feel dowdy and middle-aged. I yearn for swathes of long, glossy, glamorous hair. The really awful thing is that I had gorgeous long hair until I lopped it off last April — a mistake I've regretted ever since. I ended up looking like a giant earbud. I'd worn my hair long for almost 20 years and when I hit 45, I decided it was time for a radical change: either get a toyboy or cut my hair short. Sadly, the hair went — in a misguided belief that eight inches off my locks would cut ten years off my face. The world's most desirable women all have luscious locks, like Angelina Jolie's . For a while, I tried to convince myself I liked it. My female friends thought I looked sassy with short hair. But men hated it. One pal, Jacob, didn't mince his words. 'It's the sort of cut a middle-aged woman gets when she can't be bothered any more,' he said. Brutal, but it summed up what most chaps thought. 'Men like long hair because they think it's feminine,' says Philip Kingsley, an internationally renowned trichologist with clinics in London and New York. You only have to look at the women the world's most eligible bachelors choose to marry to see that he has a point. Kate Middleton, Angelina Jolie and Amal Alamuddin all have beautiful, long thick hair. So, Fast shampoo and conditioner and its promise of turbo-charged hair growth seemed the answer to my dreams. Most people's hair, grows an average of 1 cm to 1.3 cm per month, says Philip Kingsley. Nisim International, the Canadian company that makes Fast, claims it can accelerate growth by using a blend of amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — and essential vitamins. This super-nourishing concoction works by feeding hair at its root and stimulating the scalp — a body-building blast of nutrients for hair. In clinical trials of (an admittedly paltry) 20 volunteers, the average rate of hair growth was 30 per cent faster than normal — though some saw growth 99 per cent faster than usual. John Nikolaou, founder of Nisim, points out that the shampoo won't create new hair growth, just encourage existing hair to grow faster. But those in the business are sceptical. My hairdresser Sally guffawed when I told her about Fast promising to double the rate of my hair growth in a month. 'Does it lift your face at the same time?' she chortled. Philip Kingsley is also dubious. While agreeing that particular proteins and minerals in diet play an important role in healthy hair, he thinks it's highly unlikely that a topically applied shampoo will make hair grow faster. You only have to look at the women the world's most eligible bachelors choose to marry to see that he has a point. Kate Middleton, left and Amal Alamuddin, right, have beautiful, long thick hair . So I decided to put Fast shampoo and conditioner to the test. First, I measured my hair. Taking measurements from five different places: front, back, left and right sides, and crown. I then averaged out the result. At the start of August, I had a starting length of 23.5cm. I also measured the rate of growth following my usual twice-weekly washing regime with my normal shampoo and conditioner. At the start of September my hair measured 24.4cm: a monthly growth of 9mm, slightly slower than average. Could Fast do better? WEEK ONE . Expert Phillip Kingsley says 'Men like long hair because they think it's feminine' At £30 for a pack with 300ml of shampoo and 300ml of conditioner, Fast is more than double what I normally spend on my Charles Worthington shampoo and conditioner — £6 each for 250ml. The shampoo is a thicker texture and harder to lather. As per the instructions, I apply it twice, each time massaging it into my scalp. After rinsing, my hair feels brittle and sticky but the conditioner certainly helps soften it. Altogether, the new routine takes an extra ten minutes each day. I'm worried that washing my hair every day will dry it out, or worse, make it fall out. But Dr Hugh Rushton, a Harley Street trichologist, tells me not only is it OK to wash my hair every day, it's what I should be doing. 'Do you wash your face twice a week?' he asks. After a few days, I realise why I don't wash my hair every day. Unlike my hair, my face doesn't rearrange itself into frizzy spikes post wash — and shampooing in the mornings is a logistical nightmare. I end up drying my hair in public toilets and giving my eight-year-old daughter a Dairy Milk bar for breakfast two days in a row because of the extra time I take every morning. But, by day six, I think I can see some growth. 'Do you think my hair looks longer?' I ask Jacob. 'No,' he says bluntly. WEEK TWO . Realising I just don't have enough time to wash my hair each morning, I start doing it in the evenings instead. But at the end of the day all I want to do is slump in front of my Breaking Bad box set with a glass or two of wine. Instead, I find myself hogging the bathroom. On the plus side, my wine consumption is down, and running straighteners through my hair, I'm convinced more ends flick up — surely a sign it's growing? And washing it every day has made it beautifully soft. It's in better condition than it has been for years. WEEK THREE . Getting my roots done, Sally tries to persuade me to have a couple of centimetres snipped off. 'You need a trim. It's getting quite long,' she says. Fast, claims it can accelerate growth by using a blend of amino acids — the building blocks of proteins — and essential vitamins . I feel like kissing her. There's no doubt — my hair is no longer short. It isn't long either. But it's getting there. I swear I'll never hack my hair off again. I know how Samson felt. It's probably worse for me than it was for him: he just lost his strength, I lost my femininity. WEEK FOUR . When I measure my hair in the same places I'm delighted to find my locks now average out at 25.6 cm, an increase of 1.2 cm. That's 3 mm (or 33 per cent) more than it grew last month. It looks like using Fast has made it grow faster. But is it really possible that the ingredients in the shampoo encouraged my hair to grow? Trichologists are unconvinced. Philip Kingsley speculates that rather than the specific ingredients it's the massaging 14 times a week that made the slight difference, as it would have increased blood flow to the hair follicles. Stephen Carson, a London-based trichologist, says it's more likely that conditioning my hair every day for a month is responsible for the growth. 'There are highly protective substances in conditioners that cling to your hair and prevent ends from splitting off, making it seem as though your hair has grown faster,' he explains. Most good conditioners contain protective ingredients and it isn't necessary to use a super-expensive brand for stronger, longer hair, he says. Whatever the reason, I'm delighted. Shampooing every day is laborious, but the joy of running a comb through hair that ends below my neck is immense. I feel feminine again. I'll carry on using Fast (the pack lasted just over a month) because it seems to work. A bad hair day is wretched - a bad hair year doesn't bear thinking about.","New shampoo and conditioner, Fortified Amino Scalp Therapy (Fast)

"Mae-up is my area of expertise. I’ve always known what shade of lipstick flatters my pout (scarlet), which colour eyeliner brings out my eyes (inky black) and where to smooth on blusher to fake sharp cheekbones (the apples of my cheeks). Or so I thought. At 45, my bag of tricks is no longer working. Catching a glimpse of myself made-up sometimes makes me feel queasy. I worry that my beauty habits are making me look older but I’m so stuck in a make-up rut, I don’t know what to do. Top make-up artist Sandy Linter, author of The Makeup Wakeup: Revitalising Your Look At Any Age, is not surprised. ‘Using the same make-up in later life that you did in your 20s ages you considerably, as your skin-tone and face-shape dramatically change with age.’ So can ‘anti-ageing’ make-up take years off me? See how the experts’ tips worked… . Scroll down for video . Frances, pictured left after her anti-ageing makeover, and, right, wearing the makeup that makes her look 10 years older . Dig out your eyelash curlers and brushes. ‘As you age, eyelashes become shorter and sparse, so curlers and brushes that make lashes look longer are important,’ says Sandy. Wear black, not brown mascara as it makes the whites of your eyes — which often discolour with age — look clearer and brighter. But avoid thickening formulas because lashes dry out as you age, making mascara likely to clump, flake off and settle in the fine lines beneath your eyes. Mascara on the lower lashes is also a faux pas as it draws attention to any dark circles. Stick to upper lids and apply more thickly to the outer corners, where eyes tend to droop. WRONG: Thick black lines don't do any woman over 35 any favours as it makes eyes that are already getting smaller with age look even tinier . You may have been using your old favourite black kohl for years,  but sadly it’s got to go. Thick black lines don’t do any woman over 35 any favours as it makes eyes that are already getting smaller with age look even tinier. And the rock-chick look is too harsh for ageing skin tones, so switch to brown or charcoal-grey.‘Avoid using liquid liner above your eyes too,’ says celebrity make-up artist Oonagh Connor. ‘It just draws attention to fine lines and will sink into your wrinkles.’ Instead, get a thick, creamy crayon liner (Charlotte Tilbury does a nice range starting at £19, charlottetilbury.com) and smudge it gently under the outer third of your eye. Don’t do a harsh line  corner to corner — use a brush to smudge and blend the crayon for a softer, younger look. You need concealer to hide dark circles, which get more pronounced with age as skin thins. But caking on powder or using flaky sticks will only highlight your grooves. Keep concealer light, and opt for liquid or cream textures applied with a brush. And remember, the most popular brands aren’t necessarily the best. YSL Touche Eclat is the world’s top-selling concealer but Oonagh says it doesn’t work well on older skin. ‘It’s too pink, and looks obvious on pronounced eyebags,’ she explains. She recommends the more subtle Benefit Boi–ing (£17.50, Boots), which comes in five shades. Ditch reds, maroons and bright pinks. As you age, your complexion naturally reddens thanks to thinning skin — and bright blushers only serve to emphasise this. Try subtle shades such as peaches or corals. Bobbi Brown Nude Peach Brightening Powder, £40, has a nice sheen and doesn’t dull the skin. ‘You must also stop smiling as you apply blusher,’ says Oonagh. ‘The blusher will collect in the creases and highlight wrinkles.’ Even more surprising is Oonagh’s advice not to apply blusher on the apples of your cheeks. ‘Cheeks sag as you get older, and the apples will be lower and highlight the droop. ‘Instead, apply it on the highest point of your cheekbone with quick upward strokes.’ RIGHT: Getting your brows right can knock years off your face . Get your eyebrows right and you can knock years off your face. As . we age, our brows become more sparse and can go grey, so use a pencil . that’s a shade or two darker than your hair colour and carefully fill in . your brows. Never use mascara on them as it is too harsh, says Sandy . Linter. ‘Also, dab some highlighter under your arch to open up your . eyes,’ she adds. Grooming will make all the difference — professional threading is best. Don’t be tempted to skip powder. As you age and approach the menopause, the oiliness on your chin, nose and forehead increases. Powder applied sparingly to these areas will reduce the oily shine. Too heavy and you risk the dreaded death-mask look. Oonagh recommends a light, brightening powder that has luminescent particles to brighten up your skin, such as Korres Wild Rose Compact Powder (£21, bathandunwind.com). Her last two tips: avoid dabbing powder under your eyes, as it will seep into the fine lines and emphasise them; and don’t go for pink undertones as they’ll wash you out. WRONG: Lips, like so much else, droop as we get older, so don't apply gloss right to the corners as this will only emphasise the sag . Scarlet, dark or metallic lipsticks look wonderful on 20-somethings, but as we age, they’re out. Lips get thinner — and dark tones act as an optical illusion to make your mouth look smaller. Instead, go for peachy, pinky tones and consider dumping your lipsticks altogether in favour of lip gloss for a softer look. ‘Dab a bit of extra gloss in the Cupid’s bow to define the lip, and apply with a brush from the centre outwards,’ says Oonagh. Lips, like so much else, droop as we get older, so don’t apply gloss right to the corners as this will only emphasise the sag. It’s also worth buying a high-tech lip plumper. These are made with a mild irritant, such as chilli extract, which causes the lips to swell just enough to give you a hint of a pout. Try Soap and Glory’s Gloss Stick (£9, Boots) or Champneys Plumping Lip Gloss (£8). As you age, you need foundation more than ever to cover discolouration and redness. But a thick liquid or wax formula will sink into lines and emphasise them. Instead pick mousse foundations or tinted moisturisers. The new generation of BB and CC creams are perfect, says Oonagh, adding: ‘Less is definitely more.’ She recommends La Roche Posay CC cream (£16.99, Boots). Use the same shade or one shade darker than your natural skin tone. RIGHT: Trace your natural lip line with  a neutral shade as this will enhance the shape and definition . Your lip-line can fade as you age, making lipstick more prone to bleeding or feathering. ‘Using lip-liner can help it stay put, but ignore the usual advice to go a shade darker than your natural lip colour,’ says Oonagh. Instead, trace your natural lip line with  a neutral shade as this will enhance the shape and definition. Again, dump deep reds and other dark colours . — they’ll only accentuate the lines above the mouth.","As women grow older, they must change their make-up routine .

"The best tressed: Advice from celebrity hairstylists could mean you will look like Kate Beckinsale . Most of the time, we don’t give it a second thought. It’s our hair that we notice, that bothers and perplexes us. Our scalp? Well, it’s just... there. But as hairdressers and trichologists – trained specialists who deal with hair problems – point out, the health of the scalp is fundamental to the look, feel and even the quantity of our hair. Celebrity hairdresser Julien Farel (whose salons are responsible for the tumbling tresses of A-listers Kate Moss, Rachel Weisz and Kate Beckinsale) feels strongly about this: ‘In the same way that grass can’t grow in sand, hair can’t grow in an unhealthy scalp,’ he says. So how can you keep yours in optimum condition? The answer is to tend to it as assiduously as we do the skin on our faces. The age-old problem . Scalp – and therefore hair – problems become more apparent as we get older. Farel explains: ‘As we age, our hair ages, too. With each passing year, our scalp and hair become more dehydrated while follicles become weaker. This leads to dryness, dullness, breakage and thinning.’ Dr Jeni Thomas, Principal Scientist for P&G (Procter & Gamble) Beauty, where for the past eight years she has focused her research on hair and scalp health, says: ‘At some point in their adult life, 50 per cent of adults will experience some form of scalp concern.’ ‘A healthy scalp should look similar to healthy skin; flake-free, blemish-free, not overly oily and without redness or irritation,’ says leading trichologist Philip Kingsley. ‘Most people know if their scalp is unhealthy as it will be itchy, irritated and perhaps red, scaly or overly greasy, or both. You may also find small, raised pimples on the scalp.’ Don’t be a flake . Kingsley continues: ‘Research shows that a flaky or itchy scalp can trigger or worsen hair shedding in both men and women. Simply not washing your scalp regularly enough can allow for the build-up of flakes and an imbalance of micro-organisms – both of which can worsen, or trigger, hair loss. More severe scalp conditions, left untreated, such as psoriasis and seborrhoeic dermatitis, can lead to hair breakage and secondary infection from scratching. Get your head examined . If you think you might have a problem, a knowledgeable hairdresser can give you a first opinion. Many salons that stock Phyto, a specialist hair care range, have specialised magnifying cameras (see phyto-haircare.co.uk for your nearest one). Any diseases can be identified and treatment suggested. Cleanse and moisturise . It’s the skincare mantra most of us apply to a regular face regime – but should also be used for our scalp. Firstly, take a look at what you’re washing your hair in: most shampoos contain foaming sulphate-based ingredients (commonly sodium lauryl sulphate, or SLS) which remove oil from the hair – but also from the scalp, which can end up dry and inflamed. Look for shampoos free from SLS, such as Pureology (£11; pureology-uk.com) or branch out and try one of the many new ‘Conditioning Cleansers’ in the shops. As the brand Grow Gorgeous puts it, ‘smart girls don’t strip’, a reference to the way its conditioner (£17.99 at Boots) will get your hair and scalp clean without stripping out all the oil from it. Julien Farel Anti-Ageing Haircare Hydrate Restore (£28, Selfridges.com) claims to hydrate and nourish rather like a face moisturiser. For a more budget-conscious option try Palmer’s Olive Oil Formula Cleansing Conditioner, which costs £5.99 for a big bottle at feelunique.com or Macadamia Oil Flawless (£8.75, lookfantastic.com). Exfoliate, exfoliate... Quality name: Luxury brand Kerastase offers a range of hair 'Rituals': treatments designed to nurture the hair and scalp, from £15 . In the same way that we exfoliate our faces to get rid of dead cells that clutter up the surface and make skin look dull, it’s a great idea to exfoliate your scalp. At home, try a product such as Alterna Caviar Exfoliating Scalp Facial, £32 (01925 578000 for stockists) which you use before your normal shampoo to decongest your scalp (it’s gentle, so good even for sensitive-skinned scalps) or Philip Kingsley Exfoliating Scalp Mask, £16, www.philipkingsley.co.uk). Try a hydrating ritual . Intensive hydrating treatments to cosset and soothe the scalp are increasingly popular. Luxury brand Kerastase offers a range of hair ‘Rituals’: treatments designed to nurture the hair and scalp, from £15 (kerastase.co.uk). At the Aveda Institute in Covent Garden, the Botanical Hair and Scalp Treatment (£60) combines massage with aromatherapy essential oils (avedainstitute.co.uk). In salons such as Michaeljohn, the popular celeb-hairdresser in London’s West End (michaeljohn.co.uk), you can try a Nioxin Scalp Dermabrasion service  (from £15). It is designed to regenerate the scalp skin surface and reduce hair-loss. The treatment removes excess oil that builds up around the hair follicle, helping to restore the scalp to its optimum condition. Pick up a tonic . There is an array of scalp tonics on chemist shelves now. Choose one backed by clinical trials. Growth Factor Treatment Serum from  Nanogen (£29.95, nanogen.co.uk) is popular with dermatologists and hair-transplant surgeons. Another top-notch option is the new Tricho 7 Daily Scalp Drops in Philip  Kingsley’s Trichotherapy® kit (from £50 for the drops, £95 for the whole kit, philipkingsley.co.uk) which  support hair health and growth via the scalp. Blitz the dandruff . Dandruff is the fault of a tiny organism called malassezia globosa, which we all have on our scalps and which feeds on sebum, the oil produced by our hair follicles – though we’re not all sensitive to it. If you are sensitive to malassezia, your scalp becomes irritated and sheds skin faster than it should – seen as dandruff. A shampoo  containing zinc pyrithione (ZPT), such as Head & Shoulders, will do the trick nicely, which is why this is the top-selling shampoo around the world. Phyto produces the ‘decongesting’ Phytopolleine – a bracing mix of essential oils, £24.50, that will soon get clogged follicles  back to normal. If that doesn’t work, see a specialist. GPs don’t have any training in hair issues, surprisingly, but a trichologist could help you (trichologists.org.uk) as can a dermatologist who specialises in the scalp. Dr David Fenton (drdavidfention.com) or Dr Jennifer Jones and Dr Vicky Joliffe (of londonhairspecialists.com) can help with problematic scalp issues.","A healthy scalp should look similar to healthy skin, hairdressers say .

"Colour change: The Duchess last month . During her pregnancy, the Duchess of Cambridge's lovely locks looked their lustrous best. But since she gave birth to Prince George in July, it seems that, like many new mums, Kate's hair has looked rather worse for wear. So, what is it about pregnancy and giving birth that wreaks such havoc on hair? Why is hair less shiny after having a baby? Often, women find their hair looks thicker and shinier during pregnancy but hormonal changes kick in after having a baby, as dermatologist Justine Hextall explains. 'Hair has three phases; growth, resting and shedding,' she says. 'Normally, hair grows at the same rate that it falls out. But under the influence of pregnancy hormones, more hairs remain in the growing phase, particularly during the second and third trimester, which is why women often notice hair becoming thicker as their pregnancy goes on. 'Usually, losing your hair after birth is just your hair going back to normal.' Will the frizz last  for ever? 'Pregnancy is thought to be a terrific time for hair,' says trichologist Philip Kingsley. 'But that's not true for everyone. Hair is likely to become progressively drier during pregnancy as hormones reduce the amount of oil your sebaceous glands produce.' As your hormones return to normal, this dry frizz should subside. In the meantime, use anti-frizz products which boost levels of oil and moisture, such as DGI Organics' Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner (£5.99 each, Waitrose). Even fine hair can benefit from a light oil. Try Alterna's Kendi Dry Oil Micromist (£21.95, alternahaircare.com), which can be sprayed onto dry or damp hair. Can a special diet  help hair recover? 'Just choose healthy foods,' says Kingsley. 'And make sure that you include protein, which hair needs in order to grow, in every meal. 'Your body considers your hair to be non-essential tissue, so it's the last to benefit from good nutrition.' Fertility expert Zita West's range has supplements for different stages of pregnancy and breastfeeding (£25 a month, zitawest.com) or try Pregnacare Breastfeeding supplements (£15.25 for a month's supply, boots.com). Spatone iron sachets (£8.25 for 28, at Boots) are a good way to top up low iron levels, which can result from blood loss during birth and can lead to hair loss. Trevor Sorbie's Volume Big Hair Powder . Burt's Bees Very Volumizing Pomegranate Shampoo . Pregnacare Max . How can I give thin hair more oomph? A clip-in hairpiece or ponytail (Hersheson's Invisible Ponytail, £60, hershesons.com) gives instant volume, or rub Trevor Sorbie's new Volume Big Hair Powder (£6.29, trevorsorbie.com) - which contains particles that puff up as they emerge from their container - into your roots. There are many volume-boosting shampoos on the market, such as Burt's Bees Very Volumizing Pomegranate Shampoo, (£9.99, burtsbees.co.uk), but Nanogen gets rave reviews from new mums. Its thickening shampoo, conditioner and Growth Factor Treatment Serum (£29.95 at Boots or nanogen.co.uk) contain patented ingredients that copy your body's natural hair-growth signals, providing extra support  for post-pregnancy hair. Should new mums dye their hair? It looks as if Kate has given up colouring her hair for the time being - possibly because there's still some controversy over whether women should dye hair while pregnant or breastfeeding. NHS guidelines say it's 'very unlikely that a significant amount of the chemicals used in hair dyes will be passed on through your breast milk . . . because very little enters your bloodstream'. If you'd rather wait, try Color Wow (£28.50 at victoriahealth.com) a brush-on, temporary powder for your roots, which comes in a slick compact in shades from platinum blonde to black.

"Merry revellers quickly turned into disgruntled commuters after Sydney's busiest train stations were closed when a fire alarm caused chaos as the night ticked over into 2015. Tens of thousands of punters made their voices heard as they were forced to a complete standstill in the middle of George Street after they couldn't take their journey home via Wynard and Martin Place stations.

"At first glance, you wouldn’t even think it’s a seat. The Limbic, which I’m getting acquainted with in the picture on the right, looks like some fiendish device designed for torture. But this extraordinary item is, in fact, the most elaborate, painstakingly constructed and expensive office chair in the world. It is designed to counteract what is arguably the most common health problem: a bad back. About 7.6 million working days are lost to this complaint annually in Britain. Sitting pretty: Alice Hart-Davis tries out the £8,000 Limbic chair, the latest in ergonomically design, to help with posture . The catch is that the chair costs almost £8,000. Yes, £8,000! So what makes it so special? ‘It allows more freedom of movement than any other chair I’ve ever seen,’ says posture expert Roger Golten, who has brought the Limbic chair to the UK. ‘If you are spending many hours at a desk, it’s the only chair that will actually maintain your health. As you sit in it, you are constantly making micro-movements, which is what you need to do to keep your back healthy. ‘Sitting is one of the biggest problems for modern human health. We have legs, not roots. We were designed to move.’ IT FEELS LIKE FLYING!When you sit on the Limbic, a carbon-fibre shell wraps around each leg. Each shell can pivot independently so, after getting my balance, I found I could stretch, lean and twist forwards, backwards and from side to side. It’s a bit like flying. You also feel like smiling – not an emotion I usually associate with being seated at a desk, especially as I have a dodgy back. By enabling you to move so freely, the chair is said to stimulate the limbic area of the brain – the seat of emotions – and so make you feel happier, too. Happy back: The Limbic chair offers constant micro-movements, which is what you need to do to keep your back healthy . OUT OF THE SADDLEThe root of my back problem lies in a couple of herniated discs near the base of my spine, along with a bunch of muscle imbalances too dull to divulge. Suffice to say the result is that a normal office chair – one that obliges my spine to rest at 90 degrees to my thighs – soon becomes painful to use. I’ve tried all sorts of alternatives. For years I had a ‘kneeling chair’ – a backless contraption that lets you sit with your knees lower than your hips – but I later learned it’s not recommended for all-day use.

I also invested in a Bambach saddle seat, which looks like a saddle on a pole and felt comfortable. Then my physio said that a seat with a back would be kinder to my ageing vertebrae, to give them an occasional rest. But do I really need to invest in the Limbic? STAY ON THE MOVE‘For people who don’t have an injury, there is fairly standard guidance on what is a good sitting posture,’ says Laurence Clift, senior lecturer in ergonomics at the University of Loughborough. ‘That means feet flat on the floor, knees at 90 degrees, a 90-degree bend at the pelvis, and support throughout. ‘But you can’t generalise about people who have an injury as each problem is different, which is why it’s best to get an occupational nurse to inspect your seating and to give advice. ‘Some people stick cushions on to a chair so it feels nice, but the best thing is to get up from your desk regularly and walk about. That will help relieve the pressure on your spine and move fluid around the vertebrae to keep everything working smoothly.’ Osteopath Tim Allardyce is adamant that most of us needn’t break the bank to stave off, or cope with, back pain. ‘It is ridiculous to think you have to spend £8,000 to achieve good posture,’ he says. ‘This chair is designed to keep you mobile but you could get similar benefits from sitting on a Swiss ball or a saddle stool, which separates your legs slightly. Both can be bought for less than £40. ‘Anyone with major back ache should speak to a doctor or osteopath. Ultimately, exercise will mobilise your back and stimulate your limbic system more than any chair – however expensive it is.’ golten.co.uk .","The Limbic chair has a carbon-fibre shell which wraps around each leg .

"A federal judge in Georgia has tossed out race discrimination claims by a former Savannah restaurant manager whose lawsuit against Paula Deen ended up causing the celebrity cook to lose nearly all of her culinary empire. Lisa Jackson sued Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, last year saying she was subjected to sexual harassment and racist attitudes during the five years she worked at their restaurant, Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House. But U.S. District Court Judge William T. Moore Jr. ruled Monday that Jackson, who is white, has no standing to sue them for race discrimination. Groveling: Paula Deen begs the public to forgive her on NBC's Today after revelations stemming from former employee Lisa Jackson's charges of racial discrimination effectively ended the TV chef's career . ‘The Court concludes that Plaintiff is not an aggrieved party under Title VII because her interests are not those arguably sought to be protected by that statue,’ wrote Moore. ‘At best, Plaintiff is an accidental victim of the alleged racial discrimination.  There are no allegations that Defendant Hiers's racially offensive comments were either directed toward Plaintiff or made with the intent to harass her.’ According to TMZ, Jackson tried claiming that she has a biracial person in her family and was thus a victim of Deen's racist remarks. The ruling leaves intact Jackson's sexual harassment claims stemming from her five years as an employee of Uncle Bubba’s and The Lady and Sons in Savannah. Jackson claims Hiers’ and Deen’s conduct—including violent acts, discrimination and racism—led to the end of her employment.Deen responded to the news Monday afternoon, through her lawyers. Family affair: Jackson worked for Deen and her brother Bubba Hiers at their Savannah restaurants. She is suing them both, but it is Deen who has taken the hit. Ironically, a judge threw out the race discrimination charges Monday . ‘We are pleased with the Court's ruling today that Lisa Jackson's claims of race discrimination have been dismissed,’ Deen's representatives told CNN. ‘As Ms. Deen has stated before, she is confident that those who truly know how she lives her life know that she believes in equal opportunity, kindness and fairness for everyone.’ Meanwhile, Deen has lost a slew of major endorsement, book, and television deals since admitting in a deposition to using racist language. Unemployed: Jackson says she lost her job due to Deen and Hiers' conduct. Now Deen is the one out of a job as all her many lucrative endorsement deals have fled the embattled TV chef . The embattled TV chef even lost the gig that made her famous as the Food Network chose not to renew Deen’s contract after 11 years with the cable network. Deen lent her culinary talents to three separate shows. Deen’s 15th cookbook initially shot to the top of Amazon’s pre-order list, but was subsequently cancelled by publisher Ballantine Books. The disgraced chef also lost deals with Smithfield Foods, QVC, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Sears and others.","Lisa Jackson, the white woman who outed Deen for using racially charged language, cannot sue for racial discrimination, judge says .

"There's been a buzz about chia seeds since last year, when they were touted as the latest superfood. The likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and model Miranda Kerr are fans of the South American seeds, which are stuffed full of nutrients and healthy fats. But it seems cold-pressed chia oil is following in the footsteps of other so-called superfoods - almonds, goji berries, acai and even broccoli, which have all found their benefits harnessed in skincare. Chia is now being heralded as the latest 'wonder' ingredient in a raft of new anti-ageing face serums. The oil is one of the richest sources of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr, left, is a believer in chia serums such as Perricone MD's product, right . Although they may seem like a modern foodie fad, these little seeds have a history that dates back centuries. Once worshipped by the Aztecs as the food of the gods, chia comes from the same family as mint and became a staple food in South America where it was as widely cultivated as maize. Omega-3 fatty acids - also found in fish oils and flax seeds - are vital for the skin and help improve the health of the skin barrier, meaning it retains more moisture. Chia provides more omega-3 fatty acids than flax seed, but it doesn't go off as easily. It is also high in antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, so can help protect, calm and rebuild the skin, as well as moisturising it. One indicator that chia, more formally known by its Latin name Salvia hispanica, is about to be big in skincare is the fact U.S. clinical dermatologist Nicholas Perricone has made it the star ingredient of his latest product, Chia Serum (£59.95, perriconemd.co.uk). 'As a dermatologist, I believe essential fatty acids are vitally important to beautiful skin,' says Dr Perricone. 'Chia seeds are one of the richest vegetable sources of essential fatty acids and can keep the skin soft, supple and youthful. Gwyneth Paltrow, left, uses chia serums such as Skin Regimen Hydra-Pro Booster, right . 'Cold-pressed, extra virgin chia oil, especially when combined with fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients, rapidly transforms skin to give  a vibrant, glowing and more healthy complexion.' Ninety per cent of women who took part in a trial of the product for Dr Perricone said their skin felt more hydrated after using it, and 88 per cent found that using it for a week helped their skin retain moisture and helped make-up go on more smoothly. Another high-tech anti-ageing product containing chia oil is Comfort Zone's Skin Regimen Hydra-Pro Booster (£58, the-comfort-zone.co.uk). 'What makes chia oil so good for the skin is its powerful anti-inflammatory properties,' says Sarah Russell, of the company. 'Chronic skin inflammation has long been recognised as a major cause of ageing. Penny Badger, Simplicity Calming Facial Serum . Supercritical Chia Organic Omega-3 Oil . One Love Organics' Chia Whip Foam Cleanse . 'It's caused by our modern lifestyle, with its bad food choices, lack of exercise and high levels of stress, and it attacks our cells silently. Anti-inflammatory ingredients like chia oil help protect skin and correct the visible signs of skin ageing.' Chia oil is also a great source of antioxidant B vitamins, which play an anti-ageing role in skin by protecting it from damaging free radicals - unstable molecules that attack our skin cells and cause premature ageing. 'Chia oil has a  silky-soft feel on the skin and is considered one of the best anti-wrinkle skin oils,' says Penny Badger, who creates skincare products using pure and natural ingredients for sensitive skin. Penny includes chia in her Simplicity Calming Facial Serum (£35, pennybadgerbotanicals.co.uk). 'We use chia to soothe fine lines and improve skin elasticity. The omega-3s in chia seed oil also help relieve irritation, dryness and peeling.' Chia also features in One Love Organics' products, including Chia Whip Foam Cleanser, £23, and Waterless Beauty Balm, £39. Or you could apply a couple of drops of the oil (try the plain organic Supercritical Chia Organic Omega-3  Oil, £39, beingcontent.com) to your normal moisturiser to give it an extra  hydrating boost.

Before introducing the film, Salma spoke candidly about what motivates her on her mission to bring justice to women around the globe through her charity work. Salma set up the Chime for Change with two (rather powerful) friends: Beyoncé Knowles and Frida Giannini, creative director of Gucci. In June last year the threesome managed to get the world talking female empowerment with their Sound of Change Live concert, which took place in London. Madonna, Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, John Legend and Rita Ora were among the mega names to lend their time and vocals to the event - as well as Beyonce and husband Jay Z, of course. Before introducing the new film at the Women's Forum Global Meeting, Salma Hayek (at the forum above left and right) spoke about her what first motivated her to start campaigning for women's justice . Pakistani students gather around Humaira Bachal, the founder of Chime for Change school as she teaches them in a classroom in Karachi, Pakistan . Just over a year later, Chime for Change has launched a new film to help keep the conversation about women's rights alive. The documentary, Humaira: The Game Changer, follows Pakistani education advocate Humaira Bachal as she fulfils her dream of creating a 'Dream Model Street School' in the slums of Karachi, Pakistan, where education for girls is a taboo and the literacy rate among girls is only 15 per cent. Humaira Bachal appeared at the Sound of Change Live concert last year with Madonna, who lauded her with praise for her efforts to create equal rights in education. 'The Dream School has changed the lives of hundreds of children. Every girl deserves to go to school, regardless of where she was born,' said Madonna. 'Humaira is a freedom fighter. She is a hero for these girls and an example for all of us.' After the global tribute, contributions began pouring in and a new school was built. Left: Jennifer Lopez sung at Sound of Change Live last year; Right: Rita Ora (left), who also performed at the concert, with Frida Pinto (right), snapped backstage . During an emotional moment in the new documentary 28-year-old Humaira says: 'It feels like we have moved from a site of ruins into a palace.' The 18-room Dream Model Street School was completed in summer 2014, and includes a playground, library and computer lab. The school enables nearly 1,000 local girls and boys to pursue an education, and provides job opportunities for local women as teachers and assistants. Directed by Oscar winner Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, the film is a follow-up to Humaira: The Dream Catcher, which was launched at the Sound of Change Live concert. Before introducing the new film at the Women's Forum Global Meeting last week, Salma, who was in conversation with Mariane Pearl, said she has had a burning desire to bring justice to women from a very young age. Domestic violence, she said, was a cause she feels particularly passionately about. Left: Beyonce performing at The Sound Of Change Live; Right: Actress Blake Lively is one of the charity's many celebrity supporters and attended an event to celebrate the year anniversary of the concert . The actress was at pains to state that she had never experienced domestic violence within her own family, but said that a disturbing incident she witnessed at the age of six awakened her to the cause. She described walking down the street with her parents in Mexico City and seeing a man beating up his wife on the other side of the street. When her father crossed the road to help the woman, the young Salma was amazed at what transpired. 'The woman started beating up my father and said, 'How dare you, he can do what he wants.' First I felt sorry for her, then worried for my dad, then I didn't know how I was supposed to feel. I was confused. 'That incident haunted me,' she said. 'What did she go through to think she deserved it - not only to out it with it, but to defend it?' said the actress, who now focuses her charitable work on domestic violence. Her Charity Chime for Change promotes, education, health and justice for girls and women around the world.","Actress, mum and philanthropist, Salma Hayek, 48, introduced the new film at the Women's Forum in Deauville, France .

"Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh has filed a counter claim against the club's former owners GFH Capital. Lawyers acting for Haigh, who has been held in a Dubai jail for five months without trial, have filed a breach of contract against GFHC and Hisham Alrayes, managing director of GFHC and a former Leeds director and CEO of GFH. The claim, which has been filed in Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC), alleges that bonus shares due to Haigh from his former employers GFHC were paid at an undervalue. Former Leeds managing director David Haigh (pictured) has filed a counter claim against the club's ex-owners . It also alleges that other parcels of shares agreed between GFHC and Haigh as part of his remuneration while working as the bank's deputy CEO were never paid. GFHC are claiming £4million from Haigh, alleging he falsified invoices, and have had his assets frozen worldwide. This claim has been denied by Haigh. In a statement, Haigh said: 'The DIFC claim lodged by my lawyers represents only a tiny fraction of the amounts I shall be claiming from GFHC, who I believe have misused the Dubai legal system to have me incarcerated. They have resisted all attempts by my team to reach out to them through their senior executive officer Jinesh Patel. 'The conditions of my detention have made it impossible to prepare a speedy defence or counter claims to their allegations against me. 'However, my legal team has now almost completed my defence and is now proceeding with my counter claims. I am confident that the defence they will shortly issue on my behalf will completely exonerate me while raising serious questions about my incarceration.' Stuart Leasor, of Woodstock Leasor Ltd, acting on behalf of GFH, countered: 'It is clear from David Haigh's statement issued today that this is just another desperate attempt to showboat. Whilst GFH Capital maintains its claims of fraud against Mr Haigh in the DIFC Court, Mr Haigh files claims of no substance and negligible value purely to attract media attention. He claims to have no funds and little access to the outside world and yet he seems to be able to bombard the media at will.'

"As the son of a powerful Chinese family, he was expected to act with decorum and meet the highest standards. But Bo Guagua, 24 - now in hiding . after his parents were engulfed in scandal over the death of a British . businessman - gained a reputation as a playboy, cashing in on his . extraordinary wealth while studying at Oxford. He has not been seen in public since . his mother Gu Kailai was named as a suspect in the murder of Old . Harrovian expat Neil Heywood, prompting her politician husband’s . suspension from China’s ruling Communist Party. Socialite: Bo Guagua, seen posing with his then girlfriend Lale Can, right, at a University party, gained a reputation for his lavish lifestyle, but was held in contempt by his Oxford University tutors . But new details have emerged about the . lavish lifestyle enjoyed by the Oxford student, who was renowned for . hosting champagne and shisha parties in his room at Balliol College, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics. It is understood that his performance fell short of what was expected and he . was made to sit ‘penal’ exams. But in an extraordinary twist – and in . an astonishing example the influence of his parents before their . spectacular fall from grace – Chinese officials tried to intervene to . prevent tutors from disciplining him over his lack of work, it is understood. ‘An official turned up with a couple . of men in suits. They said it was very embarrassing because education . was highly valued in China, and it was embarrassing to his father and . grandfather. ‘His tutors replied if that was the case they should get him to work harder’, a college source told the Telegraph. A source at the college told MailOnline: 'Of course, it did not affect how the college behaved. Living it up: Bo Guagua, centre, was well known for his lavish lifestyle and love of partying during his days as a student at Oxford University . 'The college treated him like any other student. And indeed, where there were concerns, there was action taken.' This visit did not prevent the college . suspending him for a year shortly after. He moved into a flat, which, . according to a student newspaper, included ‘taps of gold, a concierge . and a small . vineyard’. Despite the apparent lack of dedication, Mr Bo graduated with a 2:1, but his peers have told how tutors would not hide their contempt for him. Mr Bo was remembered by friends to be . ambitious to climb the ranks within the Oxford Union. Friends said ‘he . never held back on spending’, according to the Telegraph, constantly . offering to buy people drinks. In one case, his attempt to become the . union’s librarian, or vice presidents, saw a large contingent of . Chinese students arrive to vote for Mr Bo. But his election bid failed . when many of his supporters were told they were not eligible to cast a . ballot because they had only registered the previous day. He was also said to have arranged a . lecture at the college by movie star Jackie Chan and organised a ball . where BBC Radio 1 DJ Tim Westwood performed. Mr Bo refused to comments on events surrounding his family when contacted by reporters. Playboy: Bo Guagua, right, with his girlfriend Lale Can, centre, and martial arts film star Jackie Chan . One of lads: Bo Guagua, 25, centre takes part in . the kind of crude stunt with fellow students that is said to have . heaped embarrassment upon his ambitious father . Party boy: Bo Guagua embraces two young friends in a series of snaps posted on the internet . His mother could face execution if . convicted of the 41-year-old’s murder, and her husband Bo Xilai has been . placed under house arrest. Mr Heywood’s Chinese widow Wang Lulu . spoke of her heartbreak over the death for the first time yesterday, . telling the Daily Mail: ‘I am so sad.’ Chinese authorities revealed on . Tuesday that Mrs Gu was a suspect in Mr Heywood’s death and said she and . her son Bo Guagua had enjoyed a good relationship with the business . consultant until a ‘conflict over economic interests’. Murder: British businessman and Old Harrovian expat Neil Heywood . The announcement prompted shockwaves . in China, where Guagua’s father Mr Bo – himself the son of a Communist . Party figure of the Mao era – was a party leader in the city of . Chongqing and expected to rise to a senior position within the national . leadership. Guagua, who also attended Harrow, had previously faced . criticism after photographs appeared on social networking sites . including Facebook and Twitter, showing him daubed with lipstick and . partying with girls at Oxford University. The pictures caused embarrassment for . his family in China and raised questions about how a Communist . politician could afford to send his son to one of Britain’s most . prestigious private schools. Mr Heywood first entered Mr Bo’s orbit when the family determined Guagua should go to Harrow. He acted as a mentor to the boy, who . was then educated in Britain from the age of 12, attending Papplewick . School in Ascot, Berkshire, before he was accepted at Harrow. His family insisted he had won scholarships to attend Harrow and Oxford. However, he was eventually suspended for a year, and contemporaries noted the Ferrari-driving student had a ‘strained relationship with books’. His privileged background made him a so-called princeling in China’s ‘red aristocracy’ and gave him a celebrity status. Connections: British businessman Neil Heywood, pictured at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, was a close friend of the wife of influential anti-corruption campaigner Bo Xilai . A brief relationship with Chen . Xiaodan, the grand-daughter of one of China’s top bankers, was followed . with such avid interest that the young couple were given a police escort . during a holiday in Tibet. He is now said to be in the U.S., where he is studying at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. His studies end next month and it is thought he may apply for asylum in the U.S. Last . month, after his father was sacked as a party leader in Chongqing, he . told The Times: ‘My personal desire is to focus on my studies and be . left out of the political intrigues.’ Guagua has shut down his accounts . on Facebook and the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, and China’s censors . have stopped internet searches on his name. Bo Guagua was sent to the famous Harrow School where he was mentored by Neil Heywood . Meanwhile in Beijing Mr Heywood’s widow Wang Lulu spoke briefly of her grief. His body was discovered in a hotel room last November. Chinese authorities initially blamed the death on excess alcohol, but there is speculation he was poisoned. At her family’s home in an exclusive gated compound, Mrs Heywood said: ‘I am so sorry. I am so sad.’ Mr Heywood was reported to have applied for a British passport for his wife in the months before his death. Their children Olivia, 11, and Peter, seven, already have British citizenship. He also told friends he had handed over documents to a British lawyer, detailing the overseas investments of the Bo family, as an ‘insurance policy’, the Wall Street Journal reported.","Bo Guagua, who is now in hiding, frustrated his tutors by becoming well known for hosting wild parties at his room at Balliol College, Oxford .

"The financial drama at Leeds has taken a new twist, with lawyers representing the club’s former managing director, David Haigh, writing to the Football League to say he can provide information relating to serious allegations about the club’s co-owner, Gulf Finance House (GFH), in its purchase of the club in 2012. A letter making the claims, including a potential breach of US Iran sanctions, has been sent to League chief executive Shaun Harvey — who was chief executive at Leeds in 2012 — and the League’s director of legal affairs, Nick Craig. GFH deny wrongdoing and question the credibility of Haigh, 37, who has been held at a Dubai police station without charge since May, accused of misappropriating more than £3m of GFH’s money, for whom he used to work. Lawyers representing David Haigh, who has been held in Dubai since May, have written to the Football League . A GFH spokesman said: ‘We are not aware of this letter and so cannot comment in any detail. We are satisfied GFH has always behaved in an appropriate manner... However, one of our former employees has been subject to both criminal and civil investigation over a variety of possible criminal actions, including fraud and money laundering, during the last few months and we are therefore unable to answer on specifics.’ Haigh was GFH Capital’s front man when they bought Leeds from Ken Bates in late 2012 for around £17million and as such is party to intimate knowledge of the firm’s business. Well-placed sources acknowledge Haigh did indeed receive the funds he is accused of misappropriating from GFH although his defence, whenever it is lodged, will say he was owed the cash in salary, commissions and expenses. Lawyers representing Haigh have written to Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey . Haigh’s new accusations against GFH will run the risk of implicating himself, as a former employee and insider. The letter from Haigh’s lawyers continues: ‘Clearly the information will need to be investigated thoroughly and our client is keen to assist in this process.’ The League have declined to comment but because GFH still owns and/or control 25 per cent of the club, the situation is potentially a huge embarrassment for them as a body and for Harvey personally. Harvey worked at Leeds under GFH until summer 2013. He became the League’s chief executive officer last autumn. A GFH spokesman said: ‘The funds used to acquire Leeds and to support the club was from the GFH group and its clients and not sanctioned Iranian funds, as has been insinuated.’ The letter said Haigh has information relating to serious allegations about the club’s co-owner, Gulf Finance Hous, in its purchase of the club in 2012 .","Lawyers representing David Haigh have written to the Football League .

"Admission: Stephen Frost said some of the targets were 'written on the back of envelopes' Olympics chiefs have paid over the odds for contracts in order to meet self-imposed diversity targets, a senior official has admitted. Stephen Frost, head of inclusion at this summer’s Olympics, confessed that some targets were ‘written on the back of an envelope’ – but stressed that they had to be honoured. The comments are likely to infuriate those angry about the cost of attending the Games. They may also concern MPs, who last month expressed fears that the London Olympics will go way over its current budget of £9.3billion. The predicted cost of the Games when London won the bid in 2005 was £2.37billion. Addressing a diversity conference in Toronto, Mr Frost – formerly of gay equality organisation Stonewall – cited an Olympic ‘volunteer selection centre’ as an example of officials shunning the cheapest option. He said the successful bidder was a ‘little more expensive’ but had ‘guaranteed to do all the work we needed to make the venue more accessible’. Mr Frost said: ‘All this stuff we’d said in 2005 to get the Games . . . some of it was written on the back of an envelope, quite frankly. We then had to deliver it.’ The Oxford and Harvard graduate also claimed that East London was an ‘urban desert’ before London’s successful Olympics bid. ‘I think if any of you go to London, or have been to London, or know London well, the East End of London is transformed,’ he said. ‘And it’s been a real physical transformation. ‘An area that was an urban desert [with] burnt-out cars, wild cats, unexploded bombs from World War II, poisoned soil, dirty water . . . has now become a really really cleaned-up, thriving community with affordable housing, lifetime homes, medical centres, [and] new hospitals as well as venues built for legacy.’ Mr Frost said the privately-run London 2012 Organising Committee (Locog) had convinced more than 60 businesses to set up a guaranteed interview scheme for disabled people. ‘That for me is systemic change which has benefits, rather than token diversity.’ Politically correct: Volunteers at the 2012 Games are also being offered advice on how to deal with cross-dressing members of the public . He also revealed that car-makers that signed contracts with Locog must make vehicles adaptable for disabled drivers. ‘It’s going to be quite nice in London to see VIPs being driven around by disabled folks,’ he said. Other contract recipients include a minority-owned film company in East London; the Royal Association for Deaf People, which will offer interpretation services; a company run by visually impaired people that will provide cleaning products; and an Asian-owned bus company. In an interview with a Canadian newspaper, Mr Frost revealed he has consulted with gay former NBA player John Amaechi on the inclusion of gay and lesbian athletes at the Games, and worked with British Paralympic champion Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson on accessibility for disabled athletes and spectators. ‘The London vision will definitely empower change, enhancing the hiring of disabled people, including gays and lesbians and dealing with homophobia in sport, bringing cultural communities together,’ he said. ‘We’re not going to solve the world’s problems, but we are going to use the power of the Games for change.’ Last September, the Daily Mail revealed that volunteers at the 2012 Games are being offered advice on how to deal with cross-dressing members of the public. They have been told that if confronted by a man wearing a dress, they should direct him to both the men’s and women’s toilets to avoid causing offence. Volunteers have also been issued with a list of words or terms they should not use while on duty. Banned terms include carer or helper, to be replaced with personal assistant or support worker. Staff must also avoid ‘patronising’ young people, the guidelines state, adding that it would be wrong to say ‘young man’.",Olympics chiefs have paid 'over the odds' to meet targets that were 'written on the back of envelopes'
"Nicky Morgan has criticised the head of Ofsted over his warning that schools are struggling to cope with an ‘influx’ of migrants. The Education Secretary said Sir Michael Wilshaw’s language was not ‘helpful’ and insisted many schools are doing ‘extremely well’ with pupils who speak English as a second language. Her remarks come amid simmering tensions between the Department for Education and Sir Michael following a series of public clashes. Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector of Schools, said schools needed the resources to cope with an influx of immigration but Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said the comments were not helpful . Mrs Morgan last month contradicted the watchdog over inspection procedures for flagship academies and expressed irritation over the timing of follow-up visits to the so-called ‘Trojan Horse’ schools. In a further blow to Sir Michael, a leaked memo revealed that calls for him to be sacked were made within the Government last year, over concerns about his running of the watchdog. In a speech addressing critics last week, the chief inspector of schools admitted Ofsted would ‘not win any popularity contests’. The latest clash follows a warning by Sir Michael that schools need more help to deal with growing numbers of non-native English speakers. During a phone-in on LBC radio last week, he was told of a school where teachers had to carry out ‘double the work’ due to a ‘huge influx’ of children who could not speak English. ‘Schools need the resources to deal with that,’ Sir Michael said. ‘When they’re faced with an influx of children from other countries, they need the resources and capacity to deal with it, and if those resources aren’t there, that’s a big issue for government. That’s the first thing and we’ll be producing reports on this fairly soon.’ In a subsequent LBC phone-in, Mrs Morgan was asked whether she agreed with Sir Michael that schools were being ‘overrun by children from migrant communities’. The Education Secretary, who is also MP for Loughborough, said: ‘Obviously Sir Michael Wilshaw has gone round to various schools but no, when I go round schools I see that they have adapted and are doing extremely well with students who do come from abroad. ‘I am not sure that sort of language is always helpful but there are challenges and there are parts of the country where we know that there are higher numbers of students who don’t speak English as a first language. ‘I know from my own constituency that can bring challenges but I also know schools that cope extremely well with that and actually I’ve been to a school recently in my constituency where they have had a situation and children are doing absolutely brilliantly.’ Asked whether Sir Michael should have chosen his words more carefully, Mrs Morgan added: ‘This whole area of immigration is an area where we need to be very careful about the language that we use. ‘It isn’t that it isn’t a concern to people because it absolutely is but we also need to think about the language and the tone of the debate that we use. ‘We need to tackle the issue in a sensitive way without saying there isn’t a problem because people are clearly concerned about it.’ In the Commons today, David Cameron told MPs that schools and hospitals were under pressure from immigration . The intervention came after David Cameron told the House of Commons that schools and hospitals were under pressure from immigration. During heated exchanges with Labour’s Ed Miliband, the Prime Minister said the British people ‘just want this issue sorted’. Concerns about the impact of migration on public services were also voiced by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, who said some towns were ‘swamped’ by European migrants, leaving communities ‘under siege’. He later retracted the comments, with a Government source saying he accepted he ‘should have chosen his words better’ and should have said some communities felt ‘under pressure’. Official figures show the number of schoolchildren who speak English as a second language has risen to 1.1million. Almost one in five primary pupils are non-native speakers and one in seven at secondary level. The number of youngsters needing extra help with English at school has risen by about a third in five years. At some schools, dozens of different languages are spoken. In nearly 20 local authorities, fewer than half of primary school children are native speakers – and in parts of London, only a quarter of primary pupils count English as their first language. Tensions between the Government and Sir Michael burst into the open last month when Mrs Morgan publicly contradicted the Ofsted chief and dismissed his demands for more powers to inspect groups that operate academies. It also emerged that the Education Secretary had expressed concern over the ‘unhelpful’ timing of follow-up visits to schools implicated in the so-called Trojan Horse plot to impose strict Muslim practices in the classroom. The inspections suggested little had changed in the schools but Mrs Morgan said a ‘great deal of progress’ had been made since the Ofsted visits. There is also believed to be frustration within the Department for Education over Ofsted’s handling of some inspections since new rules were introduced to tackle the threat of extremists infiltrating schools. In one case, the watchdog was forced to withdraw a report on a Catholic school in rural East Anglia which had been marked down for failing to do enough to ‘teach students about the dangers of extremism and radicalisation’. Meanwhile a leaked memo written last year revealed that Mrs Morgan’s predecessor, Michael Gove, considered replacing Sir Michael over concerns that Ofsted under his leadership was a ‘serious and growing problem’.","Sir Michael Wilshaw said schools need help to deal with foreign children .

The loss of everything, the whole situation was uncalled for.' He also paid tribute to Mr Johnson who was described as 'a good leader' and was loved by everyone. Ms Denny's father said the 30-year-old was devastated by her boss' death who was a friend.

He sat out the resumption of grade cricket but is set to play again for New South Wales on Tuesday . Team officials named Abbott in the side but said he would have the final call on whether he plays or not. Hughes collapsed after being struck in the neck by an Abbott bouncer in the Shield match between South Australia and NSW at the SCG on November 25. He died two days later. Abbott, who made his international debut in October, returned to training with NSW last Tuesday and was among the more than 5000 mourners at Hughes's funeral the next day in the northern NSW town of Macksville. Hughes' death sent shockwaves through the international cricket community, and senior Australian players have conceded that returning to the playing field has been a challenge. There has been speculation Abbott may be too traumatised by Hughes' death to make a full and effective return to the sport. Abbott has been supported by all parts of the cricket community, including Hughes' family and Australian captain Michael Clarke.

Cricket NSW says all players, Abbott included, will be given the opportunity to decide when they want to return to playing. The SCG wicket where Hughes was struck has been retired by groundskeepers and will not feature again during Australia's summer of cricket. Trauma experts say the impact of Hughes's death might not sink in for Abbott for weeks. But they also say that returning to training and competition, if he's surrounded by supportive team-mates, could help him recover quicker from any psychological damage. Phillip Hughes died on November 27 after suffering a head injury two days earlier while batting for his adopted state South Australia against his home state New South Wales two days earlier . The pitch on which Phillip Hughes was stricken by a bouncer will no longer be used this summer . Hughes' grieving South Australian team-mates are also yet to decide if they will play Tasmania in the next round of the Sheffield Shield. 'I wouldn't recommend (the players) stay away (from the sport) at all, actually,' said Michael Burge, director of the Australian College of Trauma Treatment. 'They just need to be taking into account that they may be a little bit awkward or not quite on their game as they were for a few weeks.'

Batting has always come easy to Watson - broad shouldered, confident and capable of bludgeoning an attack. But the past couple of days provided some of his toughest moments as a cricketer. 'There's a lot of inner demons we've had to find our way through,' Watson said of Australia's recent training sessions. Watson was in the field for NSW when Hughes was struck by a bouncer. It is a traumatic image that will stay in the mind of everyone present at the SCG on November 25. Shane Watson walks beside radio personality Alan Jones at Phillip Hughes' Macksville funeral on Wednesday . Watson has slowly turned his attention to facing India after attending Hughes' funeral on Wednesday. 'It's been the most challenging, mentally, couple of days I've had to go through in my career,' Watson said on Sunday. 'A few things flooded into my head as soon as I went out to bat - I thought I'd processed quite well over the previous week. 'The memories I've got that are very much in the front of my mind.

'I'm certainly getting much better. I know by Tuesday that I'll be ready to go.' The strain has occasionally showed while Australia trained in recent days. But Mitchell Johnson on Sunday got back to what he does best - sending down a testing bouncer to each of the Marsh brothers. Watson suggested his own mental struggles were only with the willow. 'For me, bowling's a hell of a lot easier than batting because you have to make sure you hold your nerve while guys are steaming in,' he said. Watson spent over an hour batting on Sunday, returning for some throwdowns from bowling coach Craig McDermott when most players had shuffled back to the rooms. 'It is not a lack of preparation, it is more about getting my head clear,' Watson said. 'Yesterday I also had a very long session and mentally it is a very big challenge.

"Australian cricket coach Darren Lehmann doubts Michael Clarke has played his last game for Australia. But the Australian captain faces a series of serious hurdles as he attempts to take part in the one-day World Cup, which starts on February 14. Clarke overcame a left hamstring injury to play the first Test against India, but suffered a flare-up of his degenerative back condition on day one. Clarke retired hurt, returning to the crease a day later and completing a courageous hundred. The 33-year-old then tweaked his right hamstring while fielding on day five, with scans confirming he will miss the rest of the four-Test series. 'I don't know exactly how long I'm going to be out for,' said Michael Clarke at a post-match press conference after suffering a hamstring injury in Saturday's first Test match against India. He remains in serious doubt for the World Cup, with Clarke fearful it could be even more serious than that. 'There's a chance I may never play again,' he said, noting Cricket Australia was in dialogue with experts about the best way to treat the latest tear. Lehmann's gut feel was Clarke would lead Australia once more. 'I think he will be back. You have your fingers crossed, we will wait and see,' he said. Whenever Clarke is next on the cusp of a recall, it won't be a straightforward fitness test. Lehmann and fellow selectors must weigh up not only Clarke's current state of health, but the risk his chronic back or hamstring woes could flare up at any moment. Both incidents in the first Test were incredibly innocuous. Team physio Alex Kountouris, speaking last month as Clarke raced the clock to play the first Test, admitted it was a hard issue to manage. 'Once he's done it once, twice, the risks go up of a recurrence. How we minimise those risks is difficult,' Kountouris said, then analysing Clarke's left hamstring injury. Lehmann was reluctant to discuss Clarke's World Cup equation too much on Sunday. Michael Clarke is in serious doubt for the second Test starting in Brisbane on Wednesday, after suffering another injury fielding at the Adelaide Oval today. Clarke  collapses next to Chris Rogers after injuring his right hamstring  fielding the ball during the tirst Test match against India at Adelaide Oval . 'He needs to get it right. He knows that, we know that,' Lehmann said. 'One-day cricket is an explosive game and we need guys fully fit, all the time.' Lehmann has already consulted the World Cup rulebook, confirming Australia could replace Clarke in their squad if he re-injures his back or hamstring during the tournament. National selectors would presumably want Clarke to return during the group stage, ensuring he has a few games under his belt before the knockout fixtures. 'You need to score runs to be in the team,' Clarke said of his World Cup hopes. 'I play my best cricket when I get some momentum.' On Saturday Clarke was sent for scans after limping from Adelaide Oval with a right hamstring injury. 'The scans are not great, they have certainly showed a tear there. The experts are looking at them and I can pretty confidently say that I won't take part in this Test series,' Clarke said at the time. 'I don't know exactly how long I'm going to be out for. 'There's no doubt there's certainly a chance, well there's a chance I may never play again. Man down: Michael Clarke says he doesn't know how long he's going to be out of play, after scans revealed a serious tear to his right hamstring . Australian captain Michael Clarke walks from the Adelaide Oval with team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris after suffering another injury in the first Test against India. 'I hope that's not the case and I'll be doing everything in my power to get back out on the park, but I have to be realistic as well.' Clarke has suffered serious right and left hamstring injuries in the past four months, and he was given injections to soothe his his chronic back injury when it flared up on Tuesday. 'I did my left hamstring (three times in the past four months). I've done my right side of my back, I've just done my right hammy. 'I have no regrets about playing this Test match. I have no regrets about going back on the field after I retired hurt,' he said. 'I don't have one regret. This is the most important Test match of my career. 'Once you walk into the game, you have to do whatever it takes to finish that game,' he said. 'Now I've got to go back and do what the experts tell me, to give myself my best chance of being fully fit.' Australian physiotherapist Alex Koutouris rushes to the aid of captain Michael Clarke. Michael Clarke, collapsed beside Chris Rogers (right) limped off Adelaide Oval on Saturday with a devastating right hamstring injury . The injury is a devastating blow to Australia on an otherwise exceptional day for the Australian team after Nathan Lyon dismantled the Indian batsmen in a remarkable 48-run win. Virat Kohli crafted a career-best century, but Lyon's maiden 10-wicket Test haul proved the difference as the hosts clinched victory on Saturday. The enthralling battle between chief protagonists Lyon and Kohli ended in the 82nd over. India's stand-in skipper holed out on 141, Mitch Marsh misreading the ball but completing an awkward catch in the deep. Ryan Harris and Mitchell Johnson claimed a wicket each after the final drinks break. But Lyon fittingly ended the game when he had Ishant Sharma stumped and India all out for 315 in the 88th over.

Lyon finished with incredible match figures of 12-286, bouncing back superbly after an underwhelming tour of the UAE, where he captured three Test wickets at an average of 140. Australian captain Michael Clarke went down fielding a ground ball at mid wicket after lunch and left the field clutching his right hamstring. He was assisted back to the sheds by team physiotherapist Alex Kountouris. This latest setback continues a terrible run of injuries for Clarke, who had been in doubt of playing the first Test scheduled for Brisbane before the freak accident which caused the death of his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes. Clarke strained his left hamstring in a one day international in Perth last month, then suffered a recurrence of a degenerative back injury that forced him to retire hurt on 60 while batting on Tuesday. The 33-year-old returned the next day after extensive treatment to post a courageous 128 and was fielding in pain during the Indians' two innings.

Brad Haddin was not out on 14. David Warner, who scored 145 in the first innings, knocked up 102 in the second. The overnight declaration left India with a target of 364 for victory today. At tea, India was 2/205, with stand-in captain Virat Kohli on 82 (off 112 balls) and Murali Vijay on 85 (off 208). Earlier, Mitchell Johnson had Shikhar Dhawan caught by Brad Haddin for 21, while Haddin also caught Cheteshwar Pujara off Nathan Lyon for 21. The Brisbane Test was delayed after the death of former Test opener Phillip Hughes, who was struck in the neck by a bouncer playing for South Australia against NSW on November 25. He died two days later. The Australian captain said it was 'heartbreaking' to miss any game of cricket and that he still hopes to be able to play in the upcoming World Cup. 'Our first (World Cup) practice game is eight weeks away,' he said. 'I'd love to take part in the tri-series, I'd love to take part in the World Cup but I just have to wait and see.

"A middle school student armed with two butcher knives and a creepy clown mask had to be subdued by a resource officer after he stormed into his school's cafeteria. The incident took place at West Rowan Middle School in Salisbury, North Carolina  on Tuesday morning. Police said the student started waving one of the 12 inch butcher knives 'wildly in the air' while wearing a clown mask in the  school's cafeteria. Frightening: The incident took place at West Rowan Middle School in Salisbury, North Carolina . Weapon: A middle school student was armed with two butcher knifes and had one more in his book bag . School: West Rowan Middle School in Salisbury, North Carolina did not go on lock down during the incident . Other students began screaming and running away, leaving the student, who has not been named, standing with both knives in the air. School resource officer Deputy Danny Lindley said he rushed in to subdue the 14-year-old student. He told WBTV: 'I approached the cafeteria [where] a lot of the children were running out. 'When I first got into the cafeteria I saw a subject standing there wearing a clown mask and holding a butcher knife in his hand. 'He was not moving, he was just standing there with the knife straight out in front of me, so I went for my asp baton, which is a metal pipe. 'I decided that since he wasn't making any aggressive moves toward me that I would try and just disarm him and get him to lay the knife down, go with that approach first. The deputy asked the student to drop the weapon but he continued to hold it in his right hand. He then asked him two more times  to drop the knife but he did not. Deputy Lindley said he hit the student with a baton in his forearm three times altogether. He then placed the boy in handcuffs. During the incident, the teenager  made 'several statements', but officials have not released information on what those statements were. After he was hit on the arm, he fell silent and stood still while Lindley  put him against the wall and patted him down for additional weapons. Creepy: Police said the student started waving a butcher knife 'wildly in the air' while wearing this clown mask . Police: Sheriff Kevin Auten was pleased that the resource officer was there and resolved it peacefully . Strange: The eighth grade student is described as a white male, and will be evaluated by mental health doctors . Sheriff Kevin Auten said the deputy found another butcher knife in the student's book bag. Deputy Lindley added: '[If] a person has a knife, we're basically trained that we can use up to and including deadly force.' 'I felt that since there were no other children around him and no one was in immediate danger that I would start at the lower end of the use of force continuum which would be the asp baton. The school did not go on lock down because the threat was quickly eliminated. No other students or staff members were injured during the incident. The eighth grade student involved is described as a white male. He was taken to the local medical center to be treated for his arm injury. He will also be evaluated by mental health professionals. Officers said the investigation will continue once medical officials determine the type of treatment the student may require. Deputy Lindley added: ‘I'm glad that it turned out the way it did, no one got hurt. A lot of people got scared, but no one was physically hurt. 'It could have been a lot worse and in the back of my mind I think, you know, I could have shot the kid, but I'm glad I didn't.'","The incident happened  at West Rowan Middle School in Salisbury, North Carolina .

"A former Florida A&M band member accused of being the ringleader of a brutal hazing ritual known as 'Crossing Bus C' that killed a drum major was convicted today of manslaughter and felony hazing. Prosecutors said Dante Martin, 27, was known as 'the president of Bus C' and organized the initiations that required fellow band members to try to make their way through a pounding gauntlet of fists, drumsticks and mallets from the front of the bus to the back in November 2011 after a football game. Two other band members went through the bus before Robert Champion, 26, of Decatur, Georgia. Martin was convicted of misdemeanor hazing counts in their beatings. Guilty: Former Florida A&M band member Dante Martin, 27 (left), pictured in court Monday, has been found guilty of manslaughter in the hazing death of drum major Robert Champion, 26 (right) Hazing: Martin, left, was found guilty in court on Friday. On Monday, he was supported by his family members in court who sat behind him, pictured . At fault: Martin's defense attorneys (left and right) argued that Champion voluntarily took part in the Crossing Bus C ritual in 2011. The jury disagreed in their guilty ruling on Friday . Champion's parents, Pam and Robert Champion, sat silently as the verdicts were read. Martin sat with his head down. Martin's sentencing was set for January 9 and he was taken into custody. He is facing up to 15 years in prison. Champion complained of trouble breathing and vomited after the ritual, then collapsed and died of internal bleeding caused by severe bruising in a hotel parking lot after Florida A&M played Bethune-Cookman in their annual rivalry football game November 19, 2011. His death cast a pall over the school's nationally acclaimed band, which had played at Super Bowls and before US presidents. The famed band was suspended for more than a year after the death and several school officials resigned in the aftermath. Martin's defense attorneys told jurors the ritual was more akin to a competition and that there was no actual hazing. They said Champion and the others voluntarily participated. Tragic end: Champion complained of trouble breathing and vomited after the ritual, then collapsed and died of internal bleeding in a hotel parking lot . Jail? Martin could face up to 15 years in prison when he is sentenced in January . Co-accused: Brian Jones, left, and Ryan Dean, right, have already been sentenced after pleading no-contest to third-degree felony hazing last year . 'You can't take it in isolation and act like it was just any other band,' defense attorney Richard Escobar said during closing arguments. 'Brutal as it was, foolish as it was...it was competitive.' Prosecutor Jeff Ashton said testimony made it clear that band members were looking for a measure of respect and acceptance by 'crossing Bus C.' But he challenged the defense's argument. 'Tradition didn't kill Robert Champion,' Ashton said. 'Tradition isn't to blame. Tradition is not an excuse...It's not a defense to those that got caught.' Disgraced: The famed band was suspended for more than a year after the death and several school officials resigned in the aftermath . Grieving: Champion's parents, Pam and Robert Champion, were in the courtroom every day during the trial and sat silently when the guilty verdict was announced Friday . Several other former band members have pleaded guilty to lesser charges, and three others await trial. Brian Jones and Ryan Dean were sentenced after pleading no-contest to third-degree felony hazing in 2012. Jones was sentenced  to six months of community control, which strictly limits his freedom with measures including frequent check-ins with probation officials. He also was given two years of probation and required to perform 200 hours of community service. Dean received four years of probation and 200 hours of community service.","Prosecutors said Dante Martin, 27, was known as 'the president of Bus C' and organized the hazing ritual that led to Robert Champion's death in 2011 .

They then dedicate their entire summer to taking care of the pumpkin. Cheryl Fulk told Penn Live: 'In the beginning of the season when it first grows you can see them grow from morning to night.' Paul Faulk added that the pumpkins can grow 40 pounds in one night. Cherry Crest adventure farm is located in the heart of PA Dutch Country and describes itself as 'a unique place where fun, family, and farming come together.' Next year the Fulk's are hoping to grow a pumpkin that weighs 2,000 pounds and create another completely smashing pumpkin.

"Pitting animal against animal in football, racing and looks, the Chitwan Elephant Festival in Nepal aims to remind people of their responsibility to wildlife. In its 11th year, the festival is run by Chitwan Regional Hotel Association (RHAN), which is made of a coalition of 100 hotels in Sauraha - a village south-west of Kathmandu. This year it ran for five days from Friday to Tuesday and features major events including an elephant race, elephant calf football, elephant beauty contest and elephant picnic. In its 11th year, the festival is run by Hotel Association Nepal - which is made of a coalition of 100 hotels in Sauraha, a village south-west of Kathmandu . The festival took place over five days from Friday through to Tuesday, and marvelled crowds at the spectacle . Other attractions include the ox cart race, horse cart race and canoe race. The use of the feature animal in the events is to raise awareness of the endangerment of Asian elephants. At the beginning of the 20th century, it is thought more than 100,000 of this species were found in areas of Iraq and Syria to the Yellow River in China, according to the World Wide Fund. But this count has plummeted by at least 50 per cent in the past 60 to 75 years, with the population now only existing from India to Vietnam, and in sparse numbers in the south-west corner of China's Yunnan Province. This year it ran for five days from Friday to Tuesday and features major events including an elephant race, elephant calf football, elephant beauty contest and elephant picnic . The use of the feature animal in the events is to raise awareness of the endangerment of Asian elephants . Hundreds of people gather in the small village to witness the spectacle armed with cameras and a sense of humour. About 100 elephants were expected to compete during the festival and wow the crowds.

"There was laughter, can-can lines and even the odd bouncer as Australia started their preparations for the four-Test series against India. Training together for the first time since Phillip Hughes' tragic death, the Test squad maintained a front of normality on Friday in the South Australian capital, Adelaide. Tuesday is not only the opening day of the series, but the first time Hughes' team mates will play after their beloved mate was felled at the Sydney Cricket Ground, on day one of a Sheffield Shield round between South Australia and New South Wales. The full impact of Hughes' shock death, after he was fatally struck by a bouncer, on not only the Australian cricket team but also on the game is yet to be seen. Mitchell Johnson throws a cricket ball during an Australia Test Team practice session at Park 25 Cricket Ground in Adelaide, South Australia . 'I reckon you'll get a pretty good indication of how they're going today,' Australian coach Darren Lehmann (right) said. 'The squad (left) is getting on with what we do well and that's play cricket' Phillip Hughes shock death was caused by a bouncer during a Sheffield Shield match at the SCG, which caused 'catastrophic' injuries when he was struck in the head on November 25 . Australia coach Darren Lehmann reaffirmed that players will be given time to decide whether they're mentally up to playing at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday. But the early signs suggest the fear of mass withdrawals was unfounded. Coach Darren Lehmann (left, with Steve Smith) says that it's the player's choice if they return to the pitch or not for the first test against India. The test begins on Tuesday in Adelaide . The Australian cricketers showed incredible good humour, partaking in routine hijinks and questionable dance moves as players warmed up at a suburban oval on the fringes of the Adelaide CBD. Kick-ups came first, with the standard debate over who was at fault when the soccer ball hit the ground. It was only days earlier that the nation watched a clip at Phillip Hughes' funeral, broadcast on national television, which showed archive footage of the talented youngster playing the very same game alongside his team mates. The players were photographed playing 'kick-ups'. At his Wednesday funeral, Phillip Hughes was shown in archive footage playing the same game as he laughed with his team mates . Fielding drills were next, the four fast bowlers breaking away to one group. They laughed with Peter Siddle when the Victorian overshot the mark with his return, the ball skidding along the car park and bumping a vehicle. Then came the serious business. David Warner was among the first batsmen to shuffle into the nets. David Warner took to the nets during Friday's training session. The opening batsman was incredibly close to Hughes and did not leave his side on the field after he was struck during the Sheffield Shield match . Steve Smith also took to the nets and was exposed to fast balls and bouncers as the bowlers appeared to train in their typical fashion in a remarkably normal session . Siddle, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Johnson looked to regain rhythm in a centre-wicket session. Even then, spirits remained remarkably high. Chief selector Rod Marsh helped set the tone. Marsh grabbed a baseball mitt and reprised his wicketkeeping days for a short time before being replaced by fielding coach Greg Blewett. Both Marsh and Blewett understandably struggled to read the pacemen's deliveries. The bouncer slowly came into fashion, although Johnson bowled a fuller length for most of the session. Ryan Harris (left) and Mitch Marsh (right) both returned to the pitch with confidence . Australia's fearsome fast bowler, Mitchell Johnson, appeared to bowl a fuller length for most of the session . Hazlewood fired one in that flew over Shaun Marsh's head, but it was Siddle that truly stepped up. He sent down a terrific short ball, Marsh quickly ducking under. Chris Rogers was not so lucky, a rising delivery from Siddle inflicting some serious pain when it thumped his body. It was remarkably normal. Five days of Test cricket is obviously a significantly different proposition to a run in the park. The Australian cricket coach, affectionately known as 'Boof', is confident that the boys are back in business. 'I reckon you'll get a pretty good indication of how they're going today,' Lehmann said prior to training. '(The squad is) getting on with what we do well and that's play cricket.' Spirits were high, with plenty of antics, laughters, games and questionable dancing . Just two days before, the Australian cricket team had farewelled their mate, Phillip Hughes.

"A North Carolina math teacher has been allowed to keep her job despite allegedly saying she wanted to 'kill all black people.' Cynthia Ramsey, head of the math department at Camden County High School in North Carolina, allegedly said to a student that if she only had ten days left to live, her bucket list would include 'killing all black people'. The conversation is alleged to have taken place in her classroom this week, and shortly afterwards she was suspended but then reinstated. School: Cynthia Ramsey is head of the math department at Camden County High School in North Carolina . Racist: Ramsey told a student that one of the things on her ‘bucket list’ would be to kill all black people' Job: Ramsey was placed on suspension with pay. But she has now been reinstated. Kimberly Ashcraft, the mother of the Camden County High student who reported the teacher's offensive comments told WAVY: ‘It is very disturbing.’ Ashcraft's daughter said  Ramsey was in her classroom along with several other students who were eating lunch. In the course of a conversation  Ramsey began to talk about what she would do if she knew she was going to die. ‘Mrs. Ramsey [indicated] that if she only had 10 days to live that she would kill all black people,’ Ashcraft told WAVY. The remark left the student and the student’s mother shocked. ‘I was completely shocked,’ she continued. ‘I asked her again, ‘Are you sure that was what you heard?’ I could not have imagined a teacher saying that.’ Disgust: As the teacher returns to her post, Kimberly Ashcraft said she is disappointed in the decision . But she assured her mother that other students had also overheard the teacher making the remark. School officials launched an investigation   into Ramsey’s alleged remarks and the Camden County Sheriff’s Office was also called in. The sheriff confirmed that several other students were in the classroom at the time  that Ramsey had  said 'she would kill all black people.' Ramsey was placed on suspension with pay. But has now been reinstated. Yet as the teacher returns to her post, Ashcraft said she is disappointed in the decision. 'I was very disappointed to hear that she was back in the classroom so soon,' she said. Camden County Schools' superintendent said that the board has investigated the incident 'thoroughly.' However he said that Ramsey's remarks were of a 'personnel issue,' but the board would follow protocol in the investigation. The superintendent also stated that the facts of the case would remain 'confidential until resolved.' In another development, Camden County’s sheriff gave the evidence in the case to the district attorney. Ramsey a teacher at the school for 17 years could still face charges depending on the outcome of the attorney’s investigation into the incident. The school board has also announced that it plans to discuss Ramsey’s case on November 13 and Ashcraft hopes that justice will be served. 'As a parent I felt compelled to come forward and tell somebody, because this was not only in my opinion a direct threat to the black children in the school, but also black people in the community.'","Cynthia Ramsey is head of the math department at Camden County High School in North Carolina .

"A man has been arrested  after he failed to call police following a fatal car accident that killed his girlfriend. Phillip Epperly, 49, from Tipton Indiana was arrested on a preliminary charge of criminal recklessness after the crash  in rural Tipton on Thursday. Epperly  admitted that he was the driver of the lone SUV involved in the accident which killed his girlfriend but police are also investigating his actions following the crash. Arrested: Phillip Epperly was arrested on a preliminary charge of criminal recklessness . Epperly allegedly dragged the body of his girlfriend from their crashed 2004 Ford Explorer after he ran off the road and into a tree, fence post and utility pole. He then took the body of Karla M. Wolford, 38, into the couple's home at 3980 South County Road 500 West, Tipton and laid Wolford's body in the living room before calling 911. When police officers arrived on the scene they found Epperly drinking a beer. The Tipton County Sheriff's Department first responded to the crash at approximately 10:49 p.m. Thursday, police said, before requesting State Police assistance. Epperly was driving eastbound on County Road 400 South, approaching a T-intersection at County Road 500 West, police said, when he failed to stop for a stop sign at County Road 500 West. Instead, police said, he continued through the T-intersection. Accident: Epperly allegedly dragged the body of his girlfriend from their crashed 2004 Ford Explorer after he ran off the road and into a tree, fence post and utility pole . A spokesperson for Indiana State Police said: 'The Explorer struck a fence post in a driveway at 3980 South County Road 500 West.'

"The Frenchman who could follow Sepp Blatter as the most powerful figure in world football has promised that he will consider stripping Qatar of the 2022 World Cup if elected as the next FIFA president. Frenchman Jerome Champagne, 55, a former diplomat and a long-serving senior FIFA insider until 2010, is the only person yet to make a formal declaration of candidacy for the presidential race next May. Blatter has suggested strongly he will stand, in which case Champagne will have an uphill task. Bid: Jerome Champagne is the only person to make a formal declaration of candidacy for presidential race . But if Blatter's bid was stymied by . health or other reasons then Champagne, a former aide, will have . Blatter's influential backing, and a good chance of success. The significance of Champagne speaking out on Qatar should not be underestimated because he is free to speak - as a current FIFA outsider - in a way in which Blatter cannot as current president. 'If nothing irregular has happened then maybe the World Cup does still go [to Qatar],' says Champagne. 'And if it has happened then all options, including moving the World Cup, have to be on the table.' In an exclusive interview with the Mail on Sunday, Champagne says Qatar's treatment of migrant workers is under scrutiny and could cost them. New figures show more than 430 Nepalese workers have died in Qatar since January 2012, and more than 567 Indian workers. They still die at a rate of more than one a day. The second threat to Qatar 2022 is the logistical difficulty of moving the tournament to winter to avoid the unplayable heat of summer. Surprise: FIFA President Sepp Blatter announces Qatar as the host nation for the FIFA World Cup 2022 . The third threat is an anti-corruption probe headed by American lawyer Michael Garcia, seeking wrongdoing in the bidding process. Separate FIFA evaluation processes are under way into all three areas and due to be concluded by early next year, though Champagne admits key decisions could fall to the next president. 'Sure. It could land on my desk,' he says. He insists he has no anti-Qatar agenda, having lived and worked in the Middle East, somewhere he believes a future World Cup should be staged. 'I lived in this area, I learned Arabic,' he says. 'I love the region and I think it's a good thing to take the World Cup to a cultural area where it has never been organised. But for me it's clear [that for Qatar to keep 2022] we need to know the  outcome of three processes. 'First, we cannot go to a World Cup on the blood and death of workers. Second, the disruption will be huge if the tournament is moved to winter. Last, but not least, I don't know what is in Michael Garcia's report, but we need to go with a clear mind to the World Cup without any allegations in the back of the brain.' Champagne knows FIFA inside out and is campaigning on an agenda of radical reform, aimed at purging the governing body of corruption and sharing wealth more fairly. Concern: Champagne says Qatar's treatment of workers is under scrutiny and could cost them . He says he was 'flabbergasted' in December 2010 when FIFA's 22-man executive committee voted for Qatar to stage the 2022 event. 'If I had been in the ExCo I would have voted for Russia for 2018 and USA for 2022. Why? Because I felt we should continue the continental rotations and for 2022 it was time to go back to the North American continent, in my view.' He says that holding a World Cup in North America in 2022 would have opened up the possibility of a 2026 World Cup with bids from Japan, Korea, China and perhaps India, Indonesia or a 'dream Arab candidacy' of a coalition of Gulf states. Those options for 2026 may still come to pass in the extraordinary event that Qatar lost 2022 and it was reassigned, perhaps to USA. Champagne has first-hand knowledge of workers' welfare issues in the Gulf as his first diplomatic assignment was in Oman. 'We cannot go and rejoice in stadiums, have a celebration of football, knowing it has been done on the blood, suffering and death of workers,' he adds. 'I welcome that (German ExCo member) Theo Zwanziger said that in future, human rights has to be integrated in the criteria of the bidding. I'm in favour of organising World Cups in democracies.' Champagne warns that changing the date of Qatar from June-July 2022 to winter would have 'tremendous consequences on the organisation of football' with the knock-on effect damaging seasons before and after. He adds: 'I was privileged to get hold of a very, very good document compiled by the EPFL (the organisation of European leagues), which shows how disruptive it would be, not only in Europe but all around the world.' As for Garcia's anti-corruption report, Champagne speaks of 'allegations of political influence in countries like Brazil, Germany, France. Allegations of collusion between Qatar and Spain. Allegations of, shall we say, commercial deals [linked to bids] to say the least. My position is clear: we need to know.'","Jerome Champagne is the only person to make a formal declaration of candidacy for the presidential race .

Yet, the state Health Department insists that the crew remains symptom-free and there is no reason for concern of exposure to the deadly virus to the community. It comes as new medical screenings are rolled out at airports across the United States to stem the spread of the disease. Anybody flying from western Africa who has a fever will be interviewed to see whether they have had contact with an Ebola sufferer, and from there can be quarantined if necessary.

The cameraman was infected in West Africa, but is being treated in Nebraska. A spokesman for NBC told The AP that the network could not comment on any individual case, but noted that the team was deemed to be low-risk upon its return from Liberia. He added that they had agreed  to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities which included the 21-day isolation period. He said: 'We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed.' 'Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials.'

The new scheme, which began today, will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. President Barack Obama said Wednesday that the new screening measures are 'really just belt and suspenders' to support protections already in place.","New Jersey officials issued a mandatory quarantine order for the NBC crew .

"NSW bowler Sean Abbott has returned to action for the first time since the death of Phillip Hughes, bowling with pace, confidence and, most importantly, an enormous smile on his face. In an incredible display of courage, Abbott returned the Sydney Cricket Ground, the same ground where Australian cricket player Hughes was felled exactly two weeks ago. The wellbeing and mental health of the 22-year-old has been of great concern to many since the freak accident when he bowled the fatal bouncer to Hughes. People across the globe have rallied around the young player, including Hughes' family, who told Daily Mail Australia that they '(couldn't) wait to see him, give him a big hug and tell him everything is okay.' Australian captain Michael Clarke promised that when Abbott was ready to bowl again, he would 'be the first to strap on the pads and go stand up the end of the net to hit them back at (him).' But it was a new day for Sean Abbott as he stepped out for New South Wales, taking on Queensland in the Sheffield Shield competition. He was handed the ball for the 13th over of the day and, to the relief of the nation, took to the task with abandon. Abbott even had the courage to bowl a bouncer on just his fifth ball and then continue to , indicating that the game will indeed go on. He smiled and Australia breathed out a sigh of relief: Sean Abbott celebrates taking the wicket of Nathan Reardon of the Bulls during day one of the Sheffield Shield match between New South Wales and Queensland . Sean Abbott's team mates encompass his in a huge hug as they celebrate one of his two wickets . Sean Abbott returned and played the game as normal: with energy, speed and excitement . Sean Abbott returned to cricket this morning at the Sydney Cricket Ground as NSW played Queensland . He bowled with speed and great energy; celebrating his two wickets with his team mates and cheering ecstatically. It was a demonstration of his great strength of character and the steadfast support that he continues to receive. Hughes' closest friends and family indicate that this enjoyment of the game  is exactly what the 25-year-old opening batsman would have wanted, as he 'lived for cricket'. Abbott received a warm round of applause from the crowd when he was introduced into the attack in his first outing since Phillip Hughes' death. With 'PJH 707' on his shirt, referencing Hughes' Baggy Blue number from his time with the NSW Blues, Abbott began his take down of the Queensland batsmen. He began by bowling four dot balls before delivering his first bouncer to Queensland batsman, Joe Burns, the ball sailing over the batsmen's head. He took his first ball by bowling Nathan Reardon for six. Abbott flung his arms into the air gleefully, as his team mates ran towards him to celebrate. His second wicket came soon after, when Queensland's Ben Cutting edged Abbott's delivery, clipping it straight into the gloves of wicketkeeper Peter Nevill.

After the funeral in his home town of Macksville last week attracted thousands of mourners, plans to hold a state memorial service for Hughes in Sydney have been scrapped. 'All parties felt that given the enormous outpouring of support at last Wednesday's funeral, a state memorial service would no longer need to be held,' New South Wales Premier Mike Baird said.

Abbott, who made his international debut in October, returned to training with NSW last Tuesday and was among the more than 5000 mourners at Hughes's funeral the next day in the northern NSW town of Macksville. Hughes' death sent shockwaves through the international cricket community, and senior Australian players have conceded that returning to the playing field has been a challenge. There has been speculation Abbott may be too traumatised by Hughes' death to make a full and effective return to the sport. Abbott has been supported by all parts of the cricket community, including Hughes' family and Australian captain Michael Clarke.

Cricket NSW said all players, Abbott included, were given the opportunity to decide when they want to return to playing.

Trauma experts say the impact of Hughes's death might not sink in for Abbott for weeks. But they also say that returning to training and competition, if he's surrounded by supportive team-mates, could help him recover quicker from any psychological damage. Phillip Hughes died on November 27 after suffering a head injury two days earlier while batting for his adopted state South Australia against his home state New South Wales two days earlier . The pitch on which Phillip Hughes was stricken by a bouncer will no longer be used this summer . Hughes' grieving South Australian team-mates are also yet to decide if they will play Tasmania in the next round of the Sheffield Shield. 'I wouldn't recommend (the players) stay away (from the sport) at all, actually,' said Michael Burge, director of the Australian College of Trauma Treatment. 'They just need to be taking into account that they may be a little bit awkward or not quite on their game as they were for a few weeks.'

"Fergie is looking slimmer and happier than ever before . She looked like a new woman. Slimmer than ever and bursting with an exuberance they haven’t seen for years. The Duchess of York has lost almost four stone. Something’s up. That much was clear to party-goers at Windsor Castle who helped her celebrate a double birthday: the 21st anniversary of her charity Children In Crisis and Fergie reaching the age of 55. She was her old self. When the Queen offered her favourite home to her former daughter-in-law for the dinner it was more than just a symbolic gesture. She knew how happy this would make Prince Andrew, under whose royal roof the Duchess continues to live 18 years after they divorced. And what an occasion it was (even if a little brash) as dinner was served in the Great Hall to 200, including Kate Moss and Prince Harry’s on-off girlfriend Cressida Bonas. Other guests included rich business friends such as property developer Nick Candy and mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell. Naturally, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were there with their boyfriends. There was opera from Lucy Kay, the runner-up in Britain’s Got Talent, and several other musical acts including singer-songwriter Natasha Bedingfield and the all-girl German classical quartet Salut Salon. Fergie loved it all, sitting in the castle immediately beneath a bust of Queen Victoria. She was next to millionaire businessman Sir David Tang and on the same table as her former husband, who was beside the broadcaster Sir David Frost’s widow Lady Carina. ‘Sarah looked so at home,’ says one of the guests. ‘She had lots of diamonds flashing around her throat and looked really fantastic, better than I’ve seen her for years. ‘Her face was a picture, a huge smile, as everyone sang Happy Birthday. She was so happy you could almost think the Queen had given her back her HRH.’ But there was something else that people noticed about Fergie. One guest called it a ‘calmness’ that was quite new. Perhaps this is not so surprising. For the fact is that something really is up — it’s the rebranding of Fergie. And where better to signal it to the world than at Windsor Castle? The resurrection of Brand Fergie is a crucial element in secret talks she has been having in the U.S. to endorse healthy food. It’s a brave move. Who would have thought she could be galvanised to risk launching a new business after what happened the last time she tried? Seven years ago, she set about turning herself into a household brand name, endorsing products from jewellery and scented candles to fashion and food. Her U.S. company, Hartmoor, also encompassed earnings from her children’s books, after-dinner speaking and TV appearances. But with lavish offices overlooking New York’s Central Park and a large staff, its spiralling costs — plus Fergie’s extravagant spending — were soon outstripping her earnings and plunging the operation into debt well beyond £3 million. It was at that time, four years ago, that a desperate Fergie offered ‘access’ to Prince Andrew for £500,000 to an ‘Indian business tycoon’, who turned out to be an undercover journalist at the now defunct News Of The World. Scroll down for video . The Duchess of York (left in 1988 and right at the Vienna ball in 1997) used to cut a noticeably larger figure . Following her divorce from Prince Andrew, Sarah Ferguson's weight has fluctuated. She is pictured sporting a fuller figure in 2010 (left) and 2009 (right) This was a new low point for someone who’s had so many low points. But the former chalet girl Sarah Ferguson does seem to have a knack of being able to rise from the ashes. And there are still investors — in the U.S. at least — who feel the Duchess of York’s title retains enough royal cachet to make a buck. Some believed she made a big mistake when, for £1.4 million a year, she became an ambassador for Weight Watchers, with whom she eventually parted company. Chief among those who thought a lot more money could have been made was handsome Wall Street banker J. Todd Morley, a one-time business adviser and president of the Sarah Ferguson Foundation charity, which closed two years ago. So keen was Fergie on his money-making ideas that when he flew to London for business talks with her to impress him she sent her chauffeured Bentley (a £160,000 gift from an admirer, the Norwegian Findus frozen food magnate Geir Frantzen) to collect him from Heathrow airport. Seven years ago, she set about turning herself into a household brand name, endorsing products from jewellery and scented candles to fashion and food as well as raking in money from her children's books . Where this would have led, we can only speculate. But Morley, a happily married man with three children, highly ambitious and very sensitive about his image, was horrified to learn people were wrongly suggesting he and the Duchess might be having an affair. He backed away immediately from Fergie and the project never got off the ground. But was Morley right about the Duchess’s selling power? The fact that others think he was, indeed, right has had an electrifying effect on her ambition, says a friend. And now, it seems, she is determined to stand on her own two feet. Her first step towards commercial reincarnation was to become ambassador for the National Obesity Forum. ‘She realised that if she was going to be an ambassador, she was going to have to do something about her own weight, which has always yo-yoed,’ says a friend. She set herself a target ‘to lose 50lb by my 55th birthday’. It was clear to everyone at the Windsor Castle party that she has achieved it. These were just the first moves in the ultimate resurrection of the Duchess of York. They set the stage for a major commercial onslaught in which she will endorse schemes to help people with eating problems. An announcement about her new business enterprise is likely in the New Year. ‘Fergie really has one ultimate objective,’ says a close figure. ‘She wants to be financially independent enough not to have to rely on Andrew’s generosity. She wants to do it within two years.’ Just what could this mean — would she remain under Andrew’s protective royal custody or go? For the past eight years, she has luxuriated in the Prince’s home, Royal Lodge, the Queen Mother’s gracious old house in Windsor Great Park. He has spent more than £8 million on refurbishments, thanks largely to the £15 million (£3 million more than the asking price) he received from a Kazakh billionaire friend for Sunninghill Park, their former marital home nearby. He didn’t share these proceeds with Fergie. After the house sold, it is understood that when the Queen asked what she wanted, Fergie replied: ‘Your friendship, Ma’am.’ Living permanently, and apparently contentedly, with Andrew — though, they insist, not as ‘man and wife’ — she is very much the mistress of the house. Fergie has said her greatest pleasure of being there is walking in the woods and ‘meditating on the bluebells’. In her 2011 memoir, Finding Sarah, she described her perfect man: ‘Someone who is good-looking . . . with a good sense of humour . . . believes in old-fashioned chivalry, is confident, sophisticated, intelligent and athletic . . .who has integrity, honesty and is family oriented, and who knows me better than I know myself.’ Since their divorce Prince Andrew has supported his former wife financially and allowed her to live in his home . She added: ‘I realise I have just described Andrew.’ A pity she didn’t seem to see him in quite that light when she was married to him. Since the publication of the book, she has been keeping a relatively low profile, avoiding any outrageous gaffes and even declining TV appearances. Meanwhile, she is working on a film project about Prince Albert and regularly attends meetings of the trustees of her two main charities, the Teenage Cancer Trust and Children In Crisis. She’s also made quiet visits to West Africa twice in the past year to see charity staff at work. Last year’s move to New York by her youngest daughter, Eugenie, to work for an online auction house gave Fergie a reason for monthly visits to the U.S. At the same time, she was keeping up her old business contacts. When someone suggested a commercial rebirth, she did not need much persuading. But the old Brand Fergie that cut such a swathe across America was viewed as dead. As one of her former public relations advisers said: ‘She threw away the golden opportunities that were presented to her when she left the Royal Family. Who on earth would buy anything with the Duchess of York’s name backing it now? The revamped Fergie is proof, say experts, that you can still make a comeback . ‘But times change and memories fade. A revamped Fergie can sell herself as proof that, however down you are, you can still make a comeback — that’s a very powerful selling message in America.’ The rebranding began, quietly, in the summer when Andrew arranged for her to stay at Balmoral with the Queen. The visit was inevitably picked up by U.S. social commentators. You could almost feel the excitement of investors in Fergie’s name that she was no longer the royal outcast. And there she was again, in Windsor Castle. Slim, full of exuberance, turning back the clock. As for Andrew, four years ago on his 50th birthday, he made a comment that some of her friends thought in rather poor taste. The father of two drew laughter when he described himself as a man ‘with three children’. No such jest on this occasion. Instead, his affection for Fergie, despite all the scandal that has gone before, was clear. As for the way she looked at him: ‘Well, maybe she really does see him now in the way she described her perfect man in her book,’ said one guest. The inevitable chatter among close friends is on the continuing topic of whether they might remarry — after her implacable opponent Prince Philip, 93, is gone. No one, probably not even the Queen, knows the answer.","The Duchess of York looks more put together now than ever before .

"Perhaps if Lynsey de Paul had spent less time reminiscing openly about her lovers and more time reminding the world about her songs, she would have been fixed deeper into the consciousness of today's music-buying public. Maybe if she had boasted about being the first female songwriter garlanded with an Ivor Novello award — she won two, actually, in the early Seventies — her name wouldn't be so surprisingly absent from Who's Who, and, sadly, unknown among the young. When her death was announced yesterday, her friend Esther Rantzen described Lynsey de Paul as a 'renaissance woman' who could sing, compose, 'do everything'. She was also a talented artist and cartoonist — a product of Hornsey Art College in London. Scroll down for video . Lynsey De Paul died unmarried at the age of 66 on Wednesday following a suspected brain haemorrhage . She was abused and beaten by her property-developer father and did not want other girls and women to suffer at the hands of men . But she also left something that many will consider to be far, far more valuable — a message she proclaimed loud and clear and at every possible opportunity: that women must never be taken for granted or see themselves as the 'weaker sex'. At barely 5ft tall and as delicate as china, de Paul — who died on Wednesday of a suspected brain haemorrhage — was never an archetypal feminist role model. But then her upbringing, in the north London suburb of Cricklewood, clearly had a lasting effect — she was abused and beaten by her property-developer father and did not want other girls and women to suffer at the hands of men. Perhaps it was the way her father treated her that explains why, despite having an extraordinarily glamorous string of lovers, she died unmarried at the age of 66. Lynsey smooching Hollywood legend James Coburn in 1978 during their intense relationship . The singer dated Sean Connery for five months and he would read Robert Burns poems to her and phone her from his film set . The list included Sean Connery, Ringo Starr, Bernie Taupin (who wrote songs with Elton John), Dudley Moore, Hollywood actor James Coburn and West End producer Bill Kenwright. De Paul's name was also linked with Diana, Princess of Wales's last lover, Dodi Fayed. A lively, gregarious woman, Lynsey lived happily alone in a vast house in Mill Hill, north London. She moved there last year from an equally large house in nearby Hampstead — friends say it was because she didn't get on too well with the neighbours. Her vast, 7ft bed moved with her. So did her white grand piano, on which she'd composed hit songs Sugar Me and Won't Somebody Dance With Me. She also continued her nightly habit of taking food to the bottom of her garden to feed the urban foxes. Lynsey enjoyed her own company. And with age came an attractive line in self-deprecation — she would describe herself as being 'like a Ford Escort with a re-spray'. When she gave dinner parties, she always invited couples but never a single man for herself. With Ringo Starr in 1975, but Lynsey later dismissed their romance as 'just a fling' Tiny and always curvaceously slim, she was fastidiously tidy. Her 20 pairs of jeans were hung in perfect alignment in her wardrobe. So were the 20 jumpers she liked to wear. 'Everything in her house had to be exactly in its place,' a friend said yesterday. 'I've never seen a home so spotless or so orderly — hardly a house for a husband.' Yet Lynsey certainly loved men: 'I didn't lose my virginity, I gave it away to a man much older than I was,' she liked to say. Few warm memories remained of her fling with Sean Connery some 25 years ago. She'd met him in 1989 at a party. His second wife, Micheline, was sitting next to Lynsey on a sofa but, she said, that didn't stop Connery chatting her up and asking for her phone number. 'I didn't want to have an affair with him,' said de Paul, 'and I tried to keep our relationship platonic, but he pursued me relentlessly. He wasn't my type at all because I'm not usually attracted to the macho type. 'In the end I thought, 'Why not?' I didn't know his wife, so I didn't feel I was betraying her by having an affair.' Lynsey certainly loved men: 'I didn't lose my virginity, I gave it away to a man much older than I was,' she liked to say . So began a relationship that went on for five months. Scotsman Connery would read Robert Burns poems to her and phone her from his film set. Intriguingly, she claimed he told her in one call that he was only able to kiss his co-star, Michelle Pfeiffer, while thinking of Lynsey. The affair ended rather abruptly. The couple met for what Lynsey didn't know was the last time, made love, then he told her he would ring her at the weekend. She never heard from him again. Later, Lynsey was appalled when she learned that Connery had publicly condoned hitting women; his first wife, actress Diane Cilento, revealed he had beaten her during their marriage. Lynsey said he'd never laid a hand on her, adding: 'I wasn't aware of Sean's violent side when I was with him, but I was quite horrified when I read that he'd said it was OK to hit a woman.' She launched a furious attack in a newspaper interview, saying that she bitterly regretted their affair and that she'd 'like to give him a smack for women in general'. Not long afterwards, she released a new book and DVD, called Taking Control — a manual for women to defend themselves against violence. Putting her words into action, she'd spent a year learning martial arts as an example to her readers. 'I don't see men as the enemy,' she said. 'I'm like a pussycat. I would rather curl up in a man's lap and purr and be stroked. She dated Dudley Moore and observed drily that 'he was the only man I dated whose eyes were the same height as mine' 'But if I have to, the claws come out and the hissing will start.' The book earned praise from Lord Mackenzie, then a senior member of The Police Superintendents' Association, who said it was a 'very positive contribution to crime prevention'. But Connery was not the only violent man de Paul bedded. Even the love of her life, James Coburn, threatened her during the four years they lived together in the late-Seventies. Coburn was the only man she wanted to marry — at least for the first two years of their relationship. But then she realised he was becoming too possessive. 'Jim didn't understand my need to make music,' she later recalled. 'He expected me to fit into his life. I wanted to get on with my music.' There was another possible marriage that never came to pass. For years, she wore an engagement ring given to her by Chas Chandler, bassist with The Animals. However, her relationship with Ringo Starr was merely 'a fling'. As for diminutive Dudley Moore, she observed drily that 'he was the only man I dated whose eyes were the same height as mine'. Despite a comprehensive personal history of star-studded relationships, there was a curious modesty about de Paul's professional success and Top 20 hits. Far more important to her was her concern about women being safe. Taking Control was a psychological as well as a physical self-defence manual, as she blamed women for their mental attitude. 'Possibly the single most damaging belief held by women is that they are the weaker sex,' she declared. 'This alone causes many to wear a subconscious air of victimisation that is too attractive for an attacker to resist. It may sound facile, but simply by walking with confidence you can deter attackers.' Her passion for the subject came from the beatings she took from her own father. His tempers in the family home were fierce, and Lynsey said she was hit while her mother 'stood by'. Revealing the abuse for the first time when she was in her 50s, Lynsey said: 'I knew what it was like to be frightened. I never knew what my father was going to do — slap me, yell at me, criticise me or just ignore me. 'Once, he hit me so hard that I felt sick and dizzy for three days.

"Michael Clarke has capped arguably the most remarkable Test match in his long and successful career by bringing up a hundred in the same match in which the cricket world paid tribute to his 'little brother' Phillip Hughes. Those writing screenplays could scarcely have dreamt up such a script, as it is barely believable even in the often incredible pantheon, which is world sport. Clarke, 33, defying painful back spasms to bat again and only after a night of intense physiotherapy and painkilling injections, joined Steve Smith at the crease when play resumed on day two. He brought up a magnificent century at the Adelaide Oval after a second rain delay. His celebration was subdued at first, kissing the helmet and hugging Smith before allowing himself a small smile. Smith had earlier dedicated his own majestic ton to fallen mate Hughes, pointing to the number 408 painted on the ground and then just moments later Clarke brought up Australia's 408th run, the crowd standing as one to applaud the significance of the score. Scroll down for video . Surely among the most courageous centuries in recent memory. Dogged by an injury which put him in hospital the day before and carrying the weight of his mate Phillip Hughes' death into the match, Michael Clarke scores a century on day two of the first cricket test between Australia and India . The magic moment for Michael Clarke is celebrated by his wife Kyly and other Australian fans at the Adelaide Oval. The Australian captain became the home side's third century maker of the Test before rain stopped play .

Paying tribute to his mate. Steve Smith celebrates his hundred at the number 408, signifying Phillip Hughes' Test number, painted on the turf at the Adelaide Oval . There's been pain in almost every movement Michael Clarke has made in his courageous innings at the Adelaide Oval. The 33-year-old captain became the home side's third century-maker in the first Test . Michael Clarke and Steve Smith walk past the number 408 emblazoned on the Adelaide Oval turf in honour of their former NSW and Australian team-mate, the late Phillip Hughes . Decision made, Michael Clarke returns to the field of play for Australia despite a serious back injury which threatened, at one point, to keep him out of the rest of the match . Michael Clarke's wife Kyly is all smiles as the Australian captain returns to the crease less than 24 hours after his summer looked over because of a chronic back injury . Some experts said he would be unable to play again in the match, others even dared to suggest this could be the beginning of the end of a glittering career, yet the Australian cricket captain made a truly remarkable recovery from his back injury after retiring hurt on day one to bat again in the first innings. But Steve Smith knows what his skipper is made of and confidently predicted Clarke's reappearance at the crease when he said before the start of day two 'he (Clarke) has had a few injections and he's keen to get out there and bat today'. Clarke, joined Smith for the resumption after being forced from the field on 60 during a dramatic first day of play in which David Warner scored a magnificent century and Smith also racked up a half century. Clarke's first scoring shot of the morning was a boundary through the covers to move him onto 64 but he is clearly restricted and in considerable pain, wincing with almost every shot. Feeling better.

When rain interrupted play Australia was 6 for 405. Physio Alex Kountouris admitted he didn't have much sleep after Clarke's injury and subsequent hospital visit. 'We were certainly treating it into last night. He had an injection while there (hospital),' Kountouris said. 'He's got a chronic back injury, he dived to get back into the crease when David Warner was on 99, it's quite a significant back injury. It's poor timing and he's struggling at the moment. 'I don't think it's directly related to the hamstring injury which is on the other side.' Down but not out. Michael Clarke succumbed to a chronic back injury on day one but was determined to play on in the first cricket Test, joining Steve Smith at the crease when play resumed on day two . The moment Michael Clarke realised he would have to retire hurt on 60 after re-injuring his back . 'He hasn't had anything like this for 18 months, the last time was at the Champions Trophy in England,' Kountouris said. Australia resumed at 6-354 with Steve Smith unbeaten on 72 and Clarke 60. The skipper had to overcome a recurring left hamstring injury to play the rescheduled first Test. Kountouris believed his current woes were unrelated to the hamstring issue. Before he was hurt Clarke was in typical mood, playing shots like this through the off-side on his way to 60 and in support of David Warner's century . 'This is his right lower back. This is his old injury, what he's had in the past,' he said. 'I don't think it's directly related to his hamstring, because it's the other side. 'We believe it's related to his old disc injuries. With that comes a lot of muscle spasms and other things that cause pain. 'So we're just trying to relieve those elements of it and make sure we give him the best possible chance.' The skipper ducked inside a short ball from Indian quick Ishant Sharma in the 44th over and instantly grimaced in pain. Clarke stretched his back and spoke to Kountouris and doctor Peter Brukner before trudging off the field. Kountouris revealed the initial flare-up occurred seven overs earlier when Clarke dived to make his ground at the non-striker's end. 'He felt it a little bit there. Then he tried to get out the way of a bouncer and it really grabbed,' he said.","Michael Clarke has scored his most emotional hundred, notching up the third century for Australia against India in the first test .

"On the Sunday after Paul Merton’s second wife Sarah died of cancer, he went to the Comedy Store in Leicester Square, where he had performed many times. He kept in the background and absorbed the atmosphere. He really wanted to be performing, but worried that doing so so soon after Sarah’s death might not be seemly. It is a curious, even risky admission by a comedian held in considerable affection by millions that his instincts after his wife’s death were to make people laugh — and that they had to be held in check because of ‘decorum’. TV Comic Paul Merton, 45, marrying his second wife Sarah Parkinson - who died just 12 weeks later . Only someone like Merton, 57, the son of a Tube driver and a nurse, could get away with it. He grew up in Fulham, south west London, wanting to be a comedian and, as he says in his autobiography published this week: ‘Humour is essential to people’s lives.’ Sarah Parkinson, a producer, writer and actress, was the second of Paul’s three wives. When she died, they’d been together for three years, since the collapse of his six-year marriage to the actress Caroline Quentin. He and Sarah were married for a mere 12 weeks. The wedding was a beautiful affair in Rye, East Sussex, where they kept a country house. The weakened Sarah left the church grounds on a white horse. She’d been diagnosed with breast cancer 19 months earlier, when she was 39, in the spring of 2002, after finding two lumps in her breast. Everyone at the wedding knew she didn’t have many months to live. The original 'Have I Got News For You' team (l to r): Angus Deayton, Ian Hislop and Paul Merton in May 1993 . Comedian Paul Merton wearing a suit made of newspaper back in 1993 . As Paul records with brutal irony, just three hours after a doctor told them the cancer was fast-growing and had spread beyond the lymph glands, he was recording an episode of Room 101 — a fictional place where things are eradicated forever — with fellow comedian Ricky Gervais. The brave Sarah had decided after an operation not to have chemo or radiotherapy. She spent her final week in a hospice. So the age-old coalescence of tragedy and comedy had struck yet another comic. But Merton, who married again in 2009 to comedy actress and writer Suki Webster, manages to wear trauma lightly. Perhaps this is his way of coping. Twenty-four years ago he suffered a mental breakdown, just as his career was beginning to take off, and ended up in Maudsley psychiatric hospital in Camberwell, South London, for two months. Yet in his autobiography he doesn’t say it happened due to stress, insisting instead that it was down to mistakenly overdosing on anti-malaria tablets following a trip to Africa. His breakdown emerged unexpectedly one evening, when he suddenly started crying while talking to a friend. He explained he was doing so because he thought he was Jesus. After that he began hallucinating — imagining that people were staring at him, and seeing 15-inch transparent worms. Have I Got News For You's Ian Hislop and Paul Merton accepting a lifetime achievement award at The British Comedy Awards,  Fountain Studios, Wembley, London in 2011 . He ended up being taken by taxi to the hospital, where at least two other people were claiming to be Jesus, and he was recognised in the canteen because he was simultaneously appearing on TV in the prerecorded comedy show Whose Line is it Anyway? Three months after leaving the Maudsley, he got a phone call from Hat Trick, the prolific TV production company. Was he interested in making a pilot for a quiz show based on the week’s news? ‘That’s not for me,’ he told them. ‘I don’t do topical jokes. In fact I know nothing about current affairs.’ Back came the reply: ‘It doesn’t matter. Just be funny. You can do that.’ The show was the enduring hit Have I got News for You, and Merton was to be one of the team captains. He says the opposing captain, Ian Hislop, editor of Private Eye, was also wary of being in the show, as it might affect his dignity — he was, after all, ‘a serious journalist’. Angus Deayton was the excellent presenter. But in 2002, 12 years after the show started, the News of the World exposed him with a lurid story about him snorting cocaine with a prostitute. At the next recording of Have I Got News For You — as the cameras rolled with Deayton in his usual place, seated between the teams as quiz host — Merton leapt up and unzipped his fleece jacket to reveal the vivid News of the World front page printed on his T-shirt. Merton says it had to be done — and it was his idea. Angus’s predicament had to be treated with the same jovial hostility they would treat any other story, because the show was based on the week’s news. A young Merton doing stand-up comedy on ITV show Saturday Live . Not to have done so, Merton believes, would have prompted accusations that they could give it but not take it. He knew it had been uncomfortable for Deayton, even though he, too, realised the best way of handling the situation was to make fun of it. Merton says Angus told him: ‘Thank you for making it funny.’ That might have saved his job — not to mention the show’s underlying integrity — for the time being, but when the next series opened there were even more accusations about Deayton’s private life. They’d managed the first situation, but there would be no laughing away his discomfort the second time around. So he was out and — although Merton doesn’t say so in his memoir — is said to blame Paul and Ian for forcing the issue. Despite his absence, Have I Got News For You continued from strength to strength, using guest hosts. Merton mentions that former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has been the worst. He was so slow reading the autocue that the episode took more than two hours to record — the longest time ever. Merton admits that, like Deayton, he’s had drug experiences — although never as a consumer. He tells an extraordinary story of spending an evening rolling joints for Peter Cook and other guests at Cook’s flat in Hampstead, north London. He’d been invited with fellow comic and friend Julian Clary and half-a-dozen others. ‘Peter was one of my great comic heroes when I was growing up,’ writes Paul. ‘His wit, elegance and charm inspired me.’ Merton in Galton and Simpson's The Missing Page alongside Caroline Quentin . Suki Webster, Merton's wife, in a promo shot for the play they starred in together - My Obsession . In the kitchen, Paul, a former council-house boy who says his interminable wise-cracking as a youngster lost him any number of friends, found another idol from his childhood — Monty Python’s Eric Idle. Although there was plenty of alcohol, Merton says he didn’t drink much as he was anxious not to act star-struck. There was also cannabis for anyone who wanted some. Here, surely, was a situation that most people who refuse to have anything to do with drugs would find extremely embarrassing. Merton, however, handled it with enviable aplomb. Cook and Idle were sitting next to each other, and Merton offered to sit near them, rolling their joints for them. Cook replied: ‘What a sensible arrangement. What I like about cannabis is it does what it says it’s going to do.’ Just why Merton didn’t think his toe-curling offer would make him look like the ultimate ‘fanboy’ — especially as he didn’t know how to stick the papers together — he doesn’t say. But he spent a happy evening listening to the talk of his comic heroes and, every so often, rolling a joint that was passed around the room. What fun Have I Got News For You could have with his pot-sodden evening. The one drugs scare that did panic him into rushing out early to buy a copy of a tabloid newspaper in Central London was while he was recording an edition of Have I Got News For You. His publicity agent called his wife Sarah to warn her that the following day’s Daily Mirror would have six pages about Paul’s supposed cocaine habit. After a sleepless night, he opened the paper to discover, much to his relief, that the cocaine user in question was actually Paul Merson, the Arsenal and England footballer, who is now a TV pundit. Paul Merton tells these stories lightly and with self-deprecation. After all, the lure of comedy has never been far away. In his youth he worked briefly as a meat packer for Sainsbury’s and for three years as a civil servant for Tooting employment office in South London. But, to the dismay of his parents, he gave up secure employment without knowing whether he’d ever make more than the few quid his early gigs brought in. Even when he was losing his virginity — the moment, he says, when ‘the young gazelle becomes a man’ — with a girl called Leslie, whom he met in a pub, the then 20-year-old Merton was distracted by comedy. They were in the middle of the act itself when a joke popped into his head so good that he was desperate not to forget it. ‘“Leslie,” I said, “I’m sorry, do you mind if we stop for a moment … I’ve just got to write something down.”’ So was it worth the interruption? Judge for yourself. The joke was: ‘I learned French the hard way — from a Spaniard.’ Only When I Laugh by Paul Merton (Ebury Press, £20).","Merton was with his second wife for 12 weeks before she died from cancer .

"Having been away for three years on an 'amorous adventure', Lord Brabourne is now sleeping in a converted barn on his historic 6,000 acre estate . The homecoming was nothing like it used to be. At one time, the staff at Broadlands, a vast, historic country house, rich with royal memories, would greet Lord Brabourne in the great, pillared hall, Downton Abbey-style. This time, having been away for more than three years, he slipped sheepishly through the gates of the 6,000-acre Hampshire estate, where both the Queen and Prince Charles spent part of their honeymoons. But he did not head for the four towering pillars framing the front door of the Palladian mansion left to him by his grandfather, Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Instead, he made for a converted barn, where his belongings were unloaded from the car. Lord Brabourne, Prince Philip’s godson and lifelong friend, and cousin of the Prince of Wales, was back after an extraordinary, amorous adventure with an exotic beauty that had taken him to the Bahamas. Several weeks after this bizarre return, he is still not living in his ancestral and marital home. To put it mildly, things are no longer quite the same since he walked away from his 31-year marriage. Family friends say it is ‘doubtful’ that Brabourne will be able to effect a rapprochement with his wife Penny — Prince Philip’s carriage-driving companion — whose father began life as a butcher, before making a fortune as the founder of the Angus Steakhouse chain. Thus far, the formidable Lady Brabourne has given no indication that she is even considering inviting her wayward husband, Norton, to come back and live under the roof of the historic house, far less into her bed. Understandably, she is an angry wife. Broadlands was left to Brabourne in the expectation that he would devote his life to maintaining an estate of unique historic provenance, where Noel Coward used to play the piano at weekend house parties when the Queen and Philip were staying. Instead, Penny has been running it — and doing so rather well. In her husband’s absence — making a mockery of the family motto ‘In Honour Bound’ — she even took over his role of High Steward of nearby Romsey, wearing the blue-and-gold robes with style, and carrying out the ceremonial duties with enormous aplomb. Lady Brabourne (left) has refused to allow her husband back into the marital home after he walked out on their 31-year marriage to be with Jeannie Nuttall (right), a Bahamian fashion designer . She has further stepped into his shoes by becoming patron of Romsey Agricultural And Horse Show Society. With a touch of poetic justice, it is a rather frail-looking Lord Brabourne who has been seen in recent days, pottering around the estate. The man who will be the next Earl Mountbatten on the death of his 90-year-old mother, Patricia, told one local: ‘I made a mistake, but I’m back for good — back home.’ That sounds like a man who wants to rebuild his life. This may not be easy. Apart from his wife running the estate — her photograph now adorns the official Broadlands website — his daughter Alexandra, 31, has supplanted him as patron of The Mountbatten School in Romsey. She has also taken over, while her father was absent, as president of the town’s Scouts — the first woman to have the honour. It was in 2010 that Lord Brabourne left Broadlands for Nassau, to be with Jeannie Nuttall, a Bahamian fashion designer, whose clothes sell in the enclaves of the rich, such as Rhode Island, in New England, Palm Beach, and St Barts, in the Caribbean. Just a few weeks earlier, he had cried out ‘Wow’ on seeing a picture she had posted of herself on Facebook. He had previously met her through her late husband, Sir Nicholas Nuttall, a tax exile whose money came from a family engineering company. For 66-year-old Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, his amorous adventure was also an escape from what he saw as the drudgery of running the Broadlands estate. Unlike television’s Lord Grantham, who saw the care and preservation of Downton Abbey as his life’s work, Lord Brabourne hated it. ‘At first, his new life was idyllic,’ says a family friend, ‘but eventually, it all began to go sour. Frankly, I think Jeannie began to tire of him. She’s got her dress business to run, she’s always busy. He’s a nice bloke with a title, but not very exciting.’ Happier days: Lord and Lady Brabourne at the Ansty Polo Club for the Mountbatten Trophy match in which Prince Charles was playing . Rumours that things were not going well with them began to circulate two years ago. Finally, the couple decided their relationship didn’t have a future, and he crept back to Britain. In Nassau this week, Lady Nuttall, an attractive widow for seven years, has been concentrating on her successful boutique. ‘I’m so sorry,’ she says, ‘but I don’t feel comfortable at the moment with what has happened.’ The Royals, meanwhile, are glad that Norton has returned to Broadlands, but confused as to what it might mean. Members of the family, the Queen in particular, are full of admiration for Penny Brabourne and the way she has held things together, insisting that life at Broadlands must go on as normal, despite her husband’s betrayal. Indeed, in Brabourne’s absence, no private royal event has been complete without an invitation to Penny. Hers is a name automatically added to every Palace guest list. Over the years, the striking Penny, 60, has also been a decorative carriage-driving companion of Prince Philip, 92. The two have competed in countless shows across the country. But her closeness to the Royals initially came through Norton’s friendship with Charles. ‘The Queen and Philip have never forgotten how he helped Charles (a year younger) get through the trials and troubles of Gordonstoun,’ says a family friend. ‘There’s always been a special feeling because of the terrible tragedies that beset his family. But they can’t really forgive him for what he did to Penny.’ There are serious doubts that he will ever again enjoy the level of intimacy he once had with the Royal Family. Those in the couple’s circle wonder if Penny will weaken and have him back. ‘It’s unlikely, but I doubt if she would ever contemplate divorce, either, because that would mean her leaving Broadlands,’ says a close figure. ‘She will never do that.’ The reason is the presence of a tall stone standing on a plinth, 100 yards from the house, in full view of the drawing room. That is where the Brabournes’ daughter Leonora, who had kidney cancer and died 23 years ago at the age of five, is buried. ‘Norton was uneasy about putting her grave there, because he feared it would mean they would never get over the death of the little girl they loved so much,’ says a friend. ‘But Penny insisted. She wanted Leonora to be where she could always see her and be with her. So she will never leave Broadlands, never.’ Tragedy has certainly plagued this marriage, at which Norton’s best man was Prince Charles. The ceremony at Broadlands, and reception for 1,000, had to be postponed for eight weeks after IRA bombers blew up a small boat in the sea off Mullaghmore, Co Sligo, in August, 1979. It killed Norton’s grandfather, Earl Mountbatten, his 14-year-old younger brother Nicholas, his paternal grandmother, the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and Paul Maxwell, a local boy who was with the family. Nicholas’s twin brother Timothy, and his parents, were all injured. Mountbatten’s murder meant that the newlyweds moved straight into Broadlands. But the tragedies do not end there. Their 32-year-old son, Nicholas (named after Norton’s younger brother), has battled a drug problem. He spent years on crack cocaine and heroin, living in drug dens  and bedsits. Intriguingly, he began to overcome his addictions at around the time his father was flying to Nassau to be with Jeannie Nuttall. Some family friends feel that the two events are not unconnected. ‘It’s as though something told him his mother needed some moral support,’ says one. 'Members of the family, the Queen in particular, are full of admiration for Penny Brabourne (left) and the way she has held things together, insisting that life at Broadlands must go on as normal, despite her husband¿s betrayal' Nick, a ‘digital artist’, is understood to have been ‘clean’ for more than three years, and has his own small company making computer-generated videos for the music industry. He lives in East London and is engaged to a nurse, Raz Tedros, whose family come from Eritrea. She, of course, will one day be the Countess Mountbatten, when Nicholas succeeds to the title. Nick is a year older than Prince William and was given the responsibility of showing him the ropes at Eton, though they haven’t stayed close. Despite Nick’s apparent recovery, it remains unlikely that he will be entrusted with the running of the estate when the time comes. Mindful of his difficult past, that role has been earmarked for his sister Alexandra, a forensic accountant, who is a rising star in London with a major firm of U.S. business consultants. But will she want to take on Broadlands? She is in a long-term relationship with Tom Hooper, an entrepreneur who connects specialist maths tutors in India to schools across the UK via Skype. ‘They’re great together and very happy — but Alexandra’s mother is getting rather anxious that they haven’t married yet,’ says a family figure. Which brings us back to Lady Brabourne’s own marriage. Since her husband’s reappearance, he has moved from the barn into a converted dairy, closer to the big house. Could that be a sign of things to come? Friends say he shouldn’t hold his breath. Additional reporting: Jim Norton.","Lord Brabourne left family estate in 2010 for life with foreign beauty .

"Socialite Carla Powell – confidante to a Who’s Who of celebrities and world politicians – told last night how she was robbed at gunpoint in a terrifying raid at her secluded farmhouse. The 71-year-old, who counts Tony Blair and David Cameron as friends, was thrown to the floor, pistol-whipped and kicked by a masked gang who ransacked her home in hills outside Rome. They escaped with thousands of pounds of jewellery, watches and cash after forcing her to open a safe by beating a member of her staff and threatening to kill him. The gang also fired several shots to terrify their victims. Attacked: Lady Carla Powell with one of her dachshunds at her home in Rome, Italy . The brutality of the raid has stunned friends of Lady Powell, who for years has presided over the most influential political salons in London and Italy with a stylish and frenetic charm. Her husband Charles – away at the time of the robbery – was Margaret Thatcher’s right hand man at Downing Street and she became one of the Iron Lady’s closest confidantes. Recovering at home, she told the Mail: ‘I have never been so scared in my life. I thought they would use the guns on me.’ Her ordeal began in the early hours of Monday when she heard her dogs – who she famously names after her friends – making a commotion. ‘They were outside in the orchard and wouldn’t stop barking…so I went to the door,’ she said. ‘But it was so dark I went to go back inside when two black faces appeared like a nightmare. 'They had black plastic masks on so you couldn’t see their faces and they were wearing gloves. ‘As I was shutting the door they pushed it and I started screaming. 'They pushed me on to the floor and hit me on the back of the head with a pistol to make me shut up.

They had a knife and three guns, one revolver and two handguns. ‘One grabbed me by the wrist by my Cartier watch, which they later took, the other kicked me in the side.’ Her screams alerted her Polish-born farm manager, Dario, whose knee was deliberately dislocated by the intruders to immobilise him. ‘They jumped on him twisting his leg. It disabled him,’ Lady Powell said. ‘I didn’t feel any pain at the time but when they dragged the farm manager from his room and put a knife to his neck, I realised they were serious and knew that I had to cooperate. ‘I thought they would use the guns on me so I opened the safe. They were very professional and went through everything, my sheets, clothes and bags. ‘All my good jewellery was in the safe, even my wedding ring which I wasn’t wearing because of all the work I’ve been doing on the farm. They took a lovely ruby and diamond necklace that I wore to the wedding of the Blairs’ son [Euan] and they ripped the Cartier watch from my wrist. ‘The only thing left is a gold ring that is not valuable but has sentimental value because Lady Thatcher gave it to me as a present.’ Sir Charles Powell with Baroness Thatcher as the former Prime Minister's senior Downing Street aide took his Lords seat . But even as she recounted the horror of the night Lady Powell’s thoughts were for her menagerie of animals. ‘At the time Tony Blair, my Alsatian, was so scared he was hiding under my bed,’ she recalled. ‘When they forced me into the bedroom I saw his tail was sticking out.’ The Powells’ villa in the Sabine hills has been a refuge for a string of illustrious guests over the years. Once describing herself as Mrs Thatcher’s ‘surrogate wife’, Lady Powell has filled it with political discourse from both the Left and the Right. Peter Mandelson, another confidante, once lived in the basement of the Powells’ London home. In Italy, guests have included Mr Cameron, Tony and Cherie Blair, Henry Kissinger, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Mikhail Gorbachev. She has entertained Lord Rothschild, Sean Connery, Stephen Fry and Emma Thompson. For years keeping open house has been how Italian-born Lady Powell likes it, but the events of the past 48 hours have been shattering for her. ‘Now I have nothing: I am poor like Pope Francis,’ she lamented before adding: ‘I can tell you I’ve never been so frightened in all my life, even during the Thatcher years when Charles was working in Northern Ireland and we were under threat and needed security. ‘I was a strong woman but life will be different now. When the dogs barked last night I thought the gang had come back to kill me.’","Lady Powell taken hostage by the gang at her home outside Rome .

"Six months after Florida teenager Davion Only asked a church full of strangers to help him find a real home - he still has not been adopted. Criticism of Eckerd, the adoption agency charged with finding the now 16-year-old boy an adoptive family has grown - with many potential parents claiming that their phone calls have never been returned. It is even alleged that the teenager who toured morning and national talk shows in September is no longer allowed to speak to the media, has no cellphone or email and has put his Facebook settings on private. Indeed, the young-man - who captured the . heart of the nation with his heart-breaking request last year - has . grown despondent with those who know him saying that he 'just wants the . whole process to be over'. Scroll Down for Video . Still without a family: Davion Only, 16, who has spent his whole life in foster care and begged for anyone to adopt him at his church . The teenager made his stark, simple and emotional plea stood at the pulpit in September at the age of 15 wearing a donated suit and clutching a Bible he had borrowed from his boy's home. 'My name is Davion,' he said. 'And I’ve been in foster care since I was born. He told the congregation: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be… I know God hasn't given up on me. So I'm not giving up either.' Davion told the church he never knew his real family and that he hoped for a home. He was featured on Good Morning America, Al Jazeera America and in People. Producers flew him in to speak with Barbara Walters in New York on The View. About 10,000 people around the globe called to ask about helping or adopting him. Davion has since moved out of a group home and into a foster one as reported by the MailOnline in December, but sadly, he still does not have a permanent home or adoptive parents. Now 16 - but still without a mother and father - Davion Only has not been found a permanent home and his former case worker Connie Going (right) said the teen is becoming despondent . Emotional plea: The orphan speaks before St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church to ask if someone would become his parent . Unstable childhood: Davion has been in the foster system his entire life, going from one temporary home to the next . 'Something doesn’t seem right. I pray about it,' said his mentor, Richard Prince, 22. 'He’s changed schools and foster homes, and he’s not allowed to tell me certain things. People want to hear a happy ending, but it’s not too clear what’s going on.' More than 300 people contacted the Times last fall saying they couldn’t get in touch with anyone at Davion’s foster agency, Eckerd. The Tampa Bay Times contacted a sample of 40 of those potential parents. Of the 10 who responded, nine said they had not heard from Eckerd. 'We never received a response. This just breaks my heart,' wrote Marcy Theobald of Georgia to the Tampa Bay Times. 'What is wrong with the system?! Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and loved.' 'No one has contacted me regarding Davion,' Shelly Bergman wrote from Ohio. 'I just don't understand it, and I sure hope he does not lose his faith because of that. This sweet young man just wants to be loved by someone. Bring him here, I will welcome him with open arms.' Inspiring: Davion Only at 15 with his case worker Connie Going in September before nervously making his speech before the congregation . Simple wish: Davion Only, the orphan whose plight gripped the nation, attended many interviews across the country about his plight . The paper were also contacted by Sharron Furno and her husband in Michigan. They run a license foster home and have four other adopted children. Out of the 40 people the Tampa Bay Times contacted, she was the only one who had received any response from Ekcerd. 'I received an email stating that they were only considering families in the state,' Furno wrote. 'We offered to pay for his transportation. I offered to go to Florida and spend time with him. Why leave him there when they haven't been able to give him permanency in years?' An Eckerd spokeswoman said Davion was meeting with prospective adoptive families and that the process would take time. Some adoptions experts say they are not surprised that an adoption has taken so long, but other children’s advocates are appalled. 'The poor kid has got to be wondering, ‘Why, out of all those people, does no one want me?’ Dr. Gregory Keck, a psychologist who has spent 25 years working with foster and adopted children said. Davion started to look for his mother, whom he . had never met, using his birth certificate at a local library in June. He found her obituary and discovered that La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud (left) had died aged 55 in Clearwater just weeks before . Biological family: Carolyn Ware, grandmother of Davion Only, spent time with her grandson over Thanksgiving . Wanted him back: Davion's aunt Doris Barnes, pictured left in October, said Davion belongs with his biological family. She said she would take him in - but is not allowed because she has a criminal record . According to Florida's Department of Children and Families, adoption of a child from foster care should take between nine months and a year. 'I know Eckerd is committed to finding Davion the forever family that is perfect for him,' said interim Secretary Esther Jacobo. 'The relationship cannot be forced or rushed.' In December it seemed that the teen was on the brink of a breakthrough. He was introduced to a prospective adoptive family. Eckerd spokesperson Terri Durdaller said, 'He has moved from his group home placement at Carlton Manor to a foster home where he is enjoying getting to know the family. Davion is excited to be spending the holidays with a perspective adoptive family.' However, still the teenage boy has not been found a permanent home. Durdaller said some media had misunderstood. 'The foster and adoptive parents are two separate systems,' said Durdaller. Adorable: Davion, pictured at the age of seven, has been in foster care in Florida for his whole life . 'He is in a foster home, things are more stable there. Sometimes a foster parent will adopt. But he is meeting with different perspective adoptive families. We have 15 years of his life to catch a family up on. That takes time.' Indeed, some adoption experts said that they aren't surprised that Davion still hasn't been adopted. 'It isn't easy,' said Bob Rooks, who directs Explore Adoption, Florida's adoption referral center in Jacksonville to the Tampa Bay Times. 'Of all those 10,000 calls, probably only a small percentage already were qualified to adopt. And at his age, he has his own opinions. Maybe his needs were different from what those families wanted.' Connie Going, the Eckerd adoptions specialist who took Davion to church back in September has called him 'a forgotten child.' 'I have to believe everything is going to be okay in the long run,' said Going. 'I think he just wants it all to be over.' Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him . Indeed, Going now alleges that Davion is not allowed to speak to the media anymore - despite the huge publicity tour that Eckerd allowed him to go on in September. For their part, Eckerd said that Davion has so far met with four prospective families and that they are hopeful the right fit has been found. 'It was decided that one family has the skills needed to care for him,' she wrote in an email to the Tampa Bay Times. 'All qualified families that did express an interest in adopting Davion were explored,' Durdaller wrote in February. She won't reveal where the family lives, or anything about them.","Davion Only, 16, - who captured the heart of the nation last year has still not been adopted .

"From the very first smile to a first tooth, baby steps and heading off to school, it's common for parents to capture the precious moments of their children growing up. But Suman Bansal from Gillingham, Kent, has been photographed every single day of her life since she was born on May 16 1996, totalling an astonishing 6,575 pictures. The student, who turns 18 tomorrow, is used to smiling for photographs taken by her father Munish, who has documented his daughter's life from the very beginning.

The 41-year-old accountant has since captured daughter Suman growing from baby to toddler to schoolgirl to college student. Munish explains: 'I decided to do this when Rita was pregnant.

Munish explains: 'There were couple of occasions I can remember it almost didn't happen. Once my wife thought I had taken the photos and while I was at work they went to stay at their aunt's home for a night. I had to go to her house to take the photos, but luckily they don't live far.

'There was another occasion when I nearly missed them, because I was busy with my work and the children went to sleep, but it suddenly clicked: I had to wake up the children.' Suman says: 'Being photographed every day just feels like any normal day as I have grown up with it my whole life.

"A study has found women who have close relationships with their mother will bond better with their babies . If you had a dysfunctional relationship with your mother it could mean you are more likely to have problems bonding with your own babies. Lower levels of the 'love hormone' oxytocin have been found in women who are not close with their own mother, a report suggests. Women with lower oxytocin levels were more likely to experience negative feelings towards their babies, which include resentment, depression and separation anxiety. The findings could be useful in identifying at-risk mothers and helping them break the cycle so mums can develop these crucial bonds, says first author of the paper, UNSW professor Valsamma Eapen, chair of infant, child and adolescent psychiatry. Professor Eapen and colleagues are now focusing on the application of the theory of attachment to assist women with troubled maternal relationships bond with their babies. 'What we are now developing is attachment-based cognitive behavioural therapy for mums to reframe their own perspectives and attitudes to fix problems that have been pre-programmed,' he said. He anticipates this type of therapy could be used on its own or in combination with a synthetic version of oxytocin, in the form of a puffer or nasal spray. For the study published in PLOS ONE, Professor Eapen and colleagues followed 680 pregnant women at Sydney's Liverpool Hospital. From this group they selected 100 women - half of whom reported troubled relationships with their mothers, while the others reported close childhood ties with their mother. Blood samples were taken before and three months after birth to measure oxytocin levels. The women also completed a range of questionnaires to assess their early relationship with their parents, with others and with their newborn. The group with troubled maternal relationships showed a clear deficit in oxytocin, Eapen said. Oxytocin triggers a dopamine reward response in the brain that promotes newborn bonding as a pleasurable activity. In the baby, this bonding sets lifelong oxytocin release pathways that, if compromised, will influence the child's own future attachment relationships, he said. A group of 100 women were selected - half of whom reported troubled relationships with their mothers, while the others reported close childhood ties with their mother .

"Mickey Rourke is well-known for his role in The Wrestler - yet the Hollywood actor has 'trained like a f****** animal' and shed weight in order to head into the boxing ring 20 years after his previous bout. The 62-year-old was snapped looking trim and in tip-top shape in training ahead of his fight with 29-year-old American Elliott Seymour on Friday. Renowned trainer Freddie Roach has been coaching the undefeated Rourke once more, having prepared him for eight fights in the 90s, ahead of his return to the ring followed a two-decade absence. Actor Mickey Rourke is preparing for his fight with fellow countryman Elliott Seymour . Rourke has decided to step back in the ring after a 20-year hiatus from boxing . Rourke takes a breather during a training session ahead of his upcoming fight in Moscow . Rourke and Seymour will face each other in a five-round middleweight bout at Moscow's Rossiya concert hall on Friday, on the undercard of Ruslan Provodnikov's fight against Jose Luis Castillo. Between 1991 and 1994, American Rourke fought eight times and claimed six professional victories - four by knockout - with two draws. Yet he was forced to retire due to injury, but he insists that Russian Provodnikov inspired him to return. Rourke, quoted on boxingscene.com, said: 'When I saw the fight between Ruslan and Tim Bradley, and saw how he fought, giving everything without reserve, then I came home and said to myself: ""I want to fight again."" 'Provodnikov was my inspiration. Thanks to him I want to fight again. Ruslan Provodnikov (right) inspired Rourke to return to the boxing ring, according to the actor . Rourke trains in Florida ahead of his fight against Frank Harris in 1992 (left) and he poses with former trainer Freddie Roach in 2009 (right) 'When I fought 18 years ago and my trainer was Freddie Roach, I did not train hard. I was smoking, walking and not running. And now I decided that this time back I would train like a f****** animal. 'My last fight ended in a draw, but I'd rather have lost than got the draw. Regardless of the outcome, if I give a hundred per cent I can be proud of what I've done.' He first took to the ring as a 12-year-old and amassed 27 wins from 30 fights as an amateur between 1964 and 1973 before turning his attention to acting. Rourke's original boxing career brought many injuries, forcing him to need reconstructive surgery to his face. However, Rourke is best-recognised for his acting career in which he won a Golden Globe, as well as being nominated for an Oscar, for his starring role as a past-his-prime fighter in The Wrestler in 2008. He has also appeared in films including Diner, Barfly, Sin City, Iron Man 2 and The Expendables. Rourke is set to fight 29-year-old Seymour on November 28 in Moscow .

"It is possibly the first purpose built business to cater for people needing a hug. A premises in Madison, Wisconsin, has been decked out with thick rugs, sofas, cushions and beds to welcome stressed or lonely people with open arms - which will be quickly wrapped around their clients. Five full-time professional huggers are waiting to provide a special kind of intimate touch therapy to help reduce clients' stress levels and feel more relaxed - at a price of $60 an hour. The concept was that clients would be able to book in for an hour of hugs and cuddles for $60 . But their services may not be around for long as it's already been ridiculed and labelled as filthy by some local residents. Staff at the newly-opened Snuggle House offer touch therapy to customers to help them relieve their stress, in a non-sexual way, with hugs and embraces and human touch. But according to the business's Facebook page, a local bar has accused the staff of running a seedy 'bath house' and has refused to serve any of the professional snugglers. 'Maybe it's not Madison's time for a progressive change in the status quo,' the Snuggle House staff say. But the website is still live and inviting customers to book a session to benefit from their progressive form of human therapy. Modelled on one woman's home-business in New York, which offers snuggles for $60 an hour in her own home, The Snuggle House in Madison is taking that concept to a larger business model. Opening this week, Snuggle House manager Hannah told Channel3000com: 'Even just a hug for a couple of seconds can release the oxytocin in your body, in your brain, which has powerful effects to reduce stress.' Eyes wide shut: Model Jessica Dobson enjoys a relaxing session with Jackie, at her home Snuggery, Rochester . Little spoon: Like Jackie, the Snuggle House staff draw the line at intimate touching . She said having a good hug and sharing human contact with another person provides therapeutic value to clients, which many people lack in their normal lives. 'We go right into snuggling, spooning on a bed. It sounds crazy because it's two strangers, it's two people that don't know each other, and in our culture that doesn't happen.' Among the five 'professional snugglers' there is one man, Lonnie. On the business's Facebook page, he is described as 'pure, gentle, strong in his character and he exudes a loving confidence that immediately sets you at ease. 'You can't help but want to give Lonnie a hug - pure bliss radiates from him.' Emily is the youngest professional snuggler on board, but has a 'mature soul that genuinely cares for people and is making a difference by creating a space where you can be comfortable, accepted, understood, appreciated, held and cared for... isn't that what Touch Therapy should be?' it continues. The intimate touch-therapy is based on Jackie Samuel's successful business, in Rochester, New York, which she launched last year to pay for her studies and to care for her young son. The 30-year-old, who can earn up to $260 a day, opened her own cottage up to customers and has had such a positive response she's had to employ an additional snuggler. Jackie cuddles up to 30 men a week as well as a number of women. The Snuggle House in Madison opened its doors to its first clients this week . The cuddling can take place anywhere around her cottage but most clients opt to use her large double bed. They are banned from touching parts of her body covered by underwear, which she wears under pyjamas. In interview last year, she said: 'I think clients come to me for all different kinds of reasons. Some of my older clients, their wives have passed away, and they just need someone to be with, like someone to experience touch with. 'Some of the younger clients are between relationships, some are in problematic relationships, and some people are just really curious and they come to just find out what it's going to be like.' Like the Snuggle House in New York City, Jackie's business is about touch therapy to reduce stress, but she's still accused of more salacious activities. She said she's received a barrage of emails and phone calls accusing her of being a prostitute.","Five full-time huggers are waiting with open arms at the launch of Madison, Wisconsin's new Snuggle House this week .

"Throwing a New Year's Even party? All you need to  look great and guarantee the bash is a hit are some sequins, a spa session and plenty of champagne, according to TOWIE star Amy Childs. The beautician from Brentwood, Essex,  shared her advice for throwing a glitzy event with FEMAIL as she prepared to host her family for Christmas Day for the first time. Amy, 24, said: 'Glam yourself up, do something special and treat yourself to something like a blow-dry or a massage. The hostess needs looking after too.' Scroll down for video . Amy Childs says people are always surprised by how good they look in a floor length sequined dress . The entrepreneur, who has two businesses in Essex, is planning to take the reins this party season by hosting the festivities at her new home. She was at Clothes Show Live in London and Birmingham earlier this month promoting her popular fashion line. 'I am so looking forward to spending Christmas at home with my family,' she said. 'I'm hosting it this year so it'll be the first time at my new house. I'm really nervous about the cooking - the most I ever cook is fajitas.' Fortunately her mother and cousin Harry Derbridge will be on hand. 'My mum will be helping me out though so it'll be alright and Harry's great at being my sous chef. 'l'll have to make an effort though and get dressed up - last year I was in my onesie all day. We will play games and have a really great day. I can't wait.' Amy started her range in 2011 with a line of dresses and now she presents a party dress capsule collection . Amy's top tip for New Year's Eve parties is 'dress to impress'. 'I always say the secret to looking great is feeling great,' she says. 'You can't beat a bit of confidence.' But she says you should still go for something bold and different as the festive season is the perfect time to do it. 'I love New Years and Christmas as it's the only time you can really go all out with the glitz and glam. Reality star Amy said: 'The best tip for throwing a party is to look the part. Glam yourself up.' Amy's clothing line includes form-fitting sequinned cocktail dresses and strappy numbers with lace detail . 'That's why I've brought out some long gowns and some sequin numbers, they are perfect for that special night. 'You will not go unnoticed rocking one of them that's for sure. 'People always ask me if they would look good in one of my sequin dresses and I always tell them to try it and they always love it on them. 'It's good to get out of your comfort zone sometimes with fashion. Also, it means you don't have to worry about accessorising then.' Amy said the key to enjoying any New Year's Eve celebration is to equip yourself with a bottle of Champagne and start the party as early as possible. Amy has expanded the size range of her designs to an 18 because she says curvy girls love her collections . 'I think the best tip for throwing a party is to look the part. Glam yourself up, do something special and treat yourself to something like a blow-dry or a massage. The hostess needs looking after too. 'Then make sure you have plenty of bubbly, snacks and friends. I love having some glam time with the girls. It's so nice to get everyone together and have a great time.' And she's planning to be the perfect hostess this party season by throwing not only a Christmas get-together but a New Year's party, too. She said: 'I'm actually going to host my first murder mystery night before New Year's. I'm really excited I've always wanted to do one.'","Amy Childs, 24, has a massage, champagne and snacks before a party .

"A young man who was intercepted at an international airport in August, suspected of fleeing to the Middle East to join the fight with Islamic State, fronted court on Tuesday. Ahmad Saiyer Naizmand, 19, pleaded guilty to unlawfully using travel documents issued to another person after he allegedly stole his brother's passport. The man, from Sydney's north-west, told authorities he was travelling to Malaysia to help a family member, but sparked interest after he was seen carrying only hand luggage and $6000 cash for a fortnight-long trip,Fairfax reported. Scroll down for video . Ahmad Saiyer Naizmand pleaded guilty to unlawfully using travel documents issued to another person in court on Tuesday . He allegedly stole his brother's passport to travel to the Middle East and join the fight with Islamic State . Naizmand's own passport had been cancelled in 2013 due to security concerns, so on August 6 he purchased a plane ticket with his brother's documents and departed Sydney airport. He told customs officials he was a law student travelling alone to see his uncle in Malaysia, but two days later authorities intercepted him  in Dubai. The 19-year-old was arrested and accompanied back to Sydney where he was charged, and his undoing came when he filled in a returning passenger card with his real details and not the ones on his brother's passport. Naizmand left Sydney airport on the passport, telling authorities he was travelling to Malaysia to help his uncle . He was intercepted at Dubai airport and flown back to Sydney where he was charged . The teenager was born in Afghanistan and moved to Australia in 2004, becoming a citizen in 2007. He worked as a courier.

Magistrate Carolyn Huntsman ordered a report on Naizmand's physical and mental condition be collated ahead of his sentencing, citing the 'nature of the charge.

"Had she been delivered just hours earlier, life may be very different for Cassie Wiggins. The now four-year-old is severely brain damaged, suffers epilepsy and requires around the clock care. Four years on and a hospital has admitted a series of mistakes made by medical staff caring for her mother Sarah Myatt-Maley as she went into labour, are to blame. Cassie was born at the Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham, after her mother was induced having gone 15 days over her due date. Cassie Wiggins, pictured left with her sister Katrina, suffered severe brain damage at birth resulting in her being diagnosed with epilepsy and cerebral palsy . Midwives failed to continuously monitor her heartbeat, and so missed it dropping dangerously low, leaving her brain starved of oxygen. Hospital bosses have admitted had Cassie been delivered hours earlier, the brain damage she suffered would, in all likelihood, have been avoided. But the youngster has been left unable to walk, talk or communicate. She suffers epilepsy and has also been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and visual impairment. The Heart of England NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, is now in the process of negotiating a payout to provide a lifetime care package for Cassie. Speaking out on World Cerebral Palsy Day today, Miss Myatt-Maley, who is Cassie's full-time carer along with her partner James Wiggin, 23, said: 'Our little girl had the worst start to life as a result of the hospital's mistakes and that has been very difficult for us as a family to come to terms with. 'She has been diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy and has severe learning difficulties, epilepsy and visual impairment. 'She cannot walk, talk or communicate in any way with us or her little sister. 'She is now nil by mouth and can only be fed through her gastrostomy tube. 'Cassie is regularly in and out of hospital with chest infections and will be entirely reliant on us for the rest of her life.' The Heart of England NHS Trust which operates the Good Hope Hospital admitted had Cassie, right, been delivered hours earlier, in all likelihood, the severe brain damage would have been avoided . The 24-year-old, who is also mother to two-year-old Katrina,  added: 'We are pleased and relieved that the Trust have accepted responsibility for the mistakes made when Cassie was born. 'Now this paves the way for us to continue to provide her with the very best care for the rest of her life so she can grow and develop.' A spokesperson for the hospital said: 'The Trust admitted liability at the earliest opportunity, following investigations into the events of Cassie's birth. 'An apology letter has been sent and this includes information about lessons learned and steps implemented to improve patient safety. 'Our respective legal teams will now be working towards determining the appropriate level of compensation to ensure Cassie's lifelong needs are met.'","Cassie Wiggins was born at the Good Hope Hospital in Birmingham .

Despite playing in a midfield role, Rooney netted the first two and assisted Robin van Persie's third during the 3-1 victory, and Mata believes that he is more than capable of continuing to excel in a deeper position. 'I think he can play there, yes,' declared Mata in a post-match interview with MUTV. 'He can defend, he can attack, he can pass and he can score goals arriving into the box.

"The Royal Family's footman who enjoyed world-wide fame on the day of the birth Prince George has returned to the Calcutta slum he grew up in. Falling foul of new immigration laws, Badar Azim, a 25-year-old hospitality management graduate, has returned to his family in eastern India, where relatives beaming with pride have welcomed him home. The young graduate accompanied the Queen's press secretary Ailsa Anderson in placing the announcement of Prince George's birth on an easel outside Buckingham Palace last week. Proud: Badar Azim (R), who enjoyed world-wide fame on the day of the birth of Prince George, son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, poses with his brother Muhammad Samir (second from right), father Muhammad Rahim (centre) and mother Mumtaz Begum (L) outside their home in Calcutta, Eastern India today . Mr Azim, right, pictured today back in his home in Calcutta, eastern India, was welcomed home by his family, including his brother, left . But just days later, his visa expired; he was unable to renegotiate his right to work in the country; and he quit his coveted post at the Royal Household. He has now arrived home - a world that perhaps couldn't be more different from the life he had lived last week. Ironically it appears that Mr Azim, whose chronically poor family scrimped and saved every penny they had in order to educate him, has fallen foul of strict new immigration laws because of his notoriously meagre palace salary of around £14,000 a year. Mr Azim, who first came to Britain to study for a degree in hospitality, was one of a number of migrants living legally in Britain on a student visa who were allowed to stay on for two years at the end of their course and work. But under the new points-based system, those applying to extend their visa after it expires must prove they are not taking a job which could be done by a native worker. This means they need specialist skills . which are in shortage among Britons, or for them to prove that they meet . a minimum salary threshold, currently set at around £20,000 a year - . neither of which applied to his palace footman’s post. Nazima Begum, a relative of Badar Azim, shows a graduation photo of him outside the family home in a poor slum area of Calcutta . His life back in Calcutta couldn't be further from his previous world working for the Royal Family, which came to an abrupt end last week. On the ground floor of his family home, a shoe factory can be seen being run from a small room . The main entrance of Mr Azim's family home, centre, in a poor district of the Indian city of Calcutta . A friend of Mr Azim, who flew home last weekend shortly before his visa was due to run out, said: ‘It’s a crying shame, really. You couldn’t meet anyone more dutiful, hard-working and determined than Badar. ‘The new regulations were brought in for a very good reason, we all understand that. Particularly him. It’s just rather ironic that someone like Badar, who follows every regulation to the letter, is prevented from working here, compared to the many thousands who slip through the system.’ Mr Azim found fame on Monday last week when he was photographed with the Queen’s press secretary displaying the official announcement of the birth of the Duke and Duchess’s new son on an easel in the palace forecourt. Resplendent in his black and red livery, it was complete chance that he was chosen for the job. In fact it would have fallen to the footman on duty at that moment, at the palace’s privy purse entrance. ‘The rota changes every three hours and it was a complete fluke. But he was a very popular member of staff and everyone was chuffed to bits for him,’ one official told the Mail. The Royal footman became a well-known face globally when he accompanied the Queen's Press Secretary Ailsa Anderson to place the Royal notice proclaiming the birth of a baby boy to Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge last week . Moment of fame: Days after the arrival of the royal baby, Mr Azim had returned to his family in Calcutta, his visa having expired . His welder father Mohammed Rahim and mother, Mumtaz Begum, who are among nine members of the extended family sharing a shabby two-room home in one of Calcutta’s most impoverished slums, were unaware of the honour and only learnt of his starring role after his picture was reproduced in a local newspaper. Mr Rahim, who has three sons, of which Badar is the eldest, used to regularly go without food in order pay for his son to be educated. He was eventually taken in by the charitable St Mary’s Orphanage and Day School before being sponsored to go to the International Institute of Hotel Management College in the city. The orphanage also raised £10,000 for him to complete his degree at the Edinburgh’s Napier University, from where he graduated in June 2011. He secured his footman’s post in February the following year, a job which involved everything from greeting guests, serving at banquets or receptions and tending to the Queen personally. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured shortly after the arrival of their first child, Prince George, outside the London hospital last week . Prince William carried his son the Prince of Cambridge into a car outside St. Mary's Hospital exclusive Lindo Wing in London, last Tuesday . He was also given a room in staff quarters at the Royal Mews, adjacent to the palace. Although he was forced to sign strict staff confidentiality agreements, proud Mr Azim posted a photograph of himself outside Buckingham Palace on one social network site, as well as shots of royal residences such as Balmoral where he would have been required to work when the Queen was on holiday. According to sources, he loved his job so much he explored the possibility of extending his visa with the palace personnel department, but discovered that due to his low salary and coveted position he was extremely unlikely to be successful. As a result he did chose not reapply to the Home Office and flew back to India four days ago. A source said: ‘It is a real shame as he was a very good member of staff about whom people only have very positive things to say. But it just goes to show that the rules are the rules, no matter who you work for. 'He was here on a two-year visa and always knew it was going to expire. As a result he flew home at the weekend in good spirits and very rightly proud of what he had achieved.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment last night, saying it was policy never to discuss staff members.","Badar Azim, 25, had to leave the country just days after announcing the Royal baby's birth .

"Paul Scholes believes that Liverpool do not have a strong enough squad to rest captain Steven Gerrard, and that the signings they made in the summer were not of the standard required. The Reds captain was left out of the starting line-up in their 1-0 midweek defeat away at Real Madrid, only emerging from the bench in the second half after boss Brendan Rodgers sent out something of a second string XI at the Bernabeu. And writing in the Independent, Scholes compared Rodgers' management of Gerrard with the way Sir Alex Ferguson dealt with him during his twilight years at Manchester United. Steven Gerrard on the bench for Liverpool against Real Madrid on Tuesday night in the Champions League . The Reds captain was left on the sidelines to rest alongside several other Liverpool first team players . 'I won a Champions League final six months before my 34th birthday,' said Scholes. 'You need a manager who knows when to play you and when to rest you. 'Sir Alex Ferguson was brilliant at that. He would tell me that he had a game in mind for me, a week, 10 days ahead and to get myself ready to play.' Scholes also went on to explain that he believes Liverpool's signings in the summer have not afforded them the opportunity to be able to rotate Gerrard effectively. 'Liverpool’s squad is not strong enough to allow Gerrard the rest he needs, even taking into account the performance in Madrid by a mainly second-string XI,' he added. Brendan Rodgers does not have the squad strength to rest Gerrard, according to Paul Scholes . Scholes believes Sir Alex Ferguson knew how to manage him during his twilight years at United . 'In my last few years at United we had the strength in depth that allowed the manager to be selective with my games. But Rodgers clearly feels that he has no alternative with Gerrard. 'Once again we go back to Liverpool’s signings in the summer. They did not recruit well enough. They are relying on the same players as last season to bring them through the big games. 'Rodgers said as much before the Madrid game, that it was time for those who had not been playing to take responsibility.'","Liverpool's summer signings were not good enough, says Paul Scholes .

"Paul Scholes says Manchester United have not been good enough under Louis van Gaal so far, insisting a club of their stature cannot just play well and lose. Writing in the Independent, the legendary former United midfielder admitted he was surprised by how 'subdued' Van Gaal has been in the Old Trafford dugout compared with the way he was at the World Cup while managing Holland. And Scholes also made reference to United's inferior record at this stage of the season compared with the last under David Moyes - United have 13 points from 10 games after their defeat at the hands of Manchester City last weekend. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Manchester United vs Crystal Palace . Louis van Gaal has appeared 'subdued' at times during his tenure at Manchester United, says Paul Scholes .

Van Gaal with assistant manager Ryan Giggs (left) and assistant coach Albert Stuivenberg at the Etihad . 'The scoreline against City might have been more respectable than last season but the performance in the first hour of the game was very poor indeed,' said Scholes. 'This is Manchester United. It is simply not good enough to play well for 20 minutes and lose. 'Louis van Gaal talks about progress. I expected United to have a better record by this stage of the season. Under David Moyes last season United had 17 points from their first 10 games. This time, having spent £150million in the summer, they have 13 points from 10 games.' Scholes also says he has become worried about the apparent downbeat mood of the squad after their underwhelming start to the campaign, especially in the case of record signing Angel di Maria. 'My concern is that the mood among the United players feels a bit low-key,' he continued. 'Preparing for the broadcast of the game in Madrid this week, I watched re-runs of last season and Angel di Maria smiling broadly as he celebrated goal after goal with Cristiano Ronaldo. 'He doesn’t seem to be in the same happy mood at United. It feels downbeat among the team.' Angel di Maria has appeared unhappy at  United compared to when he was at Real Madrid, says Scholes .

Scholes added that the Dutch boss has appeared a completely different character to the man who led Holland to third place at the World Cup, and that it can be tricky at times to decipher his thought process during matches. 'It is difficult to figure out what Van Gaal is thinking during games,' explained Scholes. 'His demeanour doesn’t change throughout. He looks a bit subdued.

"Winter is coming. And with it, the return of the hi-vis ball to the Premier League. With a chill in the air and the clocks going back, all ten of this weekend's Premier League ties, kicking off with West Ham vs Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, will be using the new yellow and purple Nike Ordem Hi-Vis ball. The white Ordem ball was first introduced at the start of this season and, according to Rafael E. Ortega, Nike’s Global Product Manager for Football, it was the result of more than six years’ work. The new yellow Nike  ball which is to be used in the Premier League for the first time this season . It's official name is the Nike Ordem Hi-Vis ball and it will be used throughout the winter . 'The ball has been six years in the making, taking a lot of engineering work and validation,' Ortega told premierleague.com. 'It is the first fuse-welded football. It consists of 12 fuse-welded panels in a three-layer casing system, and a poly-blend wrapped, free-floating carbon latex bladder.' For winter, the colour of the ball and the graphic detail on it are altered to maximize its visibility in darker conditions. And Ortega believes the new Nike ball will help top Premier League stars in those conditions. 'Studies have shown that that 70 per cent of matches played from October to February are under heavy clouds, rain and/or in the dark and under floodlights,' Ortega says. 'We tested what players look for, and of their vision, only 10-15 per cent is used for direct vision, the rest is peripheral. Arsenal pair Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott have been training with the new ball on Friday . As have midfielder Jack Wilshere and forward Danny Welbeck ahead of their trip to Sunderland . 'They are not always looking at the ball but need to find it in their peripheral vision quickly. So with the dark background of the crowds, the green grass and the bright perimeter boards we asked, ""How do you make this ball stand out in this environment?"" 'The colour that contrasts best was yellow. Then we found that the colour on the ball best for the players to see fastest how the ball is behaving, whether it is spinning and how fast was purple. 'So that was how we came to have the ball emblazoned with Nike’s RaDaR, or Rapid Decision and Response, technology. The graphic pattern, which is unique to each league, creates a flickering effect as the ball rotates.'

"Following Rio Ferdinand being fined £25,000 and banned for three games  for failing to respond to a charge of misconduct regarding an abusive tweet, the FA have now collected an estimated £350,000 for Twitter offences since 2011. The Queens Park Rangers defender had reacted to online provocation by using the word 'sket' in a post about the person's mother. Sket is a Caribbean word meaning a whore or promiscuous girl or woman. Since the 2010-11 season, the FA have investigated 121 incidents of inappropriate comments on social media sites. Rio Ferdinand was banned for three games and fined £25,000k by the FA for a tweet . Ferdinand has been charged for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' October 2014: Rio Ferdinand fined £25,000 and handed a three-match ban for failing to respond to charge of misconduct regarding an abusive tweet . September 2014: Benoit Assou-Ekotto fined £90,000 and banned for three-matches for tweeting support of Nicolas Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' gesture in December 2013 . October 2012: Cole fined £90,000 for describing the FA as a 'bunch of t****ts' on Twitter . August 2012: Ferdinand fined £45,000 for retweeting another user referring to then international team-mate Cole as 'choc ice' March 2011: Carlton Cole had to pay £20,000 for comments posted during England's friendly with Ghana . January 2011: Ryan Babel fined £10,000 and given a warning over future conduct for posting a doctored picture of referee Howard Webb in a Manchester United shirt on Twitter . Nearly 60 of those investigations have led to charges, and of those, 33 have involved aggravated breaches of the rules which came into force in 2010-11, before being further tightened last May as part of the FA's inclusion and anti-discrimination plan. And as a part of these new directives, the FA have introduced an educational program which they think will be a vital guard against re-offending - and Ferdinand will be required to attend it within four months on top of his fine and ban. The recent charge was not the former England captain's first social media offence. In 2012 he was fined £45,000 for retweeting  another user referred to his then international team-mate Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice'. VIDEO Ferdinand banned for Twitter taunt . Former Chelsea left back Ashley Cole has also been fined in the past for inappropriate comments on Twitter . And the former Chelsea left-back himself is one of only two players to have been fined more than Ferdinand in the past by the FA for similar offences. In 2012 he was fined £90,000 for describing the FA as a 'bunch of t****' in response to their questioning of evidence he gave in John Terry's trial for racially abusing Ferdinand's brother, Anton. The other was fellow left back Benoit Assou-Ekotto of Tottenham, who was slapped with a £50,000 fine for tweeting his support of Nicolas Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' gesture in December of last year. His message, which was written in French slang and translated to 'I congratulate you on the beautiful quenelle', was later deleted. He was also handed a three-match ban. Other high profile cases of Twitter fines include then Liverpool midfielder Ryan Babel, who was fined £10,000 and given a warning over future conduct by the FA in 2011 for posting a doctored picture on Twitter of referee Howard Webb wearing a Manchester United shirt after the 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford in the FA Cup. Tottenham left-back Benoit Assou-Ekotto was fined for tweeting support of Nicolas Anelka's 'quenelle' gesture . Former Liverpool midfielder Ryan Babel was fined £10,000 in 2011 and warned about his future conduct .

The only way to get out safely is to wear an England jersey and paint your face w/ the St. George's flag!'

The same for Newcastle fans. ‘I’m part of a fantastic squad, I’m trying to do my best, I always will. I will know when it’s time for me to go, or the gaffer or the chairman will.

"Mario Balotelli is being investigated by police over claims he threatened his mother's neighbours for taking pictures of his Ferrari. Greater Manchester Police are looking into Balotelli's alleged use of 'threatening behaviour' after the forward demanded the 'frightened and speechless' woman - whose mother used to cook the player bacon and eggs - stop taking photographs of the £240,000 car he shipped from Italy during the summer. Police were called to a housing estate at 3pm on Thursday in the Wythenshawe area of Manchester, where the 24-year-old was reportedly visiting his mum Rose Barwuah.

The woman, who asked not to be named, was visiting her mother at the time and said the former City striker left her ‘frightened and speechless’ by the incident. 'I hadn’t even taken any pictures. He came and looked through the front window. He was wearing a black beanie hat and he gave me a bit of a fright,' she said. 'Then when I came to the door he was getting right near me and pointing in my face saying, ""You took pictures of my car"" and I kept telling him ""I didn’t, I didn’t"". 'Then he said, ""If you do anything with them, I’ll come back, I’m warning you"", which to me was a direct threat. I don’t care who he is, I won’t be threatened like that by anyone.

"Don't they know they're meant to be at each other's throats this weekend? Manchester United pair Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo were all smiles with City star Pablo Zabaleta as they took part in a joint Premier League Kicks charity event. But the Argentines all did seem incredibly chummy considering the tension that's building in the city ahead of one of the biggest clashes of the season. Manchester United pair Angel di Maria (left) and Marcos Rojo and Man City defender Pablo Zabaleta (right) The Argentine trio were taking part in the event ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday . The trio, representing the Manchester United Foundation and City in the Community, also put some young fans through their paces at a training session on Friday afternoon - while Di Maria showed off a few flicks and tricks of his own. They may very well have been reminiscing about their run to the World Cup final in the summer with Argentina, even though Di Maria missed the latter stages through injury. But you imagine things will be a lot more hostile when they take to the pitch at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, with four points and five league positions currently separating the sides. For Zabaleta, who has been at City since 2008, the derby is something he has experienced many times before. However, for the United pair it will be a new world entirely, although Di Maria's El Clasico experience with Real Madrid, and Rojo's time playing for Sporting Lisbon against Benfica in the Derby de Lisboa   should stand them in good stead. Di Maria puts a young Manchester United fan through his paces during the event in Manchester . And the forward watches as another attempts a few of her best flicks and tricks . The Argentine then showed off a few of his best moves as the lucky youngsters stood back and admired . After years of domination over their city rivals, United have been forced into City's shadow in recent clashes. City have won the last three  derbies in the Premier League, and you have to go as far back as December 1970 for the last time they made it four in a row in the top flight. United have not won a derby since 2012, when a Robin van Persie free-kick gave them a last-gasp 3-2 victory. Louis van Gaal will have captain Wayne Rooney - the top scorer in Manchester derbies - at his disposal following suspension but Manuel Pellegrini will be without playmaker David Silva, who has been ruled out for three weeks with a knee ligament injury.","Angel di Maria, Pablo Zabaleta and Marcos Rojo all smiles at charity event .

Tottenham are currently without long-term absentee Kyle Walker . And fellow right-back Kyle Naughton went off injured against Southampton on Sunday . Yedlin also revealed that he had received an offer from Roma, but chose White Hart Lane because he believed he would better suit the Premier League.

"The Chelsea Supporters Trust has released a statement highlighting concerns over the re-emergence of plans to have an overseas game incorporated into the Premier League season. Recent reports suggest that the Premier League are considering the possibility of playing one of the 38 games in the schedule on foreign territory. It follows plans that originally surfaced in 2008 of an additional 39th top-flight game, but the prospect was widely condemned and shelved. Diego Costa celebrates after scoring the second in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal . Chelsea fans waiting outside Stamford Bridge for the team bus to arrive ahead of the Arsenal game . And now Chelsea Supporters Trust has have spoken out against the plans, arguing that it would impact on the integrity of the Premier League. They also believe many fans will be left significantly out of pocket, saying that: 'die-hard supporters would want to travel to such games, thereby adding significantly to the several thousand pounds a season they already spend following their teams.' Read the full statement from Chelsea Supporters Trust on overseas Premier League games below... The Chelsea Supporters Trust board notes with deep concern the re-emergence of the 'overseas Premier League game' idea reported in the media. We see this concept as fundamentally flawed for a number of reasons and oppose its introduction to top flight football in England. The 39th game idea (an extra Premier League game to be played overseas) which was first mooted and widely condemned in 2008 and subsequently shelved by the Premier League has, inevitably, re-emerged under a new guise, whereby it is apparently proposed that one of the 38 games each Premier League team plays would be played overseas. Playing a fixture overseas would inevitably impact on the integrity of the Premier League. Playing football in a different climate and time zone could potentially impact on a team's performance. 'Home' advantage would also disappear, giving those clubs playing a nominal 'away' game an advantage across the season, as such games would essentially be played on neutral grounds. Supporters' season tickets would be devalued as they would decrease in number to eighteen games and for some teams the 'missing' game would be one of their most attractive fixtures. Inevitably, die-hard supporters would want to travel to such games, thereby adding significantly to the several thousand pounds a season they already spend following their teams. This development would also have a negative impact on match going supporters in the UK who, let us not forget, are the lifeblood of the game. While they may no longer be seen as essential to clubs' income, they play a fundamental part in making the Premier League the spectacle that it is. Without full grounds producing fantastic atmospheres week in week out, the Premier League 'brand' would be severely weakened. Furthermore, there would inevitably be an impact on players with yet more mid-season and in most cases, long distance, travel. It is also possible to envision a scenario where half-fit stars are encouraged to play in such games to ensure sponsors and local supporters are kept happy. There must also be concerns that this is the thin end of the wedge and that, over time, more domestic league games could be played abroad. Simply because American Football (a single country sport at the professional level) plays international games at Wembley does not mean football, already a global game, needs to flaunt itself in the same manner. Pre or post-season friendlies and small tournaments are the logical formats for overseas matches. It is easy to understand the desire of overseas Chelsea supporters (and sponsors) to see the team play, but this cannot be allowed to interfere with the integrity of the Premier League, with title races and relegation fights often being settled by a single goal or result. There is a difference between friendly matches against strong opposition and competitive games played as part of one of the top leagues in world football that Premier League clubs would do well to understand. It is ironic that the flotation of this unwelcomed idea has arisen during the 'Leaders In Sport' conference currently taking place at Stamford Bridge. If football had leaders who actually understood the game's history and the need for competitive integrity they would take the opportunity to kill this idea once and for all. It is probably naive to expect Chelsea or other clubs to make a statement at this stage on something that is clearly being discussed behind closed doors. It is to be hoped however, that if this unwanted and ill-thought out concept is formally discussed at a Premier League meeting, representatives from Chelsea and other clubs would consider the competitive integrity and heritage of the English game and the impact on match going supporters, rather than another chance to earn even more money than they already do. It is clear from the media and social media networks that a large number of supporters are vehemently opposed to the idea. Richard Scudamore, the Premier League chief exectuive, and his acolytes seem to see money as an end in itself. The current television broadcasting deals mean that the English game at the top level is already awash with money. The fact that so much TV money goes directly to players and their agents is a matter for regret and remedial action by clubs, not shoulder-shrugging. The board of the Chelsea Supporters Trust has little or no faith in the FA, UEFA or FIFA in protecting the game's best interests, but would hope that on this occasion, they will step in and ensure that playing domestic league games overseas is not allowed to happen. We will be working with national supporter organisations and fellow Premier League supporters trusts to build coherent and effective opposition to this proposal.

"The First Lady has already given her seal of approval to Jason Wu's new diffusion line, having worn it on the campaign trail in October. Now finally, just weeks before the January 7 launch, full lookbook images from the Miss Wu collection have been released. The line takes a strong lead from the Sixties, with retro shifts and ladylike detailing. First look: A lookbook for the new Miss Wu line from Jason Wu has finally been released ahead of next month's launch - though Michelle Obama wore a piece back in October at an event in Cincinnati, Ohio . Model Meghan Collison looks every inch the ingenue in the lookbook images. Hemlines, waistlines and hemlines are all at the higher end of the scale, striking a balance between flirty and demure. Prints are key from Michelle Obama's green pixellated shift to butterflies and op-art rings. But the best part, for fans of the designer, is that price points will be significantly lower than the mainline collection. Ladylike: The designer believes his new lower-priced line will bridge a gap in the market . Affordable: Prices for Miss Wu start at $195 for a sleeveless silk bow blouse to $795 for a black leather jacket . Prices start at $195 for a sleeveless silk bow blouse to . $795 for a black leather jacket. A . garment from the Jason Wu collection, meanwhile, averages at about $1,700. Intended to be 'playful and a little younger' than his main collection, Mr Wu, 29, told WWD: 'Instead of just doing ""Jason Wu-for-less"", the idea is to explore the other side of myself. 'I always see Jason Wu [the . collection] as my aesthetic, my design sensibility. Miss Wu is my . personality. It was really fun to explore that facet of who I am - . slightly more downtown, and with a more relaxed attitude.' Here come the girls... Miss Wu is intended to be 'playful and a little younger' than his main collection . Prints charming: Textiles reign supreme, from polka dots and stripes to butterflies . The collection will be available exclusively at Nordstrom for its first year - a huge coup for the store. Jeffrey . Kalinsky, the retailer's executive vice president of designer . merchandising, explained: 'There’s a large audience who wants to wear . his clothes. 'This . collaboration has an appeal not just to a younger set of women, but to a . broader set of women and at prices that are approachable. Role play: Model Meghan Collison looks every inch the ingenue in the lookbook images . Shift in time: The Sixties silhouette is a style signature for the collection . Save the date: The collection will be available exclusively at Nordstrom from January 7 . 'What’s great is that while feeling different from the Jason Wu signature collection, it still clearly has Jason’s design DNA.' Mr . Wu added that the new line will bridge a much-needed gap in the market. 'One thing that is rare in the contemporary market is more . feminine, girlier clothes,' he said. 'It tends to be more hard-edged, or too young. I felt this is something that brings a little bit of softness.'","Miss Wu launches on January 7 at Nordstrom, with prices starting at $195 .

"A bomb threat seemingly targeting the president of Sony Online Entertainment forced an American Airlines flight from Dallas to San Diego to divert its path to Phoenix Sunday. The threat was posted to Twitter and specifically called out Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley. '@AmericanAir We have been receiving reports that @j_smedley's plane #362 from DFW to SAN has explosives on-board, please look into this,' read the tweet from hacker 'Lizard Squad.' A bomb threat seemingly targeting the president of Sony Online Entertainment forced an American Airlines flight (not pictured) from Dallas to San Diego to divert its path to Phoenix Sunday . The threat came after the Sony Playstation Network service was taken down by 'an attempt to overwhelm our network with artificially high traffic,' the company said. The Dallas Morning News reports 'Lizard Squad' - which could be a single person or a collective - took credit for the hack. Sony maintains no personal data was compromised. Smedley later wrote on Twitter that his flight had been diverted but he did not comment on the bomb threat. The tweet from hacker Lizard Squad was sent shortly after the person or group claimed credit for an attack on Sony's Playstation Network . An image of an e-Ticket for his flight along with the confirmation number was also posted to Twitter, and taken down, asking Smedley if it was a ticket for his flight. Fox 5 San Diego reports that the FBI is now investigating the tweet. Operations at San Diego's Lindbergh Field were normal as of 4:45 p.m., said Rebecca Bloomfield of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority.","Tweet was sent by hacker Lizard Squad claiming there were explosives on the flight .

"It is the stuff of science fiction - a white T-shirt that can be fully immersed in red wine and come out clean, and bone dry. But now there is a $20 product, launching this week at Home Depot, that can do just that. NeverWet, a superhydrophobic spray, actively repels liquids to protect everything from your favorite cream dress to a pair of white sneakers from ever getting stained again. Scroll down for video . Magic: NeverWet, a superhydrophobic spray, actively repels liquids to protect everything from your favorite cream dress to a pair of white sneakers from ever getting stained again . 'This is a game changer,' said Jim Stinner, vice president of marketing for Rust-Oleum, the company distributing NewWet. 'Everyone is going to want to try it out.' The product was designed by Ross Technology, which was faced with the challenge of fixing rusting pipes under the sea, and set to work to . find a substance that would coat the metal to prevent rusting. Available to buy: The $20 product is available at Home Depot, and will soon be available at other U.S. stores . In . the course of their experimentation, they found the resulting . substance - a silicone-based spray - could have infinite uses in the . worlds of fashion, technology and engineering. Not only is NeverWet, the first such . consumer product to enter the market, impervious to any liquid . substance, including oils, mud and condiments, but it actively deflects . moisture leaving no trace whatsoever on its surface. In a video released by the company, a . man in pristine white deck shoes - one coated in NeverWet, one simply . plain canvas - jumps into a muddy puddle. After swishing his feet around in the muck, he steps out to reveal the uncoated shoe covered in a thick layer of mud. As . the NeverWet coated shoe emerges however, the mud shoots off the . surface, leaving the canvas bone dry and completely unmarked. In another demonstration, chocolate sauce is poured onto the coated shoe, which slips off leaving not a trace. And on a treated white T-shirt, engine . oil, apple sauce and orange juice form convex fluid globules that speed . off the surface of the fabric. Not only could footwear companies use . the coating to thoroughly waterproof their shoes, but a fabric with . such effective repellant qualities could prove priceless to firms . producing ski equipment, sailing and fishing gear or wet weather . clothing, as well as being used as a protector for upholstery, . tablecloths or napkins in restaurants. No more stains: NeverWet, the first such consumer product to enter the market, is impervious to any liquid substance, including oils, mud and condiments, and actively deflects moisture . Waterproof: In this demonstration, mustard is poured onto the coated shoe, which slips off leaving just a few beads behind, which then brush off . And its uses can extend beyond simple fabric treatment too. Studies . have proved it is also efficient at completely waterproofing gadgets; . protecting iPhones and iPods that previously would have been rendered . useless after being submerged in water. In an experiment by Ross Technology, an iPhone was left in a bowl of water for 30 minutes - and came out unscathed. Stain free: On a treated white T-shirt, chocolate sauce forms convex fluid globules that speed off the surface of the fabric . Repelling soda: The coating could prove priceless to firms producing ski equipment, sailing and fishing gear or wet weather clothing, as well as being used as a protector for upholstery, tablecloths or napkins in restaurants . How it works: NeverWet creates microscopic nano-particles across the surface it coats, when liquids hit the superhydrophobic barrier, it forms a nearly circular bead that causes the liquid to shoot off the surface . This . so-called superhydrophic substance was developed only in the last . decade as scientists tried to mimic the water-repellent properties of . the Asian lotus plant. Research found that, contrary to expectations, smooth surfaces actually encourage liquids to stick. NeverWet creates microscopic nano-particles across the surface it coats. When . water hits the coating's superhydrophobic barrier, it forms a nearly . circular bead that either causes the liquid to shoot off the surface or . never cling there in the first place. Water damage no more: Studies have proved it is also efficient at completely waterproofing gadgets; protecting iPhones that previously would have been rendered useless after being submerged in water . Among other things, it can be used on metal, wood, masonry and aluminum as well as fabric, leather and canvas. According to Ross Technology, applications of NeverWet can be as diverse as making toilet plungers water repellant so they attract less bacteria, forming anti-corrosive coatings on metal, and as an anti-icing device, protecting surfaces prone to freezing, such as aeroplanes, piping and electrical transmission lines.","NeverWet, $20, is a waterproofing product now available at Home Depot ."
"It has brought her derision from all angles and built up debts of more than £1million. But it seems Gwyneth Paltrow is not ready to give up on her lifestyle website Goop just yet. The firm, which started out as the actress’ personal blog on how to live a ‘whole and healed life’, is set to launch its own range of clothing and beauty products to turn around its flagging fortunes. Paltrow, 42, has hired American lawyer Lisa Gersh to heal the brand’s image following years of negative publicity. Gwyneth Paltrow, 42, has hired American lawyer Lisa Gersh to heal the image of her website, Goop,  following years of negative publicity . Critics have mocked Miss Paltrow’s tendency to champion expensive products such as £46 homemade fishfingers, £3,000 wardrobe essentials and a £15,000-a-week holiday in her favourite French chateau. Now, as well as giving its 150,000 subscribers tips on fashion, food and décor, it will offer them the chance to buy Goop-branded merchandise. Miss Gersh, who is now Goop’s chief executive, told the Sunday Times: ‘The good stuff, the lifestyle advice and the travel tips, will still be there. But we will be selling our own Goop brand of clothing and beauty products online. ‘This is a chance to develop a massive new type of e-commerce company that was just not possible when I started out in the 1990s.’ 'Conscious uncoupling': Gwyneth coined the term when she announced her separation from Chris Martin on the site - to much mockery . Miss Paltrow has stiff competition in the celebrity lifestyle market. American actress Blake Lively, 27, recently started her own blog, Preserve, and took a dig at the Oscar-winning star in a recent interview, saying: ‘I’m not trying to show you the perfect life or the aspirational life. It’s real life. It’s not about me.’ Actress Jessica Alba, 33, is also moving into the lifestyle market and accused Paltrow of ‘catering only to the rich’. Critics have mocked Miss Paltrow’s tendency to champion expensive products such as £46 homemade fishfingers, £3,000 wardrobe essentials and a £15,000-a-week holiday in her favourite French chateau . Now, as well as giving its 150,000 subscribers tips on fashion, food and décor, it will offer them the chance to buy Goop-branded merchandise . And last month, American cookery author Martha Stewart, 73, said Miss Paltrow ‘just needs to be quiet’ about home economics, adding: ‘If she were confident in her acting she wouldn’t be trying to be Martha Stewart.’ Last week, financial reports revealed Goop has built up huge debts and falling shareholders’ funds, with a deficit of £177,788 in 2012 increasing to £523,200 last year. The firm said its directors ‘are of the opinion that predicted profits will provide sufficient resources to enable the company to continue trading in the foreseeable future’. In March, Miss Paltrow announced her separation from her husband Chris Martin. She and the Coldplay singer – who have two children Apple, 10, and Moses, eight - have ‘consciously uncoupled’, she said.","Paltrow, 42, has hired American lawyer Lisa Gersh to heal the brand’s image .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will travel to one of the smallest and most remote nations in the world as part of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations next year. Tuvalu, a tiny group of islands in the South Pacific, is delighted to host an official visit by the couple when larger rivals such as Australia and New Zealand will miss out. Its consul to the UK, Iftikhar Ayaz, told the Mail yesterday that his country’s 10,400 inhabitants were ‘very excited’ that such ‘a small and faraway state’ had been chosen and promised William and Kate a welcome they would not forget. On tour: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit Malaysia, Singapore, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu . When the Queen and Prince Philip . visited Tuvalu in 1982, they were carried from their ship to the shore . in garlanded canoes hoisted on the shoulders of dozens of handsome young . men. ‘I have had the . pleasure of meeting the Queen on several occasions and she still . remembers the experience very vividly indeed,’ said Mr Ayaz. ‘Of course . the Duke and the Duchess can expect the same welcome.’ Buckingham Palace yesterday announced dozens of visits by members of the Royal Family to mark the Queen’s 60 years on the throne. Her Majesty’s own itinerary will take in ten regions of the UK between March and July, as well as hosting four days of events over an extended bank holiday weekend in June. Remote: The tiny Tuvalu island in the Pacific Ocean is at risk of disappearing in the next 50 years because of rising sea levels . Beautiful: Tuvalu's capital Funafuti. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be visiting the atoll next year . The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of . Cornwall will travel to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Papua New . Guinea. Charles will make additional trips to the Channel Islands and . Isle of Man. Prince Harry will undertake his first . solo tour on behalf of the Queen, taking in Belize, Jamaica and the . Bahamas probably in early March. Prince Andrew will visit India; Princess Anne Mozambique and Zambia; the Duke of Gloucester the British Virgin Islands and Malta; and the Duke of Kent the Falkland Islands and Uganda. Ten years on: Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh ride along the Mall in an open top car on their way to watch a parade in celebration of the Golden Jubilee in June 2002 . First royal visit for 30 years: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh tour Tuvalu, a Pacific Island, in 1982. Next year the Duke and Duchess and Cambridge will follow in their footsteps . Prince Edward and his wife, the Countess . of Wessex, have bagged what is considered to be one of the ‘plum’ trips . – touring the Caribbean, including Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, . Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the . Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, with an extra visit to Gibraltar. But it is the trip by William and Kate, which also takes in Malaysia, Singapore and the Solomon Islands, which is likely to attract the most interest. No firm dates have yet been agreed but it is likely to take place in the autumn. ‘We are very proud of having the Queen as our head of state and were happily planning to celebrate her jubilee when this wonderful news came through,’ added Consul Ayaz. ‘A few years ago there was a move to declare Tuvalu a republic, but the reaction of the public was so strongly against it that it was quickly dropped. ‘As the islands that make up Tuvalu are very remote – some are 500 kilometres apart – the news will take a while to filter through, but all of the residents will be delighted. Prince William and Kate raised more than £1m for severely malnourished children in famine-hit east Africa through a charity visit. When the royal couple visited a Unicef supply centre in Copenhagen, traffic to the UK charity’s website rocketed by 226 per cent. Extra interest in the charity meant they were able to rake in extra money in donations – enough to buy two weeks' worth of high protein emergency food for 100,000 of the most acutely malnourished children. The fundraising total combines thousands of public donations as well as 'in-kind' support, including free cargo space from leading airlines British Airways and UPS, as well as life-saving supplies to the value of £520,000 from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge helped pack boxes of emergency health kits on their visit to help the 320,000 children who are at imminent risk of death. During the visit, William said: 'An incredible amount is being done. Unicef is leading the way and doing a fantastic job, but sadly there's lots more still to do, and that's why we're here today.' David Bull, executive director of Unicef Uk, said: 'Their Royal Highnesses are helping to save and transform children's lives in East Africa.'","Prince Harry will make his first solo overseas trip on Queen's behalf .

"The most common form of cancer in women, breast cancer, is easier to treat than the most common form in men, prostate cancer . Women are far more likely to survive cancer than men are, research shows. Nearly twice as many women as men are still alive at least ten years after being diagnosed. This is largely because the most common form of cancer in women – breast cancer – is easier to treat than the most common form in men, prostate cancer. Research by Macmillan Cancer Support shows that 260,000 women are still alive ten years after their cancer diagnosis, compared with 140,000 men. The charity says this is partly because almost 80 per cent of the 50,000 women diagnosed annually with breast cancer can expect to live at least another decade. In contrast, just over 65 per cent of the 41,000 men diagnosed with prostate cancer will survive for this length of time. Men are also more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer, which has only a 10 per cent survival rate. There are nearly 23,000 new cases of cancer in men each year compared with 19,000 in women.In general, men are notoriously reluctant to see a doctor whenever they are ill. This means that if they have cancer, they are more likely to ignore the symptoms and it may not be picked up until it has spread and is untreatable. Ciaran Devane, of Macmillan Cancer Support said: ‘Breast cancer is the big success story of cancer. Since the 1980s, the average survival rate has been above ten years. Lots of people get it, almost exclusively women, but they will live a long time. ‘But if you compare that with the big male cancer, prostate, survival isn’t as good.’ The findings of the study will be presented tomorrow at the National Cancer Intelligence Network conference in Brighton. There were 288,600 new cancer diagnoses in England in 2010, the latest figures available, compared with 246,400 in 2000 and 212,700 in 1990. MPs have previously warned that men with prostate cancer receive far worse care than women with breast cancer . But cancer survival rates have quadrupled in the past 40 years. MPs have previously warned that men with prostate cancer receive far worse care than women with breast cancer. A report in 2009 by the All Parliamentary Group on Cancer said that treatment for men was less prompt and they were not offered as much support. Figures also show that while breast cancer research receives an average of £815 per case diagnosed, prostate cancer only gets £417. Last week, Macmillan published figures showing that by 2020, one in two Britons will develop cancer at some time in their life.","Breast cancer is easier to treat than prostate cancer .

"It's not only soldiers who need to train for life-threatening situations on the battlefield. Experts have created a learning tool for army medics so they, too, can practice treating the wounded before putting themselves in the line of fire. A 360-degree virtual training programme has been created using the Oculus Rift headset to prepare the medical teams for the realities of war. Warning: Graphic content below. Scroll down for video . Using an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, medics-to-be can be plunged into chaotic life on the battlefield. This is a view of the scene from the 'controller's' point-of-view but medics could get close-ups of wounds in future as well as learn how to look out for enemy fire . A terminally ill grandmother with cancer is using an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset to experience life outside a virtual Italian villa, from her armchair in Seattle. The idea to use virtual reality to give Roberta Firstenberg an outdoor experience without leaving her home came from her granddaughter, Priscilla, who works as an artist designing video games. She emailed Oculus about her idea and they sent her a headset, for free, for Roberta to use. Before long, Roberta was walking through a virtual Tuscan villa, trying to catch butterflies and admiring the sunshine. 'Her favorite part was just being able to walk up and down the stairs again of the villa in the Tuscany demo,' said Priscilla. 'I guess we take a lot of things for granted.' The technology uses ‘head tracking’ to enable the user to look around the virtual world they have entered, just as they can in real life. Essex-based developers Plextek Consulting and Bespoke VR created the virtual simulation using the Facebook-owned technology, so trainee medics can assist injured soldiers in life-like battle scenarios. The simulation emulates pre-hospital care on the battlefield and allows trainees to negotiate and prioritise clinical needs. This is designed to teach teamwork and decision-making skills within high-stress ‘under-fire’ scenarios, a spokesman explained. The prototype, which was funded by the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), has been ‘well received’ and virtual reality training could become common practice in few years. A 360-degree virtual reality training programme for medics working on the battlefield has been created using Oculus Rift (pictured), which is a headset originally developed for gamers that covers the eyes with two screens presenting a 3D view that looks as though users have entered the world they are playing in . The technology uses 'head tracking' to enable the user to look around the virtual world they have entered, just as they can in real life. Medics could face frightening scenes of gruesome injuries (pictured) in their training one day . The simulation technology also has the potential to be applied to other scenarios, such as people training to help with natural disasters or medical training for paramedics. ‘Our work with DSTL is enabling us to revolutionise the way medical treatment can be applied in the battlefield, while creating a multitude of opportunities for advanced health training applications across a breadth of industries,’ said Collette Johnson, medical business manager at Plextek Consulting. ‘The innovative technology used in immersive reality solutions enables such a real-life perception that the education and response level of the trainee can be greatly heightened. ‘Any negative psychological effects could also be improved, by preparing the trainees better with a more accurate vision of what they could experience during military conflict.’ The simulation emulates pre-hospital care on the battlefield (pictured) and allows trainees to negotiate and prioritise clinical needs, teaching teamwork and decision-making skills within high-stress 'under-fire' scenarios, a spokesman explained .","The virtual reality training ground has been created using Oculus Rift .

"Intel has unveiled a walking, talking robot that can sing, translate and even tweet - and can be printed at home. The white 2 foot tall robot, called Jimmy, is being turned into a 3D printable plan chipmaker Intel will release later this year. Partners will sell components that cannot be 3D-printed, such as motors and an Intel Edison processor, in kits and it is hoped the robot will cost less than $1,600. Scroll down for video . Intel's Jimmy the Robot: the walking, talking robot on Wednesday made from 3D-printed parts that will be available to consumers later this year, if they are willing to assemble it with a kit that costs around $1,600 . Intel is planning to release the plans online for free, and allow people to modify them. Partners will sell components that cannot be 3D-printed, such as motors and an Intel Edison processor, in kits. The robot has a metal 'skeleton' but 3D printed body parts can be attached to it. Parts can be customised so each robot is unique. A high end industrial version pre-assembled will also be available for around $16,000 and is designed for researchers and industrial applications. The company's Chief Executive Brian Krzanich was accompanied by 'Jimmy' on stage at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. The white 2-foot tall robot shuffled onto the stage, introduced itself and then waved its arms. Intel describes Jimmy as a research robot, but the company intends to make 3D-printable plans available without charge for a slightly less advanced version, and partners will sell components that cannot be 3D-printed, such as motors and an Intel Edison processor, in kits. Jimmy can be programmed to sing, translate languages, send tweets and even serve a cold beer. Under Krzanich, who took over a year ago, the chipmaker is trying to be an early player in emerging technologies like smart clothing, after coming late to the mobile revolution and making little progress in smartphones and tablets. Its strategy includes engaging tech-savvy do-it-yourselfers and weekend hobbyists working on everything from Internet-connected baby blankets to robots and drones. Owners of the robots will be able to program them to perform unique tasks. They can then share the programs with other owners as downloadable apps. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California, hopes the price for the robot kits will fall below $1,000 within five years. Intel is planning to release the plans online for free, and allow people to modify them. 'What's so exciting about the open source model is the public gets involved in developing this first generation of crowd-sourced, consumer robots,' said Intel Researcher Brian Johnson, who is leading the project. 'We all get a say in what they do, and together we will come up with far more ideas, more innovation, and more creativity.' Johnson’s team has already shared the template for a pilot robot, Jimmy, with 10 teams at various universities, to download, print, and program their own smart mascots. Separately on Wednesday, entrepreneur Bill Gross announced plans for a 3D printer that would sell for $149, far less than devices that now typically sell for $1,000 or more.","White 2 foot tall robot is being turned into a 3D printable plan .

"The dollar has reached a four-year high just hours before a report showed another jobs boost. Shares also closed at record levels last night - the second in a row - ahead of a report saying the U.S. gained 214,000 jobs in October and unemployment fell from 7.2 to 5.8 per cent in a year. The findings were in today's Employment Situation report, a snapshot of the economy released every month by the Department of Labor. Record highs: The dollar has hit a four-year high and shares closed at record levels on two indexes (file photo) U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez claimed the figures meant 10.6million jobs have been created in 56 months. However, he added: 'There is still widespread economic inequality. Wages haven't kept pace with productivity. We are in the middle of the strongest run of private-sector job growth in 16 years, but we need the same broadly-shared prosperity that we had in the late 1990s. 'Today's rising tide is only lifting some boats, while too many others are struggling to stay above water. We have to do more.' Although many would have been part-time positions, the average number of weekly hours per employee held steady from 34.4 in October 2013 to 34.6 in October 2014, the report said. An average week's earnings rose slightly in the same period from $828 to $850. Investors said the jobs figure, although far from a record, would be another solid showing after gains of 248,000 jobs in September, 180,000 in August and 243,000 in July. The news prompted the dollar to hit a four-year high this morning, reaching 88.174 on the FOREX index. The rise of 0.1 per cent in a day brought it to its strongest level since June 2010 and marked a 12 per cent boost in just six months. And two of America's biggest share indexes closed at record highs last night as investors put their faith in the claims. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 69.94 points (0.40 per cent) to 17,554.47, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 7.64 (0.38 per cent) at 2,031.21. The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also added 17.75 points (0.38 percent) to reach 4,638.47. The boost is a piece of long-awaited good news for President Obama - though his Republican rivals are likely to take some of the credit. Stocks had also hit record levels on Wednesday as investors credited the Republicans taking control of the Senate - and hopes they would be more business-friendly. One analyst told USA Today the markets have historically thrived with a Republican Senate and a Democratic President. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, added the mood among investors was 'fairly positive'.

"Spectators at air shows are usually impressed by the boom of fighter jets flying overhead. But aeroplane fans at the Berlin Air Show were also wowed by the eerily quiet flight of Airbus Group's fully-electric aircraft. The prototype two-seater made its maiden flight in March but only took to the skies in front of the public last week. Scroll down for video . Eerily quiet: The E-Fan prototype electric aircraft, a 31.2-foot (9.5 metres) wingspan plane that Airbus is touting as the precursor to hybrid passenger aircraft, makes a demonstration flight above Merignac airport, France . The E-Fan uses a pair of motors with ducted fans powered by a battery. The batteries fixed to the wings are the sole power source for the two motors. An electric motor in the main wheel provides extra power during acceleration and taxiing to prevent a drain of power while the plane is on the ground. It has a wingspan of 31.2 feet (9.5 metres) and weighs 1,212 pounds (550 kilograms) It can fly for about half an hour at 110 miles (177 kilometres) per hour. There is currently a back-up battery for landing and a parachute in case the pilot goes out of range. Just like on an electric car, a gauge on the dashboard tells the pilot how much energy remains in the batteries before the aircraft has to be recharged. One of the main landing gear wheels has a small electric motor that can propel the airplane up to 35 miles (55 km) per hour to maximise flight time. It was designed from scratch, from its electrical propulsion and energy management system to its safety features. Airbus hopes that the prototype is one step towards the aerospace industry using regional jets powered by hybrid electric engines, which would slash its carbon dioxide emissions. The . development of a regional plane, seating between 70 and 90 people that . can take off and land using electric power, could take between 15 and 20 . years, Airbus Group Chief Technology Officer Jean Botti told reporters . in Munich. The company's E-fan aircraft is powered by two electric motors with a combined output of 60 kilowatts. Airbus . says it is suited for short missions such as pilot training and . aerobatics and can currently run on its lithium-ion polymer batteries . for half an hour, reaching speeds of up to 110 miles (177 kilometres) per hour. The future today: The E-fan was designed from scratch around its electrical propulsion from its safety features to its energy management system. It is hoped the technology will be used in commercial aircraft in the future to slash carbon  dioxide emissions . Engineers aim to double that fly time, but Mr Botti said: 'They [the batteries] are causing us a lot of headaches.' He declined to comment on how much the group was investing in hybrid and electric technologies. The two-seater E-Fan will be built at Bordeaux in southwest France and production could start at the end of 2017. Mr Botti said he would like to see a prototype for a regional jet in 2030.

"A four-year-old who was dragged to his death when carjackers sped off with his leg still trapped in his seat-belt in Johannesburg pleaded for his mother to save him in the moments before he died. 'Mommy help me,' were the last words Chantel Morris heard from her panicked son Taegrin as he struggled to free himself before the car sped off with him hanging helplessly out of the door on Saturday night. Morris had loaded Taegrin and his eight-year-old sister into their VW Golf outside their grandmother's house in Boksburg east of Johannesburg when three hijackers held guns to her head. Four-year-old Taegrin, pictured left, screamed for his mother Chantel (right) as he was dragged away . 'I asked them to let me get my children out, they could take whatever they wanted, but please let me have my children. I went to the back to pull out Taegrin,' Morris said. Her daughter managed to climb out of the car, but as Morris tried to free the boy from his seatbelt his foot became stuck and the hijackers sped off, ripping him out of her hands. 'I grabbed him and I held him and I pulled him,' she told Eyewitness News,' but he was stuck in the seat belt.' Fighting back tears, she added: 'I don't know how many times they drove over him. They drove over my child.' Crime-ridden: South Africa, in particular its largest city Johannesburg (pictured), has some of the world's highest rates of violent crime, and carjacking is common . Morris and witnesses to the hijacking ran after the car screaming, but it did not stop. It was later found four kilometres away, with the boy's battered body next to it. Police have offered a reward of 50,000 rand ($5,000 or £2,750) for information leading to the arrest of the hijackers. The little child’s father, Elwin, promised that if police didn’t find those responsible he would find them himself and kill them. 'I feel like killing these people,' he said. 'God must help the police catch them first before I do.'

So it seems appropriate that the star’s extensive jewellery collection has sold for more than £80million – making it the most expensive private hoard in history. Though bidders were still battling to snap up the sought-after items last night, the auction had already smashed the £45.8million record set in 1987 at a sale of the Duchess of Windsor’s gems in Geneva. Over two evenings of frantic bidding at Christie’s in New York, some items sold for as much as 150 times their reserve price. The most expensive was a 50-carat pearl, diamond and ruby necklace called La Peregrina. Listed for between £1.2million and £1.9million, it went for £7.5million on Tuesday night, breaking two world records – the highest sum for an historic pearl and for a pearl jewel. Other items shot up by more than £1million in 30 seconds as fierce bidding wars erupted over the most coveted lots. It was a fitting tribute to the last of the Hollywood greats, who died in March aged 79.","The reality star splashed out on three diamond Lorraine Schwartz bangles .

Long journey: The group was picked up by the liner near Paphos, on Cyprus' west coast, as they attempted to sail the 1,500 miles to Italy . The situation was finally resolved shortly before dawn today after Cyprus deployed an elite team of riot police to bring them down. After a few minutes of tense negotiations, the refugees agreed to leave. Cypriot officials said that the 345 people, including 52 children, were to be taken to a reception center near the capital Nicosia where they would be given shelter and medical attention until authorities determine what will happen to them.

Gambia's president has demanded a United Nations investigation into the 'manmade sinking, capsizing' of boats carrying migrants to Europe, saying 500 citizens of his African country had died in such incidents in the past five years. Migrants have been streaming out of North Africa, mostly lawless Libya, in rickety boats in rising numbers for years. Many head for Italy, a gateway to the European Union. Nearly 3,000 of those migrants have drowned in shipwrecks this year. Earlier this month, some 500 migrants are believed to have died after traffickers rammed their ship off Malta's coast, leaving only nine survivors. At the U.N. General Assembly, Gambian President Yahya Jammeh described these incidents as 'the very dangerous, racist and inhuman behavior of deliberately causing boats carrying black Africans to sink.' 'The U.N. must conduct a full and impartial investigation into this manmade sinking, capsizing of these boats carrying young Africans to Europe,' Jammeh said. 'If these boats are able to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea only to sink on European coasts, we must find out what deadly mysterious force exists on the European Mediterranean coasts that causes boats carrying young Africans to disintegrate and sink upon arrival,' he said. Dozens of civil defense officials, medical staff and police were waiting at dockside to receive the people after the cruise ship had docked. A small group did disembark from the ship to negotiate with authorities, authorities said, but talks broke off with the group returning to the ship. But several adults holding small children were seen leaving the cruise ship, while one man led away by police in handcuffs. The cruise ship had answered a distress signal from a trawler sailing some 50 nautical miles off the Cyprus coast in poor weather conditions, the Cyprus defence ministry said. Salamis Cruise Lines Managing Director Kikis Vasiliou said his company received the request from Cypriot Search and Rescue authorities to assist in the rescue operation on Thursday morning while the cruise ship was returning to Cyprus from the Greek islands. But he said the unexpected turn of events is costing his company 'several hundred thousand' euros after the cancellation of a trip by 300 mainly Russian tourists to Haifa, Israel aboard the cruise ship that was scheduled to depart late Thursday. The Cypriot Defense Ministry said the boat had 'most likely' set sail from Syria loaded with 'civilian refugees.' They will remain at a reception center near the capital Nicosia until authorities determine what will happen to them. The Mediterranean has been plagued by shipwrecks in recent months involving migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees says more than 2,500 people have drowned or been reported lost at sea this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. In one of the deadliest wrecks on record, a ship carrying some 500 migrants - including Syrians, Palestinians and Egyptians - was deliberately sunk by traffickers off Malta earlier this month, leaving just 10 known survivors. In trouble: The cruise ship had answered a distress signal from a trawler sailing some 50 nautical miles off the Cyprus coast in poor weather conditions . New liner work: The liner had been en route from the Greek island of Syros to Limassol when it received a call to assist in the rescue operation . Cyprus is located about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the shores of war-ravaged Syria. In August 2012, seven Syrians, including two children, drowned when the boat they were sailing to Cyprus to escape the conflict in their homeland sank off the island's northern coast. Thousands of migrants fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and northern Africa attempt to cross the Mediterranean Sea in rickety boats in search of safe havens in Europe, and hundreds have died at sea.","345 people, including 52 children, were rescued from boat near Cyprus .

"A fighting bull has gored three people and spread panic in a hair-raising final running of the bulls at Spain's San Fermin festival. Hundreds of people dashed alongside the six bulls through the cobblestone streets of Pamplona in Monday's eighth run. There were spine-chilling moments when one bull, named Olivito, separated from the pack and charged three runners, two Australians and a Spaniard, pinning them against walls and barriers while trying to gore them. One of the injured Australian men is understood to be James Metcalfe, a 24-year-old from Grenfell in New South Wales who was gored in the right thigh. He has since been released from hospital. Scroll down for video . Australian man Jason Gilbert, 26, underwent surgery at a hospital in the northern town of Pamplona after being gored in the chest, abdomen and thigh on Monday . The 595kg bull became separated from the herd after it slipped and crashed headlong into a wall. Seeming disorientated, it then charged a group of runners who thought they had avoided the stampede. It then set its sights on one young man, believed to be a 26-year-old Australian called J.G., repeatedly butting him and pinning him against a wall. As the man lifted his legs in a bid to protect himself from the onslaught, the bull thrust one of its horns through his left thigh, tearing off a large chunk of flesh. He managed to escape to safety behind a wooden barrier, but not before the furious bull gored him again as he clambered over the fence at which point he was taken to hospital for surgery. Festival spokeswoman Lucinda Poole described his condition as 'grave' having suffered injuries to his chest, abdomen and his left thigh. 'He is being operated on in traumatology in the hospital complex and they say the condition is grave, which translated to English probably means extremely serious,' Ms Poole said. A 21-year-old Spaniard from Navarra was also gored three times. The bull broke away from the pack and charged several runners, including Mr Gilbert who is seen hear being lifted off the ground by the bull's horns during the eighth run at Spain's famous San Fermin festival . Fierce: The bull attacked the man with such ferocity that he sent bits of wall flying as he rammed the helpless participant . Mr Gilbert stood little chance against the bull's mighty horns, which ripped his shorts and left a large chunk of skin missing . As the Australian thrill-seeker lifted his legs in a bid to protect himself, the bull thrust its horn through his thigh . Navarra hospital's Dr. Oscar Gorria said two men were gored in the legs. He said five people were also hospitalized for other injuries. There were no immediate details on their identities. Fellow Australian Nicholas Kordahi told Sydney radio station Triple M's The Grill Team he was also at the running of the bulls when he was charged by one of the beasts, sustaining injuries to his side and ankle. Mr Kordahi shot some footage of the moment the animal made its way towards him and his friends, and described it on air as 'one of the most adrenaline fueling scariest moments I've ever had in my life. Me and my two friends were shaking before the gun went.' Several men have already been gored by bulls during this year's festival but Monday's run, the eighth and last, was particularly brutal. One of the six bulls broke away from the others and charged several runners, lifting two of them off the ground on its horns and ripping through their legs. Other participants tried to distract the bull and eventually herded it into the ring. The runs usually last between three to five minutes, and the bulls then appear in an evening bullfight, when they are killed. Mr Gilbert had only arrived in Pamplona just 24 hours before he was injured with three friends he is travelling around Europe with . He said he was in pain and knew his leg was wide open when he was being chased by the bull . Pinned down: But the bull again caught him and pinned him to a barrier as others tried to ward him off . Finally, with the help of a few police officers, Mr Gilbert managed to get behind the fence where he was promptly taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries . The bull would not give up its hunt for the man who had so infuriated it and continued ramming him against the fence . Five other men were injured in Monday's run. Nine men were still in hospital on Sunday recovering from injuries from the past week, according to the Navarra region's hospital authorities. One of them was Bill Hillmann, an American who co-wrote a book called 'Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls of Pamplona'. He was gored in the thigh after he tripped and fell. Many participants drink and dance all night before taking part in the 8 a.m. (0600 GMT) event, though local authorities have tried to clamp down on reckless behaviour in recent years. Ouch!

Stampede: Hundreds of people dashed alongside the herd of bulls through the cobblestone streets of Pamplona in Monday's eighth run . Brutal: Several men have already been gored by bulls during this year's festival but Monday's run, the eighth and last, was particularly brutal . Dangerous selfie: Spanish media said over the weekend that Pamplona police were looking for a young man who was seen trying to get a dangerous 'selfie' photo of himself on his phone as he ran inches in front of the bulls . Tradition: The fiesta dates back to the 13th century and was depicted in Ernest Hemingway's novel 'The Sun Also Rises' Spanish media said over the weekend that Pamplona police were looking for a young man who was seen trying to get a dangerous 'selfie' photo of himself on his phone as he ran inches in front of the bulls. He could be fined up to 3,000 euros ($4,100) if they find he endangered other runners. A 27-year-old man from Madrid was the last person to be killed during a Pamplona bull run after being gored in the neck in 2009. There have been 14 fatalities over the past century at the fiesta, which dates back to the 13th century and was depicted in Ernest Hemingway's novel 'The Sun Also Rises'.","There were spine-chilling moments when one bull, named Olivito, separated from the pack and gored three runners .

"Killer: Joseph Wood gasped for nearly two hours as he was being executed for murdering two people . Bungling Arizona executioners administered at least two full doses of a lethal injection cocktail to double-murderer Joseph Wood in a desperate attempt to finish him off, it emerged today. Doctors and government officials watched the convicted killer let out hundreds of blood-curdling 'snorts and gasps' for 117 minutes as the deadly drugs coursed through his veins on Wednesday. But when the first batch did not achieve the desired effect, they decided to pump a second dose into his body, Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Zick told Reuters. Even so, state corrections officials pushed back against any suggestion the procedure was botched, saying Wood was fully sedated and never felt any pain. Wood - who gunned down his former . girlfriend and her father in 1989 - was put to death at the state prison . in Florence after losing a last-minute appeal. Witnesses described seeing Wood struggling to breathe and gasping for air almost the entire time. But, during an emergency hearing conducted mid-execution at the request of defense lawyers, Zick told a judge that the condemned man was unconscious and having an 'involuntary' reaction, according to a transcript provided by defense attorneys. 'That involuntary reaction continues, but I am told that Mr. Wood is effectively brain dead and that this is the type of reaction that one gets if they were taken off life support,' Zick said, according to the transcript. 'The brain stem is working but there's no brain activity.' Defense lawyers, in demanding an outside review into what they say was 'the most prolonged bungled execution in recent history,' want to determine in part which drugs were used and in what amounts. 'It is important for the people of Arizona to get answers, and only an independent investigation can provide the transparency needed following an execution cloaked in secrecy that went wrong,” defense attorney Dale Baich said. He said later he had no information about the second dose of drugs given to his client: 'It appears from what the AG said that at least a second dose was administered. We expect this information to come out during an independent investigation.' It comes as Arizona Senator John McCain, himself tortured for years while held captive in a Vietnamese prison, branded the execution as a form of 'torture.' Inhumane: . Arizona Republic justice reporter Michael Kiefer describes how Wood . gasped and breathed heavily before he died. Media witnesses agreed they . had never seen an execution like it . 'I believe in the death penalty for . certain crimes. But that is not an acceptable way of carrying it out. And people who were responsible should be held responsible,' McCain told . Politico. 'The lethal injection needs to be an indeed lethal injection and not . the bollocks-upped situation that just prevailed. That’s torture.' McCain . spent five years in the 'Hanoi Hilton' - a nickname for the Vietnamese . prison camp where he was held captive - after his plane was shot down. He eventually was released, but was tortured repeatedly while a prison. As Wood gasped for air, his lawyers filed an emergency appeal in federal court demanding that it be stopped. The appeal said Wood was 'gasping and snorting for more than an hour' Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne's office says . Wood was pronounced dead at 3.49pm - an hour and 57 minutes after the . execution started. Wood was sentenced to death for . killing Debra Dietz and her father, Eugene Dietz, in 1989 at the . family's automotive shop in Tucson. A relative of Wood's victims said she did not believe the killer had suffered - especially compared to the victims. Desperate: Arizona's highest court on Wednesday temporarily halted the execution of the condemned inmate so it could consider a last-minute appeal. Wood's death was one of a number of botched executions . 'You don't know what excruciating is,' Jeanne Brown told KTLA after the execution. 'What’s excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood. This man deserved it. And I shouldn’t really call him a man.' Before the murders, Wood . and Debra Dietz, 29, had a tumultuous relationship in which he periodically . assaulted her. Dietz tried to end their relationship and got an order of . protection against Wood. On . the day of the shooting, Wood went to the auto shop and waited for . Dietz's father, who disapproved of his daughter's relationship with . Wood, to get off the phone. Once the father, 55, hung up, Wood pulled out a . revolver, shot him in the chest and then smiled. Wood . then turned his attention toward Debra Dietz, who was trying to . telephone for help. Wood grabbed her by the neck and put his gun to her . chest. She pleaded with him to spare her life. An employee heard Wood . say, 'I told you I was going to do it, I have to kill you.' He then . called her an expletive and fired two shots in her chest. Torture: Senator John McCain says the nearly two hours it took to execute Joseph Wood amounts to 'torture' Relief: Jeanne Brown, whose sister and father were killed by Wood in 1989, is pictured at a news conference after the execution as her husband Richard Brown listens. She said that Wood had deserved to die . On Wednesday, Wood looked around the . death chamber and glanced at the doctors as they made preparations for . his execution, locating the proper veins and inserting two lines into . his arms. Wood then uttered his final words, smiled at the victim's family members and made eye contact with a deacon. Just . after declaring that he was at peace with his death, he smiled at the . deacon, but for a second, a subtle look of panic took over his face. Protest: There are growing calls in the US for the death penalty to be repealed . Officials administered the lethal drugs at 1:52 p.m. Wood's eyes closed. About 10 minutes later, the gasping began. Wood's . jaw dropped, his chest expanded, and he let out a gasp. The gasps . repeated every five to 12 seconds. They went on and on, hundreds of . times. An administrator checked on him a half-dozen times. Troy Hayden, who witnessed the execution as he covered it for KSAZ , likened Wood’s breathing to a 'fish gulping for air'. 'It was tough for everybody in that room,' he said. Wood could be heard snoring loudly when an administrator turned on a . microphone to inform the gallery that Wood was still sedated, despite . the audible sounds. As the . episode dragged on, Wood's lawyers frantically drew up an emergency . legal appeal, asking federal and state courts to step in and stop the . execution. 'He has been gasping for more than an hour,' the lawyers pleaded in their filings. 'He is still alive.' The . Arizona Supreme Court convened an impromptu telephone hearing with a . defense lawyer and attorney for the state to decide what to do. Wood . took his last breath at 3:37 p.m. Twelve minutes later, Arizona . Department of Corrections Director Charles L. Ryan declared Wood dead. The state court was informed of the death while its hearing was underway. It . took one hour and 57 minutes for Wood's execution to be completed, and . Wood was gasping for more than an hour and a half of that time. Arizona Governor Jan Brewer had told . the Department of Corrections to review the process, saying she was . concerned by the length of time it took to carry out the injections. Still, she said, there was nothing unlawful about the death. She . said: 'One thing is certain, however, inmate Wood died in a lawful . manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer. Going forward: A fence surrounds the state prison in Florence, Arizona where the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood was scheduled to take place on Wednesday . 'This . is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he . inflicted on his two victims — and the lifetime of suffering he has . caused their family.' After the death, a federal judge ordered officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood's execution for an investigation. The lengthy . execution quickly re-ignited the death penalty debate as critics . denounced it as cruel and unusual punishment and said it raised grave . questions about the two-drug combination Arizona uses for lethal . injections. Wood had . waged an intense, last-minute legal battle that challenged the state . over key information about who supplies the drugs and how they are . administered. The execution came after the U.S. Supreme Court denied several appeals seeking details about the state's execution methods. There have been several controversial . executions recently, including that of an Ohio inmate in January who . snorted and gasped during the 26 minutes it took him to die.","Double murderer Joseph Wood took two hours to die on Wednesday .

"With Iran planning to reduce its reliance on oil, work into solar power is gaining a foothold. And now one group of Iranian students is hoping to showcase their research by driving a solar-powered car through the American heartland. A 19-strong team is preparing to bring its Havin-2 car - which translates to Brilliant Sun - to compete in the American Solar Challenge in July. A 19-strong Iranian team is preparing to bring its Havin-2 car - which translates to Brilliant Sun - to compete in the American Solar Challenge in July. Its 15ft (4.5m) carbon fibre chassis resembles a giant door. The four wheels that lurk beneath its sprawling white body (pictured) are the only clue it is a car at all . Top speed: 100 mph (160 km/h) Weight: 485lb (220 kg) Dimensions: 15ft (4.5m) long, 6ft (1.8m) wide and 4ft (1.1 m) tall . Solar cells: 65 square feet (6 square meters) Batteries: Lithium-Ion - can keep car going for four hours . Powered by the sun, its 15ft (4.5 metre) carbon fibre chassis resembles a giant door. The four wheels that lurk beneath its sprawling white body are the only clue it is a car at all. Last month, the flat, rectangular vehicle was tested alongside slightly larger gas-powered motor vehicles on a stretch of highway in Iran's mountainous north. With final preparations now in place, the group plans to compete in an eight-day, 1,700-mile (2,700-kilometre) race that will take it from Austin, Texas to Minneapolis, Minnesota. The flat, rectangular vehicle was tested alongside slightly larger gas-powered motor vehicles last month on a stretch of highway in Iran's mountainous north . With final preparations now in place, the group plans to compete in an eight-day, 1,700-mile (2,700-kilometre) race that will take it from Austin, Texas to Minneapolis, Minnesota . Iran is ramping up its renewable energy efforts according to  the Iranian Energy Minister, Hamid Chitchian. The country’s goal is to add 5,000 MW of new solar energy and wind energy capacity by the year 2018. Professor Beitollah Akbari, who manages the Havin-2 team, said he believes the project could help advance the cause of clean energy in a country where generous state subsidies have encouraged massive use of motor vehicles. ‘Our young scholars and university students can significantly contribute to Iran's economic growth, particularly in the field of clean energies that can help us reduce dependency on oil,’ he said. Earlier this year, Tehran cut a portion of its energy and fuel subsidies in order to bring prices closer to international levels - nearly doubling some prices at the pump. Subsidies have kept the cost of petrol artificially low, and were blamed for making it cheaper than bottled mineral water. The cuts aim to release government money for production and infrastructural projects in order to improve efficiency and bolster the economy. Transportation expert Masoud Mohajer said solar energy could potentially be a good investment for the government, given that the country has more than 300 sunny days a year to power the cells. The Havin-2 reached a top speed of 70 mph (110 kilometres per hour) during testing, but the team believes it is capable of 100 mph (160 kilometres per hour) in competition. Farkhondeh Naziri, 20, in charge of electronics on the project, from Qazvin Azad University near Tehran, said the team plan to optimise the car's absorption of solar energy based on the route it  takes. ‘We first do a simulation of the actual race course and study the weather conditions there. Then we try to calculate what the sun's angles would be during the eight-days,’ she said. The 485lb (220 kg) vehicle is 15ft (4.5m) long, 6ft (1.8m) wide and 4ft (1.1 m) tall, with a cockpit-like canopy for the driver. With photovoltaic cells covering some 65 square feet (6 square meters) of its surface, the car's lithium-Ion batteries can drive it up to four hours. Located 100 miles (160 kilometres) from the capital, Qazvin has 300 days of sunshine a year. Good roads stretch for miles across a largely barren desert landscape. To ensure a level playing field in the United States, all teams will rely on 516 photovoltaic panels, or solar cells, made in America and patched together in Germany. But each entrant has developed their own Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) system, which connects inverters, battery chargers and other devices to optimise the car's performance. The skill and key to winning is understanding the course and detecting the angles of the sun's rays during a day's racing, starting at 9am and ending at 6pm local time, with each team using four drivers. Farkhondeh Naziri (left), 20, in charge of electronics on the project from Qazvin Azad University, said they plan to optimise the car's absorption of solar energy based on the route it plans to take . The Havin-2 reached a top speed of 70 mph (110 kilometres per hour) during testing, but the team believes it is capable of 99 mph (160 kilometres per hour) in competition . The car's predecessor, the Havin-1, ranked 17th in the 2011 World Solar Challenge in Australia. But while a host of technical challenges may have been overcome, the students now have a far bigger problem – sending the car to the U.S. ‘We are really worried about it,’ said Mohammad Saadatmand, the mechanical leader of the team from Qazvin Azad Islamic University, west of Tehran. ‘To think that we might not make it is almost too terrible to contemplate.’ Standing in their path are the sanctions imposed on Iran for a nuclear programme that some believe masks an intention to develop an atomic bomb. The restrictions make transporting the Havin-2 by air cargo a logistical nightmare. ‘This car has made us crazy,’ said Alireza Malmali, the team's electronics specialist who has now switched his attention to trying to find an air carrier. ‘I wish governments across the world would accept we are researchers, not terrorists.’ Students from the Qazvin Azad Islamic University, west of Tehran, assemble the solar powered Havin-2 vehicle for a test drive. With photovoltaic cells covering some 65 square feet (6 square meters) of its surface, the car's lithium-Ion batteries can drive it up to four hours . While a host of technical challenges may have been overcome, the students now have a far bigger problem – sending the car to the U.S. sanctions on Iran make transporting the Havin-2 by air cargo difficult . The cargo arms of Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa all refused to carry the Havin-2, citing fears of breaching sanctions. A letter from the U.S. Treasury Department appears to confirm that the car does not require special authorisation if is being used ‘in a public conference, performance, exhibition or similar event’. The solar challenge organisers, however, were unable to navigate the regulations. ‘It has been very difficult,’ said Sue Eudaly, the event's team coordinator. ‘We went to a senator, who directed us to the State Department who then sent us to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Ultimately, I guess we were not a high priority case.’ Last ditch negotiations with a Tehran-based carrier are now underway. Even then, a delivery date no later than 1 July, which the carrier is reluctant to guarantee, leaves less than two weeks for the Havin-2 to clear customs in time for the start of the race. The Iranian team is confident it can hold its own against the mostly American field, which includes the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Beyond the solar challenge's aim of promoting clean energy, a sense of national pride is also palpable among Mr Saadatmand and Mr Malmali, who both took part in the same event in Australia three years ago. ‘We want to show we are good, maybe even better than the rest of the world,’ Mr Malmali said.

"Nicolas Sarkozy has said left-wing judges are out to humiliate him after he was charged with corruption and influence peddling after 15 hours of questioning. The 59-year-old became the first former French president to be taken into custody. He was quizzed under police guard over allegations that he tried to use his influence to . thwart an investigation of his 2007 election campaign. Scroll down for video . Allegations: Nicolas Sarkozy arrives with police by car at the financial investigation unit in Paris to be presented to a judge as part of a probe into corruption allegations involving the former French President . Questioned: Sarkozy was quizzed under police guard over allegations that he tried to use his influence to thwart an investigation of his 2007 election campaign . Speaking today he said being taken into formal police custody, an unprecedented move against a former French leader, had been intended to humiliate him. 'There was an intention to humiliate me by summoning me in the form of a formal detention,' Sarkozy said in a televised interview, denouncing corruption-related charges laid against him as 'grotesque'. He questioned the impartiality of one of the judges who charged him, Claire Thepaut, noting that she was a member of the left-wing SM judges' union. 'Is it normal to chose... a magistrate who belongs to the SM?,' he asked. Sarkozy said he would declare 'at the end of August or beginning of September' whether he planned a return to politics by running for the leadership of the centre-right main opposition UMP party. 'There is no question of renouncing (politics) for me,"" he said, adding: 'When it comes to your country, you have duties.' Nicolas Sarkozy (right) smiles as he gets into a car outside his offices in central Paris today . Nicolas Sarkozy pictured today has said left-wing judges are out to humiliate him . French prosecutors later announced that Sarkozy was 'mis en examen' - put under formal investigation in what amounts to being charged. It means his case will be examined by a judge, who will determine if whether there is sufficient evidence for him . to be charged. News of the formal investigation is the . latest blow to Sarkozy's hopes of a 2017 political comeback after his 2012 election . defeat by Socialist rival Francois Hollande. Nicolas Sarkozy, pictured at a state dinner in 2010 with wife Carla Bruni, had hopes of a political comeback . Sarkozy is being investigated on . suspicion he used his influence to secure leaked details of an inquiry . into alleged irregularities in his victorious 2007 election campaign. He . is accused of influence peddling, corruption and benefiting from 'the . breach of professional secrets,' the prosecutor's office said. Influence-peddling can be punished by up to five years in prison and a fine of 500,000 euros (around £400,000). Nicolas Sarkozy gets into a car to be taken to the offices of the judicial police in Nanterre, Paris where he is being held in police custody . Sarkozy was . informed of the formal investigation during the early hours this morning by . investigating magistrates after he had been held  in police custody until nearly midnight . on Tuesday. He . arrived at police offices in the Paris suburb of Nanterre just after . 8am and was placed ‘garde a vue', a legal term meaning he is a suspect . in a criminal inquiry. Sarkozy's detention over accusations of influence-peddling at France's highest court followed the arrest on Monday of two magistrates and Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog. Mr Sarkozy arrived by car at the anti-corruption office in Paris this morning to be questioned by investigators into suspected 'influence-peddling' The . former leader is said to have offered one of the judges, Gilbert . Azibert, a job in return for inside information on the so-called . Bettencourt affair. This . was a case in which Sarkozy was accused of illegally accepting millions . from Liliane Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress and France's richest . woman, for his election campaign in 2007. The case has now been dropped. Officials . also believe Sarkozy was illegally tipped off that his phone had been . tapped by those investigating whether he received money from the late . Colonel Gaddafi of Libya. Sarkozy . is said to have used a special mobile phone, registered under the name . ‘Paul Bismuth', to speak to his lawyer because he suspected he had been . bugged. Soon . after he stepped down as president in 2012, the Paris home he shares . with his third wife, former model Carla Bruni, was raided by . anti-corruption police. As president, he had enjoyed immunity from prosecution, but this came to an end with his defeat by Socialist candidate Francois Hollande. Sarkozy, who has indicated he will run for re-election in 2017, has always insisted that he is innocent of any wrongdoing. But yesterday's developments are a disaster for his political ambitions as he faces being formally charged with influence-peddling, which carries a maximum prison sentence of a decade. His remand in custody is unprecedented. Jacques Chirac, once Sarkozy's mentor and his predecessor as president, was found guilty of corruption in 2011. It had been alleged that Mr Sarkozy was helped in his winning 2007 election campaign with up to 50 million euros (£40million) provided by former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, pictured . But he was never held in custody and received only a two-year suspended sentence for embezzling public funds when he was mayor of Paris. Conservative friends of Sarkozy leapt to his defence, with MP Christian Estrosi saying the judiciary ‘have never imposed such treatment on a former president, with such a surge of hate'. Others suggested the arrest was politically motivated, with Left-wing officials trying to humiliate him. But there is no doubt Sarkozy's behaviour as president raised suspicions. Within a few months of coming to office in 2007, he had invited Colonel Gaddafi on a state visit to Paris, on which he was honoured as a ‘Brother Leader'. Alleged evidence, including statements from leading Libyans, has suggested more than £25million was transferred from Gaddafi's account to Sarkozy's coffers. Yet it was Sarkozy, with Prime Minister David Cameron, who in 2011 ordered the airborne assault on Gaddafi that eventually led to his overthrow. In a separate case, relatives of those killed in a bombing in Pakistan in 2002 have filed a complaint against Sarkozy for allegedly violating a duty to secrecy during an official investigation.","Former leader held for questioning over suspected 'influence peddling'

"At least 14 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens more were wounded when rebels stormed their checkpoint in east Ukraine today. It is the deadliest clash yet in the conflict in Ukraine and saw three armoured vehicles destroyed and a series of other lorries and vans burned out.

Today's battle will cast a shadow over Ukraine's presidential vote this Sunday, which insurgents have vowed to derail. The authorities in Kiev see the vote as a chance to defuse tensions and stabilise the country. But they admitted that it will be impossible to stage the vote in some areas in the east. They say election officials and voters have faced intimidation and threats from the rebels. Many in the Russian-speaking east resent the government in Kiev, which seized power in February after mass protests toppled Ukraine's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych. Eastern Ukrainians see the new regime as 'fascists' bent on oppressing Russian speakers and targeting ethnic Russians. But they are also said to be growing increasingly exasperated with the rebels after finding themselves in the crossfire of battles with the Ukrainian army.

President Vladimir Putin's order to withdraw Russian forces massed along the border with Ukraine was today being carried out, according to the Russian defence ministry. Nato said it had seen no signs of movement . As fighting raged in Ukraine, Russia's Defence Ministry said today that its forces were leaving border regions as part of a military pullout ordered by President Vladimir Putin. It said that four trainloads of . weapons and 15 Il-76 heavy-lift transport planes left the Belgorod, . Bryansk and Rostov regions on Wednesday. The troops are to reach their . permanent bases before June 1, the ministry added. Many clients of Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian state gas company Gazprom, are ready to switch their payments from U.S. dollars to euros and yuan, CEO Alexander Dyukov said today. Any switch away from the use of U.S. dollars as a global reserve currency could lead to massive shockwaves in the American economy. Mr Dyukov added there could be problems borrowing abroad because of western sanctions imposed on Russia after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March but said that Gazprom Neft had fulfilled its borrowing plan for 2014. The announcment came as a businessman facing EU and U.S. sanctions was appointed Russia's business envoy to China. Gennady Timchenko said he expects a flurry of deals in a shift away from the West. He said: 'You know what Putin said? He introduced me (to Chinese businessmen) by saying now Mr Timchenko is the head of our business council. 'In other words - it is my words here - he is our main man for China. From the point of view of business relations. That was yesterday.' Nato has estimated that Russia has 40,000 troops along the border with Ukraine. The U.S.-led alliance insisted earlier this week that it had not yet seen any signs of a Russian withdrawal. Putin scoffed at Nato's scepticism, saying yesterday that the pullout involving such large numbers of troops would take time. 'Those who aren't seeing it should look better,' he said. He said the pullout will be clearly visible in satellite images. The announcement went further than an earlier step by the Russian leader two weeks ago, when he said the troops retreated from the border to shooting ranges. Putin's pullout order and his remarks welcoming Ukraine's presidential election this Sunday seemed to reflect an attempt to ease tensions with the West over Ukraine and avoid a new round of Western sanctions. He has ignored the plea of some of the rebels in eastern Ukraine to join Russia after independence referendums dismissed as a sham by Kiev and the West. The U.S. and the European Union imposed travel bans and asset freezes on members of Putin's entourage after Russia annexed Crimea in March. Western politicians have warned that more crippling sanctions against entire sectors of the Russian economy would follow if Russia tries to grab more land or attempts to derail Ukraine's election. Moscow has supported a peace plan brokered by Switzerland and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It proposes a broad amnesty and the launch of a national dialogue that focuses on the decentralisation of government and upholding the status of the Russian language. Russia also has pushed for guarantees that Ukraine will not join Nato and has advocated constitutional reforms that would give broader powers to the regions. Some say this would maintain Moscow's clout in the Russian-speaking eastern regions that form the nation's industrial heartland. Journalists picket the Ukrainian embassy in Moscow to demand the release of journalists working for RT and Moscow-based Life News who have been detained by forces loyal to the government in Kiev . As clashes continued in the east, the Kremlin angrily protested the detention of journalists working for Russian media outlets in Ukraine. Graham Phillips, a British national working for state-controlled English language television station RT, was detained earlier this week by Ukrainian forces. Two correspondents with Moscow-based Life News television are still in Ukrainian custody and facing accusations of aiding armed insurgents - a claim that Putin has dismissed as 'rubbish and nonsense.'","More than 30 Ukrainian soldiers also wounded, some gravely, witnesses said .

"Gunmen fired indiscriminately at homes, burned down a church and raided a police station in two attacks on Kenyan coastal towns overnight, killing at least 29 people. Twenty of the victims were killed in an attack in the Gamba area of Tana River county, where gunmen rushed the police station and freed suspected al-Shabab militants. Another nine were killed in a separate raid at the Hindi trading centre in neighbouring Lamu county, near the town of Mpeketoni where 65 people were killed last month.

"A teenage girl has been left severely disfigured after two older girls allegedly slashed her with knives reportedly because they were jealous that she was so attractive. Julia Alvarez, 15, was walking to her home in Argentina when she was approached by the two sisters who started kicking her and punched her to the ground. The attackers - named locally as Flor, 18, and Maira, 16 - then repeatedly slashed her face and body, leaving her covered in blood. She was later found by passersby who called an ambulance. According to the victim's statement, the pair told her: 'Everyone says you are pretty. You won't look pretty when we have finished with you. People will call you Chucky.' Horrifically scarred: Argentinian teenager Julia Alvarez has been left severely disfigured after two older girls reportedly slashed her face in a jealous rage because she was so attractive . Ambushed: Her attackers repeatedly slashed her face and body as she walked home . Chucky is a heavily-scarred doll from the Child's Play horror series which is inhabited by the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray. One cut on the young girl's back alone required 20 stitches and she had needed dozens more on her face to put the flaps of skin back together. Police in the town of Juan Domingo Peron, in the northern Argentinian province of Formosa, reportedly refused to get involved initially until the teenage girl's sister, Yeni, posted images of her injuries online. The pictures quickly went viral and caused a mass protest over the police's alleged failure to act. Brutal: One cut on the  girl's back alone required 20 stitches and she had needed dozens more on her face . Yeni said: 'They were jealous of my sister for a long time and always abusing her and insulting her, but we never expected them to go this far. 'I can only assume they were drinking or taking drugs as usual. 'I have tried to stay strong for my beautiful sister but every time I see her I want to burst into tears. 'They have ruined her life. She says she wants to kill herself because when she looks in the mirror she is so ugly now. It has ruined our family.' 'People will call you Chucky': The attackers reportedly told Miss Alvarez that they wanted her to resemble the heavily scarred doll from the Child's Play horror series (above) Police at the scene, where the teenager was left lying in a pool of blood until a passerby called an ambulance . Police confirmed that they had interviewed both suspects and had released the 16-year-old because she was too young, but that the 18-year-old they said was still in custody. The older of the two reportedly claimed that they had been insulted by the 15-year-old and had decided to exact revenge. Locals in the area have meanwhile threatened vigilante justice against the two attackers. They say that the two had been accused of regularly taking drugs and terrorising the region for too long, and have received online threats to give them the same treatment they had given the 15-year-old.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Animals at Moscow Zoo are suffering over Russia's new trade sanctions on the West which bans many foods from being imported. Keepers are urgently seeking to replace imported meat, fish, fruit and vegetables on which the animals depend. For example, the zoo's brown bears - creatures seen as the symbol of Russian virility - have a secret passion for Polish apples, which are now banned. No food: The zoo's brown bears have a passion for Polish apples, which are now banned . Zoo official Sergey Kapkov, admitted: 'We are looking for an alternative to imported fruit. The inhabitants of Moscow Zoo eat more than 100 kilograms a day.' There is anger that while food for babies have been exempted from the tit-for-tat sanctions list unveiled by Vladimir Putin's government, animal foods enjoy no such waiver. Moscow Zoo spokeswoman Anna Kachurovskaya said: 'Almost all of the products that animals consume at Moscow Zoo are imported. 'The main imported foods are fruits and vegetables.' She complained: 'A lot of the animals eat apples and we bought Polish apples which were of good quality and inexpensive. ' Penguins: A spokeswoman for Moscow Zoo said almost all of the products that animals consume are imported . Feeding time: A northern fur seal eats a fish, left, and a gorilla, right, has a mouthful of carrots, Russia's drastic ban on food imports from Europe has claimed it first victims -- the animals at Moscow zoo . She insisted that 'imported products are cheaper than domestic, and some products are rare in Russia or even not available at all.' There was surprise yesterday at the zoo's blunt attack on government policy amid an officially-inspired PR campaign to claim the move will act as a key incentive to upgrade Russia's domestic food production. However, the Russian curbs pose an immediate headache to zoo keepers. 'We cannot stop feeding the animals because of the sanctions,' said Ms Kachurovskaya. 'We are now actively coming up with new schemes for the purchases of products. We try to enter into contracts with new suppliers. Sanctions: Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev announced a wide-ranging embargo on most food imports from the EU, the US, Australia and Canada . 'The problem, however, is not so easy to solve, because some of the animals are not ready to change the suppliers. 'Some species have special 'geographical' preferences.' For example Russia imports whole fish caught off South America - the only kind that the zoo's penguins will eat. 'Some animals that eat the giblets will not eat those from our domestic market, and we cannot  explain this preference. ' We hope that the government will find a way to help. Baby food was not banned - are animals worse than children?' Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev this week  announced a wide-ranging embargo on most food imports from the EU, the US, Australia and Canada. Imports of beef, pork, fruit and vegetable produce, poultry, fish, cheese, milk and dairy products are banned from these Western countries. The moves were in response to Western sanctions imposed on Putin's government over the Kremlin's policies on Ukraine. Putin is blamed in the West for fomenting unrest in the east and south of the country after the March annexation of Crimea.","Keepers are urgently seeking to replace imported meat, fish, fruit and vegetables .

"Africa has its first white head of state since the horrors of apartheid after the death of the charismatic Zambian president dubbed 'King Cobra'. Vice president Guy Scott was named the country's acting leader today ahead of a presidential election in three months to formally replace Michael Sata, who died last night aged 77. Born in Zambia in 1944, Cambridge-educated Scott entered politics more than 20 years ago following in the footsteps of his father, a key critic of the country's former British colonisers. Scroll down for video . Forthright: Zambian president Michael Sata (left), who has died aged 77, was dubbed 'King Cobra' for his venomous verbal barbs to his opponents. He has been replaced by his vice president Guy Scott (right) Slow rise: Sata at a political rally in 2006. He jumped ship to new parties twice and ran for president four times . In an interview with The Telegraph, Mr Scott said his sudden elevation to the office of president was a 'bit of a shock to the system.' 'Everyone is getting used to calling me ""Your Excellency"", and I'm getting used to it,' he added. 'There are truckloads of guys following me on motorbikes. It's very strange.' The last white leader on the African continent was South Africa's last apartheid president, FW de Klerk. Nelson Mandela famously won the country's first true democratic elections in 1994 after decades of campaigning against the regime. Zambia is mourning the death of Sata, a charismatic, chain-smoking father of eight who rose from being a British railway porter through decades of hard politics to become the country's president. He had been in office for just three years and died at a private London hospital last night more than a month after he was last seen in public. The president gained his nickname King Cobra for his 'scorched-earth' politics and venomous barbs against opponents, one of whom was charged with defamation for calling him a potato. But to his supporters he was a reformer who promised to hack back growing Chinese industry and sweep Zambia cleaner than he swept London's Victoria station in the 1960s. Michael Chilufya Sata was born in 1937 into a poor district of the British colony of Northern Rhodesia, which would win independence as Zambia in 1964. With little basic schooling he joined a Catholic seminary aiming to become a priest, but changed his mind and would eventually enter the police force instead. Replacement: Guy Scott stood in for Michael Sata in a summit with U.S. President Barack Obama in August . Catholic: Early in life he joined a seminary with the apparent aim to become a priest, but later joined the police . He got involved in politics and trade unions, and after a controversial arrest - which he claimed was linked to his battles for independence - he came to London in the 1960s. There he worked as a platform cleaner at the capital's Victoria and London Bridge stations before becoming a porter for British Rail, alongside other work on the railways. He studied part-time and took casual jobs, including at a laundry in Bromley, Kent, at the Vauxhall car plant in Luton, Bedfordshire, before returning home and beginning his career in the police. The enthusiastic taxidermist flitted between jobs - including on the board of a taxidermy firm - before becoming an active member of the United National Independence Party (UNIP). From there it would be a slow rise to power through the newly-independent one-party state. He made his mark in 1985 by becoming the governor of the capital Lusaka, where supporters said he was a no-nonsense action man who doubled up as an eccentric showman. Divisive: Sata being sworn in as president in 2011. During the campaign he paraded through the streets in 'Noah's Ark', a speedboat pulled on a trailer, and told supporters they should jump on board to escape poverty . Power: Once Sata took office several critical journalists and political opponents were handed criminal charges . His voice hoarse through decades of smoking, he served in several ministerial portfolios but clashed on policy with the country's first president Kenneth Kaunda. As UNIP's power waned he jumped ship to the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, which won the Zambian election in 1991 and made Sata one of the nation's biggest political figures. A decade later he jumped ship again, forming the breakaway Patriotic Front in 2001. But he would take another ten years and four election campaigns to finally become president. During his 2011 campaign he paraded through the streets in 'Noah's Ark' - a speedboat pulled on a trailer - and declared to supporters: 'Jump on board and be saved from poverty'. He promised to sweep away corruption and Chinese 'infestors' as the mineral-rich nation reaped the spoils of a copper mining boom. Painting himself as a champion of the poor, he had a 90-day transformation plan and pledged to lower taxes and create more jobs. Making his mark: Sata began as the governor of the capital Lusaka in 1985, but left the party soon afterwards . Popular: Sata at a 2006 rally. He was last seen in November after returning from the UN General Assembly in New York, where he missed a speech amid rumours he had been taken ill in his hotel room. He died in London . But once in power, his forthright style often morphed into heavy leaning on political enemies. He once threatened to sack his entire cabinet - collapsing his government - if they did not do a better job. He cracked down on political foes, and in January one opponent was charged with defamation for comparing him to a potato. Frank Bwalya used a radio interview to describe the president as a 'chumbu mushololwa', a sweet potato which bends when bent and a slang term for someone who ignores advice. His presidential predecessor Rupiah Banda was also charged with a string of offences and in June, three opposition activists were criminally charged for claiming the president was dying. Journalists who reported on his long-suspected illness were also targeted, with Sata sacking figures in state-owned media. In an interview with the Telegraph after he was elected, Sata spoke wistfully of his time on London's railways and said it made him more aware of poverty in his own country. 'I had no choice but to do what all black people were doing in England, he said. 'If I went to England and I was treated like a gentleman, I would not have had any resolution to look after this country.' But poverty was far from eliminated under Sata's rule, and unemployment in Zambia remains over 50 per cent. Sata was last seen briefly in September after returning from the UN General Assembly in New York, where he missed a scheduled speech amid rumours he had fallen ill in his hotel. Just days earlier he had attended the opening of parliament in Lusaka, joking: 'I am not dead.' Neighbours: With Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe in 2012. The nations share a border at Victoria Falls . Prominent: Sata with the leaders of Sudan and Zimbabwe at a regional economic summit in February . Dilapidated: Sata (centre) leaves parts of Zambia still crippled by poverty despite its huge reserves of copper . He left Zambia again for medical treatment on October 19 but the government had not given updates on his condition. It was suggested he may have had a heart condition. He died last night at the private King Edward VII's hospital in Marylebone, central London. His wife Christine Kaseba-Sata and Lusaka's mayor Mulenga Sata - one of his eight children - were at his bedside when he died. British foreign secretary Philip Hammond said he was saddened to hear of Mr Sata's death, adding: 'He played a commanding role in the public life of his country over three decades, as governor of Lusaka, as the holder of several ministerial positions in the 1990s, as the main opposition leader, and finally as president. 'I would like to offer my condolences to his family and to the Zambian people at this time.' Zambian cabinet secretary Roland Msiska urged the public to 'remain calm, united and peaceful during this very difficult period'.","Guy Scott named as acting leader after death of president Michael Sata .

Google's just-released Year in Search reveals Australia's top topics for 2014 as represented by the search terms that were most often punched into the search engine. The data shows Australians were gripped by the biggest sporting event on the planet - the soccer World Cup - shocked by the twin Malaysian Airlines disasters, and devastated by the tragic loss of cricketer Phil Hughes. The top search term of the year was the World Cup, which saw remarkable moments like Tim Cahill’s incredible goal against the Netherlands attract the largest number of searches .

'The biggest searches, like the World Cup, Robin Williams and Malaysia airlines, were the top around the world, which shows Australians want to keep abreast of pressing international news. ‘Meanwhile, the popularity of searches for Charlotte Dawson, Phil Hughes and Schappelle Corby show that Australians are also very attentive to local news and affairs,’ he said. The top search topic of the year was the World Cup, which saw remarkable moments like Tim Cahill’s incredible goal against the Netherlands attract the largest amount of Google searches of any topic in the country. Television personality Charlotte Dawson (left), who committed suicide in February, and cricketer Phillip Hughes (right), who died after a freak accident at the SCG last month, were also among the top search terms in Australia this year . American actress Jennifer Lawrence was ranked as the sixth most searched term of the year . Mr Treeves said the World Cup 2014 had climbed in popularity from the previous event four years earlier. ‘We saw a 20 per cent spike in searches from the 2010 World Cup. Obviously Tim Cahill was an extremely popular search after his cracker of a goal, but that’s no big surprise!’ he said. Malaysia Airlines was the No.2 search term for the year, reflecting a strong interest in the double disasters of the disappearance of MH370 and the downing of MH17 by a suspected missile strike over Ukraine. Mr Treeves said the term 'MH370 found' outnumbered 'MH370 lost' - suggesting Australian’s were more hopeful than pessimistic about the search for the missing plane. Other top search terms included Shappelle Corby, the Australian released from an Indonesian prison after serving her sentence for drug smuggling, television personality Charlotte Dawson, who committed suicide in February, and Hunger Games actress Jennifer Lawrence. The list was compiled before this week's terrifying cafe siege in central Sydney - one of the biggest news events of the year. ‘It’s too early to saw yesterday’s events would have ranked. Investigating search engine date takes more time than that. It's certainly possible it could have ranked on the list,' Mr Teeves said.

"British doctors have discovered two genes that affect how well statins work . Two key genes that affect how well cholesterol-busting statins work have been identified by British doctors. The find paves the way for a life-saving blood test that helps ensure people’s cholesterol is kept under control. The simple and inexpensive test could also be used to identify those at risk of side-effects to statins – so they can be prescribed something else. And help doctors target individual patients with the most effective statins for their case. Statins, which lower levels of artery-clogging cholesterol, are the most widely-prescribed drugs in Britain and are taken by up to eight million people. They are credited with saving thousands of lives a year, but side-effects from blurred vision and fatigue to muscle and liver damage can deter people from taking them. Plus, the drugs simply work better in some patients than others. Working with scientists from around the world, researchers from Queen Mary, University of London, have now shed light on why this is. By analysing the DNA of more than 40,000 people taking statins, they found two genes linked to how much the drugs lowered cholesterol. One of the genes makes it harder for statins to get into the liver, where they lower cholesterol. This makes the drugs less effective. The second gene, however, makes statins work extra-well, the journal Nature Communications reports. Lead researcher, Professor Mark Caulfield, now wants to discover if the genes affect a person’s risk of heart attacks and strokes. This extra research could lead to people being given a blood test before being prescribed statins. If their genes show they will respond poorly to the drugs, they could be given a higher dose, a particular statin, or a different cholesterol-lowering medicine all together. Keeping a lid on cholesterol could prevent deadly heart attacks and strokes – and reduce the number of people living with disability caused by them. It is hoped the test would also spot those at risk of muscle wasting, a rare but potentially dangerous side-effect of statins. It is hoped the discovery will pave the way for a new simple blood test to identify those people who will benefit from statins, and help doctors find the best course of treatment for each individual. File picture . The test could cost as little as £5 a person – and take just a year to develop. However, studies would have to show it would save the NHS money overall if it was to become routinely used.

"A man whose scrotum swelled to more than 100lbs over the past decade has successfully undergone surgery to have it removed. Dan Maurer, from Battle Creek, Michigan, suffers . from scrotal lymphedema - an ailment that has caused one of his . testicles to become abnormally large. Now, thanks to 14-hour surgery, the growth has been removed. Scroll down for video . Massive problem: Dan Maurer, 39, suffers from a rare condition called scrotal lymphedema, which caused his scrotum to become unusually large and weigh 120lbs. He has now undergone successful surgery to remove the growth . 'He's come through the surgery fine,' his mother Connie told the New York Daily News. The 39-year-old said his condition had affected his relationship with wife of 20 years, Mindy. But following the life-changing surgery, the couple may be able to resume sexual relations. The couple reportedly have not been intimate in seven years due to Dan's illness. Mindy is now by his side as he recovers from the surgery, which took place at the University of California, Irvine, on August 28th. The mass in his scrotum was found to weigh 120lb and Mr Maurer also had some stomach fat removed during the surgery too - so is now 150lb lighter, the Daily News reports. Mrs Maurer told the Battle Creek Enquirer: '[The doctor] is very pleased with the surgery and healing. His father added: 'Hopefully, it's the start of a whole new life for him,' his father added. It is the next, and largest, step for Maurer and his battle with the rare disease scrotal lymphedema in which the scrotum grows abnormally large because of what doctors believe are blocked vessels in the lymphatic system that fail to drain the fluid from the area. Nervous and excited: Maurer said before the surgery that he was looking forward to having sex with his wife, Mindy (left), for the first time in seven years . However he is having trouble walking after the operation, having carried the growth for so long, his mother said. 'He . told me, ""Mom, I thought when (they finished the surgery) I could bound . out of that bed like a new man"",' she told the newspaper. 'He's moving . baby steps, but he wants to move (in) giant steps.' He is now undergoing physiotherapy and should be able to return home in a month. Scrotal lymphedema is a disease that is . caused by blockage of the lymphatic vessels in which tissue builds up . outside of the testicles, resulting in swelling. The tale of Mr Maurer's struggle went viral earlier this summer . after a series of stories appeared online documenting the man's efforts . to raise money for a costly and dangerous surgery to remove the growth . on his scrotum. The publicity allowed him raise close to $30,000 towards the operation, which was performed Thursday in California. Hours before the operation, Maurer took to his GoFundMe page to post an update about the upcoming operation. 'My surgery . is in 2 hours. So this might be my last post. I love you all and I can . not thank you enough for your support in all of this,' he wrote. Realisation: Mr Maurer discovered was was wrong with him when he watched TLC's reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about Wesley Warren Jr (pictured) Last hope: Dr Joel Gelman (left), who also treated Wesley Warren, operated on Mr Maurer (right) last month . 'My . wife is everything to me and to get a second chance to give her then . man she deserves means a lot to me. I will post as soon as I can if . andwhen I wake up.' Speaking to the New York Daily News before going under the knife, Mr Maurer reiterated he was anxious, but that the risk was well worth it. 'With the surgery, my life is on the line and losing my penis is on the line,' he said. He added he was excited about the prospect of having sex with his wife for the first time in seven years. Beside marital relations, he said he was ooking forward to doing more traveling and riding a jet ski. He said he first noticed that something was wrong with his anatomy when he was in his 20s. After seeking medical help when his scrotum started getting bigger, doctors informed him that he has to lose weight. ‘I was doing two miles a day in the pool, so I lost 50lbs like that,’ he said.. But . even as he was shedding the extra pounds, his scrotum continued . expanding, eventually ballooning to the size of a large cantaloupe . melon. ‘The bigger it gets it seems to me like the faster it grows. When he stands it almost hangs to his ankles,’ Mrs Maurer told My Fox Detroit. 'Misdiagnosed': Maurer first noticed that something was amiss with his body in his 20s, but doctors told him he just needed to lose weight . Setback: Maurer was able to shed 50lbs through daily exercise, but his scrotum continued growing . After consulting with physicians he got the same response as before: he must lose more weight. ‘As far as they were concerned, I had to have lap-band surgery to lose weight,’ he told the station KSDK. He ventually fell ill and had to be hospitalised with what turned out to be a broken cyst inside his oversize scrotum. Then one day, he came across the TLC reality show The Man With The 132 Pound Scrotum about the plight of Wesley Warren Jr. At that moment, he knew what was wrong with him. He then discovered that his only hope was Dr Joel Gelman, a California-based urologist who operated on Wesley Warren in April 2013 to remove his outsized growth. Warren passed away in March of this year at age 49. It is believed he died from complications with diabetes. Gelman has agreed to perform the dangerous operation to remove Maurer's massive growth, but the urologist is not in the patient's medical network and the procedure is not covered by his insurance. In the case of Wesley Warren, Dr Gelman agreed to treat him free of charge. Dan Maurer has launched a campaign on the site GoFundMe.com to raise $20,000 toward the surgery. As of Thursday afternoon, people have donated over $27,200.","Dan Maurer, 39, suffers from rare condition called scrotal lymphedema .

"It is ten times harder for a woman to become pregnant at 43 than at 37, doctors have warned. The rapid speeding up of a woman’s biological clock means that by the time she is 43, she will need to go through 44 eggs on average to produce just one normal embryo. At 37 she needs just 4.4, on average. A woman typically produces one egg a month, so this means it will take her almost four years to conceive – rather than only four months. Researcher Meredith Brower said that the number of eggs needed for a viable pregnancy rises ‘almost exponentially’ after 42, and urged women to freeze their eggs without delay. British experts said that while, ideally, women would have their babies in their twenties, the realities of modern life mean many have no choice but to wait. The research comes amid concern that growing numbers of women are risking the heartbreak of infertility by leaving it until middle-age to try to start a family. Education, careers, lack of money and the hunt for ‘Mr Right’ are all causing women to put motherhood on the back burner. No delay: Experts say that women who want to freeze their eggs should do so in their late twenties or early thirties to have the best chance of success later. Above, a female egg is artificially inseminated . Nearly half of all British babies are now born to women aged 30 and older, and the number born to women in their late thirties has almost trebled in recent years. Controversially, internet companies Facebook and Apple are offering to pay female employees to freeze their eggs. On the back burner: Nearly half of all British babies are born to women aged 30 and older. File image . The ‘perk’ – at the moment for employees in the US only – is aimed at boosting the number of women staff by allowing them to focus on their careers without sacrificing the opportunity to have children later in life. Dr Brower, of the University of California, Los Angeles, analysed data on 198 women aged between 20 and 45 having IVF treatment. This included how many eggs they produced, and the health of the embryos produced after they were fertilised in a dish. Not surprisingly, the younger women produced more eggs – and more genetically normal embryos. Dr Brower calculated that a woman under 35 would on average need just 3.8 eggs to make one healthy embryo. Between the ages of 35 and 37, 4.4 eggs would be needed. The figure starts to climb at 38. Women aged between 38 and 40 need 9.4 eggs and women aged 41 to 42 need 10.1. The number then soars, as fertility plummets, with women aged over 42 needing 44 eggs, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual conference in Honolulu heard. Importantly, the women studied were fertile, despite having IVF, and so it is thought the results apply to women trying to conceive naturally. Experts say that women who want to freeze their eggs should do so in their late twenties or early thirties to have the best chance of success later. But IVF pioneer Lord Winston has said that fewer than 8 per cent of those who thaw their eggs and have IVF will go on to have a baby. Around 500 women a year pay up to £3,000 to freeze their eggs until they want to start a family.","Number of eggs needed for pregnancy rises 'almost exponentially' after 42 .

"A five-minute brain scan could give healthy people early warning of dementia, scientists believe. They found that by measuring blood flow in the brain, it is possible to distinguish healthy people whose memory will decline from those who stay mentally sharp. In other words, tell-tale signs are present in the brain long before the memory fades. Scroll down for video . A five-minute brain scan could give healthy people early warning of dementia, scientists believe . Those given warning of the disease could take preventative measures such as changing their diet and taking more exercise. Quicker detection would allow earlier treatment and, with the help of new drugs, some who test positive might never develop the disease. Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect some 800,000 Britons and the number is predicted to double in a generation as the population ages. David Cameron has described dementia as ‘the key health challenge of this generation’. The Swiss researchers used a version of the MRI scans carried out regularly in hospitals to measure blood flow in the brain of more than 200 elderly men and women. Some were healthy, while others had mild cognitive impairment (MCI) – the slight memory lapses that can develop into full-blown dementia. Generally, up to 15 per cent of people with MCI develop Alzheimer’s within the next year. The men and women were also put through a battery of mental tests, including memory. Not surprisingly, the healthy subjects did better than those with MCI. But when the tests were repeated 18 months later, half of the healthy men and women found them harder. And, importantly, their brain scans, from the start of the study, were like those of the people who already had MCI. It is thought that other parts of the brain had initially compensated for damaged areas – masking the problem at the start of the study. But, by 18 months on, the symptoms were showing. Their brain scans showed that less blood was getting to an area in the middle of the brain called the posterior cingulate cortex, which is active when our mind is at rest. Previous research has shown this region to be less active chemically in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Researcher Sven Haller, of the University of Geneva, whose study is published in the journal Radiology, said it isn’t clear whether lack of blood to the brain causes memory loss, or whether blood stops flowing because the brain is damaged. Researcher Sven Haller, of the University of Geneva, said it isn’t clear whether lack of blood to the brain causes memory loss, or whether blood stops flowing because the brain is damaged . But, in either case, he thinks the scan, which takes as little as five minutes, could provide vital early warning of memory problems. Being able to predict who will become ill could speed the search for new drugs that can delay or even prevent Alzheimer’s. Existing medicines are of limited use and several promising pills and potions have failed to live up to hopes. However, many believe this is because they are being tested too late in the disease – and may work if given in the very early stages. Dr Simon Ridley, of charity Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘There is a growing amount of research into using various brain-scanning techniques to accurately detect changes to the brain before dementia symptoms show. ‘This study was very small and the volunteers were not diagnosed with dementia so it is not possible to tell at this stage whether this technique can be used to identify those at risk of the condition. ‘Larger and longer-term studies are needed. ‘Current methods can only accurately diagnose the condition long after the damage to the brain has started. ‘There are no drugs available at the moment that can stop or slow dementia. ‘Detecting changes in the brain as early as possible will allow people to enter clinical trials for much-needed new treatments before their symptoms have progressed too far and when they’re most likely to benefit.’","Scientists found they can distinguish whether memory will decline in healthy people from measuring blood flow to their brains .

"Healthy young women should be able to freeze their ovaries until they are ready for motherhood, experts have said . Scroll down for video . Healthy young women should be able to freeze their ovaries until they are ready for motherhood, experts said last night. They described the operation as ‘straightforward’ and ‘uneventful’, saying that almost 40 babies have been born from pieces of ovary that were preserved in liquid nitrogen. The leading fertility doctors said it was time the £8,000 technique was more widely used. A handful of clinics do ovarian tissue freezing in the UK but they usually treat cancer patients. In an article in the Lancet medical journal, however, the fertility doctors said it was now time to allow healthy young women to put an ovary – or a piece of ovary – on ice. The tissue would remain there until the woman is ready to start a family. It would then be thawed and put back in her body. British women already have the option of freezing eggs for medical and non-medical, or lifestyle, reasons. But collecting eggs to store for use later can be a lengthy process and when the woman is ready to have a baby, she will need IVF. In contrast, taking ovarian tissue means a large number of eggs is collected quickly, and after the tissue is put back in the woman, she can try to get pregnant naturally. But critics say the operation could damage a woman’s fertility and that while cancer patients have few other options, the risks are too great for healthy women. One of the article’s authors, Dr Sherman Silber, of St Luke’s Hospital in Missouri in the US, said: ‘Replacement of ovarian tissue requires surgery and might seem more onerous than egg retrieval but it is a straightforward and uneventful procedure. ‘With freezing ovarian tissue, a woman doesn’t need IVF and her fertility ten or 15 or 20 years from now will be the same as if she was a young woman. It has tremendous outcomes.’ Dr Silber, one of the few doctors to perform the operation simply to allow healthy women to delay motherhood, said the frozen tissue could be transplanted back at any time – even 50 years later. The operation does not damage fertility, he added. Commenting on the issue, Dr Gillian Lockwood, director of Midland Fertility Services, said ovarian tissue freezing can be useful for cancer patients who in some ways ‘have nothing to lose’, but that it should not be used to allow healthy women put motherhood on ice.","Ovarian tissue is removed and frozen, then thawed and put back in .

"Drugs such as low-dose aspirin (pictured) would be more effective if timed with the body’s natural rhythms, new research says . Many popular pills – including some cholesterol-busting statins – would be better taken at night than in the morning, scientists believe. They say widely-used tablets such as low-dose aspirin would be more effective if timed with the body’s natural rhythms. Scientists showed that individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day. They found that nearly half of all mouse genes work harder at some points in the 24-hour cycle than others, with ‘rush hours’ of activity just before dawn and dusk. Although the study was on mice, most mouse genes have ‘twins’ in humans. Many common drugs home in on these genes and so should be most effective when the genes are most active. This is particularly important in the case of medicines such as aspirin, which are broken down quickly by the body. The University of Pennsylvania study found 56 of the 100 best-selling drugs in the US act on genes that ebb and flow over the day. Similarly, 119 of the 250 pills on the World Health Organisation’s list of essential medicines may work better at a certain time of the day, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. Pennsylvania University’s pharmacology professor John Hogenesch said more work is needed to say when is the best time to take each pill. However, research already shows that low-dose aspirin, taken daily by millions of Britons who have survived a heart attack or stroke to keep their blood thin, is best taken at night. This ensures the drug has time to work before morning – the peak time for heart attacks. Likewise, simvastatin, one of the most widely-used cholesterol-lowering statin pills, should also be taken at bedtime. This is because the drug works by blocking a key step in the production of cholesterol, and the gene behind this step is most active at night. Patients are already told to take simvastatin in the evening, however many still take it at the wrong time. Some will take the drug in the morning to prevent them forgetting. Individual genes are governed by the body clock and become more or less active at certain times of the day. Many common drugs home in on these genes – and so should be most effective if given when the genes are most active, say U.S. researchers . Professor Hogenesch said: ‘There’s a huge opportunity for improving the action of existing drugs through better timing.’ Heidi Wright, of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ‘Simvastatin…is best taken at bedtime as your liver makes most of your cholesterol at night. ‘Low-dose aspirin works by making your blood less sticky. There is research that says more heart attacks occur in the morning, so…reducing this stickiness by the morning could help prevent heart attacks.’ Women are putting their lives at risk by ignoring the symptoms of heart disease, researchers warn. Many brush pain off as indigestion or a pulled muscle and wait days or weeks before seeing a doctor. But in fact it could be a symptom of angina, where one of the arteries to the heart gets blocked, or a mild heart attack. Harvard researchers urge women not to assume heart attacks are a ‘man’s disease’ and to seek help. Statistically, women are less likely to have a heart attack than men before the menopause, but afterwards they overtake them and are more at risk. Furthermore, heart attacks in women tend to be more severe than in men – possibly because they have ignored the warning signs. Lead author Dr Catherine Kreatsoulas, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said: ‘Both men and women go into a phase of denial – but women seem to stay in this stage longer.’","Some drugs would be more effective if timed with body's natural rhythms .

"Just four pints of lager a week could harm a man’s chances of having a family, research suggests. A study of healthy young men found that drinking just a little more than three pints a week, or half a pint a day, can reduce sperm quality. The researchers found the effects occurred when more than 7.5 units of alcohol a week - with the average pint of beer containing around 2.3 units. However, many popular lagers are stronger than this. For instance, a pint of Stella Artois lager contains 2.7 units – meaning that fewer than three pints a week may be harmful. The study also found that the more a man drinks, the greater the toll on sperm. The Danish researchers said that given the large amounts of alcohol drunk by young men, their finding is a public health concern. Around one in seven couples in the UK has trouble starting a family and male infertility is to blame in almost half of cases. Some will remain childless, despite spending thousands of pounds on IVF. The study, published in the BMJ Open journal, involved 1,200 military recruits aged between 18 and 28. They were asked about their drinking habits and gave blood and sperm samples. They had drunk 16 units on average the previous week and more than half had binged on booze or been drunk more than twice in the past month. Boozing was linked to changes in reproductive hormones – and to the health of the men’s sperm. The researchers found that for men who habitually drank heavily there was a clear link between alcohol intake and quality of sperm. The more a man drunk, the less sperm he made and the more abnormal it was in shape and size. Drinking just a little more than three pints a week, or half a pint a day, can reduce sperm quality . Importantly, the effect was apparent after just 7.5 units a week - although it was particularly strong after 37.5 units a week. The NHS advises that men don’t regularly consume more than 21 to 28 units of alcohol a week. The University of Southern Denmark researchers said that they can’t be sure that alcohol is causing the damage. For instance, it may be simply be that men with poor sperm are more likely to drink. But they warned that even ‘modest’ amounts of booze may be harmful – and advised against ‘high habitual intake’. However, going tee-total may not be the answer. The analysis also found that men who didn’t drink at all had poorer sperm than those who had a small amount. More research is needed to explain this. Chris Barratt, professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Dundee, said: ‘I think the main message of this paper is clear - high levels of alcohol intake do appear to be associated with changes in sperm and semen that may affect fertility.’ Professor Sheena Lewis, of Queen’s University Belfast, described the results as ‘compelling’. But Dr Allan Pacey, a male fertility expert at the University of Sheffield, said his own study of infertile men had failed to link boozing with sperm quality. However, he said that binge drinking may be more harmful than consuming the same amount of alcohol over a longer period of time.","Drinking just half a pint a day can harm sperm quality, new study finds .

"A 70-year-old real estate expert who solicited two girls - one 12, the other 13 - for prostitution through coded texts and secret phone calls has been arrested and charged with child sex trafficking. Michael Lustig - who owns Real Estate License Services, a school based in Ocean Beach, San Diego, and who has authored over two dozen books - was pulled over in his car and arrested on Tuesday, having been wanted by the FBI in connection to a prostituion sting dating back to last summer. Lustig was first arrested on June 8, 2012, at a hotel in the coastal town of Echinitas as one of several suspects targeted in a prostitution operation by the North County Human Trafficking Task Force (NCHTTF), at which time four of his cellphones were seized. Michael Lustig, 70, was arrested in San Diego on Tuesday following a lengthy investigation into a prostitution ring. He has since been charged with two counts of sex trafficking of a minor, relating to alleged encounters with two girls, aged 12 and 13 . During the ensuing investigation, Sheriff's investigators found Lustig had been texting and calling two girls, who were hidden in the phones under the male names 'Andrew' and 'Dominick'. Lustig exchanged 39 texts and 110 phone calls with the 12-year-old during a four-month period last year, according to U-T San DIego. There were also 60 texts between Lustig and the 13-year-old in late 2011, in which they used code words such as 'bookstore' and 'library' to set up dates. Both girls were tracked down by police, with both admitting to allegedly performing sexual acts with Lustig for money in late 2011 and early 2012, reports NBC San Diego. Both said they knew Lustig as 'George'. Jail house: Michael Lustig is being held here, the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego, without bail as he awaits trial on two charges of sex trafficking of a minor . The younger girl told investigators she’d been paid $80 for each of the 'five to seven' sexual encounters she’d had with Lustig. The older girl said she was paid $200 on three separate occasions. Investigators also obtained other evidence through search warrants and subpoenas, including motel surveilance footage of Lustig entering a room with one of the girls and leaving about 25 minutes later. With this new information, officials once again began searching for Lustig, who was no longer in custody. A warrant was issued for his arrest, charging him with two counts of sex trafficking of a minor. Lustig owns Real Estate License Services, a school based here, in Ocean Beach, San Diego, that teaches people to become brokers or insurers. He has also authored over two dozen books . Lustig is now being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center without bail until further issue can be argued in San Diego Ferderal Court tomorrow. “This is now a case of human trafficking, and must be addressed,” San Diego County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson Jan Caldwell told NBC. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alessandra Serano, who specializes in human trafficking cases, said that none of her previous prosecutions has involved victims as young as these. Authorities have not revealed further information about the sex trafficking case, including if there are other targets in the investigation. Lustig plans to hire a private attorney.","Michael Lustig was arrested this week following a one-year investigation into prostitution .

"Care Minister Norman Lamb said choosing the right care for someone we love can be an overwhelming experience . Choosing care for an elderly parent is one of the most stressful decisions we will ever make, a survey found. It ranks higher than getting married, choosing a school or buying a house in terms of worry. Even getting divorced is rated less stressful, say members of the ‘sandwich generation’. These are men and women who have to care for – or arrange the care of – their parents as well as their children. Smaller families, longer life expectancy and late parenthood in life mean that the number of ‘sandwich carers’ is growing, with an estimated 2.4 million Britons juggling their responsibilities for both parents and children. Some 84 per cent of the 259 men and women questioned by the Care Quality Commission, the hospital and care home watchdog, said deciding how to care for an elderly relative was very stressful or quite stressful – making it the top choice. This decision could be about whether they are well enough to stay in their own home – or it could be about which care home will look after them best. Financial worries, fears over the standard of care and guilt about putting a relative into a home are all likely to contribute to the mental turmoil. And many people are forced to sell their parents’ home to meet the high fees required to keep them in care. Next most stressful was buying a house, with a score of 67 per cent, followed by choosing a school for a child. Child care took fourth place in the list of six, divorce was in fifth place and getting married was sixth. Care Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘Choosing the right care for someone we love can be an overwhelming experience. There is a vast amount of information to deal with and balancing that with day-to-day pressures can be really hard.’ Some 84 per cent of the 259 men and women questioned by the Care Quality Commission, the hospital and care home watchdog, said deciding how to care for an elderly relative was very stressful or quite stressful . Helena Herklots, of charity Carers UK, said: ‘Our ageing population means that caring for older people or disabled loved ones will be a reality for all of us at some point in our lives. At that point we will want the best for our loved ones. ‘Juggling the care we want for those we care about alongside work and family commitments can be stressful and confusing.’ The CQC carried out the survey to mark the launch of a new rating scheme for care homes, which will see them ranked from ‘outstanding’ to ‘inadequate’. Andrea Sutcliffe, its chief inspector of adult social care, recently admitted that she regularly received ‘heartbreaking’ letters from families wracked with guilt for leaving a relative in a poor home. ‘Week in week out people tell me and my team how inspectors discover some truly awful care which should not be happening,’ she said. Some experts have said the rise of the ‘sandwich generation’ will spell the end of a comfortable middle age. They predict that people in their 40s and 50s will increasingly resent taking on extra responsibility, while also faced with working longer before drawing their pension. The financial burden of caring for the young and old means fewer will be able to use their pre-retirement years to pay off their mortgage, go on trips and fulfil lifetime ambitions. George McNamara, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Like walking into a maze blindfolded, when faced with the difficult decision of moving a loved one into a care home many families struggle due to a lack of trusted information and advice. ‘We know that for families and carers of people with dementia it is particularly challenging. No one should feel that they or their loved ones should have to settle for poor care.’","Of 259 questioned, 84 per cent said they worried about choosing care home .

Weeks told the music magazine that a number of issues she dealt with growing up - going to parties, her nude photos being spread, committing self-harm due to depression - were not factors for her adult film career. In the past year, she appeared multiple times on television, speaking on 'Piers Morgan Tonight,' 'The View,' and 'Dr. Drew on Call,' wrote a number of essays for the women's website xoJane, and also landed an internship with Pornhub.com. 'In porn, I can speak openly about my experiences without fear of punishment, work in a safe and professional environment and play a vital role in the creative process,' she says in her Rolling Stone column. 'Of course, not everyone can be a porn star, but more sex workers could enjoy this same level of autonomy and fulfillment if prostitution was legalized.' Weeks argues in her column that safer sex workers and reduced rates of sexually transmitted diseases are linked to legalized prostitution . Weeks argues in her column that safer sex workers and reduced rates of sexually transmitted diseases are linked to legalized prostitution, citing research from the National Bureau of Economic Research. The adult film actress also dismisses the 'Swedish model,' in which clients who seek out prostitution are prosecuted. She writes 'Every client and sex worker has a story to tell, and the current regime of criminalization over compassion only mutes their voices and pushes them to the fringes of society where danger may lurk.

"It's set to be one of the most expensive domain names ever sold, and tonight as holiday.com goes to auction, the travel industry prepares to hail a new giant. Bidding began on Monday for the auction, which starts at 5.30pm at the luxurious Sunborn London hotel, as part of the World Travel Market industry fair at London Excel, in Newham. And experts say it could surpass the current top seller, insurance.com, which sold for £21.5million in 2010. Big bucks: Holiday.com is expected to be one of the most expensive domain name ever sold . Its owners, luxury concierge service provider Breathe Luxury Ltd, call the name 'the Holy Grail' of the travel industry, and 'holiday' is one of the most popular search terms on the internet, making it a very desirable prospect. More than 90 per cent of travel companies already have the phrase as one of their top five key words for reaching customers through online search. Many attempts have been made to buy holiday.com over the past 16 years, with major travel companies battling for ownership in order to increase their market share - but it is only now that the owners are at ease to part with it. A spokesman for Breathe Luxury Ltd said: 'Holiday.com is clearly a world record breaker in the making.' Insurance.com £21.5 million . VacationRentals.com £21.1million . PrivateJet.com £18.2million . Internet.com £10.9million . Insure.com £9.7million . Sex.com for £8.4million . Hotels.com £6.6million . Fund.com £6 million . Porn.com £5.7million . Fb.com by Facebook £5.1 million . Business.com for £4.5 million . A spokesman for Breathe Luxury Ltd said: 'Holiday.com is clearly a world record breaker in the making.' 'Here at Breathe Luxury we believe that Holiday.com has all the hallmarks to be the No.1 leading travel brand and dedicated online platform in serving holidaymakers worldwide.' Richard Winslow, head of hosting, Host Europe Group, warned that while a memorable keyword such as 'holiday', is valuable for companies, they must have an effective plan, too. 'You need to have a business plan and to be able to use the name and market it effectively,' he told the Guardian. If it does sell as well as is expected, holiday.com as a domain name on its own could outstrip the sales of insurance.com, vacationrentals.com which went for £21million and privatejet.com, sold for £18million – all of which included the transfer of ownership of a complete business. According to Business Insider, sex.com still holds the Guinness World Record for the most expensive domain name-only sale – around £8million in 2010.","Web address will go on sale tonight at the  Sunborn London hotel .

"The key to keeping weight off could be as easy as hopping on the scales, according to a study. Research shows that people who have slimmed down regain less weight if they simply weigh themselves once a week. In fact, the pounds seem to keep dropping off. The finding is important because, as every slimmer knows, it is when the diet ends that the hard work really begins. And despite the best of intentions, many dieters struggle to maintain their new slimline figures. Scroll down for video . Study: More than 3,000 successful slimmers were offered vouchers for bathroom scales and asked to weigh themselves weekly for nine months. Those who took up the offer gained half a stone less than the others . Birmingham University researcher Claire Madigan said that stepping on the bathroom scales could be a ‘simple, pragmatic strategy that people could use to stop weight-regain and keep them on track’. More than 3,000 successful slimmers were offered vouchers for bathroom scales and asked to weigh themselves weekly for nine months. Just under a third took up the offer and their progress was compared with another group who had also lost weight but weren’t given any help in keeping it off. Those in the ‘weigh-in’ group regained almost half a stone less than the others, the UK Congress on Obesity in Birmingham heard. Miss Madigan, who is close to completing a PhD, said that weekly weigh-ins can help slimmers keep track of their weight, allowing them to take action immediately if they notice the pounds creeping up again. The thought of stepping on the scales may also help stop people from giving into temptation. She said: ‘Perhaps it acts as a primer. If you know you have to step on the scales, you are a bit more careful about what you eat.’ Researcher Claire Madigan said: 'Perhaps it acts as a primer. If you know you have to step on the scales, you are a bit more careful about what you eat' Writing in the Journal of Public Health, she said: ‘Many people with weight problems take action to lose weight but almost invariably put it back on. 'Finding effective strategies to minimise this is critical.’ She is now working on a new study, looking at whether daily weigh-ins are even better at preventing those sneaky pounds piling back on. 'Daily weigh-ins would mean that any weight gain should be noticed more quickly. It should also make it easier to get into the habit of weighing yourself. Curiously, daily weigh-ins only seem to help those who have already succeeded in losing weight to keep it off. Studies show the strategy to be of little or no benefit to those still trying to lose weight. Previous research has shown that to stay at a new weight, slimmers need to eat less than someone of the same weight who has not dieted.","Researchers looked at 1,000 slimmers who continued weighing themselves .

"A Saudi prince jailed for life in Britain for murdering his servant has been flown back to the Middle Eastern country to serve the rest of his sentence, the British government said Wednesday. Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasir, a grandson of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, was jailed in 2010 for killing Bandar Abdullah Abdulaziz in a London hotel after subjecting him to a 'sadistic' campaign of violence and sexual abuse. But Britain's Ministry of Justice confirmed that the 36-year-old royal flew back to Saudi Arabia on Monday after he was granted a transfer to a prison in his homeland. Prince Saud Abdulaziz bin Nasser al Saud (left) was found guilty of murdering his servant Bandar Abdullah Abdulaziz (right) in their room at a luxury London hotel. He will serve the rest of his life sentence in Saudi Arabia . Details of the transfer were announced last month. 'We have a prison transfer arrangement with Saudi Arabia which allows nationals of either country to serve their prison sentence in their home state,' a ministry spokeswoman said. 'Prince Saud has now returned to Saudi Arabia to serve the rest of his sentence. He was transferred in the same way that all prisoners are returned home and is the first prisoner to transfer under this arrangement.' She added that, as part of the arrangement, he must serve the life sentence, with a minimum of twenty years. Evidence: Saud Abdulaziz bin Nasser al Saud (in white) is seen beating his servant Bandar Abdulaziz in an elevator in London's Landmark hotel . When asked what measures had been taken to ensure that the prince would not be persecuted for his homosexual acts, or, alternatively, receive preferential treatment as a result of his royal connections, she said that the administration of his sentence is now a matter for Saudi Arabia. Saud's trial at England's Old Bailey central criminal court in London heard that he had ordered gay escorts and had frequently looked at websites for gay massage parlours and escort agencies. The prince denied being gay and his lawyers argued that he could face the death penalty in Saudi Arabia over the allegations of homosexuality. Undated handout photo issued by the Metropolitan Police of Prince Saud (left) and his victim Bandar Abdulaziz . The jury heard that the prince beat and strangled Abdulaziz to death on 15 February, 2010, fuelled by champagne and cocktails, after the pair returned from a Valentine's Day night out. A post-mortem found that Abdulaziz had suffered heavy blows to the head, injuries to the brain and ears, and severe neck injuries consistent with strangulation by hand. Prosecutors said bite marks on his cheeks showed a clear 'sexual element' to the killing.","Murderer Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz bin Nasir flown back to Saudi Arabia .

"The BBC has defended the latest episode of Doctor Who after viewers complained it was too disturbing. Saturday night’s edition of the show - the first of a two-part climax to the series - saw the Doctor and sidekick Clara Oswald caught up a plot dealing with the afterlife, which then led into an invasion of Earth by the Cybermen. It said the storyline, which saw Clara’s boyfriend Danny apparently killed in a car crash, was ‘appropriate’. Too scary? Some say the adventures of the Doctor and sidekick Clara (right) aren't appropriate for children . The children’s drama, which was watched by 5.3 million viewers, saw dead bodies transformed into an army of Cybermen. At one point it is suggested the bodies of the dead could feel the pain of being cremated, and the Doctor, played by Peter Capaldi, is told: ‘All the graves on Earth are about to give birth.’ The BBC received 118 complaints about the fact the children’s drama dealt with the afterlife. Another nine complained to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, which said it is assessing whether to launch an investigation. The boyfriend of Doctor Who's sidekick Clara was apparently killed in a car crash in the episode Dark Water . Dead bodies were transformed into an army of Cybermen during the episode Dark Water . Some people expressed disappointment on Twitter that the BBC did not warn viewers of the program's morbid content. 'Sad. Doctor Who should have had a warning, recently bereaved - terminally ill,' said @joh2710. They continued: 'The idea that dead people feel cremation is appalling especially for terminally ill people.' The episode goes to air at 8:00pm - an hour before the 9:00pm watershed after which adult content is allowed to be broadcast. 'Scary': Some on social media said dealing with cremation and the afterlife was too much . However, the BBC defended the episode’s dark themes and actor Peter Capaldi has stated previously that he wanted Doctor Who to take on a darker edge. 'I was keen he be a little darker,' the actor told the BBC in August. 'He's struggling with himself and who he is.' A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Doctor Who is a family drama with a long tradition of tackling some of the more fundamental questions about life and death. ‘We were mindful of the themes explored in Dark Water and are confident that they are appropriate in the context of the heightened sci-fi world of the show. ‘The scene in which a character reveals [an] unconventional theory about the afterlife was preceded by the same character warning the Doctor and Clara several times that what they were about to hear could be distressing. ‘When the Doctor does hear these claims, he immediately pours scorn on them, dismissing them out of hand as a “con” and a “racket”. It transpires that he is correct, and the entire concept is revealed to be a scam perpetrated by Missy.’ The current series reaches its conclusion on Saturday.","Episode 'Dark Water' shows bodies transformed in army of Cybermen .

"Cronulla Sharks captain Paul Gallen has blamed a few too many drinks and abusive NRL fans for the tweet he sent out last month lashing out the the NRL management team. In the post on his Twitter account a few weeks ago, Gallen, who was holidaying in Hawaii wrote: 'Steve Noice (sic) actually cared about players from Cronulla's feelings. Couldn't say that about any other c*** from Nrl'. Now the skipper has spoken out about the sacking of Cronulla chief executive Steve Noyce, saying alcohol and a few particularly nasty fans were to blame for the offensive outburst which saw him fined $50,000. Scroll down for video . Paul Gallen has blamed alcohol and abusive fans for his outburst on Twitter last month which saw him cop a $50,000 fine . 'I was out at a restaurant, going through my Instagram feed and I had a photo with an Australian. Turns out he was from Queensland and he had a crack at me on the actual photo and that’s what annoyed me,' Gallen told radio station TripleM, according to Fox Sports. He said after that he went out and met Roosters half back Mitchell Pearce for some drinks, but got hassled on his way home by a bunch of Australians which also riled him up. 'I got back in the hotel, the WI-FI came on the phone and Noycey (Cronulla CEO Steve Noyce) had been sacked. It upset me. I wrote the tweet in the foyer of my hotel, I got up to my room and deleted it but it had already got out there,' Gallen revealed. After removing the controversial post, Gallen posted the above image on Instagram with the message: '4 drinks for $5 RSA. OMG no wonder I'm hung. Good times. Time to fly home'. Gallen  lashed out at the NRL management team in the vulgar tweet one day after Cronulla chief executive Steve Noyce was sacked . The Sharks captain also said he was appealing the severity of the fine, and revealed there was no bad blood between him and his club over the drama. When Noyce was fired last month, it left the the 2014 wooden spooners without a CEO or coach. The team is also also under investigation by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority. Gallen removed the original post after several users advised him to take it down, but it was not soon enough to avoid any controversy. He later posted an image on Instagram with Sydney Roosters halfback Mitchell Pearce, and the message: '4 drinks for $5 RSA. OMG no wonder I'm hung. Good times. Time to fly home'. Users took to social media to address the controversial tweet. Steve Noyce was fired last month, leaving the 2014 wooden spooners without a CEO or coach . Crowdiegal said: ‏'I'm sorry but if I said what Paul Gallen said about my bosses ... I'd be sacked. He is very lucky to still have a job right now imo'. Others have shown their support for Gallen, with Samuel Abbs writing: 'Good on Paul Gallen, someone should of (sic) said that months ago, truth hurts.' Gallen is no stranger to dramas on social media. Last year he had a spat with veteran NRL coach Brian Smith in an acrimonious exchange on Twitter, after the former Sydney Roosters mentor accused him of running away from Dylan Napa after a brutal hit from the Tricolours prop. A number of the messages that appeared on Gallen's account during the exchange were later credited to his father Garry. The Sharks finished bottom of the ladder for the past two seasons, and are still under investigation from ASADA . Noyce joined the Sharks as football manager in April last year, before taking over the chief executive's role soon after. The sharks are currently under investigation by the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority for their 2011 season supplement program. Gallen suffered a backdated ban that is due to expire on November 23, meaning he will miss the upcoming international Four Nations tournament. The Sydney Morning Herald has reported that Noyce was known to have been very supportive to players, in particular Gallen, during the controversial investigations.","Cronulla Sharks captain Paul Gallen lashed out at the NRL management team in a vulgar tweet last month .

Many of his prized collection of antiques and paintings were also auctioned off. Later . on, the crash in prices of farmed salmon also hit his finances and he . was forced to sell his seven-bedroom mansion in Holland Park, London, . and his Swiss apartment. He was highly-regarded on Great Bernera, which has a population of just 350, as a benevolent laird.

"After being named ‘star baker’ a record five times, Richard Burr was the hot favourite to win the Great British Bake Off. So the judges’ decision to hand the crown to Nancy Birtwhistle instead has left a rather sour taste in the mouths of his fans.

Fan Martin Colme tweeted: 'Someone phone watchdog and report a crime, Richard was robbed on the the #GBBOfinal #MaryBerryOut #JusticeForRichard' while fellow user James Dunny added: 'Richard was robbed. Nancy was the best in the final but Richard is the best baker overall. #GBBOfinal #GBBO' But the shaven-headed family man was gracious in defeat, saying after the finale: 'Congratulations to Nancy. A brilliant baker, and a great friend. Hope I gave you a run for your money nance!!' Birtwhistle said she was so caught up in the moment, she can now barely recall the actual triumph: 'The judges said my name, and I can't really remember what happened. 'Later I was asked how I was feeling in an interview, but I felt I didn't have the vocabulary, it was all a bit of a fog,' she said. Fans of the North London builder insisted 'he was robbed' as the show reached its climax . The climax of the 10-week BBC1 series draw an average audience of 12.3 million - one of the biggest TV audiences of the year. When the winner of last year's X Factor was crowned in December, the ITV singing contest could manage an audience of 9.7 million. Last night's show even beat the 2013 finale of Strictly Come Dancing which had an audience of 11.5 million, as well as the most recent Britain's Got Talent final on 10.9 million, putting Bake Off into a new league. Birtwhistle and her fellow finalists, Burr, 37, and graphic designer Luis Troyano, 42, had to complete the toughest challenges of the series, finishing with a towering 'piece montee' as their showstopper, with sponge, caramel, choux pastry and petit fours, completed in five hours. She leapt ahead during the technical challenge, coming first with her array of tartes au citron, Victoria sponges and scones, while Burr blew it by coming last. Birtwhistle, originally from Hull, said it was an emotional moment as the three hopefuls gathered to hear who had won after 10 weeks of competition in which they had undertaken 30 separate challenges. She said: 'I can remember having to stand for what seemed an eternity to hear the result. I looked at a tree in the distance and focused on that rather than looking at the judges, and felt what will be will be. 'We were all pretty exhausted, Luis was close to tears, and Richard looked the same. I took a big gulp, and realised that this moment was like knowing the snowman is going to melt and it will never be the same again. So it was quite a poignant time for all of us.' They were joined by the eliminated contenders from throughout the series in the famous marquee pitched on the estate of Welford Park in Berkshire. Birthwhistle added: 'It was a fabulous day with the sun shining and all my family had come. There was a band playing and it was a lovely atmosphere, we had such a great time and everyone loved it.' Disappintment still lingered this morning after the shock news that Ms Birtwhistle had won sunk in . Ms Birtwhistle's win had caught many by surprise with Burr, 37, expected to take the honours after weeks of supremacy . He was the bookies' favourite and had been named 'star baker' five times, to just one week - during the first heat - for the eventual winner . Berry said: 'You never know how the bakers will be affected as we go through filming week by week, but Nancy remained constant throughout. I think it was her quiet determination that drove her through, and the fact that she never really lost her cool. 'It was a close run when it came to judging the final, but Nancy is deservedly our winner and I must admit that I have been inspired by her baking. The bakers have been so keen, so creative and the results have been mindblowing. It's been a real joy to judge this year.' Hollywood said: 'Nancy has been confident, creative and unafraid as a baker and that showed from the very start. In one of my judgings I called her close to perfection, so that says it for me. Many viewers  had been expecting Burr - known for his signature pencil tucked behind the ear - to be the victor after his many strong performances . The tearful grandmother-of-eight, dubbed gadget gran, was the unanimous winner of Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry, as announced by presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc after weeks of brilliant bakes . 'This series has been one of the best for me, as we have had great bakers who have built on their baking expertise each week. They have shown both a depth of knowledge and a sense of humour, you really couldn't have asked for a better bunch. 'They have really pushed the boundaries of technique this year. The style, the finesse and the precision - the class of 2014 have been exceptional.' The programme moved from BBC2 to BBC1 for this year's fifth series and created a buzz like never before. It has pulled in around nine million viewers and has become one of the most popular shows on the channel. BBC1 controller Charlotte Moore said last night: 'It was absolutely right for one of the nation's most talked-about programmes to move to the nation's favourite channel, and I'm more than thrilled BBC1 viewers have taken it to their hearts.'","12.1 million watched BBC One when Germany beat Argentina 1-0 in Brazil .

"Richard Attenborough's son has revealed how his father 'was obviously not the same man' after suffering a terrible fall at his home in 2008. Theatre director Michael Attenborough, 65, described his father, who died on Sunday aged 90, as: 'Quite simply my hero; my supporter, my counsellor, my friend.' But he said his beloved parent changed beyond recognition after falling down the stairs six years ago. 'He hit his head very badly and I have no idea how he survived', he told the Mirror.  'When he emerged after 18 months in hospital, he was obviously not the same man.' Scroll down for video . 'My hero, my supporter, my counsellor, my friend': Lord Attenborough's son, Michael, left, today paid tribute to his father, right, who died on Sunday days before his 91st birthday . Richard Attenborough and his wife Sheila Sim, arrive at Buckingham Palace for a garden party in 1952 . Lord . Attenborough's family chose not to reveal how badly he had suffered as a . result of the accident, which, his son said today, left the legendary . director unable to read or write. He said: 'The two things it was terrible to take away from my dad were his activity and articulation.' The Oscar-winning director, who died on Sunday five days before his 91st birthday, was able to say a few words, including his son's name, but no more than that, he said. As . a result, he said, his father suffered huge frustration for more than . four years, before becoming more resigned in the last 18 months of his . life. Lord Attenborough's son, who has a younger sister, Charlotte, and whose other sister, Jane, died aged 49 in the 2004 tsunami, said the family's focus was now on Sheila, Lady Attenborough, 92. He said they were making sure she was surrounded by relatives in an attempt to cushion her from the shock of losing the husband she spent 74 years with. A private family funeral will be held in the next week, while a more public memorial service will take place in November. Michael Attenborough, pictured at Chelsea FC's ground, Stamford Bridge, with his father in 1992 . told his loved ones he felt as though he was ‘trapped in purgatory’ during his final months, it emerged yesterday. Lord Attenborough's son's comments came as the film director's friend, producer Anthony Haas, revealed that he was glad the actor and director had finally escaped the misery of his confined existence. Mr Haas, 64, said he used to visit Lord . Attenborough every week at the nursing home in North-West London where . he lived with his wife Sheila Sim, 92, but saw his friend’s health . decline in recent months. The film legend, pictured with his wife in 2001, had been confined to a wheelchair since falling down stairs six years ago and became increasingly frustrated with his inability to move . He added: ‘My immense sadness at his death is tinged with an element of relief that his suffering is finally at an end. 'He was increasingly trapped in his own body. He told me he felt as if he was trapped in purgatory. ‘Despite . his great humour and spirit, you could see he found it increasingly . frustrating. Shortly before his death he was no longer able to have many . visitors. 'Mentally he was all there, but it became difficult for him to . communicate properly and that was causing him pain.’ Mr . Haas said the last decade of Lord Attenborough’s life was ‘tinged with . immense sadness’ caused by the loss of his eldest daughter Jane Holland, . 49, and 15-year-old granddaughter Lucy in the Indian Ocean tsunami in . 2004. He said: . ‘You never recover from something like that. It was devastating for the . whole family. He lived with that tragedy for his last years, but he had . an irrepressible spirit. Sir Ben Kingsley, pictured with Lord Attenborough at the 1982 Academy Awards, who played the title role in Oscar-winning Gandhi, said he would 'miss him dearly' ‘He was one of the most extraordinary, passionate people I will ever have the pleasure to know.’ His . comments came as Lord Attenborough’s friend and fellow filmmaker Lord . Puttnam led tributes to the star, affectionately called ‘Dickie’ by . colleagues and fans. He said he was ‘utterly irreplaceable’, adding: ‘A massively gifted man, he was also the best possible friend. ‘This . is a most remarkable man who, when you string together the things he . did, the things he helped, the things he salvaged, it’s mind-boggling . the list of decent, good things he did for Britain.’ Former . TV executive Lord Grade, who worked with Lord Attenborough at Channel 4 . when he chaired the broadcaster in the 1980s, paid tribute to his . ‘phenomenal’ energy and compassion. Lord Attenborough’s acting credits included Brighton Rock, The Great Escape, 10 Rillington Place and Jurassic Park. Sir Ben Kingsley, who played the title role in Gandhi, said he would ‘miss him dearly’. He added: ‘Richard Attenborough trusted me with the crucial and central task of bringing to life a dream it took him 20 years to bring to fruition. ‘When he gave me the part of Gandhi it was with great grace and joy. He placed in me an absolute trust and in turn I placed an absolute trust in him and grew to love him.’ Jurassic Park director Steven Spielberg, pictured with Lord Attenborough in 1993, said: 'He was a dear friend and I am standing in an endless line of those who completely adored him' Jurassic Park director Steven Spielberg said: ‘He was a dear friend and I am standing in an endless line of those who completely adored him.’ Lord Attenborough had been in a wheelchair since 2008, when he fell down a flight of stairs and hit his head on a window ledge, leaving him in a coma for several days. Soon after he joked about the incident, saying: ‘I scared the living daylights out of Sheila, and had some time in hospital. They were all fussing around.’ But he never fully recovered and was left with slurred speech and unable to walk. He joined his wife in the Denville Hall care home for elderly entertainers, which they helped to found, last year. They had met at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London when they co-starred in a production of The Lady With The Lamp, and married in 1945. Lord Attenborough made his film debut aged 18 in Noel Coward’s 1942 naval movie In Which We Serve. He made his directing debut in 1969 with Oh! What A Lovely War and went on to win four Baftas and four Golden Globes. He never fully recovered and was left with slurred speech and unable to walk.

"The BBC wasted almost £100 million on a failed IT project because senior executives ‘did not have sufficient grip’, an inquiry has found. The Digital Media Initiative was riddled with confusion, delays and inadequate controls, a report by the National Audit Office (NAO) said yesterday. And even though the scheme was axed last year, parts are still operational and costing licence fee payers £3 million a year, the public spending watchdog revealed. Damning: The BBC was accused not having a grip on the huge project which ran into trouble, costing £98million . The . findings are the latest blow to the BBC over DMI, which was launched in . 2008 in order to digitise the Corporation’s archives so that staff . could easily share and download material remotely. But it quickly ran into delays, eventually costing the licence fee payer £98.4 million when it was scrapped last May. However, . yesterday’s NAO report revealed that until last month DMI still cost . £5.3 million a year to run because of costly software licences and . maintenance contracts. Sacked: John Linwood, pictured, whose £280,000 contract was terminated . When . the Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was launched in 2008, it was hailed . by BBC chiefs as 'the single most important initiative we are working . on'. But before a year had . elapsed, it was floundering so badly insiders referred to it as 'Don't . Mention It.' The BBC originally appointed IT firm Siemens to implement . the scheme. But it ditched the company in 2009 as the project floundered . and took it back in house. By then, £26million had already been wasted but it is understood the BBC later recouped the cost from Siemens. In . February 2011, the National Audit Office condemned the corporation over . its handling of the DMI after it ran 21 months behind schedule. The . public spending watchdog found the expected gains had been overstated . and the difficulty of delivering it was underestimated. The Public Accounts Committee criticised the BBC for awarding the contract to Siemens without putting it out to open tender. The . project was meant to allow production staff to access all video and . audio material - for example last year's Olympics coverage - on their . computers. As hundreds of . staff moved to the corporation's new headquarters in Salford, this would . prevent them having to transport tapes of archive material by road from . London, reducing production costs. But the costs of the project continued to spiral to £98.4million until it was finally halted in May. The . BBC said it has now reduced the amount to £3 million, but admitted it . has not yet switched off its old system, which costs an additional . £780,000 a year to maintain. Bosses were also criticised for failing to ensure ‘clear accountability’ for the project. Instead, responsibility was shared between finance head Zarin Patel, . chief operating officer Caroline Thomson and technology boss John . Linwood, who was sacked over the debacle last year. The . report said Miss Patel – who was paid £337,000 a year – did not even . attend some meetings and sent a member of her team instead. Next . week, the trio will be grilled over their roles by MPs on the public . accounts committee, alongside members of the BBC Trust and former . director-general Mark Thompson. Labour . MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, last night said she was . shocked by the ‘astronomic losses’, adding: ‘This report reads like a . catalogue of how not to run a major programme. These failures go right . to the top.’ Yesterday’s . report comes after  accountant PriceWaterhouseCoopers last month found . DMI was ‘not fit for purpose’. NAO chief Amyas Morse said: ‘The BBC . executive did not have sufficient grip on its DMI programme. Nor did it commission a thorough independent assessment of the whole system to see whether it was technically sound.’ Dominic . Coles, the BBC’s director of operations, said: ‘As we have previously . acknowledged, the BBC got this one wrong. 'We took swift action to . overhaul how major projects are managed after we closed DMI last year.’","Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was supposed to give staff archive access .

"BBC chiefs accepted yesterday that producers had made a huge mistake in a children’s programme by claiming that Florence Nightingale was ‘racist’. Historians had accused the corporation of ‘insulting’ her memory by dramatising a scene showing the nurse – famous for her work in the Crimean War – discriminating against a black colleague, Mary Seacole. Horrible Histories featured a sketch in which Miss Nightingale rejects four job applications from Jamaican-born Miss Seacole, saying the work was only ‘for British girls’. Scroll down for video . Wrong: BBC chiefs accepted that CBBC's Horrible Histories wrong to suggest that Florence Nightingale (right, the lady with the lamp) turned down colleague Mary Seacole (left) for not being British . A formal complaint was made by the Nightingale Society, a collection of historians who seek to promote knowledge of her contribution to nursing. One member, Professor Lynn McDonald, wrote in the Daily Mail in August how political correctness had led to Miss Nightingale being smeared. Originally broadcast as part of the hit children's CBBC history show, the sketch also appeared on the BBC's Learning Zone, an educational, online resource for children. The romantic image of Florence Nightingale (left) caring for wounded soldiers in the Crimea and (right) the lady with the lamp in old age . Viewers saw the actress playing Miss Nightingale say: 'The nursing corps was for British girls. You're from Jamaica' to which Seacole responded: 'Me father was from Scotland.' The Seacole character was also seen saying: 'Four times me tried to join Old Lamp-Face's nurses in the Crimean War, and four times she said no.' Yesterday The BBC Trust, the corporation’s governing body, ruled that the two-minute, 34-second clip’s ‘depiction of Florence Nightingale in relation to racial issues was materially inaccurate’. The Committee said that programme-makers should have done more to make it clear that it was not Miss Nightingale herself who rejected Seacole. Seacole had, in fact, gone to Crimea to start her business and didn't ask once for a job. Florence Nightingale (left) with her pet owl (in a drawing done by her sister Parthenope) and Mary Seacole (right) whose role in the Crimea has been overplayed according to her biographer. Seacole never nursed in a hospital, did not start a nursing school, never wrote books or articles on nursing. She never did anything to rival Nightingale's truly pioneering work to improve healthcare . The reality is that she went to Russia in the spring of 1855 to set up a provisions store that sold luxury items (such as tinned lobster) to officers, and a restaurant and bar where they could dine and drink champagne. It was hardly fare for rank and file soldiers. Rather than ministering to the sick and wounded, Seacole's main work by day was food preparation. It said that viewers of the clip, which also showed the pair jostling, 'would be likely to receive the overall impression that Florence Nightingale had acted towards Mary Seacole in a racially discriminatory manner'. It said that given Miss Nightingale's 'significant stature' in modern British history, the allegation required 'compelling proof'. Members of the committee: Former Coronation Street executive producer David Liddiment (left) and Sonita Alleyne (right) are among the six trustees on the BBC's Editorial Standards Committee . The Committee concluded that the sketch breached guidelines on accuracy, saying: 'Given the seriousness of any imputation of racism, the relative recency of Nightingale's life...the immensity of Nightingale's contribution to modern nursing and her significant stature in modern British history, the Committee felt it was incumbent on the programme makers to ensure that there was sound evidence upon which to base any suggestion that she had acted in a racially discriminatory manner in a Learning Zone clip. 'It appeared to the Committee that an allegation of such gravity against a person such as Nightingale required compelling proof. In the Committee's view, the programme makers had provided no such evidence.' It said that it was not trying to suggest limiting 'the range of comedic or dramatic devices' used in history content for children. 'However in this very specific instance, making a charge of racism was very serious.' It added: 'The Committee felt in considering this particular clip and this issue, especially given that it appeared in the Learning Zone, it was important for a clear and rigorous adherence to fact, even within the context of the audience expectations for the format of Horrible Histories.' Children's comedy Horrible Histories began in 1993 as a series of books, written by Terry Deary, before being adapted into stage productions and a CBBC TV show. A BBC spokesman said: 'We note and accept the findings of the ESC. The intention of this Horrible Histories sketch was never to undermine the reputation of such an important historical figure like Florence Nightingale, but to open up a discussion of some of the attitudes of the time. 'The Learning Zone has withdrawn the sketch from their website and the episode of Horrible Histories will not be repeated in its present form.'","Show taken to task by BBC's own Editorial Standards Committee .

"Judy Finnigan faces calls to be sacked from Loose Women after just one appearance on the show. The veteran broadcaster sparked fury during her debut as a panellist when she suggested a convicted rapist footballer should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'. After a huge backlash about the remarks branded 'disgusting' and 'damaging', she was eventually forced to 'apologise unreservedly' for the offence she had caused. But despite the clamour for her to leave the show, ITV told MailOnline today that she is still due to appear on the show again next week. Scroll down for video . Left, Ched Evans was found guilty of rape in 2012 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence and right, Judy Finnigan provoked outrage yesterday after suggesting he should be allowed back to his club, because the attack 'wasn't violent and the victim was drunk' Judy Finnigan, right, appeared with, left to right, Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Jane Moore, on Monday's show . A spokesperson for ITV's Loose Women said: 'She will be on the panel next week so that answers the question.' Her comments came during a discussion on the ITV lunchtime chat show yesterday about whether disgraced footballer Ched Evans should be allowed to return to Sheffield United. The former Wales international, 25, was jailed for five years in 2012 after raping a 19-year-old woman at a hotel near Rhyl, Denbighshire, but will be released from jail within days. So far his former club, which cancelled his contract, has refused to comment on whether he will be offered a new one. But on the show, Ms Finnigan said: 'He's served his time. The rape – and I am not, please, by any means minimising any kind of rape – but the rape was not violent. He didn't cause any bodily harm to the person. 'It was unpleasant, in a hotel room, I believe, and she was – she had far too much to drink. And you know, that is reprehensible, but he has been convicted and he has served his time. 'Now when he comes out, what are we supposed to do? Just actually refuse to let him do his job even though he has already been punished?' Speaking on her Loose Women debut, the veteran broadcaster was discussing allowing rapist Ched Evans to return to play for his former club Sheffield United . But before the programme had even finished, hundreds of viewers had taken to social media to express their outrage. Emma Togwell said: 'How disgusting is Judy finnigan she needs to be sacked.' A Twitter user called Dave said: 'Judy finnigan is a disgrace for her comments on Ched Evans. ITV should sack her immediately.' Steffi Rox ‏wrote: 'The only thing @loosewomen should do now is sack Judy Finnigan and never have her back on the show.' Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, pictured, said she will continue to stand by him when he is released . And another added: 'If ITV do not sack Judy Finnigan after her outrageous comments that the rape was 'not violent' and 'unpleasant' then the world is messed up.' Lucinda Hawksley said:  'Why does Judy Finnigan still have her job on Loose Women? @itv - she thinks rape isn't ""bodily harm""??' But Evans’ girlfriend has also defended the convicted rapist, saying she knows he is innocent and that she will ‘continue to stand by him’. Speaking on ITV's This Morning today, Natasha Massey insisted she ‘knew he wasn’t capable of a crime like that’ and that the people ‘are reading a headline and not reading the facts’. She said: ‘I know Ched is innocent, I love him and I will continue to stand by him. I just want to get him home and live a normal life.' While presenter Phillip Schofield pointed out that Evans had been found guilty beyond reasonable doubt, sister Kylie said: ‘That’s shocking to us. I was in court every day and I have no idea how they came to that conclusion.’ Today, Katie Russell, of Rape Crisis England and Wales, said Miss Finnigan's comments could cause distress to many survivors of sexual violence. She said: 'Judy Finnegan's comments are really unfortunate and could potentially cause some hurt and distress to the many survivors of sexual violence who will inevitably have been watching Loose Women and who will read and hear her views reported. 'Whether intentionally or not, her words do imply that rape that involves extreme physical violence is more traumatic than rape that does not.' She added: 'All rape causes bodily harm and is a lot more than 'unpleasant' regardless of the circumstances in which it takes place. 'Rape is a terrifying experience that can and does have a wide ranging of long-term and even lifelong impacts for those who survive it.' Women's rights campaigner Jean Hatchet has set up a petition calling for Evans to be banned from football. She told the Daily Mail she was 'stunned' by the comments, adding: 'Drunk women don't cause rape. Rapists do. 'Evans had sex with a woman without her consent. That is a violent act. [Miss Finnigan] is guilty of such internalised misogyny that I don't think she was even aware of how hurtful and damaging her comments were.' Last night Miss Finnigan, 66, said: 'I absolutely wasn't suggesting that rape was anything other than an horrendous crime and, as I said on the programme, I was in no way attempting to minimise the terrible ordeal that any woman suffers as a result. 'The point I was attempting to raise as part of the debate was what should happen to someone after they have committed a crime and served their time? I apologise unreservedly for any offence that I may have caused as a result of the wording I used.' Broadcasting regulator Ofcom said it has received nine complaints about Ms Finnigan's comments. ITV said it had received no formal complaints. As they were: Ms Finnigan made her name as one half of Richard&Judy. The couple, who wed in 1986, worked together side by side for two decades . The South Yorkshire club has refused to comment on a possible return for Evans, who was capped 13 times for Wales before his conviction . A petition urging Sheffield United not to reinstate Ched Evans once he is released from prison has been signed by 141,173 people. So far the club, which signed Evans for £3million in 2009, has refused to say whether it will take him back. Women's rights campaigner Jean Hatchet set up the petition on the website Change.org, calling on the club's chairman Kevin McCabe and part-owner Prince Abdullah Bin Musa'ad Bin Abdul Aziz to make it clear that Evans – who still maintains his innocence – will not be welcome. In an open letter to the pair, she said: 'I'm sure he and his supporters are hoping he can quietly slip back into the position of privilege he held before. Unfortunately, he still hasn't acknowledged he is a rapist as determined by a judge and jury. He will be returning, if Sheffield Utd resign him, to a position where he has huge influence over young fans. 'They must not be given the message that rape is a trivial crime. Young boys and men have to be absolutely sure that … consent to sex is essential or the act is rape.' During the trial in 2012, Evans admitted having sex with the victim in a hotel room straight after his friend and former Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, but denied rape. Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey and Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon Taylor have backed his return. Sheffield United did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.","Judy Finnigan's comments on rape sparked outrage during debut on show .

"Sir Cliff Richard is in ‘agony’ and feels imprisoned in Portugal following historic allegations of child sexual abuse, one of his closest friends said yesterday.

These are absolutely his words. 'He said he’s totally devastated. He’s got no idea who his accuser is and, these are his words, he is appalled at what he regards as a completely false accusation. Those are his words. ‘He couldn’t believe this would actually put him through such agony, and again he said “agony”.’ Miss Hunniford’s guest on the show was actress Joan Collins, 81, and her co-panellists were Ruth Langsford, 54, Coleen Nolan, 49, and Janet Street Porter, 67.

He’s totally devastated because he’s got no idea who his accuser is' She added: 'He couldn’t believe that this would actually put him through such agony, again he said ""agony""' The presenter said she has known Sir Cliff for 45 years, adding: ‘I trust him with my life and genuinely I’ve never heard Cliff say a bad word about anybody or put a foot wrong.’ Two weeks ago, the 73-year-old singer flew briefly to Britain from his holiday villa in Portugal to be quizzed by South Yorkshire Police over an allegation from 1985. He met officers by appointment and was not arrested or charged. Miss Hunniford added: ‘[Sir Cliff] said he’s never had so much support in his life, from fans, friends, family, and indeed the Press. ‘He’s got lots of good friends and they’ve been dipping down to Portugal to see him but he’s imprisoned really if you think about it.’ The revelations come just a month after police swooped on Sir Cliff's £3.1million home (pictured) in Berkshire .

"As an international sex symbol, her glamorous lifestyle saw her both loved and envied in equal measure. But one of Brigitte Bardot’s oldest friends - and rivals - says the former Sixties siren is now a ‘sad’ recluse with a ‘dubious private life’. British singer Jane Birkin, who starred with the French actress in her last film Don Juan in 1973, believes that old age has not treated Miss Bardot particularly well. Siren: Miss Bardot, pictured left at the height of her fame, is now more reclusive, according to her friend and co-star Jane Birkin. Right: The actress, an animal rights activist, after meeting the French president in 2007 . Now 79, her once-smooth complexion has been wrinkled by years of sun exposure, and the ardent animal rights activist often walks with the aid of a crutch. A still youthful-looking Miss Birkin, 66, said: ‘She still writes to me, because I give money to her dogs’ association. ‘The postcards I get from her are always rather sad. I think she has difficulty walking. ‘Although she has a dubious private life with rather doubtful characters, she’s made people have a sort of moral conscience.’ She added: ‘People consider her as being animal-mad because human beings have been so disappointing to her, which I think is true. She was so beautiful that people were envious of her. ‘In a scene when we came out of a car, she’d been crying, so she had a slightly red face and people were delighted. They were cruel to her because she was dangerous and could have nicked their husbands.’ Miss Birkin and Miss Bardot both dated French singer Serge Gainsbourg, and both recorded versions of his single Je t’aime moi non plus. Brigitte Bardot was once a pin-up for every teenage boy. She is pictured in the film Le Mepris (1963) Miss Bardot pictured during the filming of La Parisienne. She starred alongside Sean Connery and dated the iconic French singer Serge Gainsbourg, recording a version of his classic single Je t'aime moi non plus . Je t’aime was originally written for Miss Bardot in 1967 when the couple had a brief affair. But when it was released two years later, the female part was sung by Jane Birkin, who had since started up a relationship with Gainsbourg. However Miss Birkin insisted that the pair were friends and never saw themselves as rivals, even when the song’s earlier version was released. She added: ‘Serge rang me up later in life and said, “I’ve got bad news for you. Bardot has rung and you know what she’s like – she wants money for her dogs, so I’ll bring out the original version of Je t’aime.” ‘I did sort of think oh my gosh, now people are going to prefer the first version. But her wonderful version was very different, more sensual and more womanly.’","Co-star in Don Juan: ‘The postcards I get from her are always rather sad'

"The BBC handed its own staff £369million in severance payments over eight years, the spending watchdog revealed yesterday. MPs said the massive sum showed an ‘outrageous disregard for licence-fee payers’ money’. The National Audit Office said the BBC often breached its own guidelines and had ‘put public trust at risk’ by authorising the payouts, including £61million to senior managers. Out: Payments to ten top managers, including former director general George Entwistle (pictured) and chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, totalled £4.9million . Some staff were even paid twice, pocketing a payoff after working out their notice period in full. The average individual payments to senior managers rose steadily to £191,000 last year, demonstrating the BBC had a ‘fat cat mentality’, MPs said. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the damning report revealed a ‘culture of payoffs that simply cannot be justified’. As director general Tony Hall admitted the BBC had ‘lost its way over payments’, pressure mounted on its governing body, the BBC Trust, to explain why it had failed to ‘get a grip’ despite years of disquiet over payoffs to senior staff. Culture Secretary Maria Miller condemned 'a culture of pay-offs' at the Corporation which could not be justified . Lord Hall will appear before the influential Public Accounts Committee of MPs next week alongside BBC Trust chairman Chris Patten and former director general Mark Thompson, who authorised some of the most contentious deals. The NAO revealed: . The NAO report also accused the BBC of failing to keep proper records to document why individual payoffs were approved as it emerged some deals were simply agreed by divisional directors following verbal discussions. NAO head Amyas Morse said: ‘The BBC has too often breached its own already generous policies on severance payments. Weak governance arrangements have led to payments that exceeded contractual requirements and put public trust at risk.’ In an effort to reduce costs, the BBC has cut its senior management by more than 20 per cent since 2005. But 67 per cent of those who left claimed severance payments. These came under three categories: Redundancy payments, money given in lieu of notice in return for their swift departure, and ‘discretionary’ payments. Shockingly, the NAO discovered cases of senior managers claiming money ‘in lieu’ despite having served their full notice periods, effectively paying them twice for the same period of work. One unnamed manager, who earned £300,000, was given a full years’ salary in lieu of notice despite continuing to work for 14 months after agreeing a departure date. The payment was personally approved by Mr Thompson, who also agreed to give the manager a pension ‘augmentation’ of £266,288. In 2005/6, the average individual severance payment was £128,000. This rose steadily to £191,000 in the last financial year. Two staff members were offered £425,000 in lieu of notice even though they had already secured jobs with other employers before leaving. Other managers were given ‘discretionary’ severance payments, the reasons for which were ‘not fully recorded’, the NAO found. One received £219,000 – £141,000 more than they were entitled to, including £49,000 for ‘training and information technology equipment to improve the individual’s skills and career prospects’. Another received an ‘ex-gratia’ payment of £17,600, four months extra pay in lieu of notice worth £71,000, plus a redundancy payment of £88,100. In a separate development, the BBC revealed that Mr Entwistle, who resigned on November 10 in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal after 54 days as director general, received a total of £802,000 during his final year with the corporation. As the Trust set his last day of employment on November 30, he was given an extra three weeks’ salary worth £25,000 on top of a severance payment of £470,300 and a series of generous benefits including legal support and private healthcare. Criticism: New director general Tony Hall admitted the BBC had 'lost its way' with big money pay-offs for senior staff . The BBC also admitted that Mr . Entwistle and Mr Thompson had racked up almost £200,000 in ‘legal and . related costs’ between them for their appearances before the Pollard . Review into how the BBC handled the Jimmy Savile scandal. Last . night Labour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts . Committee, said: ‘I expect [the BBC Trust] will say these payments are . not their responsibility. But they are there to protect the licence fee . payers’ interest and provide oversight. They should have got a grip on . it.’ She added: ‘The BBC . have shown an outrageous disregard for licence fee payers’ money. It . seems there has been a fat cat mentality in the BBC.’ Mrs Miller said: ‘The NAO has exposed a culture of payoffs that simply cannot be justified.’ Despite . accepting its processes were ‘not robust enough’, the BBC said it had . saved more than £35million overall by reducing senior managers. Lord . Hall said: ‘I accept in full the conclusions of the NAO report. The . level of some of these payments was wrong – I said so in my first week . in the job. I believe the BBC lost its way on payments in recent years. I . have already said that we will be capping severance payments at . £150,000 and we have now begun to improve our processes.’ Last . year 71 per cent of the BBC’s £5billion income was funded by the . £145.50 licence fee. The rest was made up by selling BBC programmes . internationally through its commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. One former BBC executive was so . shocked that his £376,000 severance payment was not properly authorised . that yesterday he wrote a cheque to the BBC repaying it. Roly . Keating, who was the director of archive content, left last year after . 29 years’ service to become chief executive of the British Library. Even . though he was not made redundant, he was offered a full years’ salary . of £250,000, as well as some £125,000 in lieu of serving his notice . period. The NAO said the decision to award it was ‘seriously deficient’ and found the BBC agreed to pay the money because it believed he would . not otherwise have accepted his new job, which had a salary of £150,000. The . 51-year-old, who was previously controller of BBC2 and BBC4, left as . the corporation was making redundancies and the future of his role was . uncertain. After being contacted by the NAO, Mr Keating wrote a letter . to the BBC including a cheque for the entire sum. Explaining . his decision to BBC director general Tony Hall, he wrote: ‘You will . understand that as a matter of principle I would never wish to benefit . from a payment that could not be demonstrated to have been fully and . appropriately authorised. ‘This . week I was concerned to receive from the NAO ... new evidence, of which . I was not and could not have been aware, concerning the BBC’s internal . process for approval of the payment to me. ‘This . evidence has led the NAO to observe that the process in this case was . “seriously deficient”. I therefore enclose with this letter a cheque . payable to the BBC, amounting to the full sum I received as severance . payment after tax was deducted by the BBC at source.’ The BBC declined to comment.","National Audit Office reveals BBC broke its own rules with big payouts .

"Deals: Lucy Adams, the BBC's Human Resources chief, approved all agreements over £75,000, including a £680,400 payment to former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson . BBC executives who authorised severance payments of £369million to their own staff may be investigated by the police, an MP warned last night. As corporation bosses insisted there was no need for a ‘witch-hunt’, pressure grew on those responsible for the debacle to face internal disciplinary action and to meet the full force of the law if any of the deals proved to be fraudulent. There were also calls for executives to ‘name and shame’ those who received excessive payments but have refused to return them. In a report published on Monday, the National Audit Office found payouts were made to 7,500 staff over eight years, including £61million to 401 senior managers. It said the corporation had paid staff more than they were entitled to in almost a quarter of the cases it reviewed, putting ‘public trust at risk’. Yesterday, it emerged that many of the payments were signed off by the BBC’s head of human resources, Lucy Adams. According to senior insiders she had a ‘blank cheque book’, allowing her to authorise a £680,400 farewell payment to former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson and a £949,000 payment to former deputy director-general Mark Byford. MPs on the influential Public Accounts Committee called for ‘full accountability’ yesterday, and castigated the ‘greedy and excessive payments’ paid by a ‘self-serving elite’ at the head of the BBC. It came as: . Mark Thompson: Personally approved some of the most controversial payments . LUCY ADAMS . BBC director of human resources.

Criticism: Tory MP Rob Wilson accused the BBC of being 'secretive and evasive' Writing to the NAO’s head, Amyas Morse, . Mr Wilson asked whether it had unearthed any evidence of fraud, . collusion in fraud, misuse of public funds, or other wrongdoing’. He said: ‘In the event that you . consider that criminal offences may have taken place, I would be . grateful if you would inform me whether the evidence is sufficient to . warrant a wider investigation as to the possibility of fraud, misuse of . public funds, or other wrongdoing in relation to severance payments at . the BBC in recent years.’ He added: ‘Based on the reply I . receive, I will consider whether there are grounds to refer this matter . to the police.’ But the BBC’s newly appointed director of news and . current affairs, James Harding, yesterday claimed licence fee payers did . not want the corporation to be ‘apologetic’. The former Times editor said: ‘The BBC . has rightly made its fair share of apologies over the past year. I, . both as a licence-fee payer and a future employee don’t want an . apologetic BBC, I want an ambitious BBC.

BBC agreed to pay the money 'on the grounds that it believed the . individual would not otherwise have accepted the job offer, which had a . lower salary', according to today’s report. In . his letter Mr Keating said of the compromise agreement: 'I entered into . and signed this agreement in the belief that the BBC had proposed it in . good faith and for good reasons, and that it had been properly . sanctioned and authorised.' The BBC’s director of strategy and . digital, James Purnell, is the only member of the corporation’s . executive committee to give an interview on severance payments since the . NAO report was published. Appearing on BBC2’s Newsnight on . Monday, the former Labour minister resisted calls to point the finger of . blame at individuals responsible for agreeing the payments. He said: ‘It was a collective . decision. On things like this you can have a witch-hunt or you can learn . from your mistakes and that is exactly what we are going to do.’ Pressed by presenter Jeremy Paxman, he . said one particularly contentious deal had been ‘signed off by a . combination of HR, finance and, er, they got it wrong’. He added: . ‘There’s no glossing over the fact they got it wrong. It was a mess.’ But yesterday, Tory MP Richard Bacon, . who sits on the public accounts committee, said: ‘What we have found is . that you need to find out exactly who is responsible.

"The BBC’s new director general is to cap redundancy and severance payments for senior managers at £150,000 following outrage over the huge exit deals given to bosses. MPs have in recent months accused the broadcaster of ‘hosing down’ departing executives with cash and said that losing a well-paid job there was like ‘winning the lottery’. There has been astonishment at the generous pay deals given to outgoing executives including former director general George Entwistle and former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who were given £450,000 and £670,000 respectively when they left their jobs last year. New BBC Director General Tony is to cap redundancy and severance payments for senior managers at £150,000 following outrage over the huge exit deals given to bosses . Speaking at his first appearance before the influential culture media and sport select committee yesterday, new director general Tony Hall said he wanted to be sure the BBC was ‘in tune with the times’, saying the new cap was a ‘really important matter of principle’. He also revealed that the proposed limit would affect about 250 people at the corporation, showing just how many executives had been signed up to generous deals at the broadcaster. But critics have said that £150,000 pay-offs will still be seen as excessive by the public. Former director general George Entwistle . and former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who were given . £450,000 and £670,000 respectively when they left their jobs last year . At the parliamentary hearing yesterday the BBC chairman Lord Patten also revealed he was prepared to rip up Lord Hall’s contract and give him a new one without the controversial gagging order, following controversy over the issue. Lord Hall came under fire for the ‘cosy’ way he had appointed senior executives such as controversial former Labour culture secretary James Purnell without ‘open competition’. One MP accused him of appointing his ‘friends’. Lord Patten also faced related accusations about the way he had appointed Mr Hall to the top job without a competitive recruitment process. On the pay-off cap, the corporation will now have to ‘consult’ with the staff who are affected by the changes as it will have to change the terms of their contract. The new proposals will entitle senior managers to one month’s redundancy pay for each year of service up to a maximum of 12 months’ salary or £150,000, whichever is lower. All members of the corporation’s executive board will also have their notice period reduced from 12 months to 6 months. New Director General Tony Hall came under fire for the 'cosy' way he had appointed senior executives . When it was suggested there may be opposition to this from those involved, Mr Hall said emphatically he was ‘confident’ he would get their agreement. Recent figures have revealed that as well as Mr Entwistle’s pay-off, 10 other executives received severance packages in recent years amounting to £4 million, with former deputy director-general Mark Byford being given £949,000. Lord Hall said: ‘We cannot be tone deaf to what licence fee payers and the public out there have said to us about pay-offs for redundancies. ‘So I have announced this morning that we will consult on a £150,000 cap on redundancy and severance payments to affect all senior management, old and new. ‘We have to deal with this problem, it wasn’t right the level of some payments, I hope that will deal with the problem clearly for the public.’ The BBC director general said the £150,000 cap was in line with the civil service. Appearing alongside BBC chairman Lord Patten at the hearing, Mr Hall added: ‘We are consulting with staff and with the unions. We have to do that. It is a contractual change for senior managers and for other members of staff which we have to quite rightly consult on.’ In a message to BBC staff, Mr Hall said past settlements could ‘no longer be justified’. During his opening remarks at the hearing Mr Hall said he wanted to make a ‘simpler BBC’ saying there ‘too much bureaucracy and too many processes’ and structures that ‘hinder’ programme makers. His announcement on tackling huge pay-offs was welcomed last night. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘After George Entwistle’s obscene golden goodbye after just 54 days running the corporation, it was clearer than ever that the BBC needed to clamp down on these eye-watering pay-offs. ‘Lord Hall’s announcement is a long overdue acknowledgment that BBC bosses have for far too long been living on another planet. However, licence fee payers will still see a £150,000 pay-off as excessive.’The National Union of Journalists general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: ‘This is a welcome development. These obscene payments were being paid while other members of the BBC were being forced out of their jobs.’ Lord Patten also faced related accusations about the way he had appointed Mr Hall to the top job without a competitive recruitment process . The new director general has made a string of appointments in recent weeks including former Times editor James Harding and former Labour cabinet minister James Purnell. But he faced claims that the political ties of Mr Purnell were ‘unprecedented’ for a BBC executive and that executive salaries at the corporation were ‘plucked out of the air’. Lord Hall said the former culture secretary was an ‘outstanding character’ and had ‘hung his boots up at the door and left politics behind’. One MP, Conservative, Angie Bray, said the appointment ‘does sound a bit cosy’ and when Lord Hall said he believed in open competition, she interjected: ‘except when you have got some friends you can appoint. It was pointed out to Lord Patten that his selection of Mr Hall was also done ‘without any open competition’. Mr Hall, 62, who was made a cross-bench peer in 2010, was the only person contacted by the BBC Trust for the £450,000-a-year post. Lord Patten told the committee that clauses in Lord Hall’s contract which prevent him from criticising the BBC during his time in office or within two years of his departure were ‘ceremonial’ and he did not expect them to be binding. He said he would be ‘happy' to look again at the director-general’s contract and remove the gagging order. Mr Hall said it would not prevent him from speaking out ‘if I felt something was wrong or if there was something I feel passionate about’.","Tony Hall said he wanted to be sure the BBC was ‘in tune with the times’

"The BBC was yesterday condemned by the spending watchdog for paying its staff £24million to move to Salford without asking for receipts to prove their relocation expenses claims. MPs accused the corporation of overseeing a ‘colossal waste of money’ after the National Audit Office found 894 staff were handed an average of £23,000 each, inlcuding 11 who received more than £100,000 for homes worth between £500,000 and £1million. The money was to compensate them for the cost of moving to the BBC’s new £1billion headquarters. However, they did not have to provide basic evidence of train fares or utility bills to back up their expense claims. The BBC's decision to pay generous allowances to persuade staff to move to the Media City in Salford has been criticised by the National Audit Office . The BBC spent a total of £150,000 on moving just one member of staff to Greater Manchester. The generous ‘relocation allowances’ mean the total cost of moving BBC staff is to rise to more than twice the estimate of £11million. Hundreds claimed up to £1,900 a month to cover all rent, bills and council tax in Salford, while others received £3,000 to buy new curtains and carpets. The influential Public Accounts Committee of MPs promised to investigate the corporation’s financial affairs as it was revealed: . Tory MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Culture Media and Sport select committee, said: ‘This report shows what we already knew, which is that the move to Salford is a colossal waste of money.’ The National Audit Office (NAO) report criticised the BBC for imposing ‘inadequate’ controls over its relocation payments to staff. It also said many aspects of the BBC’s relocation package were ‘unusual’ and ‘more generous than it normally offers’. BBC Breakfast was among the programmes to move from London to Greater Manchester . Staff who do not wish to move to Salford permanently can instead commute there – a 200-mile journey from London – for two years and receive £1,900 a month to cover the cost of renting an apartment in the city. But they were not asked provide train tickets or utility bills to prove their expense claims. The NAO report said: ‘The BBC did not apply a consistent approach to checking that relocating staff had actually incurred the costs that they were claiming. ‘The BBC did not ask staff to provide evidence that they owned a home and were therefore entitled to homeowners’ allowances until after payments started. Staff on the remote location allowance had to provide copies of their rental agreements or hotel bills but not receipts for train travel or utilities.’ Peter Salmon, head of BBC North, said he thought the move to Salford was a 'positive' step . Depending on what relocation package they chose, BBC staff were given a cash payment of £5,000 and 10 per cent of their salary as an ‘incentive’ to move. Those who sold their homes and bought property in Salford were offered a financial guarantee meaning they would receive at least 85 per cent of the market value of their old home. But despite the already generous terms, many staff members were allowed to claim back more than the BBC’s standard relocation policy normally allows. The NAO found these special exceptions ‘had not been documented’ while reasons for the decisions to grant them were ‘unclear or missing’. The BBC Trust admitted that some of the lapses in financial control were ‘unacceptable’ but insisted all payments have since been audited, revealing ‘no irregularities’. Anthony Fry, chairman of the BBC Trust’s finance committee, said the NAO report found the total relocation cost of £224million was £9million under budget. Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said her committee will travel to Salford next month for a special hearing into the NAO report. Peter Salmon said he was permanantly based in Salford and renting at his own expense. The move of Radio Five Live, BBC Sport, children’s programmes and BBC Breakfast from London to Salford was initially suggested by Greg Dyke in 2004 when he was director general. He claimed he wanted to address concerns that the corporation was too ‘London-centric’. The BBC has estimated its move to Salford could create an additional 15,000 jobs in the region through added spending. However it has directly recruited just 254 staff from Greater Manchester, including 39 from Salford.","More than 850 staff given thousands of pounds to move to the north .

"It was heartbreaking enough for his young fans when he started going out with a TV presenter 15 years his senior. So the news that Caroline Flack wasn’t the first older woman to catch Harry Styles’s eye may be rather too much to bear. It has emerged that the 18-year-old One Direction star had already had a secret romance with married radio presenter Lucy Horobin, who at 32 is the same age as Miss Flack. Secret: One Direction star Harry Styles had a romance with married radio presenter Lucy Horobin . Popular: Miss Horobin interviewed One Direction for Manchester-based radio station Key 103 . Their short-lived affair began when Styles was 17, and almost wrecked Miss Horobin’s marriage. He met Miss Horobin, nicknamed Lulu by friends, last August, when she interviewed the band for Manchester-based station Key 103. Their relationship was common knowledge among staff at the station, who had noticed them flirting on air. A former colleague at Key 103 told the Daily Mail: ‘Apparently Lucy and Harry hit it off from the moment the boys walked into the studio – it was electric and they were flirting like crazy. Glamorous: Miss Horobin's short-lived affair with Styles began when the singer was 17 . ‘Lucy made it quite clear she fancied him and there was a lot of banter between them both on and off air. It got a little risqué. ‘She is a really fun girl with loads of personality and she’s not at all shy about coming forward and making sure she gets what she wants. ‘People knew that Lucy’s marriage was in a strange place at the time and obviously the attraction between her and Harry was mutual. ‘She looks just like George Clooney’s ex, Lisa Snowdon, and that sophisticated “older woman” look obviously appeals to Harry.’ Miss Horobin had been married to husband Oliver Pope for only a year when she met Styles. The couple lived in a rented terraced house in Chorlton, Manchester, where neighbours described them as ‘nice and friendly’. But they are said to have encountered difficulties and were leading separate lives at the time of the affair. Miss Horobin’s flirtation with Styles began on air when she interviewed him alongside his bandmates Liam Payne, 18, Zayn Malik, 19, Louis Tomlinson, 20, and Niall Horan, 18. Introducing the show, she said: ‘I’m joined by five very handsome and lovely boys, and I’ve got you all to myself tonight.’ Styles was quick to compliment her, saying: ‘You look lovely today.’ She replied: ‘Thanks Harry, so do you.’ The pair later exchanged flirtatious messages on Twitter and Facebook. Miss Horobin and Styles then met secretly at a hotel in Manchester, where they reportedly spent a night together. It is understood they met again in December – after Styles had started dating Miss Flack – when One Direction returned to the city for another concert. A source said: ‘I think that was the end of it. By then I think Lucy was determined to mend her marriage and put this fling behind her.’ In February, Miss Horobin and her husband moved south together after she landed a new job at another radio station. A former neighbour said: ‘She said she had a job at Heart radio. ‘She said they were going to be renting a cottage on a farm so there would be plenty of room for her cats in the fields.’ Styles dated Xtra Factor presenter Miss Flack for three months. They split in January. The singer has previously denied he is attracted to so-called ‘cougars’ – older women who seduce younger men. Yesterday Styles’s spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for Miss Horobin did not respond to the Mail’s enquiries. Affair: The pair's relationship was common knowledge among staff at the radio station, where staff noticed them flirting on air .

"Their riotous show has just won one of the most prestigious awards  in radio. But, as may be apparent from their names, Beryl and Betty are not the latest young turks of the airwaves. They are - at 86 and 90 respectively - probably the oldest women on radio. The age of radio: Betty, left and Beryl in the studio . Winners: David Reeve of BBC Radio Humberside celebrates his award with 'co hosts' Betty and Beryl . Nevertheless, they have seen off established stars and much younger rivals to win the award for best entertainment programme at the Sony Radio Academy Awards, the Oscars of the UK industry. The BBC Radio Humberside hosts beat names including Frank Skinner and the BBC’s Adam & Joe for their hour-long Saturday evening show which airs at 6pm. The pair banter with co-host David Reeves about matters such as fashion and sex, cackle to seaside postcard humour, and play easy-listening music. Mr Reeves, who also produces the show, met the two pensioners during a guided tour of the BBC Hull building in 2006. They now join him every week to offer their ‘knowledge of local history, new music and taste in younger men’. The Sony radio award judges said: ‘A . joyous, entertaining  double act, having fun with the medium and . unconstrained by any ingrained ideas of what works and what doesn’t. ‘They . give a voice to a sector of society unrepresented on radio, and do it . with a joy that puts many of their fellow broadcasters to shame.’ The . double act, which has been on air for six years, picked up their award . watched by some of the industry’s biggest names, including Radio 2 star . Chris Evans. The ceremony also featured performances from Jessie J and Gary Barlow. Previous winners of the same award have included Evans, Russell Brand and Chris Moyles. However, the ladies’ show only pulls in between 10,000 and 20,000 regular listeners each week, directly after their station’s football coverage ends. Last night Beryl Renwick, 86, said: ‘It’s never been known to have older people like us getting their big break in broadcasting. It’s quite a thing at our age. ‘It all started six years ago. We used to run a Saturday night club for ladies, and we asked the BBC to take us round the studios. 'David heard us talking and interviewed us for a job on his show, and it all went on from there.’ Asked for the secret of the show’s success, Betty Smith, 90, said: ‘We never stop talking. ‘And because we have lived full lives, people want to hear what we have to say. We are full of good advice.’ Mrs Renwick added: ‘We are never scared to give a straight answer. If a caller has a dilemma, we do our best to help. And we don’t get embarrassed, no matter what the subject matter is.’ Mr Reeves has said: ‘I was interested in older people’s views. Nothing heavy, just their stories, their thoughts on the week.’ He said he had visited old  people’s homes to find the right people but had drawn a blank. Andy Gray, left, and Richard Keys, right – sacked from Sky TV in a sexism row two years ago – won the best sports programme award, pictured right, for their TalkSport show. The sexism scandal in January 2011, which brought an abrupt end to their 20-year stint with Sky began when the two were recorded speaking off-air about female assistant referee Sian Massey prior to a game between Liverpool and Wolves. Gray was sacked from his £1.7m a year job at Sky after more tapes emerged of him making sexist comments. He asked co-presenter Charlotte Jackson to tuck a microphone into his trousers in a 12-second video posted on YouTube by an anonymous user. Presenter Richard Keys resigned from his £500,000 a year job after a tape was posted of him using crude language in a studio at Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge ground. He referred to a woman as 'it' and twice asked pundit Jamie Redknapp if he 'smashed it'. Redknapp replied that he 'used to go out with her'.

"When George Clooney suggested the Elgin Marbles be returned to Greece earlier this year, many chalked his interest  down to promoting his new film. But the actor may have in fact taken inspiration from his human rights lawyer wife, who is aiding the Greek government with its bid to take back the artefacts from the British Museum. Amal Alamuddin Clooney will fly to  Athens to aid discussions as to how best to secure the Marbles' return next week at the request of the Greek prime minister. Scroll down for video . George Clooney's calls for the return of the Elgin Marbles may have been inspired by his new bride, Amal Alamuddin (pictured together) The actor suggested the artefacts 'found their way back' to Greece while promoting his film The Monuments Men earlier this year. His human rights lawyer wife (left) is reportedly due to fly to Greece to aid talks . The 36-year-old will be joined by her colleague, Geoffrey Robertson QC, who secured the return of the remains of Tasmanian Aborigines  from the Natural History Museum in 2006. It comes after her Hollywood husband spoke in favour of the Greeks' plea for the Marbles to be returned to Athens from Britain while promoting The Monuments Men in February. The film is based on a group of allied men and women who saved historic European art from the destructive force of the Nazis during the Second World War. At a press conference in Greece, Mr Clooney, 53, was asked whether he sided with his hosts or with Britain when it came to the Elgin Marbles, sold to the British government by Lord Elgin in 1816. The artefacts have remained at the British Museum since, but are considered by some to be the property of the Greeks who have tirelessly fought for their return. 'I think you have a very good case to make about your artefacts.  I don't think it would be a bad thing if they were returned,' Mr Clooney told a journalist. Later, at a press conference at London's National Gallery, he said while he was not an expert in the matter, he felt the Marbles ought to 'find their way back'. Clooney made the comments while promoting his film The Monuments Men in which he and Matt Damon (pictured) are among a group of men and women who protect European art from the destructive Nazis during the Second World War . The Elgin Marbles were sold to the British Parliament in 1816 and presented to the British Museum where they have since been on display (pictured) 'Even in England the polling is in favour of returning the Marbles of the Pantheon (sic). 'It's one of those. There are certain pieces that you look at and you think, that actually, probably would be the right thing to do.' The Elgin Marbles refers to a collection of stone objects acquired by Lord Elgin while he was ambassador to the Ottoman court of the Sultan in Istanbul. After an explosion in the ancient building, built as a shrine to the goddess Athena, many of the sculptures could not have been reattached to the walls they were originally part of. With the permission of the Ottoman, Lord Elgin removed around half of the pieces for his own collection. Among them was a series of inscriptions which he sold to the British Parliament in 1816. It was presented to the British Museum, and has remained there since. Parts of the Marbles are also displayed at the Louvre and the Vatican, as well as in museums in Copenhagen, Vienna, Wurzburg and Munich. Since the early Eighties, the Greek government has appealed to the British Museum to return its part of the Marbles. Almost half of the surviving sculptures are shown at the Acropolis Museum in Athens. His comments sparked outrage among British politicians who suggested he did not understand the complexity of the situation. John Whittingdale, the chairman of the culture, media and sport committee said at the time: 'I'm a great admirer of George Clooney, but I suspect that he probably doesn't know the history of the Elgin Marbles and the legal entitlement that Britain has to them.' Today, a spokesman for Doughty Street Chambers, where Mrs Alamuddin Clooney works, confirmed she had been asked to advise the Greek government on the matter. 'Doughty Street barristers Geoffrey Robertson QC and Amal Alamuddin Clooney will be conducting a visit to Athens on 13-16 October 2014 at the invitation of the Greek government in connection with the Parthenon sculptures that are presently on display in the British Museum. 'In 2006 Mr Robertson led the legal initiative which required the Natural History Museum to return the remains of Tasmanian Aborigines. 'Mr Robertson and Mrs Clooney were first asked to provide legal advice to the Greek government on this matter in 2011. 'They will be holding a series of meetings with government officials during their stay, including the Prime Minister, Mr Antonis Samaras, and the Minister of Culture, Mr Konstantinos Tasoulas,' a statement said. The British Museum this morning said it had no knowledge of any new efforts to have the artefact removed. 'We're not aware of any new developments and we've certainly not been contacted. 'As far as we are aware there is no change in the situation,' a spokesman said.","Elgin Marbles from the ancient Parthenon are held at The British Museum .

"The Duchess of Cornwall is expected to plea with the nation to support credit unions as alternative to payday loan companies (pictured today in Kent) The Duchess of Cornwall will today issue an impassioned plea to the nation to support credit unions as an alternative to the payday loan industry. Camilla, who herself uses a local banking co-operative, is expected to tell industry leaders: ‘Credit unions can change the way we talk and think about savings and loans. ‘They can encourage those who have the means to save and bring in from the cold those vulnerable people who struggle to qualify for loans. ‘The simple fact being that if more of us support them by opening savings accounts, they will be able to offer more loans to those who really need them.’ A credit union is a regulated co-operative, whose members can borrow from pooled deposits at low interest rates. The UK has more than 520, boasting more than a million members and managing £1billion of assets. Because there are no shareholders and they are not driven by profit, credit unions can offer very low interest rates – on average 12 per cent a year – for those seeking loans to tide them over in financial difficulties. This compares with payday lenders such as Wonga, the country’s largest, which has charged a staggering 5,853 per cent in annual interest. MPs, debt campaigners and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is involved in setting up the Church of England’s own credit union, have all joined the growing clamour of critics branding short-term lenders ‘legal loan sharks’. As a member of the Royal Family, Camilla does not want to be seen as passing comment on payday lenders but is instead keen to tell people about the credit union movement. A spokesman for the Duchess said: ‘The Duchess wants to raise awareness of credit unions, which do not have an established national profile, nor do people understand what they are and what they do. 'Credit unions are regulated financial institutions. They are based within the community and are not for profit. As a member of the Royal Family, Camilla does not want to pass comment on payday lenders but is raising awareness of credit unions. Pictured on memorial pitch at the former school of her late brother, Mark Shand . MPs, debt campaigners and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is involved in setting up the Church of England’s own credit union, have all joined the growing clamour of critics branding short-term lenders ‘legal loan sharks’ ‘Her Royal Highness believes credit unions do a valuable job in their local communities and wants more people to know about them. 'She felt that International Credit Union Day was a good time to raise awareness about the good work they do.’ Indeed, Camilla has put her money where her mouth is. In January 2013 she opened up a personal savings account with the London Mutual Credit Union. It is understood the royal was ‘inspired’ by the work the mutual does. It is believed she uses her savings account to support local community projects. The Duchess has drawn together at Clarence House a high-profile gathering of representatives from business, banking and politics, as well as credit union members and volunteers, to mark International Credit Union Day. In particular, the group wants to find ways to encourage more savers to get involved. Although some of the small credit unions are not able to offer a return on investments, many offer interest or dividends of up to 1.75 per cent, which is healthy compared to the high street. Marlene Sheils CEO of Capital Credit Union in Edinburgh said: ‘This is about people coming together and pooling their savings together. From that pool of savings we are able to lend to each other. ‘We are not a poor persons’ bank. We just need everybody in the community to become involved. Joining a credit union gives you a good deal but helps people as well.’ Payday lenders such as Wonga have been criticised for repeatedly lending money to people who can not afford to pay it back, further spiralling them into debt. The firm’s reputation was damaged further this summer when it was revealed to have been charging customers for letters from fake legal firms to pressurise them into paying up. Earlier this month Wonga agreed to write off the debts – thought to total £220million – of 330,000 customers who are in arrears of 30 days or more. This was a direct consequence of discussions with watchdogs at the Financial Conduct Authority. Chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said: ‘Payday lenders have engaged in poisonous practices for years. ‘The payday loan market has pushed people into debt by repeatedly concealing the true cost of loans and failing to check if borrowers can repay. 'In only a quarter of the payday loan cases reported to us did the borrower think their payday lender had treated them sympathetically.’ Wonga has been criticised for repeatedly lending money to people who cannot afford to pay it back, which leaves them spiralling into more debt. Earlier this month the company had to write of £220million in debts .","Duchess of Cornwall will tell industry leaders to support credit unions .

"Union leaders said triking BBC staff would have returned to work in the event of Nelson Mandela's death  - but suggested the death of Baroness Thatcher might not have warranted the same response. When it emerged that ailing South African president Nelson Mandela, 94, had been admitted to hospital, union leaders declared the walk-out would be postponed in the event of his death 'for BBC news coverage of that story only'. But the question of whether the same . would apply in the event of the death of Baroness Thatcher - nemesis of . the trade union movement in the 1980s - was not met with the same . response. Journalists and technical staff staged a . 12-hour walk-out at midday yesterday amid a row over job losses, workload and . bullying claims at the Corporation. Contrast: Strike action at the BBC would have been postponed in the event of Nelson Mandela's (left) death, but that of Baroness Thatcher (pictured right in 2005), might not have warranted the same response . Strike action: Journalists and technical staff staged a walk-out yesterday amid a row over job losses and workloads . The National Union of Journalists and Bectu both told the Daily Telegraph they had not considered what their course of action would be in the event of the 87-year-old former prime minister's death. 'Mandela, with his background in the trade unions, is an important figure for everybody,' an NUJ spokesman said. A BBC spokeswoman said of the union's contingency plan ahead of yesterday's walk-out in light of Mr Mandela's condition: 'We welcome this announcement and it is a tribute to the character of BBC staff.' The strike, which lasted until midnight, led to the cancellation of BBC 2’s Newsnight, Radio 4’s PM and the World Tonight. There are further threats of stoppages to come at the BBC as the corporation makes savings and the action will be followed by a ‘work to rule’. The BBC apologised for disruption caused by the strike but said it could not agree to union calls for compulsory job losses to be postponed. Members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) and the technicians’ union Bectu mounted picket lines outside BBC centres, including New Broadcasting House in central London. The unions are protesting at the Delivering Quality First (DQF) programme which will lead to 2,000 job losses. Impact: The strike left the BBC news channel with insufficient workers to put out a live service . Viewers aired their bafflement at the situation on the BBC's news channel from midday yesterday. One wrote: ‘Odd. BBC News Channel has a big “recorded” banner at the top of the screen, and has just started with “Good morning”. Problems?’ Another wrote: ‘BBC News Channel running pre-recorded output - ‘Hello Good Morning...’ One added: ‘BBC on strike, BBC News channel output is recorded from this morning.’ The BBC said last night that the first hour of the strike on the news channel had shown recorded coverage from the previous hour to manage the transition into the strike period. They claimed this had also happened during previous strikes. Initially more than 100 people massed outside Broadcasting House as part of the action. At its peak, a thick picket line sprawled across the width of the main entrance. However within 30 minutes the group’s numbers dwindled to about a dozen, who stood in a small group, holding placards in front of the centre’s glass revolving doors. Some claimed that staff were being ‘bullied’ to do more work as a result of the cuts.","BBC workers staged a 12-hour walk-out in row over job losses and workload .

"The Queen was last night heralded as ‘Queen Astute’ for her ‘carefully calculated’ appeal for voters to exercise caution in the Scottish independence referendum. Pro-Union MPs roundly applauded Her Majesty’s call for voters to think ‘carefully’ about how they vote in Thursday’s referendum – with many interpreting her words as clear support for keeping Scotland in the UK. Scottish Nationalists denied furiously that her remarks represented a challenge to the No campaign, however – with First Minister Alex Salmond insisting the Queen was ‘absolutely impartial’. Warning: Her Majesty is said to have told a well-wisher that voters should 'think very carefully about the future' The 88-year-old monarch made her much-debated remark on Sunday after attending a service at Crathie Kirk near her Scottish home of Balmoral. Her Majesty took the unusual step of not only stopping to talk to 40 well-wishers but also inviting the Press over, commenting: ‘I hope everybody thinks very carefully about the referendum this week.’ Asked about her remark yesterday, Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: ‘This was not an intervention but nevertheless it was an important Royal aside. She is not Queen mute but she is Queen astute.’ Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured, insisted the Queen was ‘absolutely impartial’. Former Foreign Office minister Henry Bellingham said: ‘Anyone who has been a follower of what the Queen has said over the years should be in no doubt about her views, her incredible support for the Union,’ while left wing Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Queen’s comments were ‘carefully calculated’ to remain neutral. But Alex Salmond insisted: ‘I think Her Majesty the Queen is absolutely impartial in this referendum.’ Last week, Buckingham Palace said in a statement that any suggestion the Queen would want to influence the referendum result is ‘categorically wrong’. Downing Street declined to comment.","Her Majesty heralded as 'Queen Astute' for 'carefully calculated' words .

Kate, 32, who is around ten weeks pregnant with her second child, retreated to her family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, this week with her son, Prince George. Sources said the Duchess 'hasn't been at all well' as she battles hyperemesis gravidarum, which causes severe vomiting in expectant mothers. Scroll down for video . Duchess of Cambridge, who is around ten weeks pregnant with her second child, retreated to her family home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, this week with her son, Prince George . Kate was hospitalised with hyperemesis gravidarum and dehydration during her first pregnancy with George . Indeed, Kate has been so sick that aides have been forced to cancel all her forthcoming engagements until at least the week after next. Her mother Carole Middleton has apparently helped to take charge of her recovery and has been researching alternative sickness cures, such as herbal tea, on the internet. And despite the presence of Spanish nanny Maria Borallo, Mrs Middleton has also been taking George off her daughter's hands. She has been seen in local shops with her 15-month-old grandson, prompting one startled assistant to write on Twitter: 'Served Kate Middleton's mum and Prince George today at work. He is gorgeous!'

A source added: 'Don't be fooled by the fact that she hasn't been admitted to hospital this time. She is just as poorly. The difference is that her doctors have been able to diagnose and treat her quicker. She really hasn't been at all well, though.' The Duchess was forced to cancel her first solo overseas visit – a trip to Malta – last month because of the severity of her condition. Last week she also reluctantly cancelled a visit to a project by The Art Room in London and several other forthcoming engagements have now been scratched out of her diary. Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that she is expected to take part in the state visit of the president of the Republic of Singapore on October 21. However, a source warned: 'Her attendance will be reviewed closer to the time, depending on her health.' Caitlin Dean, of the charity Pregnancy Sickness Support, said: 'Hyperemesis gravidarum is not morning sickness. It is a chronic and debilitating condition that can cause sufferers to vomit up to 30 times a day.' Hyperemesis gravidarum affects about 15 per cent of all pregnancies. The condition is thought to be caused by elevated levels of ‘pregnancy hormone’ HCG, or human chorionic gonadotropin, which increases after conception. It causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis. It is much more serious than the nausea commonly experienced by expectant mothers. The severe dehydration puts both mother and baby at risk of being deprived of essential nutrients and sufferers can be left vomiting up to 30 times a day, with exhausting and hazardous consequences. They cannot eat or drink without retching and may lose up to 10 per cent of their body weight when they are supposed to be gaining about 1lb a week. It can trigger a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine known as ketosis as the body tries to compensate for lack of food. Hyperemesis sufferers can also experience acid reflux, where stomach acid keeps repeating up the throat. Hospital treatment for these women is essential, as without intravenous feeding and fluids they are at risk of becoming dangerously dehydrated. Treatment typically includes an injection of the drug heparin to protect against blood clots triggered by dehydration, as well as supplementation of vitamin B, one of the vitamins most depleted by the condition. An intravenous infusion of saline for rehydration is standard practice. The condition can also affect the baby’s development and there is a risk it will be premature or have a very low birth weight. In severe cases, the sickness can trigger a miscarriage.","Duchess of Cambridge is around ten weeks pregnant with her second child .

Prince Harry brought the Invictus Games to a close this evening and praised the hundreds of wounded servicemen and women who took part as 'inspiring' Thanking the 400 international competitors, he said: 'These games have shone a spotlight on the unconquerable character of servicemen and women and their families - their invictus spirit. 'These games have been about seeing guys sprinting for the finish line and then turning round to clap the last man in. 'They have been about team-mates choosing to cross the line together; not wanting to come second, but not wanting the other guys to either. 'These games have shown the very best of the human spirit.' 'Many of us here this evening have friends who paid the ultimate sacrifice and are no longer with us; we should take a moment to remember them. ‘And then there are others, perhaps watching at home, at an earlier stage in their recovery or for whom the challenges ahead still seem insurmountable.‘ .

British singer Ellie Goulding also performed at the concert where more than 20,000 people gathered . 'By definition, servicemen and women are highly skilled, well trained and motivated people. 'Many of those injured are young men and women, with their whole lives ahead of them. For those no longer able to serve in the Armed Forces, the future is often uncertain. ‘However, we should be there, ready to support them, if or when they need it. For a few this may mean long term physical and mental support, but for the majority this means fulfilling employment. 'Not special treatment, but to be treated as they were before injury, with respect, admiration and recognition of their considerable talent. ‘As the focus inevitably moves elsewhere; through the work of our Foundation, William and I will continue to draw attention to the challenges facing all those leaving the armed forces, whether wounded or not, to ensure they can do so with purpose, with hope and with confidence. 'They are a credit to our nation and to each nation here at these games.' A message from his grandmother The Queen read: 'As I have followed the competition over the past four days, I have been deeply moved by your courage, determination and talent. 'All of you have used the power of sport to enhance your own recovery and to raise wider awareness of the enormous challenges faced by wounded veterans. ‘The success of these Games can be measured not by medals won, but by the renewed sense of purpose and confidence in your abilities that you have gained.'

Singer James Blunt dedicated his hit You’re Beautiful to Harry, while Dave Grohl, lead singer of the Foo Fighters, revealed how Harry had got his number from a friend and called him personally to persuade him to play. Earlier in the day, Harry said he would unwind with a birthday beer with Team GB captain Dave Henson. 'On the birthday side of things, I'll be chuffed to bits when I'm having a beer with Dave Henson, captain of the GB team - we turn 30 at exactly the same time, on Sunday night,' he said. 'We're really looking forward to being 30, both feeling quite old about it.'

Speaking about the competitors he added: 'Rest assured these guys are going to party on Sunday night and they deserve to.' It is thought that Harry was due at Kensington Palace last night for a party organised by Kate and his old friend and nightclub owner Guy Pelly. However the prince instead stayed late into the evening watching Invictus events. The Invictus Games is Paralympics-style championship, featuring competitions such as wheelchair rugby, sitting netball and indoor rowing. Competitors, many with missing limbs or other serious injuries, welcomed the sporting challenge, while the auditoriums were full at most of the events.

"She was captured ‘photo-bombing’ two Commonwealth Games athletes over the summer and has even posed for her first ‘selfie’. But the Queen has confided that she actually finds the phenomena of people filming her on their mobile phones rather ‘strange’. Never one to get on her soapbox, her feelings on the subject have, however, been made public by the US Ambassador to the UK, Matthew Barzun. Scroll down for video . The Queen confided in the US Ambassador to the UK, Matthew Barzun, that she finds it 'strange' with 'crowds all standing there holding up their mobile phones' The 43-year-old diplomat, tipped as a future American president, told this month’s Tatler magazine that he was invited, along with his wife, to Buckingham Palace when they arrived in the UK last year. He recalled how they had a ‘nice chat’ with the Queen, who told them ‘how strange she finds it these days, with the crowds all standing there holding up their mobile phones’. ‘She was essentially saying, ‘I miss eye contact,’ Mr Barzun told the magazine. The 88-year-old sovereign is by no means a Luddite – owning a mobile phone and an iPod on which, it is said, staff download The Proms for her to listen to. She and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 93, are also said to be surprisingly computer literate. But according to senior royal sources the Queen does find the trend for members of the public to stand close up and attempt to film their encounters with her ‘not a little disconcerting’. On her recent state visit to Paris, it is understood that some over-excited members of the public had to be physically restrained as they rushed forward, camera phones brandished, to photograph and video her. The 88-year-old sovereign was captured photobombing two Australian athletes during this summer's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Similarly, when members of the Royal Family go on walkabouts it is not uncommon for people chatting to them to push a camera-phone in their face and simultaneously film the encounter. Other members of the Royal Family have also openly spoken about their antipathy to social media, on which many of these pictures are posted. Harry, 29, recently admitted to a class teaching teenagers how to use social media to promote charity work: ‘I really quite hate Twitter’. The prince said he felt pictures and information about his movements that were regularly shared on the site as an invasion of his privacy. On the whole, however, most royals are happy to play along. The Queen was declared to have carried out the ‘best photo-bomb in history’ when she walked, smiling, into a shot being taken by two Australian hockey players at the Commonwealth Games earlier this summer. Jayde Taylor was posing for a photo with team-mate Brooke Peris when the radiant Queen appeared in the background over her shoulder. Harry also got involved in the act when he put his thumbs up behind New Zealand sevens rugby coach Sir Gordon Tietjens (left) Sport Manawatu chief executive Trevor Shailer during the swimming . The hockey player then posted the picture on Twitter, where it was retweeted thousands of times with the hashtag #queenselfie. Prince Harry showed he was an equally good sport at the Games when he leant over and gave a cheeky thumbs-up in the back of a shot of New Zealand team officials. Other members of the Royal Family to have posed for selfie-style shots include Prince Charles and Prince William. Last year Brownie Jessica Fitch couldn’t believe her luck when she persuaded not only the Queen but Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall to each pose for photographs with her battered old bear, Bertie. The gutsy seven-year-old, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was at a Buckingham Palace event when she secured her unprecedented royal hat trick. The secret to her success, however, was not that she thrust a phone in the monarch’s face - but that she asked her politely. ‘She held up Bertie towards the Queen so I just said without thinking: ‘Ma’am’, would you mind posing for a picture with Bertie bear from our Brownie group?’ ‘ said her father, Michael. Jessica continued: ‘The Queen looked at Bertie’s uniform and smiled and asked me : ‘Are you a Brownie?’ ‘Then I said, in a very posh voice, ‘Yes I am’. And she said ‘Yes, of course’.","Sovereign shared feelings with US Ambassador to the UK Matthew Barzun .

"It is arguably the most exclusive swimming pool in the country. Perfect, one might say, for a future king. And that’s exactly why little Prince George is now enjoying weekly swimming lessons with his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, in the historic pool at Buckingham Palace, it can be revealed. On his first birthday this week, George was seen being driven into Buckingham Palace by his mother, accompanied by his nanny Maria Borallo and a police protection officer, on what was believed to be a visit to his grandparents. Scroll down for video . Prince George is now enjoying weekly swimming lessons with his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, in the historic pool at Buckingham Palace, it can be revealed . In fact, he was off to enjoy his weekly splash-about. The pool, which is situated at the rear of the palace, was converted from a conservatory in 1938 and has been used by generations of royal children, including Prince Charles and his siblings, Andrew, Edward and Anne. More recently, George’s late grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales, visited each week as part of her fitness regime, as well as using it to teach her sons William and Harry how to swim. Now George is continuing the family tradition with regular dips with his mother when the family are in London. At a recent event to highlight his new presidency of the British Sub-Aqua Club, Prince William told how George loves splashing around and that bath-time has become ‘quite painful’ A source said: ‘The Duchess brings him up to the palace every week now.’ At a recent event to highlight his new presidency of the British Sub-Aqua Club, Prince William told how George loves splashing around and that bath-time has become ‘quite painful’. His own father Prince Charles also revealed he instilled a love of water in his son from an early age. ‘I threw him in the swimming pool on occasions. Instead of putting him off, it enthused him,’ he said. Teaching babies to swim at an early age in a safe environment is highly recommended. Members of the Royal Household are, it has been claimed, also permitted to use the Queen’s swimming pool. But rules state that if a staff member is swimming and a royal appears they have to get out of the pool unless invited to stay. If a staff member arrives to swim and a royal is already swimming, they must not attempt to join them, it is said. Kensington Palace declined to comment last night, saying it wouldn’t discuss a ‘private’ matter.","Pool, situated at the rear of Buckingham Palace, was converted from a conservatory in 1938 .

"The new arrival will enjoy an idyllic country upbringing with Prince George as their parents move into their Norfolk home later this month. Despite official claims that Kensington Palace will remain the family’s primary residence, the Cambridges will increasingly use Anmer Hall as their main base – particularly as they will have two children under two by next spring. The ten-bedroom Georgian mansion was a present from the Queen following their wedding and has undergone a complete refurbishment, paid for by the couple. Scroll down for video . Idyllic: The Cambridges will increasingly use Anmer Hall (pictured) as their main base – particularly as they will have two children under two by next spring. The ten-bedroom Georgian mansion is close to William's new job . Family: Both William and Kate have never made a secret of the fact that they wanted more children. Above, the couple pose for a photo with their son, Prince George, and pet dogs in the garden of the Middleton family home . With William’s new role as a pilot with East Anglia Air Ambulance Service based in Cambridge – less than an hour’s drive away – it is inevitable they will spending most of their time in Norfolk. William’s decision to put off full-time royal duties for at least another two and a half years was always going to offer the perfect window to add to his family. Both he and Kate never made a secret of the fact that they wanted more children and his new career choice offers them the chance to bring up them up outside the goldfish bowl of full-time royal life. William is a country boy at heart – his late mother Diana often described her sons as being like ‘caged lions’ in the city. Newly renovated: The royal couple have privately complained of feeling ‘trapped’ in their 22-room home at Kensington Palace in London, which is pictured yesterday after news of the Duchess's pregnancy broke . The prince is believed to want his children to enjoy the same carefree, rural existence he experienced on the Royal Family’s vast estates in Norfolk, Scotland and Gloucestershire. Both he and Kate have also privately complained of feeling ‘trapped’ in their 22-room home at Kensington Palace, which has recently undergone a top-to-toe renovation, funded in part with £4.5million of taxpayers’ money. The duchess, in particular, has come to resent the paparazzi who have taken to hanging around Kensington Gardens and other parks in the hope of photographing her pushing one-year-old George in his buggy. Although the pictures have so far not been used in the UK, there is a lucrative market for them abroad. William’s decision to put off full-time royal duties for at least another two and a half years was always going to offer the perfect window to add to his family. Above, he and Kate are pictured after Prince George's birth . And while their spokesman insists that Kensington Palace will remain the couple’s ‘primary and long-term’ official residence, it is all too clear Anmer Hall, which has its own swimming pool and tennis court, will be considered their home. Living there will allow William, when he is on the day shift, to get home from work in time to help out with his children’s nightly bath – something he has said he enjoys immensely – and be a hands-on father. The property has had trees planted to shield it from public view and will be guarded round the clock by armed police, while an alarm system has been installed.

"Taken from reels of never seen before home movie footage, it offers a rare glimpse of the Queen and her family in relaxed ‘off duty’ mode. From a gangly Prince Philip racing his son, Prince Charles, on a children’s tricycle, to a young Princess Elizabeth dancing a sailor’s reel with her mother, the ageing cine film is a charming record of happy days gone by. Now it is among the highlights of a . new exhibition at Buckingham Palace – Royal Childhood – which opens to . the public tomorrow. Scroll down for video . In one clip of the never before seen royal footage, the Duke of Edinburgh can be seen on a child's tricycle leading Prince Charles around on toy tractor while playing. Prince Philip (centre) and Prince Charles (left) appear to be following Princess Anne (right) as they all play on children's tricycles in the royal grounds . In another clip, Her Majesty The Queen poses for a photograph while a very young Princess Anne appears distracted with the object in her right hand . The footage also reveals a very young Prince Charles, dressed in shorts and a t-shirt, proudly showing sticks to the camera as he plays in front of Buckingham Palace . The treasured family film, much of which was shot by the Queen and Prince Philip themselves and comes from their personal collection, is incredibly touching. Although the Windsors have suffered more than their fair share of family heartache and fractured relationships in recent decades, the footage shows the Queen and her husband were once hands-on parents – as much as their busy official schedule allowed, anyway. A hilarious Prince Philip, wearing a suit and dark sunglasses, can be seen borrowing Princess Anne’s red and white tricycle, in a clip that is believed to date back to 1953. Pedalling furiously along one of the palace terraces, the Queen’s husband is followed in hot pursuit by Prince Charles on a three-wheel tractor given to him by toy manufacturer Tri-ang that was known to the family as ‘Major’. Determined Anne, dressed in a white summer dress, then takes her treasured tricycle back off her father to show off her own skills on the lawn. In the ageing cine film, a young Princess Elizabeth (left) can be seen dancing a sailor¿s reel with her mother (second from left) and a young Princess Margaret (right) The foursome can be seen putting their best foot forward as they dance in pairs for the camera. The clip has been released as part of the Royal Childhood exhibition . A young Princess Margaret and Princess Elizabeth were also filmed dancing together without the adults, in the adorable home footage . A young Princess Elizabeth (facing the camera left) looks happy as she dances arm-in-arm with Princess Margaret (facing the camera right) in the home footage . This is the rocking horse President Obama sent Prince George to mark his birth last year. The hand-made toy sports a presidential seal on its saddle and a polo mallet with a head made from the branch of an oak tree that once stood on the south lawn of the White House. The Obamas also sent the baby prince a blue alpaca wool security blanket. The gifts are on display at the Palace as part of the 'Royal Childhood' exhibit. Other clips show the Queen affectionately offering a toy xylophone to her then toddler son, Charles, and playing peek-a-boo with a handkerchief. She also films a beaming young Princess Anne, sitting on a garden chair, with just two bottom teeth popping through. One piece of footage is particularly poignant and shows the Queen’s adored, but frail, father, King George V1, sitting on a sun lounger and fondly placing his arms around his grandson, Prince Charles’s waist. The future Prince of Wales, dressed in smart red trousers and a matching jumper, leans in affectionately and plays a toy drum hung around the neck. The film was almost certainly shot just months before the King’s death in February 1952. Footage of the Queen from infanthood to new mother herself, also features heavily in the exhibition. As a carefree young girl she can be seen playing on a see-saw with her younger sister, Princess Margaret, throwing her head back in laughter as they go higher and higher, each trying to unseat the other. The two . sisters are also shown singing and dancing, surrounded by the family . corgis, helping their mother to weed in the garden at Windsor and . learning to ride. One . of the most charming segments, however, sees the two princesses, aged . around ten and six, on board a royal yacht, possibly Britannia, showing . off their new-found dancing skills for the camera. They are subsequently joined by their mother – then Queen Elizabeth - and governess, Marion ‘Crawfie’ Crawford. The young Elizabeth affectionately links arms with her smartly dressed ‘mama’ and shows her how to do the reel.

Anna Reynolds, a curator at The Royal Collection Trust, said at a preview of the exhibition yesterday: ‘It’s easy to forget that Buckingham Palace, now one of the most famous buildings in the world, was purchased as a family home [in 1762], and has remained so for over 250 years. ‘This exhibition gives visitors a very personal insight into life as a young member of the royal family over nine generations, through the toys the children have played with and loved, and through the clothes they have worn. ‘The cine footage comes from the Queen’s private collection and brings even more vividly to life the family aspect of a very public home.’ Royal Childhood can be seen as part of the annual Summer Opening of the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace from July 26 to September 28.

"Republicans clashed with the Internal Revenue Service's new commissioner Wednesday in a Capitol Hill hearing that featured the unveiling a document indicating that the agency planned as early as 2012 to change its rules in a way that justified singling out tea party groups for special scrutiny. The document, an email from Treasury Department tax policy attorney Ruth Madrigal to a group of IRS officials including the disgraced Lois Lerner. 'Don’t know who in your organizations is keeping tabs on c4s,' Madrigal wrote, quoting an election law blog and referring to the 501(c)(4) tax-exempt groups that were the subject of the tea party targeting scandal, 'but since we mentioned potentially addressing them (off plan) in 2013, I’ve got my radar up and this seemed interesting.' House Ways and Means Committee chairman Rep. Dave Camp insisted Wednesday that Madrigal's note indicated that new regulations were planned as a 'remedy to the target[ing]' back in 2011 and 2012. 'I’m pretty sure [off-plan] means ""hidden from the public"",' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR THE FULL DOCUMENT . John Koskinen, the new Internal Revenue Service commissioner, fended off tough questions on Wednesday . Tea party groups say the IRS targeted them for their political beliefs but the government agency has been slow to turn over documents showing if the slow-walking of tax-exempt applications was a conscious effort to cripple the organizations . A Treasury Department email unveiled during Wednesday?s hearing shows the IRS considered new rules that would hamper tea party groups a month after the targeting scandal broke . The revelation that the IRS planned two years ago to change the way it approached approving those groups for tax-exempt status is raising eyebrows because it indicates the agency was aware early on that its practice of singling out conservative groups was out of sync with existing regulations. In November the IRS formalized those plans, raising the hackles of Republicans who say officials are trying to codify the tactics that put right-wing groups applying for tax-exempt status in perpetual limbo while liberal groups were quickly approved. The hearing brought out attacks from GOP members of the House Ways and Means committee who grilled newly minted IRS Commissioner John Koskinen over the timeline, saying it proved his agency knew it was acting improperly long before an inspector general report revealed the depth of the tea party targeting program. That report prompted President Obama to ask for the resignation of Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller. Republicans in the House Oversight Committee have uncovered evidence that IRS officials in Washington directed a field office in Cincinnati to put a 'hold' on tea party groups' applications, but the scandal has not reached the level of direct White House involvement. Not amused: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp is demanding documents that will show if the IRS moved to change its rules because officials knew they were unfairly targeting conservative groups . House Ways and Means Oversight subcommittee Chairman Rep. Charles Boustany (L) and ranking member John Lewis sparred Wednesday over the IRS's program that singled out right-wing groups for lengthy scrutiny . Poster child? Then-IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner refused to testify on May 22, 2013 about her part in targeting tea party groups during the 2010 election season . Another subcommittee, in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, will hold a separate hearing on Thursday and has invited Barbara Bosserman, the attorney in charge of the IRS's internal investigation, to testify. She has not said whether she will show up to answer questions. Attempts to contact Bosserman on Wednesday were unsuccessful. She has attracted conservatives' barbs for her political leanings, evidenced by more than $6,000 in contributions to the political campaigns of President Barack Obama and other Democrats. President Obama claimed Sunday in a televised interview with Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly that the IRS wasn't engaged in partisan witch hunts of conservative groups during the 2010 election season, despite statistics that suggest otherwise Lermer's refusal to testify about her actions. 'The president claimed there was not ""even a smidgeon of corruption"" at the IRS,' complained Louisiana Republican Rep. Charles Boustany during the hearing, 'and he blamed the targeting on ""bone-headed decisions"" by ""a local office."" Now, this committee has actually investigated the matter, and found otherwise. The president’s staff is either ill-informed or they are misleading him.' Boustany chairs the subcommittee that held Wednesday's hearing. He and Camp have demanded documents from Koskinen detailing the timeline and process behind the regulatory changes, but the IRS commissioner has pushed back saying that providing the material would 'interfere' with his agency's rulemaking. Not 'a smidgen of corruption': In a pre-Super Bowl interview, President Obama told Fox's Bill O'Reilly that the IRS's hands weer clean -- despite ongoing investigations that still might prove otherwise . Conservatives are still angry about what they say is a White House using the IRS as a political weapon, and point to the Nixon administration for comparison . 'Adding insult to injury ... the IRS continues to withhold documents requested by this committee pursuant to an ongoing investigation,' Boustany saud. 'Commissioner Koskinen, turn over the documents your agency owes us and let’s start this relationship on the right foot.' 'I want to be perfectly clear,' said . Camp. 'This committee will fight any and all efforts to restrict the . rights of groups to organize, speak-out and educate the public, just as . unions are allowed to do so.' 'We . will get to the bottom of this, and I expect the IRS to produce – . quickly – the outstanding documents the committee has requested.' Democrats on the subcommittee mocked Republicans' efforts to press for answers, framing them as a political witch hunt aimed at Obama during a congressional election year that will determine the shape of Washington politics during the president's final two years in office. 'All of these efforts to tie this to the White House have been fallacious,' said Democrat Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan. Koskinen indicated that he wants to put the entire matter in the IRS's rear-view mirror. 'Nobody wants this investigation to be completed sooner than I do,' he said during his testimony, adding later that 'I'd like to close the 501(c)(4) issue.' Tea party groups have complained, however, that investigators – including the politically conflicted Bosserman – have never contacted them about how their tax-exempt applications were delayed for as long as three years while left-leaning groups won near-instant approval.","The IRS was working on a plan to justify targeting some nonprofit groups for special scrutiny as early as 2012, according to a new document .

"A Chinese doctor has admitted to stealing babies from the hospital where she worked and selling them to human traffickers. Zhang Shuxia told parents their newborns had congenital problems and persuaded them to give the babies up, according to court reports. Shuxia, a locally respected and soon-to-retire obstetrician, stood trial on Monday in northern Shaanxi province's Fuping county, according to online postings from the court. Scroll down for video . Trafficking: Zhang Shuxia, who is involved in a baby trafficking scandal, stands trial . Doctor: Zhang was a doctor with the Fuping County Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital . Zhang told parents their newborns had congenital problems and persuaded them to 'sign and give the babies up,' the court postings said. Calls to the Weinan Intermediate People's Court and the local Communist Party propaganda department went unanswered. The case exposed the operations of a baby trafficking ring that operated across several provinces centering on Zhang, who delivered babies at the Fuping County Maternal and Child Hospital. Child trafficking is a big problem in China, despite severe legal punishments that include the death penalty. Families who buy trafficked children are driven partly by the traditional preference for male heirs, a strict one-child policy and ignorance of the law. The indictment said that from November 2011 to July 2013, she sold seven babies to middlemen who sold the babies to 'couples' in central and eastern China. Six of the babies were rescued, but one that was trafficked for 1,000 yuan ($165) in April later died. Zhang was found out when a mother suspected her baby had been abducted and reported her to police in July. The official Xinhua News Agency reported that Zhang had taken the baby home with her and sold him to a man in a neighboring province for 21,600 yuan ($3,600) the same night. Accused: Zhang Shuxia, accused in a baby trafficking scandal is escorted to trial . He in turn resold the baby to a villager in central China for 59,800 yuan ($9,900). Several other suspects have been detained in at least four provinces, Xinhua said. The case has added to public frustration with China's medical profession over rampant bribery and other abuses. The Beijing Times newspaper called for a 'fair punishment' for Zhang to deter other doctors. 'It will inject the authoritativeness of law into professional ethics of doctors and will warn doctors not to take the wrong step that brings them lifelong regret,' the paper said.","Locally respected and soon-to-retire obstetrician Zhang Shuxia on trial .

"The Falklands should belong to Uruguay, the authors of a new book on the disputed islands have sensationally claimed. A forgotten 172-year-old treaty signed between Spain and the south American country gives it sovereignty rights over the British colony, they say. Uruguayan architect Juan Ackermann, one of the two authors of the book, insisted last night: 'Legally, the islands are ours.' Disputed: Now the authors of a new book on the Falkland Islands have made the sensational claim that they actually belong to Uruguay . Co-author Alfredo Villegas, an Argentine engineer, added: 'For me, as an Argentine, it was very difficult to come to terms with this.' The book, whose title translates into English as 'The Falkland Islands. Are They Uruguayan?' argues colonial Spain controlled the region's seas, islands and coastline from naval bases ion Cuba, Peru and the Uruguayan capital Montevideo. Mr Ackermann said: 'No-one remembers an 1841 treaty signed between Spain and Uruguay. 'In that document, Spain cedes it the naval base's powers. History: Steel helmets abandoned by Argentine armed forces who surrendered at Goose Green to British Falklands Task Force troops during the Falklands War . Ours: A British flag is planted at a farm in the Falkland Islands. Residents will vote in a referendum on March 11 about whether they want to remain part of the UK . War of words: President of Argentina, Cristina . Fernandez de Kirchner, pictured left,  accuses Britain of stealing the . Falkland Islands in an open letter addressed to Prime Minister David . Cameron . 'Seventeen years later, Spain does the . same with Argentina, but it couldn't give it something it's already . given to another. That is a very strong argument in favour of Uruguay.' A 1972 international agreement on the . Antartic confirmed Uruguay as the rightful owner of the Falklands . because it was based on the 1841 treaty, Mr Villegas added. The Spanish discovered Uruguay in 1516 but due to fierce resistance from the local Indians and an absence of gold or silver, only a few settlements were established during the 16th and 17th centuries. The capital Montevideo, was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold but soon developed into a thriving commercial hub competing with Buenos Aires. In 1811 a successful revolt against Spanish rule was led by Jose Gervasio Artigas. It was at this point that the then Spanish governor of the Falklands, Pablo Guillen . Martinez, was called back to Montevideo. He left behind a plaque claiming . sovereignty of the islands for Spain. Britain had withdrawn their presence from the Falklands in 1776, leaving Spain in control. In 1821 Uruguay declared independence and sided with Argentina in a war against Brazil. Britain then fostered the 1828 Treaty of Montevideo, which gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state. Historians insist the Falklands had no established Argentine population at the time the British re-took control in 1833. He told an interviewer: 'It was signed first in the Uruguayan senate and then in the Argentine senate.'The basis of that signature is the 1841 treaty. 'When the Argentine legislators signed, they were recognising that agreement.'It's obvious they didn't read what they signed.' One option is to do nothing and let Argentina and Britain carry on their war of words over the islands, the authors argue. But they also claim Uruguay would be within its rights to start negotiations with the UK and Argentine about proposals to divide up the disputed territory. International analyst Juan Luis Gonzalez-Perez described the book today as a 'historical curiosity' but quashed the idea Uruguay had any sovereignty claim over the Falklands. He insisted: 'Uruguay has never shown any type of interest in that area and it would be a triviality for it to now make any sovereignty claim. 'The United Nations recognise that the only two countries who lay claim to sovereignty are the United Kingdom and Argentina.' Argentine president Christina Kirchner upped the ante recently over the Falklands. She wrote an open letter earlier this month to David Cameron accusing Britain of stripping the Falklands from Argentina in an aggressive act of colonialism 180 years ago. The Sun newspaper wrote a reply to Mrs Kirchner, published in Argentine newspapers, pointing out British sovereignty over the Falklands dates back to 1765. The islanders are due to vote on sovereignty in a referendum on March 10 and 11. They are expected to send a firm message to Argentina they wanted to remain British.","172-year-old treaty .

"Man is missing his best friend. A Missouri army specialist suffering spinal and brain injuries as well as PTSD claims the army has 'stolen' the the combat dog he wants to adopt that  served as his only companion during months of deployment. 'They're not dog and handler, they're brothers,' Don Grommet, the soldier's father, told ABC news. More than a year ago, Brent Grommet, 23, assigned to the 101st Airborne Division out of Fort Campbell, Kentucky, returned from Afghanistan with his military combat dog, a German Shepherd named Matty. Scroll down for video . Companion: Missouri army specialist Brent Grommet, 23, who is suffering spinal and brain injuries as well as PTSD is desperately trying to adopt the combat dog that served as his only companion during months of deployment . Grommet and Matty had gone through basic training together, been deployed together, and were both injured together in two separate IED (improvised explosive device) attacks, according to Fox 8. Procedure: Grommet followed the procedures necessary to adopt the dog but Matty was given to someone else . Upon returning to the United States, standard operating procedure forced the two to be separated. With Grommet having already filled out the paperwork to adopt Matty, the separation would not last long -- or so he thought. Months passed with Grommet making multiple calls inquiring about the adoption status to no avail, according to Fox 8. The New York Post reports that the Grommets had been given little to no information about Matty and his adoption status and many military officials were flippant, with one even saying not to contact him again. In March, nearly a year after the pair returned from Afghanistan, Grommet said he received a call informing him that Matty had been adopted. The Grommet family told Fox 8 that a military contact tracked Matty to a man in the Fort Bragg area who said he had grown attached to Matty and wouldn't give him up to Grommet. The family told Fox 8 that they were desperately trying to find Matty's exact location hoping who ever had Matty would sell him or give him back to Brent. But military officials gave the family no information on who the man is or where exactly Matty is. Together: Grommet and Matty had gone through basic training together, been deployed together, and were both injured together in two separate IED (improvised explosive device) attacks . A Facebook post from the ABC 11 news page indicates that the American Humane Association is offering a minimum of $5,000 and a new war dog to Matty's owner. That was nearly three months ago. 'It’s hard, it really is,' Grommet told the Post. 'If I just wanted a dog, I could get a dog. I don’t want a dog. I want my dog.' Grommet told KTVI  that he's getting the 'run around' from military officials and has been filing Freedom of Information requests. But if and when he does get Matty, the dog will have a room of his own filled with tennis balls. KTVI reports that a spokesperson for Senator Claire McCaskill said her office has been working on Grommet's case for several weeks and hopes to have new information for the family soon. Run around: Grommet said he has been getting the run around from military officials, but if and when he does get Matty, the dog will have a room of his own filled with tennis balls .

"Australian airline passengers who are considering buying a controversial gadget that stops the seat in front of them from reclining will be wasting their money. Australia's largest airline companies, Qantas, Virgin and Jetstar, have confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the Knee Defender gadget is banned on their flights. The airlines say the American legroom gizmo breaches the same rules that stop people taking drugs and smoking on planes. There has been a surge in global sales for the Knee Defender after a fight between two passengers broke out on a United Airlines jet on August 24. Scroll down for video . Locked and loaded: Most airlines prohibit the use the of the Knee Defender, the male passenger allegedly used one so he could continue working on his laptop . The plane was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Chicago after a woman on the flight threw water at a man seated behind her who used the $21.95 ($A23.57) device to stop her reclining her seat on the four-hour flight from Newark to Denver. The Knee Defender's website crashed on Tuesday after travellers flocked to get their hands on the gizmo. Sales for the plastic clips also saw a substantial boost, inventor Ira Goldman told the Sydney Morning Herald. Goldman, an 170 cm-tall American man, designed the U-shaped device that fits over the arms of the seat-back tray table in 2003. 'Qantas would not permit attachments such as the Knee Defender to aircraft seats, and in any event such attachments would need to undergo stringent reviews to ensure they comply with Australian safety regulations in the first instance before being considered,' a Qantas spokesperson said. Australia's largest airline companies, Qantas and Virgin, have confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the Knee Defender gadget is banned on their flights . 'We find that our passengers tend to be courteous to those around them, and are mindful of the times during which it might be less convenient to recline their seats inflight such as during meal times,' they added. Virgin Australia said: 'The use of knee defenders or similar device would be in breach of our conditions of carriage. 'The safety and comfort of our guests remains our highest priority.' The conditions of carriage include: 'You must not behave in a manner which would be considered by a reasonable person to be offensive, or in a manner which might cause discomfort, distress, offence or injury to another person,' and you must not 'disobey the directions of the flight crew'. They also explain that you are not allowed to 'tamper, interfere with or damage any part of the aircraft' or 'do anything which may endanger the safety of the aircraft on which you are travelling, or the safety of our flight crew or your fellow passengers'. A spokesperson for Jetstar said: 'We've seen no evidence to suggest the use of knee defenders is a common or frequent occurrence on our services.' 'From an onboard policy perspective, we’d consider the attachment of the devices an aircraft modification and as such wouldn't permit their use in-flight. 'All modifications to our aircraft must be undertaken by trained and approved engineers to ensure they comply with Australian safety regulations,' they added. During the on board fight on Sunday in America, the pilot made an emergency landing and the two passengers, both 48, were arrested. The Federal Aviation Administration in America leaves it up to individual airlines to set rules about the controversial devices. [caption] . Tiny: The Knee Defender, which is about the size of a house key, retails for about $19.95, but is banned by all major American airlines . But United Airlines said it prohibits use of the device, like all major U.S. airlines. Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air take the reclining mechanisms out of their seats, leaving them permanently upright. Chicago Police and TSA officers met the flight, spoke to the passengers and 'deemed it a customer service issue', Transportation Security Administration spokesman Ross Feinstein said. The TSA would not name the passengers. The plane then continued to Denver without them, arriving 1 hour and 38 minutes late, according to the airline's website. The Federal Aviation Administration can impose a civil fine of up to $25,000 for passengers who are unruly. In this case, no arrest was made, according to airport spokesman Gregg Cunningham. The fight started when the male passenger, seated in a middle seat of row 12, used the Knee Defender to stop the woman in front of him from reclining while he was on his laptop, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak. Emergency landing: United Flight 1462 from Newark, New Jersey to Denver had to make an emergency landing in Chicago, causing the flight to be one hour and 38 minutes late to its final destination . A flight attendant asked him to remove the device and he refused. The woman then stood up, turned around and threw a cup of water at him, the official says. That's when United decided to land in Chicago. Both passengers were sitting in United's Economy Plus section, the part of the plane that has four more inches of legroom than the rest of coach.","Surge in sales comes after an incident occurred Sunday on United Airlines Flight 1462 from Newark to Denver in America .

"There are some results that you look at on paper and they are decent enough. A draw at Manchester City, a point at Manchester United and a 1-1 at Southampton, given their fine run under Ronald Koeman, are decent returns for a club with Chelsea’s ambitions. Defeat at White Hart Lane, when they were fully aware Manchester City had just beaten Sunderland at the Etihad, is not. This, it has to be said, was an absolute mauling. Jose Mourinho fumes as his Chelsea side slip to a 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year's Day . Tottenham’s bracing victory here will be remembered as the day the Barclays Premier League title swung back in favour of the defending champions. The quicker we cut to the chase of January 31, when Chelsea play Manuel Pellegrini’s team at Stamford Bridge, the better. Here at White Hart Lane we were supposed to witness the great recovery, the Chelsea backlash after the perceived injustice at St Mary’s last Sunday. Instead they are searching for answers to their increasingly perplexing form on the road after this defeat against Mauricio Pochettino’s improving Spurs side. This dodgy little run of Chelsea’s began on November 29 when they drew at Sunderland and were then beaten at Newcastle on December 6. John Terry looks dejected after Chelsea concede their fourth goal at White Hart Lane . Here at White Hart Lane, just moments after Andros Townsend’s penalty had rippled the back of Thibaut Courtois’ net, Jose Mourinho was heading for the tunnel. It is usually in these situations when he takes a moment to himself, deconstructing his team’s performance before the grand, half-time speech to the players in the dressing room. He was entitled to be upset here, frustrated that his team allowed a one goal advantage to slide to such an extent that they were out of this game by half-time. By the 52nd minute, when Harry Kane scored his second of the game, it was all over. So what has happened to them? At Stoke on December 22 they scored early as well, earning three points after John Terry put them in front and Cesc Fabregas added the second. At the time their spirit looked unbreakable. It was a different story at Southampton, where Mourinho showed his ruthless streak by taking off Andre Schurrle at half-time as punishment for a poor performance. Mourinho embraces his opposite number Maurcio Pochettino before the end of the match . At White Hart Lane there was no sign of the German World Cup winner, not even making the bench after that 1-1 draw at St Mary’s. This time it was Oscar who made way, dragged off at the break and replaced by the muscular presence of Ramires. It made no difference. Despite Mourinho’s brilliance as a coach, he always has the potential to combust. The manner and the execution of the criticism levelled at referee Anthony Taylor was unnecessary, even if he failed to award Cesc Fabregas a 55th minute penalty. Although Mourinho had a point, it has distracted this Chelsea team from the main event. He lost it again here, repeatedly saying cursing at fourth official Andre Marriner when he felt decisions were going against this Chelsea team. Terry, Cesc Fabregas (right) and Nemanja Matic all vie for the same ball with no Spurs players in sight . Referee Phil Dowd had it in the neck too, berated form the sidelines as Mourinho grew increasingly animated in the technical area. Chelsea’s manager has to sort this out because he, just like his defence, is in danger of losing his cool. John Terry, who has been so reliable this season, and Gary Cahill are suddenly creaking as a central defensive partnership. Terry’s unusual mistake at Southampton, which led to the opening goal from Sadio Mane. This was another chasing. Harry Kane was magnificent, scoring twice and winning the penalty that put Tottenham 3-1 in the clear by half time. When the young England forward hit the target in the 52nd minute, you just knew it was going to be Tottenham’s day.","Tottenham beat Chelsea 5-3 at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day .

"Hannah Defoe, 20, died in the swimming pool of a St Lucia hotel in July 2012 . An England footballer’s cousin who was electrocuted in a Caribbean hotel swimming pool died as a result of manslaughter, an inquest has concluded. Hannah Defoe, 20, was staying at Juliette’s Lodge hotel, St Lucia, in July 2012 when the tragedy happened. Miss Defoe, a cousin of former Tottenham Hotspur striker Jermain Defoe, who now plays for Toronto FC in Canada, had dived into the pool - but then suddenly called out and disappeared beneath the water. The inquest in St Lucia heard that it was not known how the water had become live but nobody was able to enter the pool to save Miss Defoe without being electrocuted themselves. Giving evidence to the inquest via video link in November, her aunt Janet Defoe, who was on holiday with her niece at the time, told the inquest jury that Hannah had been swimming in the pool when suddenly she called and sank beneath the water. She told of repeated attempts to rescue her niece from the pool – but the water was inexplicably live and no one was able to enter it to save her without themselves suffering electric shocks. Reading from her witness statement she told the jury and Magistrate Robert Innocent: ‘I ran to the pool and when I got there I saw Hannah’s body stretched out at the bottom of the pool. I jumped into the pool to rescue her. ‘As soon as I jumped in I felt a fuzzy feeling over my whole body.’ The inquest in Vieux Fort, St. Lucia started in February 2014 and has taken almost a year to hear evidence from all parties concerned with the tragedy. The jury returned a verdict of manslaughter. It is not yet known whether proceedings will now take place against the resort. A British inquest into Miss Defoe’s death has been repeatedly postponed while the authorities waited for the St Lucian inquest to conclude - and can now resume. Jermaine Defoe, who played for Tottenham Hotspur FC at the time, returned from team's pre-season tour of America following his cousin's death . It is not known what caused the water in the pool at Juliette's Lodge in Vieux Fort (above) to be live . Miss Defoe was staying at the hotel in St Lucia (above) with her family at the time of her death . The 20-year-old's parents, Matthew and Hope Defoe (right), said they were encouraged by the verdict . Hope Defoe, Hannah’s mother, said: ‘We are very encouraged by this verdict as we were beginning to feel that it was all a charade. ‘We are very hopeful that criminal proceedings will follow but have been warned that this could take years.’ Miss Defoe’s family want key reports and witness statements to be considered by the UK inquest, which are believed to contain criticisms of electrical installations and safety checks. An preliminary inquest hearing in the UK was told that the water in the pool registered 180 volts when tested the day after the incident. Miss Defoe, who was a performing arts student at the Performers College, Essex, died three weeks before her 21st birthday. She was on holiday with her family as a reward for her hard work in the first year of her course.","Hannah Defoe died after jumping into swimming pool at St Lucia hotel .

"The fugitive ‘white widow’ of a 7/7 London bomber was a key link between Al Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan and their fighters in East Africa, it has emerged. Muslim convert Samantha Lewthwaite, who was married to Kings Cross bomber Germaine Lindsay, spent two years working for the deadly extremist organisation in South Africa using a false name. Investigators in Britain and Kenya have now established that the Home Counties mother-of-four has been working with a key British-born bomb maker who had trained with Al Qaeda in Pakistan. Grenade attacks: Samantha Lewthwaite is still on the run while working to help finance militant group, Al Shabaab . Lewthwaite’s role was to channel money raised in the UK and elsewhere to terror cells in Somalia. A security source said: ‘We are now clearer about the role Lewthwaite has been playing for Al Qaeda and her links with this bomb maker. ‘She seems to have spent two years building up a network that spans the UK, South Africa, Pakistan and Somalia.’ Lewthwaite, 29, a soldier’s daughter from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, has been on the run in East Africa after police foiled a Christmas bomb plot against Western tourist targets in the Indian Ocean coastal resort of Mombasa in 2011. Police now believe she has been working with experienced Al Qaeda bomb maker Habib Ghani. Sources said Ghani, from Hounslow, West London, gained bomb-making experience in Pakistan. He is understood to have a Pakistani father and a Kenyan mother and left Britain several years ago. Hiding: The Serena Beach Resort in Mombasa where Samantha Lewthwaite is believed to have previously rented an apartment . Lewthwaite fled with her young children and was initially thought to have crossed the border into lawless Somalia where she was being sheltered by Al Qaeda affiliate Al Shabaab. However, there have been recent reports she may have returned to Mombasa. A Kenyan police source said: ‘We believe she is back in Mombasa but because she wears a full Muslim veil, she is difficult to spot. We have identified her as a blue-eyed woman in a hijab and believe she is active on Twitter and still working as a fundraiser for Al Shabaab.’ In December 2011, she was arrested and let go in mysterious circumstances after Kenyan police picked up her British accomplice Jermaine Grant close to a make-shift bomb factory. Grant, 30, from Brixton, south London, and Lewthwaite were both charged with possessing bomb-making materials and of planning to cause loss of ‘innocent civilian lives’. Caught: British-born Jermaine Grant, 30, in cuffs and flanked by guards as he is held on terror charges in Mombasa, Kenya . He will briefly appear in court on Mombasa on Wednesday. Last month, Scotland Yard anti-terror officers were due to fly to Kenya to give evidence in Grant’s trial. But police received a tip-off that Lewthwaite and other Al Shabaab terrorists were planning to attack the court and free him, so his trial will now take place in a high-security court inside a prison. Lewthwaite, who also uses the Muslim name Sherafiyah, converted to Islam at the age of 17 and married Lindsay in 2002 after meeting him on the internet. She was seven months’ pregnant when Lindsay, a Jamaican convert from Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, killed 26 people when he blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train in July 2005. Bombers: Germaine Lindsay, Samantha's ex-husband, pictured centre before he blew himself up on a Piccadilly Line train in July 2005 . Devastation: The Piccadilly Line train after Germaine Lindsay detonated the bomb between King's Cross and Russell Square tube stations . British security services have so far failed to explain how she slipped off the radar, travelled to East Africa on a stolen passport, and became, as police believe, an integral member of Al Shabaab. Since her disappearance, Lewthwaite has been linked to a spate of grenade attacks in Mombasa, including one on a packed pub last year which killed three people, including a nine-year-old boy. There are also reports she is using Twitter to bolster support for an all-female suicide squad in East Africa. She is known as ‘dada mzungu’ – Swahili for white sister – and is described as serving ‘Allah as his female soldier’ and who ‘commands her all-female mujahid terror squad and conducts operations against the kuffar [non-Muslims]’. Grant is also facing charges for trying to sneak into Somalia disguised as a Muslim woman in 2008.","Mother-of-four from Buckinghamshire converted to Islam at 17-years-old .
