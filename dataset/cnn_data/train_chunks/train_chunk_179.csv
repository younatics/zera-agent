"(CNN) -- Gunmen in Mexico opened fire on police and civilians Wednesday in two separate incidents, in which at least 13 people died, according to a government statement. One incident was gang related. Federal Police officers aboard a helicopter spotted a suspicious convoy in the state of Michoacan. The occupants fired at them, the National Safety Commission said. The officers returned fire, killing five people, including an organized crime leader. Police seized the gunmen's vehicles and found five assault rifles with magazines and other combat paraphernalia, the National Safety Commission said. Mexico has a reputation for strict gun ownership laws. Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing . In the town of Apatzingan, gunmen opened fire twice on residents who were commemorating the anniversary of the death of a revolutionary figure popular in the region. Federal Police returned fire and ""shot down"" one gunman, who was armed with a .50-caliber rifle, an AK-47 assault rifle and two pistols. It is not clear if the man died from his wounds. Eight died when the same group, marching in a ceremonial parade, came under fire again. In addition, six civilians and two police officers were wounded. Mexico's Federal Police are made up of multiple divisions, the largest of which is part of the military.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Authorities have completed an autopsy of Ram Singh, one of the men accused of gang raping and fatally beating a woman on a New Delhi bus. Police have said Singh hanged himself in jail cell in Tihar Prison on Monday. His lawyer and parents claim he was murdered. It is unclear when the results of the autopsy will be released. ""Ram Singh did not kill himself. He was murdered,"" Singh's father, Mangi Lai, told CNN affiliate CNN-IBN on Monday. Singh's death in custody sparked harsh criticism of India's prison system. ""If prisons are to be considered rational institutions, rather than horrible holding pens, then prisoners' rights should be of utmost importance, and their protection the state's strongly held commitment,"" wrote The Indian Express newspaper in an editorial Tuesday. According to the country's National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), India had 1,382 jails in 2011 with a total capacity to hold 332,782 inmates. However, the occupancy rate in those jails was around 112% that year, data posted on the bureau website show. Last year, Tihar Prison recorded 18 deaths, including two suicides, according to CNN-IBN. Authorities say Singh was the driver of the bus aboard which several men brutally raped a 23-year-old woman on December 16. The gang rape, and the woman's subsequent death from injuries, prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks. Police charged Singh and four other men with murder, rape and kidnapping. Their trial began in February. If convicted, the men could face the death penalty. A sixth suspect is 17 and will be tried separately in juvenile court. The December rape gripped India and led to calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women. Many Indian women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations.","NEW: The death sparks harsh criticism of India's prison system .

"(CNN) -- What was arguably the most anticipated video game of 2012 just became one of the most anticipated games for 2013. Irrational Games and Take Two announced Wednesday that ""BioShock Infinite"" will be delayed four months to allow developers more time to make tweaks to the game. The third installment in a popular horror series, set in a dystopian undersea universe, will now be released on February 23, 2013, instead of this coming October as previously scheduled. Creative director Ken Levine made the announcement on Irrational's website: . ""When we announced the release date of BioShock Infinite in March, we felt pretty good about the timing,"" he wrote. ""Since then, we've come to realize that some specific tweaks and improvements will make Infinite into something even more extraordinary. Therefore, to give our talented team the time they need, we've decided to move the game's release to February 26, 2013. We wanted to let our loyal (and very patient!) fans know this as soon as possible. ""I won't kid you: BioShock Infinite is a very big game, and we're doing things that no one has ever done in a first-person shooter,"" he added. ""What does this mean for you? It means a bit more waiting, but more importantly, it means an even better BioShock Infinite."" Levine said developers will hold off on showing ""BioShock Infinite"" this summer at such gaming events as E3 and Gamescom. ""That way, the next time you see our game, it will be essentially the product we intend to put in the box,"" he said. ""Preparing for these events takes time away from development, time we're going to use instead to get the best version of Infinite into your hands in February."" Fans have been waiting for the next creation in the ""BioShock"" universe since ""BioShock 2"" was released in 2010. The new title will take players beyond the underwater realm of the first two games and put them in Columbia, a futuristic city in the sky, during a time of anarchy and strife. In an interview with CNN last December, Levine described how excited he was to work on this new setting. ""In all these stories, you have these incredible themes. One of great optimism and excitement for the future and one of this ominous feeling at the same time,"" he said. ""This yin and this yang that was present in all of this research really made me excited to work on this game."" Response from fans on Internet message boards Wednesday was generally positive, with many saying they are willing to wait longer for the game if it lives up to expectations.","""BioShock Infinite"" will now be released on February 23, 2013, instead of this coming October .

"(CNN) -- A joint drug investigation in Hong Kong hauled a record cocaine shipment worth an estimated street value of U.S. $98 million, customs officials said. The Customs Drug Investigation Bureau of Hong Kong seized 649 kilograms (about 1,425 pounds) of cocaine from a shipping container that arrived from Ecuador, Lee Cheung-wing, the head of the Custom Drug Investigation Bureau, said in a statement released Friday. Three people, described by Lee, as ""local men"" were arrested in connection with the seizure, which occurred Wednesday and was made public Friday. The drug operation began in April when the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration began tipping Hong Kong authorities to the arrival of containers from South America, Lee said. The tips that continued through June came as a result of a joint drug investigation, codenamed ""Surfing Coke,"" that saw Hong Kong customs authorities partner with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to combat drug trafficking, Lee said. Neither the DEA nor Customs and Border Protection released details on the drug operation, and their respective Washington offices did not immediately respond to request for comment early Saturday. Hong Kong customs officials visited three South American countries where they met with their respective counterparts during the investigation, trips that were aimed at ""enhancing the mutual anti-narcotics cooperation and intelligence exchange,"" Lee said. The cocaine was in a shipment that arrived this week in Hong Kong from Guayaquil, Ecuador, according to Lee. ""Customs officials found inside the container 22 nylon bags containing a total of 541 slabs of cocaine,"" he said. ""In the afternoon on the same day, a container truck took the container and delivered it to a designated location for collection by two other men."" The 52-year-old driver and two other men, ages 34 and 37, face charges of drug trafficking. The three men were scheduled to appear in court to answer the charges on Sunday, Lee said.","Hong Kong authorities seize 649 kilograms of cocaine, an official says .

"(CNN) -- Sunday morning we awoke to breaking news of another tragic nightclub fire, this time in Brazil. At last report the death toll exceeded 230. This tragedy is not without precedent. Next month will mark the 10th anniversary of a similar nightclub fire in Rhode Island. At this sad time, it's appropriate to reflect on what we've learned from club fires -- and what we haven't. Rhode Island's Station nightclub fire of 2003, in which 100 concertgoers lost their lives, began when fireworks set off by Great White, an 80s heavy metal band, ignited flammable packing foam on the club's walls. Deadly blazes: Nightclub tragedies in recent history . Panicked patrons stampeded toward the club's main exit, and a fatal pileup ensued. Contributing to the tragedy were illegal use of pyrotechnics, overcrowding and a wall covering that would have failed even the most rudimentary flammability tests. Video images of the Station fire were broadcast worldwide: A concert begins; the crowd's mood changes from merry, to curious, to concerned, to horrified -- in less than a minute. You'd think the world would have learned from it. You would be wrong. The following year, the Republica Cromanon nightclub in Argentina went up in flames, killing 194 people. The club was made to hold about 1,000 people, but it was estimated that more than 3,000 fans were packed inside the night of the fire, which began when fans began lighting flares that caught the roof on fire. Echoes of the past: Rhode Island victims 'can't help but watch' Then, in January 2009, at least 64 New Year's revelers lost their lives in a nightclub in Bangkok, Thailand, after fire ignited its ceiling. Many were crushed in a rush to get out of the club. In December of that same year, a fire in a Russian nightclub, ignited by pyrotechnics, killed 156 people. Overcrowding, poor exits, and indoor fireworks all played roles in these tragedies; yet no one bothered to learn from mistakes of the past. While responsibility for concert disasters unquestionably lies with venue operators, performers and promoters, ultimately, we, as patrons of clubs and concerts, can enhance our own safety by taking a few simple steps. The National Fire Protection Association urges concertgoers to: . • Be observant. Is the concert venue rundown or well-maintained? Does the staff look well-trained? • As you proceed to your seat, observe how long the process takes. Could you reverse it in a hurry? Do you pass through pinch points? Is furniture in the way? • Once seated, take note of the nearest exit. (In an emergency, most people try to exit by the door they entered, which is usually not the closest, and is always overcrowded.) Then, share the location of that nearest exit with your entire party. Agree that at the first sign of trouble, you will all proceed to it without delay. • Once the show begins, remain vigilant. If you think there's a problem, LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. Do not stay to ""get your money's worth"" despite concerns about safety. Do not remain to locate that jacket or bag you placed somewhere. No concert is worth your life. Better to read about an incident the next day than be counted as one of its statistics. Read more: How to protect yourself in a crowd . To be sure, all fire codes must be vigorously enforced, and club and concert hall operators must be held to the highest standards. A first step is banning indoor pyrotechnics in all but the largest, stadium-type venues. But, ultimately, we are our own best ""fire marshals"" when it comes to avoiding, and escaping, dangerous situations. We can still enjoy shows. But it is up to us to look out for our own safety. In coming days, Rhode Islanders will follow the unfolding news from Brazil with a sense of queasy deja vu -- the rising body counts, the victim identification process, the grieving families, and the assigning (and dodging) of blame. If only they had learned from our tragedy. Eerie sounds of cell phones amid disaster adds to first-responder toll . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Barylick.","Pyrotechnics, overcrowding, poor exits have contributed to tragic fires in recent years .
You would think the world would have learned from past incidents, John Barylick says .
Concertgoers have to be their own fire marshals, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Australian police have seized as much as $246 million worth of drugs stashed inside a steamroller sent from China after busting an international smuggling ring in Sydney. A U.S. citizen, 33, and a Canadian, 34, have been charged with drug-importing offenses in relation to the confiscated methamphetamine and cocaine, Australian Federal Police said Wednesday. The charges carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The operation to seize the drugs resulted from a ""complex and protracted"" investigation over the past two and half years, police said. The steamroller was shipped in from China, police said, and was tracked down at a storage unit in northern Sydney amid a series of searches. When officers searched the unit, they found the vehicle, dismantling equipment and 13 sports bags containing ""blocks of compressed powder and a crystalline substance."" The blocks consisted of 235 kilograms (520 pounds) of methamphetamine, with an estimated street value of up to 174 million Australian dollars ($180.2 million), and 115 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated street value of up to 63 million Australian dollars ($65.3 million), police said. The Australian Federal Police cited experts as saying that data shows rising use of both drugs in the country. The seizure comes less than a week after authorities in the Pacific island nation of Tonga found cocaine with a potential street value of as much as 116 Australian dollars ($120 million) in a yacht that had run aground off one of the country's northern islands. That discovery was the result of cooperation between Australian, U.S. and Tongan authorities, Australian police said.","The drugs are blocks of methamphetamine and cocaine, police say .

"(CNN) -- ""BioShock: Infinite"" is one of the most talked about games in 2011 and highly anticipated games for 2012. With a combination of fantastic art direction, immersive gameplay and deep storyline, the third installment in the franchise has attracted attention from gamers and nongamers alike. The series is the brainchild of creator and game designer Ken Levine. Levine, 45, has been working in the gaming industry since 1995 and had early success with ""System Shock 2"" and ""Thief."" But it's his more recent work in the creation and development of ""BioShock"" and ""BioShock 2"" that has garnered the most attention. In an interview for CNN.com, Levine talked about where he gets his inspiration for his games, growing up nerdy and being a self-proclaimed ""media whore."" Inspiration for games . Levine didn't start his career in gaming. During his college days, he turned his creative talents to writing plays. While working on his craft and worrying about his post-college years, Levine sought out the advice of playwright Jon Robin Baitz. Baitz, Levine said, taught him about the business side of writing and dealing with agents. So when an agent asked to turn a play Levine had written into a screenplay, he had his opening into the movie industry. But Levine ended up only selling one screenplay to Paramount and didn't like what he learned about having to write commercially, instead of strictly creatively, and how tough it was to be one of the legions of screenwriters in Hollywood. He began to ""tool around doing different things"" for the next seven years and was struggling to figure out what he was going to do. Eventually, his attention turned to something he loved doing as a child: playing games. ""All of a sudden it occurred to me that there are actually people who make these,"" Levine said. ""Could I become one of these people? I started looking at gaming magazines for ads from the game industry and I just tuned into (the job) 'game designer' primarily because I knew I couldn't draw, I couldn't program ... so what was I going to do?"" Levine was hired by Looking Glass Studios and was ready to unleash his creative talents in the gaming world. He was particularly focused on creating unique and interesting worlds and allowing players to move freely through them (a unique concept at the time). He worked on the writing and design of 1998's ""Thief: The Dark Project."" ""I'm not certain how the writing fell on me, but it did. They knew I could write and it sort of fell to me,"" Levine said. ""I was able to bring an understanding of artistry and structure from when I was writing plays and in movies."" ""Thief"" was Looking Glass' most successful title in sales and critical acclaim. But Levine was looking for a new challenge and joined two others in forming Irrational Games in 1997. He jumped at the opportunity to work on ""System Shock 2"" as game designer after playing (and enjoying) ""System Shock."" ""I felt it was a real step forward in launching the gamer into a real environment that felt true,"" he said. ""I also loved the feel of the characters -- that they felt like they were written in a naturalistic style. ""They were just people and you found all these diaries of the people. It played out like some sort of novel. It has a natural, believable feel to it."" It was during this time that Levine began to hone his skills for telling a creative and interesting story while still making it interactive for the player. ""How do you get to those levels of interaction so they feel natural and exciting? And anticipate what the player is going to do -- that's always a challenge,"" he said. ""System Shock 2"" wasn't a commercial success, but it drew attention from critics for its forward-looking approach to how games should be played. Levine and his team began to build a culture of intellectual curiosity at their studio as a way of inspiring ideas and concepts for their games. In 2002, that free flow of ideas gave rise to the ""BioShock"" franchise. Levine said ""BioShock"" and ""BioShock 2"" are noted for their incorporation of historical philosophy and architecture movements -- inspired, he says, by a ""nerdity that is pretty far-reaching and broad at the company."" ""We'll start up these conversations about the World's Fair or conversations about politics or about American history or conversations about social movements. And because we are a bunch of industry and culture and social movement nerds in the company, we are fascinated by all these activities,"" he said. ""We nerd out on a very broad range of things and we bring those things to our games."" For ""BioShock: Infinite,"" Levine said, he tried to form a complete social perspective on the period in which the game takes place. A Public Broadcasting System documentary called ""America 1900"" served as the launching point for the upcoming game's themes of optimism and anarchy. The game is set in the United States in 1912, a time between the Civil War and World War I. It was also a time of great technological leaps that Levine said gave people an incredible sense of optimism. ""You have, in the last 30 years of our lives, one major piece of technology and that's been the Internet. If you go back to 1912, they had, like, 10 different things on the scale of the Internet,"" Levine said. ""They had electricity, cars, movies, records, airplanes, radio in a period of about 10 or 20 years. Their heads must have been absolutely spinning."" It was also a time of great upheaval. An anarchist shot and killed President William McKinley in 1901 and an anarchist would assassinate Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914. A book entitled ""The Devil in the White City"" detailed America's first documented serial killer who stalked the 1912 World's Fair in Chicago and caught Levine's attention. ""In all these stories, you have these incredible themes. One of great optimism and excitement for the future and one of this ominous feeling at the same time,"" Levine said. ""This yin and this yang that was present in all of this research really made me excited to work on this game."" Growing up a nerd . Levine said he was a nerd when he was growing up -- and that it wasn't the badge of honor that it can sometimes be today. He said he played ""Dungeons & Dragons"" by himself in his family's basement. He played war games from Avalon Hill, like ""Luftwaffe"" and ""Panzer Blitz."" His first console was an Atari 2600 that he got on his birthday and was ""one of the best moments of my life."" But he acknowledges that it was a lonely time. ""By the definitions of the time, I was a nerd.,"" he said. ""I couldn't help what I was. I couldn't pretend to like things I didn't like. I hated it to some degree, because I was made fun of for it. Now that I'm grown up, I'm not made fun of for it and it is sort of celebrated."" Now, he points to events like the PAX convention, hosted by Penny Arcade, as a celebration of being a nerd. And people openly proclaiming to be a geek or a nerd is more evidence of the changing culture. ""I'm very happy that kids growing up now, it is very much more accepted,"" Levine said. ""(They) will not be made fun of because of what I went through as a kid. I'm very happy about that."" ""Media whore"" When diving into a project like ""BioShock: Infinite,"" Levine dives head first: researching everything he can about the time, the culture, the technology and the conflicts of his setting. He said he gets deeply invested in the concepts because he wants to be able to weave as complete a story as possible. Levine said he constantly reads and, with his Kindle, he can read wherever he is. He is a self-proclaimed history nerd and, while he doesn't read a lot of science fiction, was originally inspired by a book called ""Red Mars,"" which he said revealed quite a bit about unintended consequences to him, a running theme in the BioShock franchise. ""They were all excited about the colony on Mars because they thought they would leave all the problems of Earth behind -- racism, war, all that. What they forget is that on Mars they bring the problems with them because they bring the people with them,"" he said. ""Things don't always happen the way they are created to, whether it is Ryan in 'BioShock' or Comstock in 'BioShock: Infinite.' "" He also consumes other types of media voraciously and views it as part of his job because he needs to know what's going on. ""I'm watching and re-watching 'Mad Men.' I'm watching and re-watching 'Breaking Bad.' I read comic books. I play video games. I'm a huge media whore."" He said his appetite for media feeds his creativity for his projects. The more he reads and watches, the greater detail he can put in his games. Critics and players consistently point to the attention to the littlest details in the ""BioShock"" series as one of the standout elements in the franchise. Levine wants the players to feel as he would want to feel in the game's time period, like they belong. ""I want to feel like if I went back in time and I was there that I wouldn't be that confused or surprised by what I saw. That would be my goal.""","Ken Levine is the creator of one of this year's most talked about games, ""BioShock: Infinite""

"(CNN) -- Kristina Heeger was wounded in her French class nearly two years ago when a gunman killed 30 of her classmates and instructors at Virginia Tech's Norris Hall. Students walk through a passageway connecting Norris Hall to another building at Virginia Tech. Still coping with memories of the massacre, she returned to the historic stone building Friday as the university reopened the wing of the academic building where the deadliest mass shooting in recent U.S. history occurred. ""It's still something I deal with every day,"" Heeger told reporters during a tour of the newly refurbished west wing of Norris Hall's second floor, where visitors took in the gleaming, contemporary space. ""We're still grieving, we're still mourning,"" she said. ""But we are coming together in a very strong, powerful way. We are coming together to move forward.""

"(CNN) -- A packed passenger bus tumbled into a river near the Peruvian city of Trujillo early Saturday, killing at least 33 people, state media reported, citing regional authorities. The bus was carrying 43 seated passengers, but there were many others standing in the aisle, leading authorities to believe the death toll might rise, according to ANDINA, the state-run news agency. Among the dead were many doctors and nurses, the agency reported. Photos from the scene showed the mangled wreckage of the red bus in the middle of small rapids on the rocky Moche River, flanked on either side by steep green slopes. The bus was heading from Huamacho to Trujillo when it went off the road and into the river, local police told ANDINA.

"(CNN) -- The dead can't speak. Their cell phones do. And, for police, firefighters and paramedics, the incessant chirping, bleating and incongruously cheerful boom box beats of victims' cell phones comprise a soundtrack of disaster. It happened at the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007, a commuter train crash in Los Angeles the next year, the movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado, last July and, again, at the night club fire in Brazil that killed 231 people on Sunday. The incessantly ringing phones, and the realization that someone is desperately trying to reach someone else who is now dead, short-circuits the psychological defenses first responders need to do their jobs, said Jim Crabtree, a registered nurse who helps train them for the Los Angeles County Emergency Management Services Agency. Four arrested in connection with deadly Brazil nightclub fire . ""It starts ringing and it becomes an instant reminder that this person is human, that they have friends and family who care,"" he said. It also leaves responders with an uneasy feeling they're keeping a secret from the victim's loved ones, Crabtree said. Crabtree first ran across the issue following the Virginia Tech shooting, in which a lone gunman, a student, killed 32 people. Some first responders couldn't get the sound of ringing cell phones out of their ears, psychologists Christopher Flynn of Virginia Tech and Dennis Heitzmann of Penn State wrote in a follow up journal article. ""As police and rescue workers removed the bodies of the deceased and evacuated the survivors, they reported haunting memories of cell phones ringing in body bags as parents and friends desperately called their loved ones."" Los Angeles first responders dealt with the same issue when a commuter train collided with a freight train in 2008. Be ready for emergency at a crowded public gathering . Hundreds of firefighters and other first responders flooded the scene, clawing through the mangled wreckage to get at the bodies of victims. All the while, Crabtree said, dozens of cell phones kept ringing. Aurora police Officer Justin Grizzle spoke this month during a court hearing of entering a theater where 12 people died in that shooting rampage. The things he noticed: blood running down the steps and the sound of cell phones ringing. It was the same Sunday night, when firefighters rushed through a hole punched into the wall of the Kiss nightclub by people who had escaped the building after it caught on fire. They found dozens of bodies of club-goers who died of smoke inhalation. And they once again heard the sounds of ringing phones. Milton Neves, a reporter from Radio Bandeirantes, said some 800 to 900 mobile phones were going off at the same time. One alone had 104 missed calls. Hundreds of family and friends were desperately trying to reach loved ones who were at the nightclub in the Brazilian city of Santa Maria when a fire swept through early Sunday, killing at least 230 people and injuring hundreds more. Brazil nightclub fire: 'Like a war zone' with bodies piled . ""It was a really complicated scene. A lot of smoke, a lot of shoes that were left, cell phones, because everybody tried to get out of there running,"" Glauber Fernandes, a reporter for CNN affiliate Band News said. ""While we were there, we saw the cell phones were ringing. It was parents, friends, trying to know about what was happening and nobody was answering."" Few, if any, agencies have policies on what to do about the multitude of ringing phones police and firefighters frequently encounter at disaster scenes, Crabtree said. He said he tells trainees turning off the phones can help save their own sanity, but says some agencies could view the act as tampering with evidence. He favors policies that would allow responders to turn the phones off, but says most commanders haven't yet come to the same conclusion. ""It's a 21st century problem,"" he said. But it's an issue emergency agencies will have to deal with sooner or later, if the experience of first responders Crabtree has spoken to is any indication. ""They don't talk about it openly, but when you get them alone ... "" Crabtree said, like the responders, leaving the rest unspoken. Deadly blazes: Nightclub tragedies in recent history .

"Two new sci-fi video games cast you in the futuristic role of a space marine who must face off against deadly creatures. However, while ""Dead Space: Extraction"" and ""Halo 3: ODST"" share this theme, and are both played from an immersive first-person perspective, the two experiences are quite different. Here's a look at each of these entertaining, ""Mature""-rated titles. ""Halo 3: ODST"" As an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper (ODST), part of an elite group of space marines dropped into hostile areas, you land in the fictional African port city of New Mombasa to ward off an invasion from the Covenant, an alliance of militaristic alien races. In ""Halo 3: ODST,"" which takes place between the events of 2004's ""Halo 2"" and 2007's ""Halo 3,"" you play as a new character (simply referred to as the ""Rookie""), rather than the heroic ""Master Chief."" The gameplay offers a slower-paced, more urban-centered combat compared with previous adventures, and while you can play the game solo, it's a lot more fun to invite up to three friends to play online via the Xbox Live service. On a related note, even better than the main campaign, perhaps, is the new ""Firefight"" mode. This is a cooperative multiplayer video game where up to four ODST fighters can take on increasingly challenging waves of Covenant invaders, similar to the celebrated ""Horde"" mode from ""Gears of War 2."" Also included in the box is a second disc with three new ""Halo 3"" multiplayer maps, as well as all original ""Halo 3"" maps and downloadable map packs, totaling 24 in all. ""Dead Space: Extraction"" Serving as a prequel to last year's extraordinary ""Dead Space"" for the Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and PC, this new Nintendo Wii exclusive reveals what happened leading up to Isaac Clarke's deadly mission aboard the USG Ishimura mining ship in deep space. The action-heavy, cinematic game play takes advantage of the Nintendo Wii's motion control, but to better handle the limited horsepower of the console, you won't be directly controlling your character. ""Dead Space: Extraction"" is an ""on-rails shooter"" game, so you'll only have control of your character's weapon rather than his feet. That doesn't mean you won't find the game fun or challenging. Introducing new characters, weapons and enemies (including tough boss battles), this atmospheric, horror-filled tale follows a group of space colonists who vow to fight a mysterious virus spreading through the USG Ishimura and the planet Aegis VII. One of the key features of this great-looking game is join-in-or-drop-out cooperative play. That means a friend beside you can at any time pick up a controller to help blast away ""Necromorph"" aliens limb by limb -- or quit the game if need be -- without disturbing the intense action.","Reviews of ""Halo 3: ODST"" and ""Dead Space: Extraction"" video games .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- A Bangkok nightclub owner turned himself in to police Monday as the death toll from a catastrophic New Year's fire continued to rise. Rescue officials survey the scene of the nightclub fire in Bangkok, Thailand. The fire at the upscale Santika nightclub broke out early Thursday while about 1,000 revelers were ringing in the new year. Suriya Ritrabue, the main shareholder of the company that owned Santika, turned himself over to police early Monday morning after authorities reported at least 64 people had died as a result of the fire. All fatalities have been identified, two were Singaporean and one was Japanese, with the majority being Thais, according to police. Most of the victims that died after hospitalization sustained severe burns and some fell into comas, police said. Hospital officials said more than 40 of the 229 injured survivors were foreign nationals. Police are gathering statements from survivors and physical evidence from the scene in what they describe is an ongoing investigation. Authorities have said the nightclub wasn't properly equipped with safety devices, noting a lack of sprinklers and poorly displayed exit signs. Police also said they are investigating whether people younger than 20 were allowed into the nightclub, which is prohibited by Thai law, and criminal negligence, which carries up to a 10-year sentence. There was no immediate response from Suriya or his representatives. But one of his partners, Visuk Setsawad, told the Thai newspaper Matichon that he has apologized to all victims and relatives and that the owners will set up a fund for the dead and injured. The fire was ""out of expectation,"" he said. The blaze started near a stage where fireworks were being used as part of a performance on the club's closing night, police said. The club is located in one of Bangkok's busiest commercial districts. The theme of Santika New Year's party was ""Goodbye Santika."" CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","At least 64 people have died from injuries sustained in the fire, police say .

"Temecula, California (CNN) -- The horse's name is Nitro Active. He was bred for speed. This great-great-grandson of the legendary Secretariat had won nearly $200,000 in prize money at tracks around Southern California. It had been a modestly successful racing career, but by December of last year it was over. The coulda, woulda, shoulda Triple Crown winners . Nitro Active was breaking down. Because of injuries to his tendons and leg joints Nitro Active could barely stand, let alone race. His fate seemed clear. Like many spent and injured racehorses, Nitro Active was destined for euthanasia or a Mexican slaughterhouse supplying horse meat to restaurants in Europe and Japan. He sold at auction for $190. Injury sidelines 'I'll Have Another' from Belmont . It was at that point that Monika Kerber came into Nitro Active's life. Kerber runs Villa Chardonnay, a horse rescue operation in Temecula, California. ""He deserves another chance,"" said Kerber. Most days, he would simply lay in his stall, in pain and misery, Kerber said. After months of expensive veterinary care, today Nitro Active is slowly healing. But for hundreds of other racehorses, there is no happy ending. ""They are literally running for their lives,"" said Nancy Perry of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, or ASPCA. ""If they run too fast they break down on the track and die. And if they don't run fast enough, they are discarded."" The Jockey Club -- the registry for thoroughbred horses in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico -- estimates that 15 thoroughbreds die on American racetracks every week. Those figures do not include other breeds of horses that also race in the United States. ""When you extrapolate that to quarter-horse racing and standardbred racing, you realize the numbers are astronomical,"" Perry said. The ASPCA is pushing for federal regulation to halt the use of performance enhancing drugs on the racetrack. ""They are injecting cocaine. They are injecting cancer drugs into horses in order to mask pain,"" said Perry. ""They are even injecting snake venom."" She said the proposed Interstate Horse Racing Improvement Act would remove oversight from a hodgepodge of seemingly ineffective state commissions. As the sun rises above Santa Anita Race Track in Arcadia, California, the horses take to the track. This was the location where Nitro Active spent most of his racing career. There is an air of calm and peace at this racing oval at the foot of the San Gabriel mountains. But racetrack CEO Mark Verge knows that his sport is under pressure. ""Horse racing on its own has too much infighting,"" Verge said. ""Everyone is looking up and saying, 'The public doesn't even care about us anymore.'"" Overheard on CNN.com: If wishes were horses, 'Another' Secretariat would rise . But Verge bristles at charges that his sport mistreats horses. ""The last thing you want to do is bring families and friends (to the track) and have a horse break down,"" Verge said. He also stressed that the industry has raised millions of dollars to provide a comfortable retirement for aging racehorses. In recent years, Santa Anita has spent millions more installing an artificial race surface in an effort to reduce racing injuries. But Verge said the new surface didn't work. There were constant problems keeping the track in proper condition to race. While mortality rates during races were lowered, trainers complained that the new surface was causing an increase in training injuries. The artificial surface has since been replaced by a traditional dirt track. Racehorse fatalities at Santa Anita are back up, the highest in the state. In addition to racing incidents, three horses were killed during the filming of horse race scenes at Santa Anita for the HBO TV series, ""Luck."" Attendance at racetracks nationwide is falling. That's why federal regulation is needed, according to the ASPCA. Perry said the sport could regain its popularity if people believed it was cleaning up its act. ""In sports where people compete, we have prohibitions on the use of steroids and other performance enhancing drugs,"" she said. ""But for some reason we've allowed horse racing to slip through the cracks."" Some of racing's greatest horses have met horrific fates. In 2008, Eight Belles snapped both front legs in the Kentucky Derby and was euthanized in front of a TV audience of millions. Two years earlier, Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro broke his leg racing in the Preakness Stakes. In 2002, the horse racing world was rocked by the news that 1986 Kentucky Derby winner Ferdinand was apparently killed in a Japanese slaughterhouse. Industry groups said $35 million a year is spent on equine drug testing. They said the problem is being blown out of proportion, but some in horse racing want state racing groups to agree to uniform medication standards as a way of controlling what violations do exist. Horse racing's critics said these and other deaths are not isolated tragedies, but rather part of a callous pattern within the inner world of the racing industry. Veterinarian Wayne McNeel has been guiding Nitro Active back along the long road to recovery. The horse's future is still far from certain. But he said he hopes that one day soon Nitro Active will be able to bear a rider around the shaded grounds of his new home.","An estimated 15 thoroughbreds die on American racetracks every week .

"(CNN) -- At just 31 years old, and already heading a vast business empire he built from scratch, Ashish Thakkar has been referred to by some as Africa's youngest billionaire. But this is a label the Ugandan entrepreneur doesn't want to associate himself with. ""Money should never be a measurement for anything,"" says Thakkar, founder of the pan-African multi-sector business conglomerate Mara Group. ""I like to see myself as an entrepreneur that's being disruptive -- I like to be the underdog in a lot of cases,"" he adds. ""It's all about how you go about it; but one thing I definitely don't want to be known as is as 'Africa's youngest billionaire.'"" Whilst having problems with that specific description, Thakkar has no issue about claiming other, less corporeal, titles. An adventurous spirit, Thakkar is gearing up to become the first ever East African in space, proudly representing the region in the Virgin Galactic program, which offers paying customers the opportunity to travel beyond the Earth's atmosphere. ""I'm taking quite a few of flags into space, as a way to kind of send a strong message that 'look, we as Africa have the vision and the ability as well,"" says Thakkar. ""It's something that started off for fun and it's actually turned out to be something quite nice where we can send a strong message to say, 'we're coming, we're going to mark our space in that territory too."" Reading this: Flying doctor takes to the skies . Conquering the space frontier seems like a rather fitting move for a maverick entrepreneur such as Thakkar, who quit school around the age of 15 to embark on his first commercial enterprise -- a small IT business inside a shopping mall built across the road from his father's shop in Kampala, Uganda's capital. ""The idea initially was to do it for the two months during my summer holiday,"" recalls Thakkar."" And when school started again I conveniently didn't tell my parents that it did, and obviously they figured me out in a week."" Thakkar believes his business journey was easier because of his accommodating parents, who allowed him to pursue his entrepreneurial dreams. ""So I told them, 'look, if you want me to go through the whole cycle I'll do it for formality purposes, but I'm going to end up doing this, so I'd really appreciate it if you'd let me do it now.' ""They were surprisingly really open-minded and kind of gave me the opportunity and said 'look, do it on your own, try it out for a year -- if it doesn't work out you go a year behind your friends.' ""And I've still got that option open 16 years down the line."" So, at the age of 16, Thakkar spotted a gap in the market and went big. As his business evolved, Thakkar started flying to Dubai to stock up on computer hardware and then sell it for a profit in Kampala. ""I was flying to Dubai every weekend because I didn't have the money to set up a shop and have enough working capital to do an air cargo,"" recalls Thakkar. ""So Monday to Friday I'd sell my goods in Uganda and on a weekend I'd actually fly to Dubai, fill my suitcase up with IT stuff again and bring it back, and the same repeated,"" he adds. This quickly developed into a thriving business and before long Thakkar was branching out into several other areas. Today, the Dubai-based Mara Group has grown into a major corporation that operates in 18 African countries and has various and diverse interests -- from financial services and real estate to communication, manufacturing and agriculture. The group also runs the Mara Foundation, a non-profit arm focused on fostering entrepreneurship among young Africans. Read this: African CEOs look to bright future . While Thakkar acknowledges that there are still many challenges when it comes to doing business in Africa, he says the continent holds a fantastic opportunity going forward. ""The West is definitely investing more in Africa -- or wanting to invest more in Africa -- but they're still investing a lot in Asia as well, specifically India and China. [The] nice thing is that India and China's investing in Africa, so the ultimate destination is us,"" he says. ""People do want to come to Africa; people realize that we're the next big thing -- India and China have had their time, it's now ours."" Echoing a growing chorus of voices cautioning against exploitative behavior from foreign investors, Thakkar adds that, whilst Africa still needs investment in many sectors, gone are the days where the continent desperately relied on outsiders. ""We're evolving; we're writing our own story now; we're making it happen for ourselves,"" he says. ""So I think that's very important for people to realize that they must plug into what's important to us and how it should be done that's going to benefit our countries and our people -- local beneficiation, empowerment of our people. ""We want to see our economies and our countries transform, so I think people with that mindset, willing to help us on that route, are more than welcome. And I think that's hopefully what we're going to see more of now, because we're becoming more picky as countries.""","Ashish Thakkar, 31, is the founder of pan-African business conglomerate Mara Group .

"(CNN) -- Dick Traum, who made history as the first amputee to run a marathon, has a message of hope and triumph to those who lost limbs during the Boston Marathon bombings. ""If I lost a leg in Boston, you know what I would be thinking of is that I'm going to come back next year and slay the monster,"" said Traum, who ran the New York City Marathon in 1976 on a prosthetic leg. Traum, now 72, participated in last week's Boston Marathon in a hand-cranked wheelchair. He finished the race three hours before the twin explosions struck near the marathon's finish line, killing three and wounding more than 260. His personal story demonstrates how the victims of last week's Boston terror bombings can overcome the devastating setback of losing a limb. At least 13 of those injured in the Boston attacks underwent amputations. While it might sound crazy to even think about running 26.2 miles after a devastating injury, Traum has invited the amputees to join him and his nonprofit group of disabled runners, Achilles International, to participate in next year's Boston Marathon. ""I would tell them the marathon is a lunatic fringe, but as they progress out of the hospital, we'd love to have them join us in Boston,"" said Traum, who lost his leg when a car hit him in 1965. His work with disabled athletes earned him a CNN Hero nomination last year. The patients don't have to run in the first year of recuperation -- although it's been done before. Newcomer amputees can use hand-cranked wheelchairs as Traum did this year, in an act of mercy on his 72-year-old joints. As these victims work on physically recovering from their injuries, they also must cope with the emotional shock of losing a part of their body. ""I don't think I ever had a more horrifying moment in my life than when I pulled the cover up after my surgery and I saw my leg was gone,"" said Denise Castelli, a triathlete and softball player who lost her right leg below the knee four years ago at age 23. ""It was like, this is your life now and there's no looking back. Unfortunately you can't grow a limb back, and it is very frightening."" While she did not compete in this year's Boston Marathon, she had an emotional reaction after learning of the horrendous attacks. ""My first reaction was I just want to give them a hug, to let them know they will be OK,"" Castelli said. ""I have no doubt in my mind that any of the marathoners who lost a limb will run a marathon again."" Waking to the new reality can be tortuous. The patients confront the anguish of a loss just short of life itself, and yet they must find a way to advance themselves. ""The initial phase of recovery for the victim is going to be psychological, accepting what happened to them and stop asking 'Why did this happen to me?' and move forward to the next step,"" said Roy Perkins, senior director of programs for the Challenged Athletes Foundation, which supports people with disabilities in their pursuit of athletics and an active life. Dr. Andrew Ulrich, executive vice chair of emergency medicine at Boston Medical Center, which treated victims of the marathon blasts, described recovery as ""an extended process."" ""It's going to take a long time,"" Ulrich said. ""As the patients come to more realization as to what happened, there's going to be a lot of work to be done in a lot of places. ""Everyone is going to figure how to go forward,"" he said. Opinion: Amputees never say 'I can't' Family and friends will play key roles in overcoming grief and depression. ""There's so many times when I got down on myself, and my confidence would waver, and parents and friends would say 'You can do this, hang on,'"" Castelli said. ""They tried to be as encouraging as possible. That helped me cope a lot."" Lindsay Ess, a quadruple amputee, urged the victims to be resilient. As hard as it may seem, life does improve, she said. Her limbs were removed in 2006 after she suffered from Crohn's disease and organ failure brought on by septic shock. ""I've been there, and I could tell them that it gets better. Just never give up,"" Ess said. Counseling and physical therapy become like a ""full-time job,"" she said. ""That's huge,"" she said, ""because for a long time I didn't want to take any pills that would make me happy. I didn't want to accept that I needed the medication to stabilize. ""You have to realize that it's not forever,"" she continued. ""It's something that you have to deal with and fight, and keep fighting."" The rewards can be profound. ""You will love yourself even more afterwards because of how much you have gone through and overcome,"" Ess said. ""And other people probably will never be able to relate. And in a way that's a good thing, because they didn't have the opportunity to have a near-death experience and live."" Mike Lenhart ran this week's Boston Marathon as a guide to an amputee runner who had completed a sports camp operated by Lenhart's Getting 2 Tri Foundation. The two men were about four blocks from the finish line when they heard the bomb blast, which Lenhart said sounded like a garbage truck dropping a Dumpster. He and amputee runner Richard Blalock weren't injured. Lenhart attests to how science keeps improving an amputee's quality of life. His foundation promotes people with disabilities swimming, cycling, running and racing wheelchairs as a way to integrate in their communities. ""We're at a point in this country where the technology is much more advanced than 20 years ago regarding prosthetic limbs,"" Lenhart said. ""It used to be, 20 years ago, you got an ugly rubber foot and it wasn't very functional. And now they're very functional."" Insurance companies will pay for a prosthetic leg used for walking, but they don't typically cover prosthetic legs used for running or cycling, which can cost between $25,000 and $40,000 each, said Jenna Novotny of the Challenged Athletes Foundation. That's why the foundation awards annual grants -- $1.9 million to more than 1,200 para-athletes around the world this month -- to pay for the running prosthetic legs and other adaptive equipment, Novotny said. The foundation has also started a fundraising web page for the Boston victims who lost limbs. Castelli, 27, didn't trust her prosthetic leg at first. Would it support her next step? She spent about six months learning how to walk on it. After two more months, she learned how to run. ""I feared falling,"" said Castelli, who was a collegiate softball player when she broke her leg sliding into second base on a steal, leading to infection and ultimately amputation. ""And there's always a fear that if I can't run, then it would be a reminder of what my life used to be, that I would never be that speedy little center fielder. My entire life I identified myself as an athlete."" Eight months after she learned how to run, she tested her old identity: She signed up for a women's softball league in West Milford, New Jersey, as the only amputee in the league, she said. She conquered the amputation in her first at-bat, she recounted proudly. She hit a home run. And because the field had no fence and an outfielder chased down the ball, she enjoyed no home run trot. She ran. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.","Para-athletes offer hope to Boston Marathon blast victims who lost limbs .

"(CNN) -- The final, violent moments in the life of their son, Trayvon Martin, no longer dominate the national news, as they once did. Tens of thousands no longer attend rallies demanding justice for the slain teenager; pundits no longer debate the case on every media platform imaginable. What once had been the big story has increasingly become yesterday's news. But Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin haven't stopped fighting. One year ago Tuesday, they were grieving and relatively anonymous parents, trying to come to grips with the sudden death of their 17-year-old son. But in time, they became celebrities of sorts in a world of gun violence and vigilante justice. To their supporters, they were the faces and the voices of victims of racial profiling. Talk Back: One year later, what have we learned? While the spotlight largely has faded since then, they say their commitment has not. ""We (want to) make sure that no other parents have to go through what we have gone through in the last year,"" Fulton told CNN's Piers Morgan on Monday night. On February 26, 2012, her teenage son was walking back to the Sanford, Florida, home of his father's fiancee after picking up some Skittles and an iced tea at 7-Eleven. That's when, and where, then-28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman spotted him. What happened the night Trayvon Martin died . What happened between then and when Zimmerman fatally shot the teen is subject to dispute, one that could be settled by a jury starting June 10, when Zimmerman is set to go on trial on a second-degree murder charge. As the prosecution and defense lawyers battled in court in the weeks and months that followed, Trayvon Martin's parents became less visible on the national scene. But they've still been active, said Fulton, including continuing to work on behalf of the Justice for Trayvon Martin Foundation, which they started. They held a benefit dinner for the nonprofit organization, as well as a peace walk in Miami ""to let teenagers know they have a right to walk in peace,"" she said Monday. On Tuesday, the anniversary of their son's death, they'll be in New York for a candlelight vigil. Five things to know . Their efforts include continuing to speak out on issues. Among them is gun violence, a debate over which is brewing in Washington and nationwide after several grisly mass shootings, including one that left 20 children and 6 adults dead at a Connecticut elementary school last December. ""It's just too much senseless violence; it's overwhelming the homes right now,"" Tracy Martin said Monday, referring to the Newtown massacre as well as murders in places like Chicago. ""We, as parents, certainly feel the pain."" Even as they continue to fight, Trayvon Martin's parents acknowledge that -- after months in the spotlight, trying to ramp up pressure on authorities to go after Zimmerman -- much about their son's case is now out of their hands. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump, on Monday asked rhetorically if Zimmerman is ""not held accountable, what message does that send to the next child that's killed, unarmed, on the ground?"" Still, Sybrina Fulton said that, to a large extent, she and her ex-husband have gotten what they asked for. Zimmerman was arrested and, unless something unforeseen happens, he will stand trial. Opinion: What we can learn from Trayvon Martin shooting . ""We just want to have that trial, and let the jury decide,"" she said. ""And whatever decision comes out of that, we're going to accept that. ""We may not like it, but we're going to accept it."" The jury will have to decide between two starkly different versions of what happened that night. Zimmerman told police that, after the two exchanged words, Martin went after him. According to his account, the teen, who didn't have any weapons on him, punched him, forced him to the ground, and slammed his head on the concrete. That's when Zimmerman shot Martin in self-defense, he claims. Martin's family and supporters, though, have long had a different story. One of the first to tell it was Tracy Martin, who initially addressed reporters last March 8, trying to raise the case's profile and hike pressure on authorities. He and, soon, others suggested Zimmerman had targeted his son, an African-American youth wearing a hooded sweatshirt, because of his race. Timeline of events in the Trayvon Martin case . The parents' legion of supporters grew exponentially as the weeks wore on after the shooting, with no one charged. They created a petition on the website Change.org calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Within a week, it was the second most-popular petition in the website's history, with 877,110 signatures. Protests drawing thousands of people sprung up nationwide demanding ""Justice for Trayvon"" and blasting local authorities' response. As their reason for not immediately arresting Zimmerman, police cited Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which states that people who feel threatened don't have to retreat from danger and can use deadly force to protect themselves. Zimmerman was charged on April 11, with a probable cause affidavit stating he ""profiled"" Martin and disregarded a 911 dispatcher's request that he wait for police. The weeks that followed produced more news. For example, Zimmerman posted $150,000 bail, only to have it revoked after the judge said he'd mislead the court about his financial situation, including tens of thousands of dollars he'd raised online for his defense fund.

"(CNN) -- What was it Jane Fonda used to say? ""No pain, no gain."" She wasn't talking about punching a guy in the face, handcuffing him to a chair for days and weeks on end, stringing him upside down like a piece of dry-cleaning, setting him on fire (feel the burn!) and running him over with a van, but these nuances can get lost in translation when an ambitious young man takes it into his head to improve his lot in life. Such is the plot of ""Pain & Gain."" Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) is like Don Vito Corleone: he believes in America. His heroes are the self-made men -- like the Corleones, like Scarface. The guys who started with nothing and made it happen for themselves. Do-ers, not don't-ers. Daniel believes in America and he believes in fitness, and having proved his worth by attaining the physique he always wanted and tripling the membership at the Miami gym where he works (primarily by offering free memberships to strippers) he reckons he deserves the rest of the package: the big house, the boat, the sports car, the money. And so he hatches a ""three-finger plan."" With two bodybuilding buddies (Anthony Mackie and Dwayne Johnson), he snatches a wealthy client (Tony Shalhoub) and tortures him until he signs away all his property and assets. Surprisingly, this works. The gang's gross incompetence and double-digit IQ is matched only by the indifference of local law enforcement. Although he's famous for his boys' toys movies (""Transformers,"" ""Armageddon""), let's not forget Michael Bay cut his teeth on the slick buddy cop movie ""Bad Boys,"" which filmed in and around Miami at much the same time as Daniel Lugo and pals were chopping up body parts with a chainsaw and an ax. Does that make this self-styled ""small movie"" a more personal, mature work than his blockbusters? Well, it's R-rated, which means Bay gets to indulge his sexism and casual homophobia more explicitly than usual, albeit roped to a scattershot satire of dumbbell self-improvement culture and rampant egomania. Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have shown a knack for hardboiled black comedy before, notably in ""You Kill Me,"" and it's easy to imagine that the Coen brothers could have fashioned something sharp and funny out of this dismal true story. But even if he's obviously imitating ""Burn After Reading"" (the Coens' worst film) and ""Fargo"" (possibly their best), putting a satire in Bay's hands is rather like presenting the keys of a stolen Lamborghini to a drunken teenager. It's a fast ride, but it doesn't take you where you want to go. This is a movie about stupidity and cruelty in which stupidity and cruelty permeate almost every scene. Bay doesn't hold anything back -- everything is over-pitched and underlined in hot neon. If he's braked his trademark action cutting, it's only to go overboard on slow-motion so as not to miss a single drop of blood or perspiration. He casts broad comic actors like Rebel Wilson, Rob Corddry, Michael Rispoli and Ken Jeong in supporting roles while encouraging his leads to play it straight, but caricatures victims and criminals alike. They're all contemptible in his eyes -- the women more than anyone. Israeli model Bar Paly plays an Eastern European stripper who is apparently so stupid she believes Daniel is a CIA agent. She's also subjected to a throwaway gang rape gag for her trouble -- thanks for that, Michael. The scenes of violence -- played for gross-out black comedy -- are especially toxic.

"(CNN) -- A 51-year-old man had between 500,000 and 1 million full-length child pornography videos and images inside his central Florida apartment, said authorities, who accused him of downloading and sharing the illicit materials. John Edward Shearen of Leesburg, Florida, was arrested Thursday on 15 counts of possession of child pornography and 15 counts of distribution of child pornography, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement announced. He was later booked, without bond, into Lake County Jail. His arrest came after FDLE agents executed a search warrant at his residence in Leesburg's Lakeside Pointe apartment complex, about 45 miles northwest of Orlando. They found the illicit videos and images on computers and ""mass media storage devices,"" the state agency said. Feds: Identified by tattoos in pictures, woman indicted on child porn charges . Steve Arthur, an FDLE spokesman, said pieces of children's clothing were also found inside the apartment. Asked what Shearen would have done with the clothes, FDLE Special Agent Jeff Duncan told CNN affiliate WFTV, ""He (told us) that he utilizes them himself, but it's virtually impossible.""

"(CNN) -- Pervez Musharraf recently returned to Pakistan after five years in exile, determined to face down his challengers in the courtroom and make a sensational return to politics in time for the May 11 election. But his grand plan has turned to a disaster following a week that the former president would rather forget. On Tuesday, election officials barred Musharraf from running for a seat in parliament. By Friday he was formally arrested -- the first time that has happened to any former chief of the Pakistani army -- amid claims he illegally placed senior judges under house arrest during a period of emergency rule he imposed in 2007. Later that day he was transferred to a guest house at Islamabad Police HQ where he can be held for a maximum 48 hours before he appears in court to face charges relating to the detention of the judges. At that point he could get bail, go to jail or return to house arrest at his villa. Most analysts expect the house arrest option. The ex-military strongman still has to face two separate other cases dating from his time in power. The first relates to claims he did not do enough protect the life of Benazir Bhutto -- the first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan -- after she was assassinated in 2007, just weeks before an election in which she hoped to be returned to office. Musharraf is also accused of ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader, in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006. WATCH: Musharraf under house arrest . Last month, Musharraf told CNN that all the charges against him are ""trumped up, politicized cases."" But he now finds himself under house arrest at his farmhouse compound on the outskirts of Islamabad. Why did Musharraf bother returning to Pakistan? Despite the criminal charges awaiting him and the threat of assassination by the country's Taliban extremists, Musharraf arrived in Karachi last month and declared: ""I have come to save Pakistan."" Though the party that succeeded him became the first democratically elected government to serve a full five-year term during the country's 65-year history, Pakistan is still beset with problems -- a crippled economy, food shortages, frequent power cuts and a bloody insurgency. In his absence overseas, the government had frozen the considerable wealth Musharraf had acquired. According to CNN's Nic Robertson in Islamabad, Musharraf expected a swift return to politics amid plenty of popular support -- but that proved a major miscalculation. ""From day one it didn't happen,"" said Robertson. ""As one of his advisers told us, 'it would have been better if he hadn't come back.' Musharraf anticipated hundreds of thousands of people greeting him at the airport when he landed. It turned out to be hundreds. ""Then there were the legal cases: charges of treason, of being involved in the Bhutto murder and of putting judges under house arrest. In all those cases the judges really went after them aggressively. ""Musharraf had expected them to hold off until after the election. That didn't happen. ""Then his apparent miscalculation in the election itself -- he was barred by the election commission from challenging for four different seats. Now he's not able to leave the country and under house arrest. The reality is the advice he appears to have been given about the level of popular support he still has in Pakistan was erroneous."" What level of support does Musharraf have? Musharraf's popularity began to wane in 2007 after he suspended the chief justice of the Supreme Court for ""misuse of authority."" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence a court decision on whether he could seek another term in office. More than six years on and some Pakistanis would be happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler, hoping his leadership could help restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence. But others will point to the many enemies in the final years of his presidency, notably among the judges he detained. The Pakistani Taliban vowed to send a death squad to hunt down the former president if he returned to the country, although Musharraf has admitted he has been living under threat of death since September 11, 2001, when he supported the American war on terror and fought against the Taliban. Musharraf also revealed last week that his government secretly signed off on U.S. drone strikes within its borders, but only if there was no time for Pakistan's military to act against al Qaeda targets. This is the first time a top Pakistani official, past or present, has admitted publicly to such a deal. ""He said it wasn't a blanket agreement -- he agreed to perhaps several of these types of drone attacks -- but until now absolutely no word, no hint of this, only ever denials that there were ever any green lights,"" said Robertson. Can Musharraf count on support from the military? As the former army chief, Musharraf will have retained support and influence within Pakistan's powerful military. ""Most people here think the army won't let him go to jail and won't tolerate him being under house arrest for long,"" said Robertson. ""However they will not do anything rash. They'll exert their influence behind the scenes to secure a favorable outcome. I think for now the legal process continues apace."" What's next for Musharraf? More court appearances. After appearing before a magistrate Friday, Musharraf returned home where he is being held under house arrest, according to his lawyer, Ahmed Raza Qasoori. Musharraf will continue to seek bail in the case, Qasoori said. However, an attempt on Thursday to appeal the Islamabad court's decision at the Supreme Court appeared to have so far been unsuccessful. To further complicate matters, Qasoori claimed the Islamabad High Court judge who ordered Musharraf's arrest is one of the judges whom Musharraf is alleged to have had detained in 2007 and therefore should have recused himself from the case. Are there implications for Pakistan? ""The judiciary has been emboldened, though they are widely perceived to operate a political bias,"" said Robertson. ""But in the end we are seeing small steps towards democracy in Pakistan. Ultimately a strong and unbiased judiciary is a good check on political corruption and excess."" But an editorial Friday in The Nation, an English-language newspaper, took a more critical view of events this week. ""All segments of society, supporter or opponent, official or non-official, high or low, are watching keenly to ascertain just how Pakistan will deal with the first of its former dictators to go on trial. ""Adding further spice to the case was the total inaction shown by the police in putting him under arrest that had been specifically ordered by the IHC (Islamabad High Court). As he came out of the court room, he sped off to his villa ... in a bullet-proof vehicle, guarded by his personal security, with the police and rangers playing the part of silent spectators."" Referring to the provisional administration in place until after next month's election, it added ""the shameful reality is the utter lack of cooperation and indifference shown by the caretaker setup in Musharraf's trial, though it is simply carrying on with the tradition set by its predecessor governments."" CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Pervez Musharraf went back to Pakistan after five years in exile, hoping to return to politics .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- For the war-beaten orphans of the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, this big old shoe fits. A monument to a shoe thrown at former President Bush is unveiled at the Tikrit Orphanage complex. A huge sculpture of the footwear hurled at President Bush in December during a trip to Iraq has been unveiled in a ceremony at the Tikrit Orphanage complex. Assisted by children at the home, sculptor Laith al-Amiri erected a brown replica of one of the shoes hurled at Bush and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki by journalist Muntadhir al-Zaidi during a press conference in Baghdad. Al-Zaidi was jailed for his actions, and a trial is pending. But his angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world. He is regarded by many people as a hero. Demonstrators in December took to the streets in the Arab world and called for his release. The shoe monument, made of fiberglass and coated with copper, consists of the shoe and a concrete base. The entire monument is 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) high. The shoe is 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) long and 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) wide. The orphans helped al-Amiri build the $5,000 structure -- unveiled Tuesday -- in 15 days, said Faten Abdulqader al-Naseri, the orphanage director. ""Those orphans who helped the sculptor in building this monument were the victims of Bush's war,"" al-Naseri said. ""The shoe monument is a gift to the next generation to remember the heroic action by the journalist."" ""When the next generation sees the shoe monument, they will ask their parents about it,"" al-Naseri said. ""Then their parents will start talking about the hero Muntadhir al-Zaidi, who threw his shoe at George W. Bush during his unannounced farewell visit."" Saddam Hussein, the former Iraqi leader toppled by the United States in 2003, was from the Tikrit region. Al-Zaidi marked his 30th birthday in jail earlier this month. One of his brothers said he is ""in good health and is being treated well."" Al-Zaidi's employer, TV network al-Baghdadia, keeps a picture of him at the top left side of the screen with a calendar showing the number of days he has spent in detention. The network has been calling for his release. By tradition, throwing a shoe is the most insulting act in the Arab world.

"(CNN) -- Maria D'Angelo is a former private school teacher who has made the shelters of Los Angeles her classroom. Her goal: to transform the lives of homeless children through academic and social opportunities. Through her nonprofit, the Children's Lifesaving Foundation, D'Angelo believes she can spread hope to a community often overlooked. ""I believe everyone is fundamentally good,"" she explained. ""I don't like to give up on people."" For D'Angelo, the reality of growing up poor is personal. When she was 13, D'Angelo and her siblings immigrated to Staten Island, New York, from Naples, Italy. Her father, an artist and chef, had moved three years earlier to establish a life for his children. ""We moved into a $30-a-month walkup apartment,"" she said. ""None of us spoke English."" So to help her parents make ends meet, D'Angelo and her siblings went to work. Her first job was in a bakery after school, which foreshadowed her love of service. ""Each Saturday night, (my boss) would give me all the baked goods and cakes that were left over,"" she said. ""So, I would bring them to the entire neighborhood. ... I was so thrilled."" Despite growing up in poverty, D'Angelo never saw herself as poor. ""Being poor is a real state of mind,"" she explained. ""We never felt poor; we just lived in a poor environment."" D'Angelo went on to college and became a high school Spanish and Italian teacher. She also served as a tour guide for New York's Rockefeller Center. But it was on a trip to a homeless shelter that D'Angelo was ""accidentally"" introduced to a future life of nonprofit work. After moving to Los Angeles in 1990, D'Angelo worked as a volunteer in a shelter and met an 8-year-old boy who couldn't read. She learned that the boy never attended school because his mother never took him for the required physical exam. Without hesitation, she got the mother's permission and took him for the exam. Soon, D'Angelo was taking other kids to the doctor and eventually on field trips. ""I then started bringing the kids on outings to the beach and to the mountains,"" she said. And in 1993, D'Angelo founded the Children's Lifesaving Foundation. With her son and daughter working closely by her side, the former teacher's nonprofit works to connect youth in Los Angeles shelters, who are often exposed to drug use and violence, with resources that support the ""whole family."" D'Angelo believes that children succeed when their family's social, emotional and academic needs are addressed. ""We need to focus on all these aspects to be a whole person,"" she said. Her main goal is to provide them with the same sense of hope she had as a child. The Children's Lifesaving Foundation is funded through a combination of grants and private donations. With a staff of more than 250 volunteers, the foundation provides services that fall under three key initiatives: living, learning and enriching. Designed to meet the domestic needs of at-risk families, the living platform transitions children and parents from shelters into stable housing in safe communities. Upon qualifying for this program, families are given a fully furnished apartment, complete with a year's worth of food, clothing and appliances. ""We also help to supplement their income for that first year,"" D'Angelo added. She says the program is available only for families who are ready to change their lives. Parents must be drug- and alcohol-free and have a job, among other qualifications, when they move into their new homes. To assist families in maintaining their homes, the foundation also provides access to financial and credit coaching, interview training and mentorship opportunities. Through this platform, the group has moved more than 60 families into homes. ""It plants hope in the hearts of these children and families,"" D'Angelo explained. The nonprofit's learning platform is dedicated to academic growth. Through this initiative, the children have access to computer labs and one-on-one tutoring sessions from Children's Lifesaving Foundation volunteers. Under the nonprofit's Care Through College Program, it is D'Angelo's goal to make sure that each child is prepared for college. ""To have that basic education is so important. ... It is going to prepare them for life."" Upon completion of this program and graduation from high school, students receive four-year college scholarships. ""They actually care about your life, not only in school but outside of school,"" said 19-year-old scholarship recipient Christopher Rojas. ""Thanks to them, I am able to attend college."" Rojas, who lives with his mother and two siblings, is studying film production at a Santa Monica community college. The Children's Lifesaving Foundation helped spur his interest in photography with classes through a local nonprofit, and he attended a summer cinematography session at the University of Southern California with help from the foundation and D'Angelo's daughter, Francesca. The foundation's enrichment platform is what D'Angelo describes as social aspect of her organization. Through this program, the nonprofit provides L.A.'s inner-city youth -- some homeless, some not -- with recreational activities. This can include summer camps, birthday celebrations, family movie nights and pizza parties. D'Angelo believes that through these events, Children's Lifesaving Foundation families are able to see a world unrestrained by poverty. ""It shows the kids that they so deserve it,"" she said. Over the nonprofit's 20-year history, its three platforms have helped more than 75,000 families. ""If your heart is open, you are kind,"" D'Angelo said. ""And if you are kind to another person, you open their heart.""","Former teacher Maria D'Angelo offers hope to families living in Los Angeles shelters .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Opening statements began Thursday in the corruption trials of six former city council members of Bell, California, who are accused of receiving exorbitant salaries for no work and turning taxpayer money into a personal ""piggy bank,"" officials said. The six former council members are named in a 20-count complaint accusing them of misappropriating about $1.2 million in public funds. The six are being tried in a Los Angeles County courtroom: former Mayor Oscar Hernandez and former council members Teresa Jacobo, George Mirabal, Luis Artiga, George Cole and Victor Bello, said spokeswoman Jane Robison of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Also charged in the corruption case are former City Manager Robert Rizzo and former Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia, whose trials have yet to be scheduled, Robison said. Together, the eight defendants are charged with misappropriating more than $5.5 million, including being paid for phantom committee meetings and making illegal personal loans. Former District Attorney Steve Cooley had called the case a ""feeding frenzy of corruption by Bell officials."" He filed the charges in 2010; he retired last year. Each of the so-called Bell Eight has pleaded not guilty, authorities said. Prosecutors have alleged that the six ex-council members, as well as the two other former city officials, turned the city treasury into ""their own piggy bank, which they looted at will."" Between 2006 and 2010, they ""illegally gamed the system to receive ridiculous salaries for doing no work"" and were paid nearly $8,000 a month for meetings on four boards that never took place or lasted just a few minutes, prosecutors have alleged. Those boards were the Solid Waste Authority, Surplus Property Authority, Public Finance Authority and Community Housing Authority, authorities said. In 2011: Officials in California scandal reject plea deal . Bell, a city of 36,000, is about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. The city has taken measures to promote transparency in government by posting the city's ""checkbook"" on a revamped website, Mayor Ali Saleh told CNN. The open records are designed to rebuild the public trust, Saleh said. ""All we're waiting for now is justice for our residents,"" Saleh said of the ongoing trial. ""Let's not forget that we still have a lot of issues with litigation that the city has endured because of the scandal."" He was referring to lawsuits against the city, including one filed by Rizzo and by the former police chief, who was making more than $400,000 a year, he said. Saleh is now focused on ""moving the city forward,"" he said. He said council members no longer make $100,000 a year. ""I'll tell you exactly what my W-2 says from 2012: $8,130.12 -- don't forget the 12 cents,"" he said, providing his city salary last year. Current council members now receive $673 a month, he said.

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN)  -- Argentina's Court of Justice on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a club owner to 20 years in prison for a deadly club fire that killed 194 people but absolved the band that had played that night of responsibility for the tragedy. An injured clubgoer and his father wait for news of his brother after the club fire in December 2004. The incident happened in December 2004, when a fire broke out in the overcrowded Republica Cromanon venue in Buenos Aires. Many of the exits to the building were illegally closed. Omar Chaban, the owner of Cromanon, was convicted of causing the deaths of the concertgoers and of bribing officials, the court said. Prosecutors had asked for 23 years for Chaban, who became the object of such scorn that he had to move repeatedly over the past four years to avoid harassment, according to the newspaper Clarin. Some city officials also were convicted in the case. Deputy commissioner Carlos Diaz was sentenced to 18 years, and two other city functionaries were sentenced to two years for failing to carry out their municipal duties. The band's former manager, Diego Arganaraz, also was sentenced to 18 years, the court said. But the members of the Callejeros band, whose fans were gathered outside of the court house, were acquitted although band members had been indicted. Family members of the victims reacted strongly when the judge announced that the band was not found responsible. Victims' family and friends inside the courtroom began crying and shouting at the news, and at least one man was removed by police. Outside of the courtroom, there were some injuries as fans of the band and families of the victims clashed. ""The justice we were hoping for does not exist,"" Betty Morales, a family member of one of the victims, told CNN en Español. ""Callejeros are just as responsible... While they are partying, our children are buried, dead."" All of those convicted Wednesday remained free pending appeals. The Republica Cromanon nightclub was made to hold about 1,000 people, but it was estimated that more than 3,000 fans were packed inside the night of the fire, which began when fans began lighting flares that caught the roof on fire. The members of the band began playing together in 1995 and took the Callejeros name in 1997, according to a fan site. The band was considered an up-and-coming rock group, but didn't perform for almost two years after the deadly fire. And when they did play, it was a controversial event. Fans of the band rejoiced at Wednesday's outcome. ""Personally, I think it's good because the band didn't have anything to do with it,"" fan Mauro Fernandez told CNN. CNN en Español's Javier Doberti contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Justice we were hoping for does not exist,"" victim's kin says of band acquittal .

"(CNN) -- Denouncing election irregularities, Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski demanded a recount and said early Monday that he will not recognize the country's presidential results ""until every vote is counted."" His comments came less than an hour after officials said the man former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez handpicked to be his successor had won the country's presidential vote. With 99% of votes counted, Nicolas Maduro won 50.66% of votes, National Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena said, calling the results ""irreversible."" Capriles won 49.07% of votes, she said. Fireworks erupted over Caracas as Maduro spoke to cheering supporters, calling on Venezuelans to respect the results and respond peacefully. ""I have won by nearly 300,000 votes. It is the decision of the people,"" he said. The closely watched election was the second time in just over six months that voters in the South American country cast ballots in a presidential election. Chavez, who ruled Venezuela for 14 years, celebrated a triumphant re-election victory in October. After his death on March 5, authorities announced new elections to select his successor. Maduro, 50, was the United Socialist Party of Venezuela's candidate. Capriles, 40, represents a coalition of opposition parties. Capriles is the former governor of Miranda state. He lost to Chavez in October's presidential vote, coming within 10 percentage points of the longtime leader. It was a significant gap, but the closest any opposition candidate ever came to defeating Chavez during his rule. More than 18.9 million Venezuelans are registered to vote in the presidential election. More than 68% of the country's registered voters had cast ballots by 3 p.m. Sunday, elections officials said. Far beyond Venezuela's borders, voters lined up at diplomatic offices around the world. Venezuela's National Electoral Council says that more than 100,000 Venezuelans are registered to vote abroad at diplomatic offices in 88 countries. There are more than 37,681 Venezuelans registered to vote in the United States, according to government figures. By midafternoon, thousands had cast ballots in New Orleans. Many said they had traveled by car or bus for more than 12 hours to get there from Florida because Venezuela shut down its consulate in Miami last year. Beatriz Olavarria, who worked to mobilize voters, said it wasn't easy. While campaigning lasted for months before October's election, this time around, the official campaign period was only a matter of days. ""It was much more difficult because the time has been short, and the budget has been low,"" she said Sunday, ""but the excitement has been enormous."" In addition to representatives from national organizations serving as observers, Venezuela's National Electoral Council says 170 foreigners have been invited to witness the elections in Venezuela. The international group includes delegations from the Union of South American Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center. Authorities detained 43 people Sunday for alleged electoral crimes, Maj. Gen. Wilmer Barrientos told reporters. But elections officials said Sunday evening that the day had proceeded smoothly without major incidents. ""It has developed with total normalcy, with total calmness,"" said Sandra Oblitas of the National Electoral Council. Polls were scheduled to close at 6 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), but Barrientos said polling stations where voters remained in line would remain open until the last voter cast a ballot. As polls were closing on Sunday evening, Twitter accounts for Maduro and his party were apparently hacked with posts denouncing ""electoral fraud."" A group calling itself Lulz Security Peru claimed responsibility, while officials from Maduro's campaign criticized what they said were ""dirty tactics,"" blaming right-wing political opponents for the hacking. Both candidates' campaigns called on Venezuelans to await official results calmly earlier Sunday. But they also appeared to be bracing for a fight, with opposition leaders decrying what they said were election irregularities and Maduro's campaign vowing to defend the election results. Capriles said in a Twitter post that some officials want to change ""the desire expressed by the people."" Jorge Rodriguez, the head of Maduro's campaign, stressed that the election had been fair and called on Maduro's supporters to gather in front of the presidential palace. ""We will recognize the results, whatever they are,"" he said. ""And in this we say, that in the scenario that the anti-Chavista candidate wins by one vote, we will recognize it, but in the scenario that we win by at least one vote, we are going to defend this victory with the people of Venezuela."" CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Patricia Janiot and Paula Newton contributed to this report from Caracas.

"(CNN) -- The megayacht that Steve Jobs commissioned in the final years of his life has been impounded in Amsterdam after a payment dispute involving the designer, Philippe Starck. The Venus, a 100-million-euro ($137.5 million), 260-foot-long yacht, made its unofficial debut in late October. It's currently stuck in the Port of Amsterdam after Starck hired a debt-collection agency to attempt to remit the final payment for his design. According to lawyers at Ubik -- Starck's design company -- speaking with Reuters, the designer has only received 6 million of the 9-million-euro commission and is seeking the rest of the payment before the Venus will be released.

"(CNN) -- At least eight people were killed Sunday as the Pakistani Taliban continued to attack candidates in that country's upcoming elections, authorities said. The Pakistani Taliban, in a statement obtained by CNN, took responsibility for the bombings at the offices of candidates in Peshawar and the Orakzai Agency. The Taliban said it targeted secular candidates, but many parties have been hit by the increasing violence. ""A man cannot be secular and Muslim at a time. These are two different doctrines in nature,"" the statement said. The elections in May mark the first time in Pakistan's history that one democratically elected government will give way to another. The nation has experienced three military coups, been ruled by generals for half its life, and it remains mired in near-constant political turmoil. Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud has told Pakistanis to stay away from the elections. ""We are not in favor of democracy, democracy is for Jews and Christians,"" he said in recent propaganda video. ""They are intended to divide Muslims; we want the implementation of Sharia (law) and for that jihad is necessary,"" he added. Both attacks Sunday targeted independent candidates. Five people died and 22 were wounded by Sunday's explosion in Orakzai, said Dilawar Khan Bangish, police chief of the Kohat District. In Peshawar, three people were killed and eight wounded, said Khalid Mehmood Hamdani, a senior police official. The bombings follow three attacks Saturday and one Friday. The Pakistani Taliban are closely linked with the group's namesake in Afghanistan as well as with al Qaeda. It shares its religious extremist ideology -- but is its own distinct group that wants to replace the Pakistani government with an Islamist one. Elections are scheduled for May 11.

"Washington (CNN) -- Declaring the U.S. goal is a successful Iraq, President Barack Obama on Monday promised economic, diplomatic and military help to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki after the last American troops leave the Middle Eastern nation by the end of the year. The two leaders met at the White House and held a joint news conference to declare the eight-year war formally over now that U.S. troops are completing their withdrawal this month. They then proceeded to Arlington National Ceremony in Virginia for a solemn wreath-laying ceremony to pay respect to the war dead. Obama said the end of the Iraq war means a new chapter in U.S.-Iraq relations, with a focus now on a ""normal relationship between sovereign nations."" He told the visiting Iraqi prime minister the two nations will build ""a comprehensive partnership"" that includes trade relations, support for building up Iraq's democratic capacity and military-to-military ties aimed at helping Iraq rebuild its air force, which was destroyed in the war against Saddam Hussein's regime. ""Our goal is simply to make sure Iraq succeeds, because we think a successful, democratic Iraq can be a model for the entire region,"" Obama said. After the meeting, National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor announced the U.S. government's intention to sell 18 more F-16 fighter jets to Iraq, doubling the initial sale of 18 announced earlier this year. Al-Maliki said he is committed to building ties. ""The relationship will not end with the departure of the last American soldier,"" he said. At the same time, the Iraqi leader insisted his country now is completely reliant on its own security apparatus, with the help of training by U.S. and NATO forces. ""We have proven success. Nobody imagined that we would succeed in defeating terrorism and al Qaeda,"" al-Maliki said. Also Monday, NATO announced it is withdrawing training forces from Iraq by December 31. A NATO statement said ""robust negotiations"" on extending the NATO training mission failed to reach agreement. The unresolved issue was granting foreign forces immunity from local prosecution, officials said. The same issue stymied earlier talks between the Obama administration and al-Maliki's government about the possibility of some U.S. training forces staying longer than the deadline for withdrawal set in an agreement dating back to the Bush administration. Both Obama and al-Maliki have political reasons for ending the U.S. military presence. Obama pledged during his 2008 campaign to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq, while al-Maliki faces internal opposition to the foreign military presence. More than 4,400 U.S. troops were killed and thousands more were wounded in the war that began in 2003. Iraqi casualties are estimated to exceed 100,000. Some U.S. conservatives oppose the end of the Iraq operation, arguing that the withdrawal of American forces leaves Iraq vulnerable to political instability from internal forces and neighbors such as Iran. ""Domestic political considerations in each country have been allowed to trump our common security interests,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said in a statement. "" All of the progress that both Iraqis and Americans have made, at such painful and substantial cost, has now been put at greater risk. I hope I am wrong, but I fear I am not. It did not have to be this way, and the fact that it is has everything to do with a failure of vision, commitment and leadership both in Washington and Baghdad."" As of Sunday, 6,000 U.S. troops and four U.S. military bases remained in Iraq, according to Col. Barry Johnson, spokesman for the United States Forces in Iraq. The four bases are: . • Kalsu in Iskandariya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad . • Echo in Diwaniya, about 110 miles south of Baghdad . • Adder near Nasiriya, about 200 miles southeast of Baghdad . • Basra in Basra, about 340 miles southeast of Baghdad . Iraq faces many challenges as U.S. troops pull out, ranging from human rights issues to oil deals to national stability. Obama said Monday that the United States wants to help Iraq ""ramp up oil production"" and is ""helping to encourage international investments in that sector."" He also said some military-to-military ties will continue, similar to U.S. links with some other countries, and there ""may be occasion for joint exercises."" The U.S. goal ""is a sovereign Iraq that can protect its borders, protect its airspace, protect its people,"" Obama said. For his part, al-Maliki told reporters he requested military hardware from Obama, including the F-16s to help rebuild the air force. ""Definitely we have raised the issue of the Iraqi need for weapons for area protection, naval and ground protection,"" al-Maliki said. ""We have a lot of weapons, American weapons, and it requires trainers. And we received promises for cooperation from his excellency, the president, for some weapons that Iraq is asking for, especially those related to its protection of its airspace."" Some analysts fear that violence could spike in Iraq as groups struggle over power in the wake of the U.S. troop withdrawal, and that the decreased U.S. presence could allow Iran to increase its influence. Meghan O'Sullivan, a Bush administration deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan from 2004 to 2007, wrote that there is ""reason to worry"" in a recent analysis for Foreign Affairs posted on CNN's Global Public Square blog. ""The foundations of the Iraqi state remain shallow. Divisions within Iraq's ruling elite run deep,"" wrote O'Sullivan, now a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. ""A continued U.S. military presence would not have guaranteed peace and prosperity, but its removal increases the risks of failure in Iraq by eliminating the psychological backstop to a still delicate political system and by kicking open the door more widely to foreign interference."" American officials have insisted the drastic pullback of troops does not mean an end to the U.S. government's presence in Iraq. Hundreds of nonmilitary U.S. personnel will remain in Iraq, including 1,700 diplomats, law enforcement officers and economic, agriculture and other professionals and experts, according to the State Department. In addition, 5,000 security contractors will protect U.S. diplomats and another 4,500 contractors will serve other roles, such as helping provide food and medical services, until they can be done locally. Future U.S. involvement in training for Iraqi troops is also a possibility, U.S. officials have said. Officials and analysts have said the impact of the U.S. presence will echo for years to come. ""Iraqis, Americans and the world ultimately will judge us far more on the basis of what will happen than what has happened,"" Ryan Crocker, then-U.S. ambassador to Iraq, said in 2008 congressional testimony. ""In the end, how we leave and what we leave behind will be more important than how we came.""

"(CNN) -- This story is about a U.S. senator's alleged trips on a private plane to the Caribbean for sex parties with prostitutes. If it proves to be true, it would most likely topple a powerful politician and affect President Barack Obama's ability to pass legislation. If it is false, it would raise questions about how government watchdog groups and the media handle anonymous tipsters and their information. The senator is New Jersey's Robert Menendez, a 59-year-old divorced father of two who is set to become chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His Senate website calls Menendez ""a fighter for New Jersey families."" Menendez denied the story in a statement issued Wednesday by his Senate office: ""Any allegations of engaging with prostitutes are manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog and are false."" The ""right-wing blog"" Menendez is accusing of manufacturing the allegations is The Daily Caller, an online publication founded by conservative commentator Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel, a former adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney. The Daily Caller published its first reports on the allegations in early November just before the election. The stories were based on interviews with two women and a Dominican Republic official -- all unidentified. That prompted a denial then by the Democratic senator. He was easily re-elected. But the latest allegations are based on documents published by a ""non-partisan"" Washington watchdog group -- Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, known as CREW. It would be a stretch to call CREW ""right-wing,"" considering Executive Director Melanie Sloan served as minority counsel for the House Judiciary Committee under Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, before being hired by the Clinton Justice Department to be an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. In fact, a quick online search finds blogs accusing CREW of being a ""left-wing"" group. CREW published an e-mail this week it received last April from a man who identified himself as Peter Williams. ""My duty as a U.S. citizen obligates me to report what I consider to be a grave violation of the most fundamental codes of conduct that a politician of my country must follow,"" the tipster wrote. E-mails sent by Williams included statements from women detailing what they said were sex parties in a house and on a yacht in the Dominican Republic owned by Dr. Salomon Melgen, a south Florida ophthalmologist. One e-mail purported to include a statement from a woman who said she was paid to have sex with the senator several times when she worked for ""the Doll Palace"" escort service in the spring of 2009. Prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic, but only if the prostitute is 18 or older. Williams suggested that he and the women ""will be willing to testify"" about the allegations if their safety was guaranteed. His e-mail to CREW said he became aware of the alleged behavior while traveling in the Dominican Republic for ""personal and business reasons"" starting in 2008. CREW said it passed the ""numerous"" Williams e-mail exchanges on to the Justice Department and the FBI in July 2012, after the group was ""unable to independently verify the truth of the allegations."" But 10 months after the first contact with Williams, Sloan told CNN her group now has doubts about Williams' identity, motives and veracity. ""This unnamed source said he has had this information about Sen. Menendez as early as 2008, yet he didn't come forward until four years later, right before Sen. Menendez was up for re-election,"" Sloan said. ""Further, this source refused to ever speak by phone to us, with other news organizations, or with the FBI, so, those two facts combined to seriously undermine his credibility."" CNN efforts to reach Williams through the e-mail address used to contact CREW have been unanswered. It is not known whether the FBI succeeded in talking directly to Williams, but there was a very public indication this week that the agency is investigating Melgen. Agents were seen carrying boxes from his Palm Beach, Florida, office Wednesday. An FBI spokesman in Florida confirmed there was ""law enforcement activity"" at the location where the search occurred but did not mention Melgen or anyone else and did not explain what agents were investigating. In 2011, the Internal Revenue Service hit Melgen with an $11 million tax lien. ""The government has not informed Dr. Melgen what concerns it may have, his lawyer Dean L. Willbur Jr. told CNN in an e-mail Thursday. ""We are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times. Additionally, any issues concerning Dr. Melgen and the IRS have been fully resolved and satisfied."" Menendez calls Melgen a friend and political supporter. He acknowledged flying on the eye doctor's plane three times to the Dominican Republic in 2010, trips that he said were ""paid for and reported appropriately."" One of the trips involved official travel for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which he chairs, while the other two were personal trips, Menendez's spokeswoman Patricia Enright said. The senator is not required to publicly disclose information concerning personal travel, she said. The senator made a payment of $58,500 from his personal funds to Melgen's company on January 4 for the full operating costs of the two flights Menendez took in August and September 2010 to the Dominican Republic, Enright said. It was an ""oversight"" on the part of the senator not to have paid for the flights at the time he took them, she said. New Jersey state Sen. Sam Thompson, a Republican, sent a complaint to the Senate Ethics Committee in November calling for an investigation, saying Menendez may have violated Senate ethics by ""repeatedly flying on a private jet to the Dominican Republic and other locations ... and soliciting prostitutes."" Thompson said he did not hear back from the Ethics Committee. At an event in Washington on Thursday night, when asked by CNN whether be violated Senate finance rules, Menendez said, ""These are nameless, faceless, anonymous allegations. You should find out from them."" The Senate Ethics Committee said it could not comment. Enright said the senator assumes the committee is reviewing the matter, but he has not been contacted. CNN asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday whether he thought Menendez was handling the controversy properly. ""First of all, Bob Menendez is my friend,"" Sen. Reid said. ""He is an outstanding senator. He is now the new chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. Any questions in this regard direct to him. I don't know anything about it."" ""I think the issue of the trips alone are probably not enough to suggest that he doesn't have the right to assume the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee,"" Sloan said. ""I think if all the allegations together prove to be true, that would certainly suggest questions about Sen. Menendez's fitness for the chairmanship and perhaps even his position in the Senate."" The executive director for CREW, which sent the Williams e-mails to the FBI, said people should ""withhold judgment given the many questions about the source of these allegations and the timing of these allegations. I think the best thing is to wait for the FBI to investigate and figure out what really happened here, if Sen. Menendez did something wrong and if not, who's really behind this effort to smear him."" If this story evolves into a scandal and Menendez is forced to resign, the Democrats' majority in the Senate would likely get one vote thinner. New Jersey law allows Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, to appoint an interim senator until a special election, which would be no sooner than November. CNN's Jim Acosta, Ted Barrett, Adriana Hauser and Joe Johns contributed to this report.","Sen. Robert Menendez denies allegation he hired prostitutes .

Wait, what?

"(CNN) -- Myanmar has formed an internal commission to investigate the recent sectarian violence that killed dozens in the western part of the country, state media reported. The June clashes between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine killed at least 62 people and displaced thousands. President Thein Sein's commission is made up of various groups, including activists, officials from minority parties, entrepreneurs, government leaders and religious leaders, The New Light of Myanmar said Saturday. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon applauded the move. ""This commission is comprised of a representative cross-section of national figures in the country,"" Ban said in a statement. ""It could make important contributions to restoring peace and harmony in the state and in creating a conducive environment for a more inclusive way forward to tackle the underlying causes of the violence, including the condition of the Muslim communities in Rakhine."" The international community has welcomed Sein's commitment to introducing political reforms in Myanmar since assuming leadership last year. Sein has highlighted the need to form an independent commission that does not include foreigners. Violence between Buddhists and Muslims erupted after police detained three Muslim men in relation to the rape and killing of a Buddhist woman in May. Two of the men were sentenced to death, and a third man committed suicide in detention. News of the crime may have motivated several hundred people to attack a bus in Rakhine in June, killing 10 Muslims onboard, state media said. Violence between Buddhists and Muslims spread across the northern part of the state, resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes, according to the government. The national government declared a state of emergency in Rakhine, bringing in the military to help restore order. Rakhine is home to the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority group that says it was persecuted by the Myanmar military during decades of authoritarian rule. At the height of the violence, hundreds of Rohingyas tried to cross the border into neighboring Bangladesh to flee the sectarian violence. But Bangladeshi authorities have turned them back, saying they already have too many Rohingya refugees. The unrest has tested the efforts of Sein's administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance.

"(CNN) -- He's enjoyed unprecedented success off the court, now Roger Federer has helped pave the way for some major changes at the U.S Open. As president of the ATP Player Council, the 17-time grand slam champion, from Switzerland, has helped to negotiated a hike in prize money to $50 million by 2017, nearly double the figure in 2012. The United States Tennis Association (USTA) confirmed the tournament -- the season's final major -- will also rejig its schedule to ensure the men's semifinals are played on Friday with the final reverting to Sunday by 2015. It marks the culmination of a year's worth of discussions with the game's top players, led by Federer, but also including world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. ""The [USTA] approached our concerns with a true spirit of partnership, and as president of the ATP Player Council I am personally grateful for their support,"" five-time U.S. Open winner Roger Federer said in a statement on the tournament's official website. ""The U.S. Open is very special, and we all look forward to great competition at Flushing Meadows later this year, and in the years yet to come."" Under the terms of the five-year deal with the men's ATP Tour and the women's WTA Tour, the tournament will now have a 2013 prize purse of $33.6 million -- a record $8.1 million increase from 2012. Grass roots tennis will also see a boost in funding and Flushing Meadows in New York, which hosts the competition, will also be revamped, with a new Louis Armstrong Stadium and Grandstand. ""We welcome the commitment the USTA has made concerning player prize money at the U.S. Open through 2017,"" said Brad Drewett, ATP executive chairman and president. ""These increases are the largest in the history of the sport, representing a significant step forward in truly recognizing the input the players have in the success of the U.S. Open. ""We also welcome the decision from the USTA to adopt a schedule with the men's semifinals completed by Friday and the final on Sunday, from 2015 onwards."" The USTA announced in December 2012 it was moving the women's final back to Sunday and the men's final to Monday to allow the players more rest time. Poor weather in recent years has seen the men's final take place on a Monday for the past five years, with some players having to play their semifinal and final on consecutive days. But though the schedule will remain in place for the next two installments, by 2015 the U.S. Open will come into the line with the other majors and become a 14-day tournament. ""We applaud the USTA's long-term commitment to increased and fair compensation for our athletes,"" said Stacey Allaster, WTA chairman and CEO. ""For 40 years the USTA has been a leader for equality and for women's tennis, and today's announcement is a testament to their continued bold vision for the sport."" Recently, the game's top male players, like Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, called for more stringent drug testing, prompting the International Tennis Federation to announce they were introducing biological profiling into the sport. ""The USTA has a long-term vision in place to ensure that tennis continues to thrive in the United States,"" said David Haggerty, USTA chairman and president. ""This vision encompasses every level of the sport, from energizing existing fans, to attracting new players, to ensuring the U.S. Open remains one of the world's most prestigious sporting events. ""With this unprecedented commitment to long-term prize money and recognition of the value that players bring to the sport, we will gain stability for the sport so that we can focus our energy on growing the game and ensuring tennis' vitality in the U.S. for years to come.""","U.S. Open announces a rise in tournament prize money to $50 million from 2017 .

"(CNN) -- Syria's opposition opened an embassy Wednesday in Doha, Qatar, a day after Arab League representatives meeting there allowed the rebels to take Syria's seat at the summit. The embassy is the first for the Syrian National Coalition, which has been recognized by more than 100 nations as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people. Other coalition ambassadors -- in Paris, London, Washington and the representative to the Gulf Cooperation Council countries all operate without a formal embassy building, according to Sarah Karkour with the coalition's media office. The coalition is taking over the embassy building that formerly housed the diplomatic representatives of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, which lashed out Wednesday at the Arab League's decision to seat rebel leaders at the summit. The government said the Arab League was in violation of its own charter for its decision to seat ""an illegitimate party and raise a flag other than the Syrian national flag,"" the state-run SANA news agency reported.

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi is just two goals behind Diego Maradona's international total of 34 after guiding Argentina ever closer to qualifying for next year's World Cup in Brazil. The four-time World Player of the Year netted from the penalty spot as Argentina eased to a 3-0 win over Venezuela as it remained four points clear at the top of the South American group. Real Madrid's Gonzalo Higuain scored twice to take him to 10 goals for the qualifying campaign, but it was Messi who stole the show once again. The 25-year-old has repeatedly vowed to win the one prize to have eluded him so far in his astonishing career- the World Cup. Not since 1986 when Maradona led Argentina to glory has the country won the tournament -- a statistic that Messi is desperate to change. After an incredible 2012 where he scored 91 goals for club and country, surpassing the previous record of 85 by Germany's Gerd Muller, Messi looks set to break new ground once again. This season alone he has scored 61 goals in 51 matches for club and country with 55 of those coming in 43 matches for Barcelona and six in eight appearances for Argentina. Messi still has a way to go until he passes Gabriel Batistuta, who holds Argentina's all-time record with 56 goals from 78 matches. But his priority is success in Brazil next year -- a target which is looking eminently possible. ""We have a forward line that can be considered among the best in the world,"" Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella told reporters. ""Venezuela are a tough team, very compact, who know what they want. What happened was that Argentina played very well, especially in the first half and were very superior."" Messi will hope to move past Maradona on Tuesday when Argentina head to the high altitude city of La Paz to face a Bolivia side which won its last meeting between the two 6-1. Elsewhere, Colombia looks set to end its 16-year wait to play in a World Cup after thrashing Bolivia 5-0. MacNelly Torres gave Colombia a first half lead with Carlos Valdez, Teofilo Guttierez, Radamel Falcao and Pablo Armero all scoring after the break. Jose Pekerman's side is four points adrift of leader Argentina but has played a game less. Liverpool's Luis Suarez hit his eighth goal of the qualifying campaign to help Uruguay secure a 1-1 draw against Paraguay to leave it in fourth position. Peru, which has not played at a World Cup since 1982, remains in the hunt following a 1-0 win against Chile following Jefferson Farfan's strike.","Lionel Messi scored his 32nd international goal to help Argentina defeat Venezuela .

"(CNN) -- While the French offensive to flush out Islamists in northern Mali dominated media coverage this week, news from other African nations certainly hasn't stopped. Here are five other stories you might have missed: . 'State funeral' for hundreds of Kenyan lawmakers . Throngs of Kenyans wearing black marched down the streets, coffins perched on their shoulders, crooning altered dirges in a mock funeral for lawmakers. When the march came to a halt outside parliament offices in downtown Nairobi, hundreds of caskets lay charred, a defiant message against a recent hefty retirement package lawmakers passed for themselves. The Kenyan president rejected the package, which included a bonus of $110,000 each and a state funeral for lawmakers, an honor reserved for presidents and high achievers. The mock caskets were a spoof on the state funerals. Major newspapers in the nation heaped praises on the president and criticized the lawmakers, who had attempted to pass another retirement package in October. ""Africa's big men behaving badly,"" an editorial in the Daily Nation newspaper screamed. ""Drama as civil society members bury greedy MPs,"" a story in the Standard read. Good news for Mubarak . Former President Hosni Mubarak, once a powerful figure in Egyptian politics, will get a new trial after an appeals court tossed out his life sentence. A judge overturned his conviction for failing to stop the killing of hundreds during the uprising in 2011. He will remain in prison as he awaits his next court date, likely in April. Compared to the defiant riots that erupted during his trial in June, Egyptians appeared to welcome the news Sunday with shrugged shoulders. During the trial, both sides lunged at one another in court as fiery supporters and foes clashed outside. The nation has spent the last year mired in protests, prompting the Economist to describe it as a ""Dilemocracy."" 20 years and over $1B later, U.S. recognizes Somalia . After pouring more than $1 billion in aid to Somalia, the United States officially recognized the nation's government for the first time in more than two decades. American officials have not recognized it since warlords toppled dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and mayhem nationwide. Two years later, militants shot down Black Hawk helicopters and killed American forces attempting to raid a warlord in the capital of Mogadishu. U.S. applauded Somalia's progress, citing its first democratically-elected government and its successful efforts to push out al Qaeda-linked militants. ""We provided more than $650 million in assistance to the African Union Mission in Somalia, more than $130 million to Somalia's security forces,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. ""In the past two years, we've given nearly $360 million in emergency humanitarian assistance and more than $45 million in development-related assistance to help rebuild Somalia's economy. "" Global uncertainty amid Algerian hostage crisis . Algerian forces stormed a gas facility to free foreign hostages without warning other governments, leaving leaders in a series of capitals scrambling to get information on their citizens' fates. Heavily armed fighters attacked the remote BP facility in the desert this week, holding workers from various nations hostages. Attackers said the raid was a result of the French offensive against Islamist militants in northern Mali. Captives included Americans, Japanese and Britons. Hours after the raid, it was unclear how many hostages had been let go, killed or still held captive. Analysts say Algeria raided the complex to salvage its tough military's reputation after militants attacked with security forces nearby. ""The temptation to show its strength first and foremost must have been overwhelming for a regime that showed as little weakness in the face of the Arab Spring,"" the Telegraph's Richard Spencer said. The nation has a massive military budget, which makes it influential in stabilizing the region, Anouar Boukhars, a scholar in the Carnegie Endowment's Middle East program, said in an editorial in The New York Times. Roaring success for South African musician . Your African culture may be your ticket to Hollywood, according to a famous South African musician. Lebo M put his stamp on ""The Lion King,"" his powerful opening vocal sequence contributing to its appeal as a popular culture phenomenon. More than two decades later, the singer and songwriter still has a passion for what he does. His arrangements captured the spirit of Africa -- and the politics in his home country at the time. ""That's the hardest thing to do right now -- to tell young people in Nigeria, in Johannesburg, in Ghana that the African in you is your ticket to Hollywood,"" he said this week. Before he got the gig, the movie's producers scoured his hometown of Soweto, looking for him. ""They looked all over,"" Lebo said.

"(CNN) -- A controversial photography exhibit called ""In the Playroom"" depicts young children reenacting tragic and violent historical events, including the September 11 attacks and the abuse of inmates at Iraq's infamous Abu Ghraib prison. The artist, Jonathan Hobin, says his work is an attempt to reflect on modern events that affect children and prompt dialogue about ""issues in our world."" But the photos have also drawn criticism from those who say Hobin's use of artistic license involving children crosses an ethical boundary. ""Some of it is appropriate,"" said psychiatrist Alvin Poussaint. ""But I don't know that it's appropriate to put a scarf around a girl's neck like she's going to be strangled with out really understanding what that's about."" Poussaint was referring to one of Hobin's photographs in which a young girl is depicted as slain 6-year-old JonBenet . Ramsey, who was found dead in the basement of her Colorado home in 1996 after being strangled. The image portrays the girl dressed in beauty pageant attire while holding a mauve-colored scarf around her neck. Poussaint said he commended the photographs for their portrayal of events that affect children, but cautioned that the children likely ""didn't understand what they were doing."" He also warned against placing young children in situations that could potentially traumatize or frighten them, cautioning that the effects of traumatic events commonly surface later in life. But Hobin defended his work, arguing that ""media is so pervasive its almost inescapable"" and the exhibit . endeavored to show how these events are ""part of our culture."" ""We have to acknowledge it,"" he said. Others aren't so sure. One photograph, called ""The Twins,"" shows two young boys staring directly into the camera in a playroom designed to look like a scene from the September 11 attacks at the World Trade Center in New York. In the scene, a boy is shown holding a toy plane, while the other child holds a toy fire engine crane in front of a building made to look like its ablaze. Another image shows a hooded child on box with phony electrodes attached to his fingers in a scene that portrays an Abu Ghraib prisoner. Next to him shows a near naked boy, handcuffed beside a stuffed animal of a dog. Hobin's exhibit was first unveiled in September at a gallery in Ottawa, Canada, and was shot with the approval of the children's parents, he said. CNN spoke with one parent who said she allowed her child to be photographed, but could not immediately reach the parents of the other children.","Exhibit ""In the Playroom"" depicts young children re-enacting violent events .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- Australia's most senior Catholic has urged the government of Victoria not to change the state's laws to allow the victims of sex abuse at the hands of clergy to seek higher compensation than currently available. Cardinal George Pell said this would amount to discrimination against the Australian Catholic Church. This comes after a tumultuous week in which the victims of church sex abuse heard Cardinal Pell acknowledge the church had covered up the abuse of minors, out of fear the scandal would envelope the faith. Pell was this week, the final witness in a state government enquiry into the responses to the allegations of child sex abuse by religious and non-government institutions in the state of Victoria. The cardinal also apologized for the abuse. While denying he had personally covered up offenses committed by priests within the large Melbourne archdiocese over which he presided from 1996 to 2011, Pell said his predecessor, Archbishop Frank Little, now deceased, had destroyed documents to protect priests. ""The primary motivation would have been to respect the reputation of the church. There was a fear of scandal,"" Cardinal Pell told the enquiry, which is expected to deliver its report to the Victorian government at the end of September. Cardinal Pell also admitted that the cover-ups had allowed pedophile priests to continue to prey on young children. ''I would have to say there is significant truth in that,'' Pell said, while also admitting the Australian church had been slow to understand and deal with the damage, and oftentimes the destruction of the lives of the victims. ''Many in the church did not understand just what damage was being done to the victims. We understand that better now,'' he said. ''If we'd been gossips, which we weren't, we would have realized earlier just how widespread this business was.'' The Australian premier, Julia Gillard, last year called a wide-ranging, nationwide enquiry into child sex abuse, though it is not confined to the Catholic Church. The investigation found that, in Victoria alone, there have been 600 cases of child sex abuse at the hands of Catholic clergy since the 1930s. ""There have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil,"" said Gillard when she announced the Royal Commission. Among the many cases reported by CNN when the Royal Commission was announced was that of Melbourne sisters Emma and Katie Foster who were assaulted by their local parish priest, Kevin O'Donnell, now deceased. Emma was just five years old when the rapes began. Katie was younger, her parents believe probably around four. O'Donnell was convicted of the sexual assault of 12 victims, according to the victims lobby group Broken Rites. The court was told he had offended consistently from 1946 until he was brought before the courts in 1995. When Emma heard news of his conviction, she was 14 and began self-harming. ""We saw her with blood pouring out of her wrists taking heroin to dull the pain."" the girls' father, Anthony Foster told CNN last year. Emma took her own life when she was 26. When her sister Katie turned 14, she became cognizant of the sexual abuse she had suffered and told her parents. She began binge drinking. ""She was at a friend's house,"" Foster said. ""She was drunk, crossed the road and was hit by car. ""She has severe brain injuries. She has pre-accident memory. But she can't run her life,"" he explained. Kevin O'Donnell was never charged with the sex abuse of the Foster sisters. Foster said he died before charges could be laid. He and his wife Chrissy sat at the Victorian Inquiry this week to hear Pell's evidence. ""It comes down to a question of restitution of lives,"" Foster told CNN. ""And this doesn't just happen with an apology. It requires much, much more than that. It requires whatever victims need to improve the quality of their lives and there should be no limitations on compensation."" The Victoria Archdiocese, under Pell's leadership, capped compensation at A$75,000 (U.S.$72,000) per victim, along with ongoing counseling and treatment. During his evidence to the Victorian enquiry, Pell admitted the compensation cap was low compared to that offered to victims of Catholic clergy abuse in the United States. At the same time, he acknowledged the enormous wealth of the Australian church and added it would ""pay whatever the law recommends is appropriate compensation."" For Foster, this reflects poorly on the Australian church. ""He was basically saying the church will change if the government tells it to,"" he said. ""A lot of what's been done is driven by the business side of the church and the Catholic Church is a large business."" Nor does Pell's admission that the church had covered up the abuse bring solace or closure. ""No, there is no closure,"" he told CNN. ""We knew there'd been a cover-up. All of Australia knew that. We had a feeling of disappointment because we expected more, but all that happened was he said the things we already knew. He offered no more."" And Foster fears the church's response to child sex abuse is still driven by fear of reputational damage. ""I think the avoidance of scandal is still what drives it along with the minimization of the financial effect,"" he said. He says the Australian Catholic Church is a fractured organization able to deflect responsibility to individual dioceses and orders. The Australian church is comprised of 33 diocese, 7 archdiocese and 175 religious orders. ""It would be useful if there was some reform of the church to the point that there is someone or somebody responsible for all branches of the church,"" he said. ""It is almost a state of anarchy in the church; no one is responsible for anything other than in their sector. We have the Australian Bishops Council, which is close and they can agree to common forms of process. But there is very much a reliance on individual orders and diocese doing the right thing,"" said Foster. Nor, says Foster, has the church been pro-active is investigating those priests against whom allegations have been made, and sometimes proven. ""The church could have at least started to investigate backwards from the claims they received. They only ever reacted to a claim. The church has never proactively looked at what the (reported) priests were doing and what access the pedophile priests had to kids. Every one of the victims had gone to the church for help. None were the church going out to look for them."" In his evidence to the enquiry, Pell said the church's organizational structure was such that, indeed, no single individual could be held accountable. ""I'm not the Catholic Prime Minister of Australia. I am not the general manager Australia. The Catholic Church is. . . a very interesting example of a flat organization,"" he said. He admitted that, in some cases, the Catholic Church had placed priests above the law, but he denied the church had ignored claims brought before it, despite evidence that concerns about O'Donnell had been raised as far back as 1946. ""I think many persons in the leadership of the Church, I don't think they knew what a horrendous widespread [issue] we were sitting on,"" he said. For the Fosters, Pell's apology and admissions are too little, too late. His surviving daughter Katie remains highly dependent on care to live. ""Katie is a shell of what she should be"" Foster said. ""She has 24-hour care and always needs someone looking after her. She can't remember anything. She has no idea what she is doing in ten minutes time. She can't work."" But recently, the family has had good news. Katie Foster is engaged to be married and recently has begun the slow process of learning how to walk again, 15 years after the accident that followed her realization of the abuse she suffered. ""We are incredibly pleased and fortunate that through the care teams she has had, she has met someone and is engaged. But it's not like it should have been,"" Foster said. However, the damage to Katie's life and that of her parents, will linger. ""The question of children has been a major one because it is not fair on the child,"" said her father. ""The child would be cared for by her carer. But it is her decision.""","Top Australian Catholic spoke at inquiry into allegations of institutional child sex abuse .

"(CNN) -- As British Prime Minister David Cameron called on footballers to act as role models, Liverpool's Luis Suarez chose not to appeal his 10-match ""biting"" ban handed to him by the English Football Association for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic. Earlier this week the Uruguayan striker was hit with the sanction by the English Football Association for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic following the ruling of an Independent Regulatory Commission. The ban's severity sparked fierce criticism from the Liverpool hierarchy. The ban will start with immediate effect, meaning Suarez will play no part in Liverpool's four remaining Premier League matches with the Uruguayan also ruled out for the start of next season. ""Liverpool forward Luis Suarez has not appealed the suspension issued to him by an Independent Regulatory Commission this week,"" read an FA statement released on Friday. ""The FA intends to publicize the Independent Regulatory Commission's written reasons in due course."" Suarez issued a statement of contrition via his personal website where he once again apologized for his actions. ""I know that all the things that are happening to me in England will help me to improve my conduct on the field,"" said the 26-year-old, who could still yet win the Professional Footballers' Association Player of the Year award, after an outstanding season for Liverpool. ""Whilst 10 games is clearly greater than those bans given in past cases where player have actually been seriously injured, I acknowledge that my actions were not acceptable on the football pitch so I do not want to give the wrong impression to people by making an appeal. ""I really want to learn from what has happened in the last two-and-a-half years, many things have been said and written about me, I just tried to do my best on the field."" In the aftermath of Sunday's game Liverpool condemned Suarez's actions and fined the player, but the club expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the punishment meted out to their 23-goal top scorer. ""The charges against Luis were his to consider and we have to respect his decision to not appeal the 10-game ban,"" Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre said in a statement released by the club. ""Luis is an important member of our team and nothing has changed in that regard. ""We are committed to helping him improve his conduct and he will be given our full support. We look forward to him returning to the team next season when he is available for selection."" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers echoed Ayre's sentiments and praised the form Suarez has shown this season. ""Luis has made a huge contribution to the squad this season and we respect his decision to accept the ban,"" said the Northern Irish coach. ""He will be missed for the remainder of this season and the early part of next, but we will have the opportunity to welcome a better person and player when he returns."" Rodgers had earlier sprang to Suarez's defense, suggesting the player had been unfairly targeted and that he would understand if he felt he needed to leave English football. ""This is a guy who I see on a daily basis trying very hard. His two passions in life are his family and Liverpool Football Club,"" the Northern Irish coach told a press conference ahead of Saturday's match against Newcastle United. ""He loves this country and being here. If I'm Luis Suarez sitting at home with my wife and family, who absolutely love it here -- they love life in Liverpool and learning the language -- it's arguable he will never have a better season than he has had this. ""Yet he has still come under this scrutiny and criticism. ""That will make you think, no question. But in a couple of days' time when he is more reflective, because there is a shock and anger at the moment, a sense of reality will set in."" For a second time this week, Cameron weighed in on the debate over Suarez's bite on Friday. ""As a dad and as a human being, do I think we should have tough penalties when football players behave like this? Yes,"" the British Prime Minister told BBC Radio 5 Live. This is not the first time the Uruguayan striker has been sanctioned for a bite. Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by Dutch football authorities in 2010 for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakal while playing for Ajax. Last season he was hit with an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.","Liverpool's Luis Suarez will not appeal 10-match ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic .

"Rome (CNN) -- After months of political uncertainty and economic crisis, the lower house of Italy's parliament gave Prime Minister Enrico Letta's new government a vote confidence on Monday. Letta received support from lawmakers in a 453-153 lower house vote. Lawmakers in the upper house, the Senate, are scheduled to vote on Tuesday. Letta was sworn in on Sunday -- the same day a gunman shot and wounded two national police officers outside the prime minister's office. But Letta was being sworn in at the presidential palace a short distance away and was not present at the time of the shooting, state-run news agency ANSA said. Italy has been hampered by political uncertainty since February, when elections left none of the candidates with enough support to form a government. Letta, a center-left politician, has 18 ministers -- two of whom are members of the center-right People of Freedom Party led by three-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Nearly all the others are members of Letta's Democratic Party or people close to it. Letta said last week that the most important priority is tackling the country's 11.6% unemployment rate, which has pushed many young Italians to leave the country. The second most pressing issue facing Italy is the need for political reform, he said. Constitutional changes are needed to reduce the number of members of parliament and fix an electoral system that has kept the country locked in a political stalemate it can't afford, he said. ""We need to do this together with the largest participation possible,"" he said. He also said the European Union's policy of austerity needs to change.","NEW: In a confidence vote, Italy's lower house confirms the new prime minister's government .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The world has at least 1,453 billionaires, with about half of those residing in the U.S. and China, according to the Hurun Global Rich List. In terms of cities, Moscow is home to the greatest number of billionaires with 76, followed by New York (70), Hong Kong (52), Beijing (41) and London (40). ""For every billionaire that Hurun Report has found, I estimate we have missed at least two, meaning that today there are probably 4,000 billionaires in the world,"" said Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of Hurun Report, a Shanghai-based publishing group that tracks China's wealthy. ""Asia is home to the lion's share of billionaires on the planet with 608 individuals, followed by North America with 440 billionaires and Europe 324,"" said the report. ""By country, the US was home to 409 billionaires, comfortably ahead of the 317 from China."" The billionaires on the list account for $5.5 trillion in personal wealth -- equivalent to the GDP of China, the world's second richest country, according to the report. ""This past year has seen a rebound in the wealth of private sector,"" it stated. ""Stock markets in the U.S. have risen and the U.S. dollar has gotten stronger, rising against the Brazilian real by 19%, Indian rupee by 12% and Japanese yen by 6%, making it harder for locals to make the cut-off."" Still, most billionaires on the list have companies listed on China's stock exchanges (212) rather than U.S. exchanges (211), despite Chinese markets underperforming in recent years. Three out of four billionaires in the Hurun List are self-made, with real estate, telecommunications, media and technology and retail leading industries that produce the super-rich.

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities said Monday that they've spotted a troubling immigration trend: large numbers of migrants abandoned at sea by traffickers. Every month, Mexico's navy says it rescues about 150 stranded migrants, left adrift in overloaded boats off the country's Pacific coast. As part of the scam, officials said in a statement, traffickers tell the migrants that there has been an equipment failure and promise to return but never do. The immigration and maritime authorities said the frequency of that approach -- about 10 or 12 times per month -- inspired them to issue a warning on Monday: ""Do not allow yourself to be fooled and put your life at risk by leaving it in the hands of people without scruples whose only goal is obtaining money without caring about the lives of other human beings."" Authorities have long warned of the dangers of illegal border crossings, often focusing on perilous desert treks by land. And in the past five years, maritime border crossings into the United States have become a ""new frontier,"" said David Shirk, a professor of political science at San Diego State University and an expert on Mexico and border security. ""It's a reflection of the fact that is has become significantly more difficult to cross the border by land,"" he said. That means the Border Patrol and the U.S. Coast Guard will likely need more resources, he said, ""to address not only the illegal activity, but also the different kinds of risks that implies for people who are putting themselves in that situation."" ""We're likely to see a dramatic increase now in drownings and other kinds of water fatalities and other kinds of danger associated with crossing in the water,"" he said. The statement from Mexican authorities on Monday suggests that attempted border crossings by boat are drawing increasing concern. But it isn't a new phenomenon. In 2009, U.S. officials said Mexicans smuggling drugs and migrants into the United States were increasingly turning to the Pacific Ocean for a short sail to the California coast. ""We've seen a huge spike in smuggling by water,"" Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in San Diego, said in 2009. Despite the dangers of border crossings, new figures released by the Pew Research Center on Monday indicate that more than a third of Mexicans surveyed say they would move to the United States if they could. In a national opinion survey of 1,000 Mexicans conducted last month, more than 60% said they would not move to the United States even if they had the means and opportunity to do so, but a ""a sizable minority"" of 35% said they would move to the United States if they could. And 20% said they would emigrate without authorization, according to Pew. Immigration is expected to be one of the topics on the table when U.S. President Barack Obama travels to Mexico this week. CNNMexico.com and CNN's Arthur Brice, Rene Hernandez and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","NEW: Expert: Maritime crossings into the United States have become a ""new frontier""

"(CNN) -- Last week's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, appears to have at least temporarily changed the debate on gun control and opened the door to new restrictions. Following up on his pledge to ""use whatever power this office holds"" to prevent another slaughter at a school, President Barack Obama has said he will submit new gun-restriction proposals to Congress in January. But the obstacles to progress remain formidable, chief among them the political power of the gun-rights lobby in Washington. Yet we don't have to wait until the national gun-control debate plays out to better protect our children from violence at school. What really makes schools safer? We can begin now in our elementary and secondary schools by starting a campaign to eliminate the number of lethal weapons that students bring to campus. Despite laws against them and some progress in reducing their numbers, weapons on campus continue to be a major problem. Over the past decade, various government agencies have surveyed millions of students across the nation about weapons in schools, and, year after year, they have told us that they have seen guns and knives on campus and have been threatened by them at school. Alarmingly, a sizable minority don't disapprove of them being on school grounds. The presence of weapons and toleration of them on campus create the potential for more pain and suffering in the nation's schools. According to the most recent federal statistics, there were 33 school-associated violent deaths from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. Opinion: Not man enough? Buy a gun . ""Nationwide,"" reports the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Youth Risk Behavior Survey, ""5.4% of students had carried a weapon (e.g., a gun, knife or club) on school property on at least one day during the 30 days before the survey."" Data from the 2009-2011 California Healthy Kids Survey, the most recent, show a horrifying number of weapons-packing students. About 5% of secondary-school students said they carried a firearm to campus, while another 10% reported bringing knives and other potentially lethal weapons during the past year. Stunningly, about 3% of fifth-graders reported that they brought a weapon to school. Taken together, the surveys suggest that hundreds of thousands of potentially lethal weapons are being smuggled onto the nation's school grounds -- and students may be using them for self-protection but also to threaten their classmates. Around 8% of secondary-school students in California and nationally report such threats in recent surveys, a percentage that has stayed basically unchanged since 1993. Even if not directly threatened with a weapon, many students are nonetheless aware of the presence of guns and knives on their campus. For about a decade now, about one-quarter to one-third of students in California public schools (both elementary and secondary) and other states have reported such awareness. Readers share: 10 ways to put brakes on mass shootings in schools . In past decades, schools have installed metal detectors, hired extra security to patrol grounds and hallways and instituted other zero-tolerance measures to make campuses safer. But a report released by a zero-tolerance task force assembled and published by the American Psychological Association in 2008 concluded there was no evidence that these measures were effective in making students and staff feel safer. And they can be self-defeating: It's tough to learn or feel cared for in a prison-like setting. So what to do? For starters, we should listen to what the students are telling us in the surveys. Yes, listen, because few in our schools, communities and government are. How can you reduce weapons in schools if you do not know what students think about guns in school and you have no clear idea of just how prevalent the problem is? Step one is for teachers and principals to use the survey results from their own states -- in California the data is available online -- to open discussions with students and parents about the presence of weapons on campus and their potential use as a threat. The many students in California and other states who think there's nothing wrong with weapons being in students' backpacks need to learn that what they may see in society at large -- the presence of guns in many places -- is unacceptable on school grounds. Opinion: Teachers with guns is a crazy idea . As important as changing their attitudes toward weapons on campus is providing students with anonymous ways to let authorities know about a potential threat. Schools that have created such channels of communication report that the information has thwarted many incidents over the past decade. The best prevention of student-instigated violence on campus is an educated, well-trained and caring school community in which everyone understands what to do when they see a weapon on campus and why it might save lives to act. We can begin to build such a community by talking with students in each classroom and each school about what they see, hear and experience while at school.

"(CNN) -- It's never easy when you get that phone call, even when you've known for years that it might be coming. But on Friday, I got the call that someone I loved had died. Just five days earlier, my friend Marci and I had been making plans for our kids to go trick-or-treating together, and now she's gone. I can't write that Marci Smith lost her battle with brain cancer, because Marci hated that phrase. Her husband, Tim, thinks she just didn't like the concept of losing at anything. Actually, in my book, she beat cancer. Her disease was diagnosed when she was 43, when her son Joshua was 3 years old. Her doctor told her that statistically speaking, she had three to six months to live. That was in February 2007. She beat cancer not just in the length of the time she survived, but in how she lived these last 4Â½ years. As the cancer invaded Marci's brain and the chemotherapy poisoned her body, her spirit remained clean. She never expressed anger to me that she got cancer at such a young age and with such a young child, even though she certainly would have been entitled to. It's not that Marci sugar-coated her illness: Tim remembers she was scared when she got the diagnosis, and she talked to me and her other friends about the brain surgeries and the awful side effects of the chemo. But Marci lived full speed ahead until she couldn't live anymore. She knew cancer would ultimately end her life, but she didn't let it ruin the life she had left. ""She was such a happy, positive person,"" Tim told me after her death. ""She just wanted to enjoy every minute she had left. She never wanted to talk about 'what happens if I die.' "" Instead, Marci planned for life. She'd always wanted to visit all 50 states, and so over the past four years, she and Tim and Joshua visited the states she hadn't been to yet. She wanted to see Israel and Scotland, too, and the three of them took trips there. When a teenage family member needed her help, she took him into her home, since helping family and friends meant everything to her. Marci taught me so much about living, and so much about being a smart patient. She was one of the first people I wrote about when I started the Empowered Patient column shortly after her diagnosis, and our frequent discussions about doctors and hospitals and treatments and choices have informed my writing since. Marci was the ultimate empowered patient, as she diagnosed her own cancer. When her cancer was first diagnosed, doctors told Marci she had leiomyosarcoma, a particularly rare and aggressive form of cancer. A licensed practical nurse, Marci looked up the diagnosis online and called to tell me that something sounded strange -- she had the leiomyosarcoma only in her brain and nowhere else, and such leiomyosarcoma cases are so rare, they get written up in medical journals. Plus, people with leiomyosarcoma often have had diseases like HIV, or have had lots of radiation earlier in life. Marci had neither. Her oncologist wanted Marci to start chemo right away, but she refused. Instead, she and Tim flew to a hospital in Florida that specialized in sarcomas, where they confirmed she didn't have leiomyosarcoma, but rather a much more common type of tumor, a glioblastoma multiforme. If Marci had simply accepted her first diagnosis, she would have received the wrong treatment and most likely would have died quite quickly. She lived for 4Â½ years -- she lived to see her son's seventh birthday -- because she was smart and she trusted her gut, the most important part of being an empowered patient. Marci was in her kitchen the last time I visited her, surrounded by Tim, Joshua, her mother, and aunts, uncles, cousins and friends. The weekends at her house were like that, as she sustained a community for herself, her husband and son. I'd never seen a house so full of life in the face of death, but that's because Marci embraced all that was good no matter what horrible things lay ahead.","Marci Smith was one of the first people featured in this column .

"(CNN) -- A leading figure in the party poised to head Italy's next government says a return for the country's previous Prime Minister, controversial politician Silvio Berlusconi, would be a ""disaster."" Democratic Party Vice Secretary Enrico Letta's comments come as Berlusconi's popularity surges in the Italian electoral polls after seemingly being out of the race. In an interview with CNN, Letta said incumbent Prime Minister Mario Monti cannot win the election and it is now a straight race between Berlusconi and Bersani. A victory for Berlusconi ""would create mistrust between Italy, its European partners and the markets,"" Letta told CNN. Italy's economy is experiencing a period of relative calm as government bond yields remain well below the critical 7% level and Monti's austerity measures begin to take effect.

With a contracting economy and GDP falling 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2012; Italy is still grappling with the economic mess Silvio Berlusconi left in his wake before resigning in late 2011. The media tycoon and owner of soccer club AC Milan -- who previously served three terms as prime minister -- was forced to step down amid an escalating eurozone debt crisis and personal legal battles. Letta added: ""The only way to avoid any risk to the Italian economy is a victory for the Democratic Party."" Italians will take to the voting stations this weekend to decide which candidate will lead a country, struggling to emerge from a financial crisis that has plagued the 17-nation eurozone for three years. Bersani is currently leading the polls with Berlusconi trailing by 5 to 7 points. But Deborah Bergamini, a parliamentarian and member of Berlusconi's PDL party, is expecting a ""surprise"" result on February 25. She rejected Letta's assertion that a return for the 76-year-old Berlusconi would destabilize Italy's economy. Speaking to CNN, Bergamini said: ""Berlusconi can definitely win. We are gaining ground... financial markets don't care at all about single heads of governments."" A Bersani government is the true threat to Italy's economic recovery, according to Bergamini, as the Democratic Party could adopt hard-left policies that tax the middle class and punish big businesses. ""There are many similarities with Bersani and what is going on in France... we are very worried,"" she added. With a population of over 60 million, Italy -- the eurozone's third-largest economy -- has an unemployment rate of 11.2% with public debt to GDP forecast to rise to 128% this year, according to the European Commission.

Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, told CNN that a year ago Italy's economy was ""falling off a cliff"" and the investment community is showing ""complacency"" over the prospect of a Berlusconi return.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The jet carrying 228 people from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that disappeared overnight as it entered an area of strong turbulence probably crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, the CEO of Air France said Monday. Anne and Michael Harris, who lived in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were two Americans aboard the flight. Brazilian and French ships and planes were looking for any sign of the missing plane, authorities said. The first three hours of what was to have been an 11-hour flight appear to have been uneventful, CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said. But about 4:15 a.m. Paris time, Flight 447's automatic system began a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating that ""several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down,"" he said. ""This succession of messages signals a totally unforeseeable, great difficulty,"" he said. ""Something quite new within the plane."" During that time, there was no contact with the crew, Gourgeon said. ""It was probable that it was a little bit after those messages that the impact of the plane took place in the Atlantic,"" he added. He said the Airbus A330 was probably closer to Brazil than to Africa when it crashed. He noted that turbulence made flying ""difficult"" in the area but that it is ""too early to say"" exactly what happened. The chances of finding any survivors were ""very low,"" French President Nicolas Sarkozy admitted Monday. ""This is a catastrophe the likes of which Air France has never seen before,"" he said at Charles de Gaulle International Airport, where he met with relatives of the missing. ""I said the truth to them: The prospects of finding survivors are very low,"" he said. The airline company identified the nationalities of the victims as two Americans, an Argentinean, an Austrian, a Belgian, 58 Brazilians, five British, a Canadian, nine Chinese, a Croatian, a Dane, a Dutch, an Estonian, a Filipino, 61 French, a Gambian, 26 Germans, four Hungarians, three Irish, one Icelandic, nine Italians, five Lebanese, two Moroccans, three Norwegians, two Polish, one Romanian, one Russian, three Slovakian, two Spanish, one Swedish, six Swiss and one Turk. An official list of victims by name was not available late Monday. The American victims were identified as Michael Harris, 60, and his wife, Anne, 54, by the couple's family and his employer, Devon Energy in Oklahoma -- the largest U.S.-based independent natural gas and oil producer. Michael Harris was a company geologist in Rio de Janeiro, according to a company spokesman. Anne Harris' sister, Mary Miley, told CNN the couple had been living in the city since July 2008 and that they were traveling to Paris for a training seminar for Michael and for a vacation. ""Anne and Mike were indeed a beautiful couple inside and out and I miss them terribly already,"" Miley said in an e-mail. Sarkozy said French authorities sent ships and planes to the area about 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Brazil. ""Our Spanish friends are helping us; Brazilians are helping us a lot as well."" French Transport Minister Jean-Louis Borloo told CNN affiliate France 2 that France asked the U.S. military to assist in the search through U.S. detection satellites. Pentagon officials in Washington did not immediately confirm the request. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters in San Salvador, El Salvador, that he had spoken with Sarkozy but neither leader knew what to say. ""All we could do was thank each other,"" Lula said. ""He thanked me for the speed with which the Brazilian air force took charge."" He added, ""In times like these, there is little to do but to deeply lament, to wish the families a lot of strength, because there are no words in times like these."" Sarkozy said authorities were seeking the help of satellites that might be able to pick up signs of what happened to the 4-year-old Airbus 330. No possibility was being excluded: Turbulence in the area was strong, but other planes were able to pass through it without incident, he said. The plane reported a problem with the electrical system, ""but the specialists refuse for the moment to express themselves about any possibility,"" Sarkozy said. The jet also sent a warning that it lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said.  Watch aviation expert describe possible scenarios » . It lost contact with air traffic control between Galeao International Airport in Rio de Janeiro and Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, the airline said Monday. The Airbus A330 sent out an automatic signal warning of the electrical problems just after 2 a.m. GMT Monday as it flew ""far from the coast,"" said an Air France spokeswoman who declined to be identified. It had just entered a stormy area with strong turbulence, she said. The jet was flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet and a speed of 521 mph, the air force said. Among the passengers were 126 men, 82 women, seven children and a baby, in addition to the 12 crew members, Air France officials in Brazil said. Much of the route is out of radar contact, Brazilian air force Col. Henry Munhoz told TV Globo. The flight, AF 447, took off from Galeao International Airport at 11:30 p.m. Sunday GMT. It was scheduled to land in Paris at 9:10 a.m. GMT.  Learn more about recent notable airplane crashes » . Its last known contact occurred at 2:33 a.m. GMT, the Brazilian air force spokesman said. It was expected to check in with air traffic controllers at 3:20 a.m. GMT but did not do so, the Brazilian air force said in a statement. Brazilian authorities asked the air force to launch a search mission just over three hours later, at 6:30 a.m. GMT, the statement said. The plane reported no problems before takeoff, Joao Assuncao, Air France's manager in Brazil, told the country's Record TV. The airline set up a crisis center at the Paris airport. It listed numbers for families to call: 0 800 800 812 for people in France and 00 33 1 57 02 10 55 for families outside France. At a crisis center at the airport in Rio, relatives of the missing complained of a dearth of information from Air France, the Brazilian state news agency reported. One man, who identified himself as Bernardo, said his brother, Romeo Amorim Souza, and his wife were on the missing flight. ""I came to the airport because I wasn't finding information, and my parents are very nervous,"" he told Agencia Brasil. The missing A330 last underwent a maintenance check on April 16, the airline said. CNN air travel expert Richard Quest said the twin-engine plane, a stalwart of transatlantic routes, had an impeccable safety record, with only one fatal incident involving a training flight in 1994. ""It has very good range and is extremely popular with airlines because of its versatility,"" he said. Its crew was composed of three pilots and nine cabin crew members, including a captain who has logged 11,000 hours in flight. About 1,700 of those hours were on the A330 and A340. Of the two co-pilots, one has 3,000 hours of flying experience and the other 6,600 hours. The aircraft has flown 18,870 hours. The model is ""capable of communicating in several different ways over quite long distances even if they are out of radar coverage,"" said Kieran Daly of the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence. The French Accident Investigation Bureau for civil aviation is investigating, the company said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- The small fruit has the color of a cranberry, the shape of an almond and tastes like a flavorless gummy. The ""miracle fruit"" makes acidic foods, such as lemons and grapefruits, sweet and candy-like. But after chewing the fruit and rubbing the pulp against the tongue, the berry, known by a promising name -- ""miracle fruit"" or Synsepalum dulcificum -- releases a sweetening potency that alters the taste buds. For about 15 to 30 minutes, everything sour is sweet. Lemons lose their zing and taste like candy. Oranges become sickeningly sweet.  Hot sauce that usually burns the tongue tastes like honey barbecue sauce that scorches as it trickles down the throat. Through word of mouth, these miracle fruits have inspired ""taste tripping"" parties, where foodies and curious eaters pay $10 to $35 to try the berries, which are native to West Africa. About five months ago, a Miami, Florida, hospital began studying whether the fruit's sweetening effects can restore the appetite of cancer patients whose chemotherapy treatments have left them with dulled taste buds. ""What happens in patients is the food tastes so metallic and bland, it becomes repulsive,"" said Dr. Mike Cusnir, a lead researcher on the project and oncologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center. ""Most of the patients undergoing chemotherapy have weight loss. Then they cut further into their diet and then this furthers the weight loss. It causes malnutrition, decreased function of the body and electrolyte imbalance.""   Watch a flavor tripping demonstration and the interview with Cusnir. » . One of Cusnir's patients, Don Blechman, told him about the fruit after discovering it while he and his wife volunteered at a tropical fruit garden in Coral Gables, Florida. ""We didn't need it, but we thought it's wonderful and told a lot of people,"" said his wife, Terry Blechman. ""If you can't eat because everything tastes bitter, and one berry gives you back your taste for a meal, what is it worth? It's worth everything."" Cusnir filed for an investigational new drug application, which is required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use an unapproved product in a new patient population. His study seeks 40 cancer patients. ""The majority have given good feedback that it did improve taste,"" Cusnir said. ""A few patients felt there wasn't much change. The feedback is mixed as it usually is in any situation. It's been encouraging, but we haven't analyzed the data so far."" If the results show promise of helping cancer patients to maintain a healthy body weight and appetite, there will be bigger studies, Cusnir said. The process is expected to take several years.  ""If this doesn't work, we move on and spend resources on something else instead,"" he said. It's not only cancer patients and foodies turning to the miracle fruit. Carmen Duporte, a Fort Lauderdale,Florida, resident, integrated the miracle fruit into her routine drinks of aloe vera juice. Duporte drinks the juice to cleanse her digestive system, but hates its thick and long-lasting taste. ""It's really bitter,"" she said. ""If I don't take [the miracle fruit], I'd be having that taste for a long time. When I drink it with the fruit, there's no taste in my mouth."" Duporte told her friends about the berries, because ""it's such a friendly fruit."" Through word of mouth, the miracle fruit has picked up buzz. ""This new resurgence of interest is fascinating,"" said Linda Bartoshuk, a professor at the University of Florida's Center for Smell and Taste. ""It popped on the scene and people are having fun with it. It motivated us to go back and do research."" Bartoshuk seeks to better understand how the berry works. In the 1970s, she studied the fruit while working for the U.S. Navy and Army labs. The miracle fruit contains a natural protein, called miraculin, which has sugar molecules that bind to the tongue, she said. When acid enters the mouth, the sugar molecules press into the sweet receptors. Some of her colleagues are looking into how the berries could help people with diabetes and obesity, because they sweeten the taste of food. Unlike sugar, the miracle fruit  has very few calories and unlike artificial sweeteners, the berries are natural. Bartoshuk said she hasn't seen any reports of dangers from eating the berries, but warned against premature health benefit claims. ""Everyone's immediate response is it's an artificial sweetener, it'll help you lose weight,"" she said. ""But the bad side is artificial sweeteners don't help you lose weight. Any real claims for health benefits are going to have to be supported by good research."" After the FDA in 1974 declared that miraculin was a food additive, the miracle fruit grew in obscurity in South Florida and remained a local treat. Individual farmers, like Curtis Mozie, a retired post office employee, raised the berries and began shipping them to customers who found him on the Internet. ""I felt like everyone else needs to be aware of this fruit,"" said Mozie of Fort Lauderdale. ""Why was it kept hush-hush? I wanted people to enjoy the fruit and enjoy the experience and any edible item that doesn't taste good with the help of the miracle fruit."" Curiosity about the fruit began to circulate among exotic fruit seekers. After a few media reports, other small farms cropped up and companies started selling the miracle fruit and tablets. ""No offense meant to people who want to pay money to eat miracle fruit and weird things. We used to do that every Friday,"" said Richard Campbell, who oversees the tropical fruits at the Fairchild Tropical Fruit Garden. ""We grew up with miracle fruit. People came over, ate miracle fruit and sat around eating limes. I feel stupid I didn't think of charging anyone.""","Miracle fruit launches ""taste tripping"" parties where foodies eat lemon, hot sauce .

"(EW.com) -- In the final weekend before Iron Man 3 kicks off the summer movie season in earnest, Michael Bay's R-rated action comedy Pain & Gain topped a slow weekend at the box office with $20 million from 3,277 theaters, giving it an average of $6,103 per location. The Paramount film achieved only a fraction of the opening weekend grosses of Bay's Transformers films, but it only cost a fraction — just $26 million — of those films as well. It's well on its way to profitability. Pain & Gain, which stars Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, redeemed both stars following unimpressive box office results for action films earlier this year. Wahlberg's Broken City petered out with just $19.7 million, while Johnson's Snitch fared only slightly better, grossing $42.1 million. While both those films had darker, more serious tones, Pain & Gain was marketed as a sunny, over-the-top black comedy. Unfortunately, audience reaction wasn't particularly sunny. Polled moviegoers issued Pain & Gain a dreadful ""C+"" CinemaScore. In second place, Tom Cruise's sci-fi adventure Oblivion, which last week debuted with $37.1 million, dropped 53 percent to $17.4 million, giving it a 10-day total of $64.7 million. While the Universal film seems unlikely to reach Cruise's one-time benchmark of $100 million domestically, its $134.1 million international total lifts prospects considerably. Still, a $198.8 million worldwide total versus a $120 million budget isn't an incredible result after accounting for distribution and marketing costs. Warner Bros.' $40 million Jackie Robinson drama 42 scored another $10.7 million in its third weekend, representing a 40 percent decline. With a cumulative gross of $69.1 million so far, 42 is a big winner for Warner Bros., which badly needed a hit following flops like Beautiful Creatures, Bullet to the Head, and Jack the Giant Slayer. Yet most analysts expected the film, which earned an ""A+"" CinemaScore grade, to reach $100 million. That no longer seems plausible. 'Rocky' musical headed to Broadway in '14 . Star-studded romantic comedy The Big Wedding flopped in its opening weekend, with just $7.5 million from 2,633 theaters, giving it a sad $2,848 per theater average. The $35 million Lionsgate release got off to a weaker start than other recent wedding titles like The Five-Year Engagement, License to Wed, and The Wedding Date — and all of those were considered misfires upon release. The Big Wedding, which features performances by Robert De Niro, Susan Sarandon, Robin Williams, Diane Keaton, Amanda Seyfried, Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace, and Ben Barnes, garnered wretched reviews from most critics, and audiences, which were 77 percent female and 66 percent above the age of 30, gave it an ugly ""C+"" CinemaScore. D.C. dinner: Spacey, Spielberg in spoofs . The Croods spent its sixth weekend in the Top 5 with $6.6 million (a 29 percent drop), lifting the colorful Stone Age comedy to $163 million total. The Fox-distributed film, produced by DreamWorks Animation for $135 million, has carried even more cash into its cave internationally, and this weekend it passed the $300 million mark. Worldwide, The Croods has earned a terrific $471 million, and it will zoom right past the half-billion mark some time in the next two weeks. Unsurprisingly, a sequel is already in the works. 1. Pain & Gain -- $20 million . 2. Oblivion -- $17.4 million . 3. 42 -- $10.7 million . 4. The Big Wedding -- $7.5 million . 5. The Croods -- $6.6 million . Despite the success of films like The Croods, Identity Thief, and Oz The Great and Powerful, the first third of 2013 hasn't been a particularly good one at the box office. For the year to date, both attendance and revenue at the U.S. box office are down 12 percent, and Hollywood is now turning its attention to potential blockbusters like Iron Man 3, Fast & Furious 6, and Man of Steel to turn this year's prospects around. Iron Man 3, at least, seems like a safe bet. The superhero sequel debuted this weekend in 42 overseas territories (about 79 percent of the international market), where it earned an incredible $195.3 million — a higher figure than The Avengers' $185.1 million start. That figure is even more impressive when your realize that Iron Man 3 has yet to open in powerhouse territories like China, Russia, and Germany. Iron Man 3 achieved the best opening weekend ever in a number of Asian countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore), which is a testament to the continent's booming box offices, but perhaps also to Disney's efforts to tailor the picture to better appeal to Asian filmgoers. The film opens in the U.S. on Friday and is expected to open above $150 million. See the original article at EW.com.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Privacy advocates plan to call on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to suspend use of ""whole-body imaging,"" the airport security technology that critics say performs ""a virtual strip search"" and produces ""naked"" pictures of passengers, CNN has learned. A TSA employee, shown from the back, as he stands in an airport whole-body imaging machine. The national campaign, which will gather signatures from organizations and relevant professionals, is set to launch this week with the hope that it will go ""viral,"" said Lillie Coney, associate director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which plans to lead the charge. ""People need to know what's happening, with no sugar-coating and no spinning,"" said Coney, who is also coordinator of the Privacy Coalition, a conglomerate of 42 member organizations. She expects other groups to sign on in the push for the technology's suspension until privacy safeguards are in place. Right now, without regulations on what the Transportation Security Administration does with this technology, she said, ""We don't have the policy to hold them to what they say. They're writing their own rule book at this point."" The machines ""detect both metallic and nonmetallic threat items to keep passengers safe,"" said Kristin Lee, spokeswoman for TSA, in a written statement. ""It is proven technology, and we are highly confident in its detection capability.""  Watch a video of the body-imaging scans » . Late last month, freshman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, introduced legislation to ban these machines. Of concern to him, Coney and others is not just what TSA officials say, it's also what they see. iReport: Tell us what you think about these scanners . The sci-fi-looking whole-body imaging machine -- think ""Beam me up, Scotty"" -- was first introduced at an airport in Phoenix, Arizona, in November 2007. There are now 40 machines, which cost $170,000 each, being tested and used in 19 airports, said TSA's Lee. Six of these airports are testing the machines as a primary security check option, instead of metal detectors followed by a pat-down, she said. The rest present them as a voluntary secondary security option in lieu of a pat-down, which is protocol for those who've repeatedly set off the metal detector or have been randomly selected for additional screening. So far, the testing phase has been promising, said Lee. When given the choice, ""over 99 percent of passengers choose this technology over other screening options,"" she said. A big advantage of the technology is the speed, said Jon Allen, another TSA spokesperson, who's based in Atlanta, Georgia. A body scan takes between 15 and 30 seconds, while a full pat-down can take from two to four minutes. And for those who cringe at the idea of being touched by a security official, or are forever assigned to a pat-down because they had hip replacements, for example, the machine is a quick and easy way to avoid that contact and hassle, he said. Using millimeter wave technology, which the TSA says emits 10,000 times less radio frequency than a cell phone, the machine scans a traveler and a robotic image is generated that allows security personnel to detect potential threats -- and, some fear, more -- beneath a person's clothes. TSA officials say privacy concerns are addressed in a number of ways. The system uses a pair of security officers. The one working the machine never sees the image, which appears on a computer screen behind closed doors elsewhere; and the remotely located officer who sees the image never sees the passenger. As further protection, a passenger's face is blurred and the image as a whole ""resembles a fuzzy negative,"" said TSA's Lee. The officers monitoring images aren't allowed to bring cameras, cell phones or any recording device into the room, and the computers have been programmed so they have ""zero storage capability"" and images are ""automatically deleted,"" she added. But this is of little comfort to Coney, the privacy advocate with EPIC, a public interest research group in Washington. She said she's seen whole-body images captured by similar technology dating back to 2004 that were much clearer than what's represented by the airport machines. ""What they're showing you now is a dumbed-down version of what this technology is capable of doing,"" she said. ""Having blurry images shouldn't blur the issue."" Lee of TSA emphasized that the images Coney refers to do not represent millimeter wave technology but rather ""backscatter"" technology, which she said TSA is not using at this time. Coney said she and other privacy advocates want more oversight, full disclosure for air travelers, and legal language to protect passengers and keep TSA from changing policy down the road. For example, she wants to know what's to stop TSA from using clearer images or different technology later. The computers can't store images now, but what if that changes? ""TSA will always be committed to respecting passenger privacy, regardless of whether a regulation is in place or not,"" Lee said. She added that the long-term goal is not to see more of people, but rather to advance the technology so that the human image is like a stick-figure and any anomalies are auto-detected and highlighted. But Coney knows only about what's out there now, and she worries that as the equipment gets cheaper, it will become more pervasive and harder to regulate. Already it is used in a handful of U.S. courthouses and in airports in the United Kingdom, Spain, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Thailand and the Netherlands. She wonders whether the machines will someday show up in malls. The option of walking through a whole-body scanner or taking a pat-down shouldn't be the final answer, said Chris Calabrese, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""A choice between being groped and being stripped, I don't think we should pretend those are the only choices,"" he said. ""People shouldn't be humiliated by their government"" in the name of security, nor should they trust that the images will always be kept private. ""Screeners at LAX [Los Angeles International Airport],"" he speculated, ""could make a fortune off naked virtual images of celebrities."" Bruce Schneier, an internationally recognized security technologist, said whole-body imaging technology ""works pretty well,"" privacy rights aside. But he thinks the financial investment was a mistake. In a post-9/11 world, he said, he knows his position isn't ""politically tenable,"" but he believes money would be better spent on intelligence-gathering and investigations. ""It's stupid to spend money so terrorists can change plans,"" he said by phone from Poland, where he was speaking at a conference. If terrorists are swayed from going through airports, they'll just target other locations, such as a hotel in Mumbai, India, he said. ""We'd be much better off going after bad guys ... and back to pre-9/11 levels of airport security,"" he said. ""There's a huge 'cover your ass' factor in politics, but unfortunately, it doesn't make us safer."" Meantime, TSA's Lee says the whole-body imaging machines remain in the pilot phase. Given what the organization has gleaned so far, she said additional deployments are anticipated.","Privacy advocates to launch campaign against 'whole-body imaging' machines .

"Harrisburg, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Somewhere, somehow, someone tried to carry a tribal spear onto a commercial aircraft. Troy Thompson knows that not because he is privy to the nation's latest intelligence reports but because he works for Pennsylvania's Department of General Services, where objects discovered and surrendered at airport checkpoints are stored, sorted and resold to the public. The non-descript government building in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, could be called the world's most unusual thrift store because of the odd assortment of stuff that ends up there. You'll find piles of hockey sticks and golf clubs, dozens of snow globes, enough rolling pins to equip a culinary school and so many pocketknives that they are sold by the pound. All of the items are prohibited on planes because they could be used as weapons or, in the case of snow globes, could contain liquid explosives. Every year, passengers surrender about 750,000 prohibited items at airport checkpoints. The Transportation Security Administration cringes at the term ""confiscated"" because passengers have the option to return prohibited items to their cars, check them with their baggage, ship them home, or hand them off to someone on the public side of the checkpoint. But more often than not, rushed travelers surrender the items -- or ""voluntarily abandon"" them, in TSA parlance -- to screeners. TSA stands by knife decision . Illegal items -- guns, grenades, brass knuckles and such -- are handed over to local law enforcement. (The TSA seizes on average four guns a day at checkpoints and took a total of 1,549 last year.) But prohibited items -- knives, large tools and sporting equipment -- are considered excess government property and are sent to the nearest state willing to accept them. The TSA does not profit from abandoned property, it says. But Pennsylvania says the commonwealth can profit largely because it already has a facility devoted to selling government surplus. Using those resources, Thompson said, Pennsylvania has brought in almost $900,000 in the past nine years selling checkpoint items. Who's who in opposition to TSA rule change . Knives are probably the most common items aside from liquids, which are thrown away. Travelers surrender about 35 knives at Baltimore-Washington International Airport on an average day and about 47 per day at Los Angeles International Airport. Pennsylvania employees research the market values of items and set prices, taking into consideration the items' conditions. Some items are sold in a no-frills government surplus store in Harrisburg. Most are auctioned on GovDeals.com (search for ""Pennsylvania Surplus""). New batches of items are placed on the auction block three times a week. Oddities include a large box filled with bullet belts. Whether they came from punk rockers or Hopalong Cassidy fans, or perhaps both, is unknown. ""You can't physically go through each bullet to make sure it's not a real bullet,"" Thompson said. In the inventory this week were Nunchaku, or nunchucks, toy guns and a horse whip. ""I don't know who would want to take a horse whip onto a plane,"" Thompson said. Thompson said he doesn't expect the TSA's recent decision to permit small pocketknives to appreciably alter the flow of goods through his department. Many of the surrendered knives have longer blades and will remain prohibited. And there's always someone trying to board an aircraft with bullet belts, nunchucks and spears, which, if nothing else, keeps jobs at the checkpoint and one Pennsylvania surplus store very interesting.","Passengers surrender 750,000 items annually at airport checkpoints, TSA says .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States officially ended Tuesday, the South Korean Defense Ministry said. But the ministry noted that South Korea is still closely monitoring for possible provocation and possible missile launches by North Korea. A torrent of unnerving threats from Pyongyang in recent weeks has strained already fragile relations in the region. The North's rhetoric intensified when the U.N. Security Council voted last month to slap the tougher sanctions on the regime and amid the U.S.-South Korean military drills. The tensions prompted the closure of Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea -- one of the few symbols of inter-Korean cooperation. Key dates in U.S. military moves near North Korea . The complex, which sits just north of the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries, houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. During a frenzy of rhetoric aimed at South Korea and the United States earlier this month, the North began blocking South Koreans from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border. It then pulled out the more than 50,000 North Koreans who work in the zone's factories, saying it was temporarily suspending activity there. The move surprised some observers since Kaesong was considered to be a key source of hard currency for the Kim Jong Un regime. Training to go supersonic with South Korea's Top Guns . Seven remain . On Saturday, South Korea started withdrawing its remaining citizens from the manufacturing zone jointly operated with the North. On Tuesday, the South's Unification Ministry said seven South Koreans remain at Kaesong to tie up loose ends. This is not the first time Kaesong has shut down. In 2009, North Korea temporarily suspended in Kaesong Industrial Complex several times, not permitting South Koreans to enter and exit the zone. The suspension also took place during the annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drill. Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . But if all South Korean workers pull out, it will be the first time the joint economic zone will have no South Korean workers since the business kicked off about a decade ago. In 2012, the production value of the complex grew to $500 million; just five years earlier, it topped $100 million for the first time. The average wage for North Korean workers in Kaesong Industrial Complex is $134 per month, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. North Korean authorities take about 45% of their wages for various tax reasons. South Korea pulls out citizens from joint industrial zone .

"(CNN) -- North Korea plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between December 10 and 22, a spokesman for the Korean Committee for Space Technology said Saturday, according to state-run media. The Unha-3 rocket will launch from the Sohae Space Center in North Phyongan Province and put a ""working satellite"" into orbit, the report by the official Korean Central News Agency said. The planned launch is unusual because it comes during the wintertime and only months after a failed attempt in April. On that occasion, Pyongyang also said the rocket was supposed to put a satellite into orbit, but the launch was seen by many other countries as cover for a ballistic missile test and drew international condemnation. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said another launch ""would be a highly provocative act that threatens peace and security in the region."" It would be also in direct violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions 1718 and 1874, under which North Korea is barred from testing ballistic missile technology, she said in a statement. ""Devoting scarce resources to the development of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles will only further isolate and impoverish North Korea,"" she said. ""The path to security for North Korea lies in investing in its people and abiding by its commitments and international obligations."" The North's failed launch in April soured relations with the United States and scuppered a deal for Washington to provide thousands of tons of food aid to the North's malnourished population. KCNA said a second version of the same Korean-made Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite is to be launched this time. Scientists and technicians have analyzed the mistakes made in April, when the rocket broke apart shortly after takeoff, and have worked to improve the reliability and precision of the satellite and carrier rocket, the news agency reported. The ""polar-orbiting earth observation satellite"" will blast off southward on a trajectory designed so that parts of the carrier rocket that fall during the launch will not land on neighboring nations, the news agency said. It said North Korea had acted with utmost transparency on its last ""peaceful scientific and technological satellite launch,"" and would ""fully comply with relevant international regulations and usage"" this time too. South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade expressed ""serious concern"" Saturday over its neighbor's planned launch, saying it was a ""long-range missile test in the name of working satellite."" If the North goes ahead with the launch as intended, ""it will be faced with a strong response,"" the ministry's statement said. ""The launch is a severe provocation as it is ignoring the concern and warning from the international community and is a direct challenge to the international community as a whole,"" it said. South Korea will work closely with the international community, including fellow members of the so-called six-party talks on North Korea -- the United States, Japan, China and Russia -- to stop Pyongyang's ""provocative act,"" it added. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague also condemned the planned launch and urged the North Korean authorities to abandon the project. ""Failure to do so must lead to a further response by the international community, and will damage the prospects for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said in a statement. The botched launch in April drew stern criticism from the U.N. Security Council, which repeated demands for Pyongyang not to carry out similar tests in the future. It followed attempts in 2006 and 2009 that were also judged by international experts as having failed. News of the latest planned launch does not come as a complete surprise to North Korea watchers. A U.S. academic website, 38 North, published an analysis of commercial satellite images Thursday that it said revealed trailers carrying the first two stages of one of the North's Unha rockets near the main missile assembly building at the Sohae Satellite Launch Station on the country's west coast. The analysis by 38 North, which is run by the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, followed the release of an image this week by the satellite imagery company DigitalGlobe that showed increased activity at the launch station. 38 North suggested the possible motivation for the activity at the Sohae site was the planned launch of a satellite-bearing rocket this week by its archrival and neighbor, South Korea. Seoul postponed that launch minutes before takeoff after the discovery of an electronic signal problem. Top satellite image analyst Joe Bermudez, of DigitalGlobe, told CNN earlier this week that a launch on this scale for a second time within a year would be unprecedented for North Korea. The North Koreans are looking for ""maximum political impact"" domestically, regionally and internationally with a test launch such as this, he said, calling it a ""very politically motivated event."" The timing of a launch at the end of this year would coincide with many consequential events, said Bermudez, including South Korea's planned launch. North Korea and Japan will also be holding another set of bilateral talks early in December and the South Korean presidential election will take place in less than a month. North Korea-watchers say new leader Kim Jung Un may be responding to internal political pressure from hard-liners to send a message. CNN's KJ Kwon, Jethro Mullen, Jennifer Rizzo and Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","NEW: Nuland: A launch ""would be a highly provocative act that threatens peace and security""

"(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson was too angry to talk to the press after Manchester United's Champions League exit, and Roberto Mancini was feeling very much the same way after a shock defeat surely ended his side's English title defense on Saturday. Manchester City crashed 2-0 at Everton, which allowed United to march 15 points clear with just nine games to play following a functional 1-0 win over second-bottom Reading. Mancini's ire was raised not only by a controversial refereeing decision late in the match -- mirroring Ferguson's frustration after Nani's red card against Real Madrid -- but also by his team's capitulation against a side thrashed by struggling Wigan last time out in the FA Cup. Everton even had Steven Pienaar sent off with half an hour to play, but the key moment came when Marouane Fellaini's handball inside the area was penalized with a freekick outside of it as City trailed 1-0 with four minutes left. ""He is a bit angry, as you can imagine,"" Mancini's assistant David Platt said after the match. ""He is just taking stock of the situation and calming down. He doesn't want to come out here and say anything that might get him in trouble."" Platt later told City's website: ""From where I was down on the touchline I didn't know if it was inside or not, but we quickly had a message come through to us that it was inside -- having now seen it myself, it was well inside the box, but it's not gone for us. ""But even then we probably created enough decent chances to get something out of the game."" Everton also had an appeal for a penalty turned down when Fellaini fell, and Kevin Mirallas had an effort ruled out for offside. Even so, goals from midfielder Leon Osman and substitute Nikica Jelavic kept David Moyes' team in sixth place, three points ahead of city rivals Liverpool with a game in hand as the club's manager celebrated 11 years in charge. More importantly in terms of the Premier League title race, it left United in pole position to claim a record-extending 20th English crown at the expense of their bitter rivals. Ferguson made eight changes following last weekend's FA Cup draw with Chelsea, but it was two of the players who retained their places that made the difference against managerless Reading. Center-back Rio Ferdinand charged upfield and directed the ball towards Wayne Rooney, who teed the ball up and then saw his volley balloon over goalkeeper Stuart Taylor after taking a big deflection. That 21st-minute effort -- Rooney's 12th goal in the league this season and 16th overall -- was enough to see off a visiting team which had sacked manager Brian McDermott last Monday. Ferdinand has been called up into the England squad for the first time since 2011, and Ferguson confirmed that the 34-year-old would be available for this month's World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Montenegro despite earlier expressing fears about his fitness. Ferdinand was omitted by Roy Hodgson for Euro 2012 as the coach cited ""footballing reasons"" -- though it was widely reported that the United defender missed out due to the fallout from his younger brother Anton's racism case against John Terry, who was selected for the tournament in Poland and Ukraine. ""It wasn't a great performance but where we are now is not down to today, but the last six months,"" Ferguson said. ""The team has shown great consistency and played a lot of great football. Our goal difference is big over City now -- 13 goals. ""The problem I've got is a lot of players are away on international duty and play two games. They come back and then we've got a lunchtime game against Sunderland on Saturday (March 30) and then it's lunchtime again against Chelsea on the Monday. We have a squad to use it and that's what we did today."" Fifth-placed Arsenal bounced back from the club's midweek Champions League exit with a 2-0 win at Swansea. Left-back Nacho Monreal scored his first goal since leaving Spanish side Malaga on January's transfer deadline day, and Ivory Coast forward Gervinho also netted as Arsene Wenger's team moved to within two points of fourth-placed Chelsea -- who host London rivals West Ham on Sunday. Seventh-placed Liverpool crashed 3-1 at Southampton, who moved seven points clear of the relegation zone. West Brom could have climbed above Brendan Rodgers' former European champions, but drew 0-0 at midtable Stoke. Aston Villa won for the second match in a row to establish a six-point buffer over the teams in the relegation zone, beating bottom club Queens Park Rangers 3-2. In Sunday's other matches, third-placed Tottenham will look to bounce back from successive defeats against Liverpool and Inter Milan in the London derby at home to Fulham. Third-bottom Wigan host Newcastle, while Sunderland will seek to halt a slide down the table at home to 14th-placed Norwich.","Roberto Mancini snubs media after Manchester City's 2-0 defeat at 10-man Everton .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Forget the ads, the weather, and all those back-and-forth attacks -- the Republican caucuses in Iowa will come down to thousands of small pieces of paper. While Iowa Democrats famously caucus by literally standing up for their chosen candidate, the Hawkeye State's GOP holds secret ballot votes. Here's how the unique process will work: On caucus night, would-be voters will gather in 809 locations across the state -- school gyms, churches and auditoriums of all shapes. To participate, each person must be a registered Republican who will turn 18 by the general election on November 6. But, in a closely watched twist, voters can switch party affiliation at the caucus and register as Republicans that night. ""From a process standpoint, it's a nightmare,"" said Dallas County Republican chairman Mike Elam, ""but I think it's a good thing. People can decide they want to be involved up to the very last minute."" Republicans this year hope that ability leads to a surge of registrations from disgruntled Democrats and independents. But the practice also allows potential cross-party sabotage, where members of one party can participate in a rival caucus in order to vote for the candidate they see as the weakest potential opponent. All registrations must be complete by 7 p.m., when the caucuses begin, in order for people to participate. Inside each caucus, party officials will first conduct some housekeeping, including the approval of the person who will chair the meeting. Then comes the only campaigning allowed. Each candidate may select one person to give a short speech on his or her behalf. Often, these are limited to just two or three minutes apiece. ""It's hard to get people to speak,"" insisted John Bloom, former chairman of the Polk County Republicans. ""I assure you every candidate right now is still out hustling to find speakers for every precinct in Iowa. And in some of the smaller precincts they won't get anybody."" After the speeches, it's time to vote. Now we get into some technical truth. The Iowa Republican caucuses vote in what is actually a nonbinding poll, sometimes called the presidential straw poll. The results do not mandate how convention delegates are divided per se. So why does everyone care so much, you ask? Good question. There are two answers. For one, the vote measures who's present at the caucuses. That's important because in a later business item, caucus-goers determine who will represent them at the party conventions, which will determine the national delegates from Iowa. Thus, the caucus poll is seen as the best indicator of how the state's delegates ultimately could be divided. The second and simpler, answer: The caucus poll is the first statewide vote in the presidential nomination contest. It is the first test of a wide field of candidates. This brings us to a current complaint about the Iowa caucuses: their track record at picking a nominee. It's mixed. Several recent Republican winners in Iowa have petered out after the Hawkeye State caucuses, including Mike Huckabee in 2008, Bob Dole in 1988, and George H.W. Bush in 1980. (Though in the case of the elder George Bush, that 1980 Iowa victory put him on course to become Ronald Reagan's vice-presidential pick and then president himself. ) Iowans brush off this complaint. ""The Iowa caucuses aren't here to pick the next nominee,"" said Mark Lundberg, chairman of the Sioux County Republican Party. ""The Iowa caucuses are here to cull the herd a little bit."" And that culling happens with the caucus vote. Back to that. Caucus-goers select their candidate on simple paper ballots. How this happens varies widely from county by county. In many places, these are blank pieces of paper on which each person writes down a single name and hands it in. In some places there is a list of candidates printed for people to circle or check. At all caucus sites, voters can write in the name of anyone they like. It is not limited to official presidential candidates. That means you could vote for your boss, your sister or even Justin Bieber. (Though a vote for Bieber would be wasted, since he's Canadian and not old enough to become president. Yet.) Next, the votes are collected and counted by hand. Each campaign has the option of sending a monitor to watch the process. Often these are the same folks who spoke on the candidates' behalf. How long does counting take? When will we get results? It depends on the size of the caucus. In smaller precincts, this will take just minutes and results could be ready before the clock strikes 7:30 p.m. In other places, it may take 90 minutes or more to count and recount the ballots. Finally a point person calls in the results to state Republican headquarters. Candidates react. Speeches ensue. The field of candidates is likely culled. The process overall is on the heavy participation end of the election spectrum. It is heavily decentralized, with county parties retaining strong control over specifics. And it emphasizes passionate community participation. All that requires a lot of planning and an army of volunteers. And Iowans boast about that, almost in dare-like fashion, to the other states salivating in envy at their state's first-in-the-nation status. ""I have a feeling that if some of those states, like Florida, who wanted an earlier primary,actually tried to do a caucus, that they would be overwhelmed by the amount of work involved,"" Cory Adams, chairman of the Story County Republican Party, told CNN. ""They'd be happy to remain fourth or fifth in line instead.""","On Tuesday night, Iowa Republicans will gather for 809 caucuses across the state .
They'll cast paper ballots for their choice for the nomination, and it could be anybody .

"New York (CNN) -- Weather has delayed the scheduled Monday morning delivery of the final two sections of a 408-foot spire to the top of One World Trade Center, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The two sections were scheduled to be delivered to the roof deck, as long as weather allowed on Monday. Once they are installed, they will make the building the tallest in the Western Hemisphere, according to the site's management. The two pieces form a stainless steel beacon weighing almost six tons and will be the final piece put in place to give the building an iconic height of 1,776 feet, according to a news release from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Once the architectural structure is complete, it will be comprised of 18 separate sections of steel and three communication rings. The first -- and heaviest -- steel section was installed in January, weighing more than 67 tons, the news release said. Port Authority Assistant Director of Media Anthony Hayes said the original design included a radome -- short for radar dome -- but that was rejected because of anticipated servicing and maintenance difficulties. The radome would not have impacted the height, but would have provided an additional design element, which ultimately proved impractical, Hayes told CNN. The spire will serve a television broadcast facility housed in One World Trade Center, the press release said. While under construction, One World Trade Center became New York City's tallest building a year ago, standing 1,271 feet above street-level. The building then was 21 feet higher than the Empire State Building's observation deck.","One World Trade Center will top out at 1,776 feet .

"(CNN) -- As you're being inundated with wall-to-wall coverage of the Iowa caucuses this week, keep the following number in mind: zero. The quest for the GOP's presidential nomination is ultimately a race for delegates. With 2,286 delegates attending the party's national convention in Tampa at the end of August, the backing of slightly over half of that group -- 1,144 -- will be needed for Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, or someone else to capture the prize. Guess how many of these delegates will be selected in Iowa on January 3. Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Iowa matters for one reason only: the media says so. It's been deemed the first ""real"" contest on the presidential nominating calendar, and for some reason ""first"" warrants wall-to-wall coverage. The winner -- or perceived winner -- is almost certain to get a campaign cash boost and ride a tidal wave of media-fueled momentum. ""Big Mo,"" as George H.W. Bush once famously called it, can be a game changer. Want to know what really happens in Iowa in January? Not much. A few thousand people who care enough about politics to spend an evening at their local library or church basement will decide who gets to attend the state GOP's county conventions in March. They'll also participate in a non-binding presidential preference vote. (""Non-binding"" means the state's national convention delegates do not have to vote according to the preferences of caucus participants.) And that's about it. In March, the county convention delegates will decide who attends a bunch of congressional district meetings and a statewide convention in late April and June. That's when most of Iowa's 28 national convention delegates â€” a bit over 1% of the total number of delegates in Tampa â€” will actually be chosen. If there's already a likely nominee by that point, you can bet Iowa won't rock the boat. Remember Mike Huckabee's big win in the 2008 Iowa GOP caucuses? The party's eventual nominee, John McCain, won all of Iowa's delegate votes at the national convention. The history of the Iowa caucuses is actually a case study in the power of the media to shape -- or warp, depending on your point of view -- the nomination contest. ""The name of the presidential nominating game is perception, and the reality of the Iowa precinct caucuses has long been replaced by the media perception,"" writes Drake University Professor Hugh Winebrenner. ""It is not the caucus event per se but the media report of the event that shapes the presidential selection process."" The Democrats, who stripped most nominating power from their party bosses after 1968, first realized Iowa's power in 1972 when the press all but declared George McGovern the ""winner"" after his surprise second-place finish behind establishment favorite Ed Muskie. McGovern, a liberal anti-Vietnam War candidate, went on to win the nomination. Four years later, a little known former Georgia governor rocketed onto the national stage by finishing second in Iowa behind an uncommitted delegate slate. Jimmy Carter eventually rolled all the way to the White House. CNN.com: GOP presidential field still unsettled . In 1980, Iowa Republicans came up with the idea of a non-binding preference vote as a way to provide more concrete results to a media mob hungry for primary-style hard numbers to report. The elder Bush's upset win over Ronald Reagan rattled the GOP race that year and eventually helped earn Bush the vice presidential slot. In 1984, Gary Hart's second-place Iowa finish beat expectations, set him up for a victory in New Hampshire, and established him as the main alternative to Walter Mondale. It also winnowed the field, effectively eliminating John Glenn after Glenn finished a disappointing fifth. CNN.com: Did Gingrich push Medicare drug bill . In 2004, eventual Democratic nominee John Kerry jumped from third to first place in the national polls following his Iowa victory. John Edwards also surprised pundits with a strong second-place showing. Howard Dean and Dick Gephardt crippled each other with a barrage of negative ads. Dean became best remembered for his infamous election night ""scream,"" which further damaged his insurgent campaign. Four years ago, Barack Obama's eight-point win in Iowa established him as a force to be reckoned with on the Democratic side. Hillary Clinton's disappointing third place finish, meanwhile, undercut her early knockout strategy and set in motion a long nomination fight that her establishment campaign was ill-prepared to fight. On the Republican side, McCain proved it's possible to ignore Iowa and live to fight another day. The senator's campaign set the media expectations bar low by making it clear he was focusing most of his attention on New Hampshire. McCain's fourth place finish in Iowa proved to be irrelevant when he rolled to victory in the Granite State. This time around, Mitt Romney's camp has tried to keep media expectations low in Iowa -- never an easy trick when you're seen as the national frontrunner and are therefore expected to compete everywhere. A first-place Iowa finish for the former Massachusetts governor -- overcoming regional, religious, and ideological obstacles -- could set Romney up for a huge win the following week in neighboring New Hampshire. It could also signal an early end to the nomination fight. Conversely, if Newt Gingrich hangs on for a first-place win in Iowa, the former speaker could potentially narrow Romney's lead in New Hampshire and set the stage for a more protracted contest. Or maybe Rick Santorum's investment in Iowa will reap a reward from the state's social conservatives and earn the former Pennsylvania senator another look from activists in other parts of the country. Perhaps the most intriguing possibility is a first-place finish by Ron Paul, a candidate with unorthodox GOP views on economic, defense, and social issues. A victory for the Texas congressman -- who has a strong Iowa organization in place -- would test the assumption that there's a hard ceiling on his popular support. It could also help Romney by denying other candidates more favorable media attention. Defenders of Iowa's role in the nomination process fear a Paul win could potentially marginalize the state in the future by associating it with non-mainstream attitudes. Iowa's Republican governor, Terry Branstad, is already trying to finesse the significance of a Paul victory. ""It's who comes in second and who comes in third as well as who comes in first,"" Branstad recently told CNN. ""And if somebody else does surprisingly well, it could well launch their campaign. It's happened before. So you don't necessarily have to win in Iowa, but you do need to be in the top three to be in contention going forward."" Just remember: no matter who finishes first, second, or third in Iowa, nobody will be any closer to the magic 1,144 delegate mark at the end of the night. The January 3 caucuses are a media expectations game, the importance of which depends entirely on voter reactions to the headlines on January 4. CNN's Kevin Bohn, Keating Holland, Adam Levy, and Rob Yoon contributed to this report .","No national delegates are actually at stake in Iowa's January 3 caucuses .
The caucuses are primarily a game of media expectations .
George H.W. Bush beat expectations by winning Iowa in 1980, helping to earn a spot on Reagan's ticket .
Mitt Romney is trying to keep expectations low in Iowa -- never easy for a front runner ."
"(CNN) -- As each of the Republican candidates claims victory of one kind or another -- having beaten the others, having beaten expectations, having beaten odds or some combination of all three -- and heads eastward for another contest, some thanks are in order. To the people of Iowa. Every four years, presidential candidates descend upon the small, unassuming state to make their case. They do so for months on end, glad-handing farmers and old folk and insurance salesmen in each of the state's 99 counties, delivering variants of the same stump speech as if its contents had just occurred to them. Over bacon breakfasts and Sunday sermons, these candidates parade their policy positions, personal histories, moral convictions and leadership styles. And then come early January, as just happened today, party activists around the state render their judgment, and thereby establish an important precedent for the primary season to follow. Every four years, one also can count on a bevy of political observers to bemoan this state of affairs. Why should such extraordinary responsibility be vested in one small state? And particularly one that is a great deal whiter, rural and less educated than the rest of the union? Stephen Bloom took on the question of ""why-Iowa?"" in a controversial article for The Atlantic last month, in which he referred to a ""schizophrenic"" and ""culturally challenged"" state, home to some of the ""wackiest"" congressmen and ""scuzziest"" towns in the nation, where the only reason to own a dog is ""to track and bag animals you want to stuff, mount, or eat."" Given the clear importance of early wins in presidential campaigns, it seems patently nuts to abide a primary and caucus schedule that begins with a population whose interests in ethanol subsidies would appear to rival their concerns for national defense. Again, Stephen Bloom: ""How screwy it is that a place like Iowa gets to choose -- before anyone else -- the person who may become the next leader of the free world."" Shouldn't the residents of larger, more diverse states, such as Florida, New York, Texas or California, be given the job of vetting our presidents? No. And for two reasons. First, it is precisely because of Iowa's size and community organization that less well-known, and hence less well-funded, candidates can gain traction in presidential campaigns. Though the contents of their war chests are not irrelevantâ€”just ask Tim Pawlentyâ€”they are not the only relevant factor. For this brief interlude in presidential politics, electoral fortunes depend as much upon the establishment of personal connections and acquisition of key endorsements as on expensive ad buys, which helps explain why Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, who spent little money but lots of time in Iowa, managed to keep pace with the mighty Mitt Romney and his deep Superpac reserves. Were the primary season to begin with New York, the only candidates worth monitoring would be those who, roughly 18 months before the Democratic and Republican conventions even are held, have the wherewithal to blanket the state with television and radio advertising . And this leads to the second reason why our nation benefits from having Iowa -- and then the likes of New Hampshire (population 1.3 million) and South Carolina (population 4.5 million) -- lead off. To generate momentum in these states, presidential candidates must speak directly to actual voters in these small states. Far and away the most time that candidates (and later presidents) spend engaging actual voters, listening to their policy preferences, concerns and struggles, occurs in the months that precede these early caucuses and primaries. If you lament the amounts of money spent in presidential campaigns (amounts that will only increase in the post-Citizens United era) or the intellectual poverty of televised debates between presidential candidates, then you should applaud the good people of Iowa. For months at a stretch, they scrutinize the candidates in their homes, diners, meeting halls and churches. For before long, some of these same candidates will be swept up into much larger, more exclusive venues. Could other small states perform the same service for the nation? Of course. Could they do it better than Iowa? I doubt it. And regardless, it is because the residents of Iowa engage these presidential candidates as much, and as well, as they do -- inviting not just the candidates themselves into daily activities, but the national electorate as well -- that some gratitude is owed. So thanks Iowa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Howell.","William Howell says now that Iowa caucus over, we should thank patient people of Iowa .

It's navy blue, and I received it for attending a baseball camp when I was 11. Attending that camp was one of the highlights of my youth. I wore that T-shirt more than I should have. In high school, I would wear it underneath my soccer and baseball jerseys. In college, it served as my personal pick-up basketball uniform. I still have that T-shirt. Today, it's resting safely in a drawer at home. The sleeves are missing, and it's a tad tight, but I still have the tee and everything it represents.

(Last year's T-shirt was black and looked really cool.) Now, I'm not implying that I am running the race solely to inherit another T-shirt, but it will surely be a great reminder of the experience. Needless to say, the T-shirt will be one that I cherish. When I die, I want the people packing up my belongings to find my collection of old T-shirts. Hopefully, after sifting through the stacks, they'll find my 2013 Malibu triathlon shirt and wonder, ""How did he get this? Did he really run a triathlon?"" If only they knew.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States will provide $73 million in aid to Zimbabwe, President Obama announced Friday after meeting with Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai at the White House. President Obama (right) praised Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai at the White House on Friday. ""I obviously have extraordinary admiration for the courage and tenacity that the prime minister has shown in navigating through some very difficult political times in Zimbabwe,"" Obama said. ""There was a time when Zimbabwe was the breadbasket of Africa, and [it] continues to have enormous potential. It has gone through a very dark and difficult time politically."" Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe ""has not acted oftentimes in the best interest of the Zimbabwean people and has been resistant to the democratic changes that need to take place,"" Obama said. ""We now have a power-sharing agreement that shows promise, and we want to do everything we can to encourage the kinds of improvement not only on human rights and rule of law, freedom of the press and democracy that is so necessary, but also on the economic front."" The U.S. aid will not be going to the government directly ""because we continue to be concerned about consolidating democracy, human rights and rule of law,"" Obama said. ""But it will be going directly to the people in Zimbabwe."" In a CNN interview following his meeting with Obama, Tsvangirai said he is grateful for the generosity. ""Whether it is humanitarian aid or transitional support, it adds up to the relief that Zimbabwe is seeking,"" he said.  Watch Tsvangirai discuss importance of aid to Zimbabwe » . Tsvangirai said he told Obama he would like the United States to use its global influence to assist Zimbabwe in dealing with the challenges it faces. Tsvangirai said he understood other nations' reluctance to support the Zimbabwean government, given Mugabe's controversial history. ""I think it's fair,"" he said. ""I understand it, given our history, and I'm not going to defend President Mugabe."" But, he noted, the two have agreed to work together and help Zimbabwe progress as a nation. In remarks with Obama, Tsvangirai said progress has been made by the transitional government, but much remains to be done. ""It is the problems of implementation,"" he said. ""... even by the standard of our own benchmarks, there are gaps that still exist."" He said he would continue to strive to meet those benchmarks, not for the international community, but because ""it gives [the] people of Zimbabwe freedom and opportunity to grow."" The power-sharing arrangement between Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, and Mugabe came after contested elections last year. ""Of course we cannot brush away that history, that sad history,"" Tsvangirai told CNN. But he said he is hoping the country will heal and move forward, and wants even those skeptical of Mugabe to appreciate the transition process. Asked whether he believes Mugabe should retire, Tsvangirai said ""at the age of 85, I think one needs to retire."" But, he said, for his own legacy, it's important for him to be thinking about a ""dignified exit."" ""I think that [the power-sharing government] provides him with this opportunity,"" Tsvangirai said. Asked about his relationship with Mugabe, he said, ""We don't have to fall in love to work together. But we have accepted that we have made an agreement to have a workable relationship between the two political parties."" He said there had been acrimony between the two, but they realized it was not helping the Zimbabwean people. ""We are inspired by people like Nelson Mandela, who had to go for 27 years in jail but still come out and say, 'Let's forget about the past' ..."" he said. He and Mugabe have chosen the process of dialogue rather than violence, Tsvangirai said. ""Let history judge whether this historic experiment was the right course of action.""

"(CNN) -- A chapter was closing in Dutch history Monday as Queen Beatrix spent her last full day on the throne after 33 years as the country's monarch. Beatrix will abdicate on Tuesday morning, handing over to her eldest son, Willem-Alexander, who will be the first Dutch king in more than 120 years. The queen was due to give a televised speech later on Monday. She steps down on the national holiday known as Queen's Day, an opportunity for people across the Netherlands to dress up and party. The investiture of the new king will be the high point of a year of celebrations marking the end of the Napoleonic occupation in 1813. The 75-year-old monarch announced her abdication in January, saying it was time for a new generation to lead. ""I have always considered it as an extraordinary privilege to be able to put a big part of my life at the service of our country and in accordance with my task to add substance to my kingship,"" said Beatrix, who acceded to the throne when her mother, Queen Juliana, abdicated in 1980. ""Until today, this beautiful task has given me a lot of satisfaction. It is inspiring to feel close to people, to sympathize in grievances and share times of joy and national pride."" She went on: ""It is with great confidence, that on April 30 this year I will pass my kingship to my son, the Prince of Orange. He and Princess Maxima are fully prepared for their future task. They will serve our country with devotion, faithfully serve the constitution, and with all their talents give substance to their kingship."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte added: ""Anyone who has met the queen will agree that she touched people and helped them forward with her knowledge and experience and her great interest and involvement."" The Dutch media has speculated that the queen was abdicating to spend more time with her second son Friso, who was injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort last year. He remains in a coma in a London hospital. Prince Willem-Alexander was educated in Wales and Holland, where he earned a history degree at Leiden University. He served in the Dutch Royal Navy from 1985 to 1987. As Prince of Orange -- the title given to the person first in line to the Dutch throne -- he has been interested in sustainability and innovation. He is married to Princess MÃ¡xima, who was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She has a degree in economics and has worked for HSBC and Deutsche Bank. The couple have been married for 11 years and have three daughters. Last week the couple gave their first joint TV interview in which Willem set out how he intended to rule. ""I want to be a king who is first of all traditional, built on the tradition of my predecessors, who stands for continuity and also for stability in the country ... but also a king who in the 21st century can bind together and represent society as a whole."" Asked how he intended to do that, Willem told the NOS state broadcaster: ""By being present where you think people need support or help, by giving extra attention and presence to worthwhile events and by supporting people who are in need."" One notable absence at Tuesday's ceremony will be the new queen's father, Jorge Zorreguieta, who was a minister during the 1976-1983 Argentinian military dictatorship. Princess Maxima said her family would not attend her swearing-in as queen because of her father's controversial past. ""This is a constitutional event, when my husband becomes king and my father doesn't belong there, especially if there are issues,"" the princess told NOS. ""He remains my father, we still enjoy our private moments."" Mark Saunders, a royal biographer, said he had bumped into the new king and found him to be personable and relaxed. ""I met him in the strangest of circumstances,"" he said. ""I was on a ferry stuck between Estonia and Norway. I spoke to this young pleasant guy who gave me some advice that maybe you should get off (the boat). It was only afterwards that I discovered it was Crown Prince Willem. I remember thinking that this was the most 'non-royal' royal I've ever met. I haven't met that many, but he was a pleasant guy. ""He's young too, only 46 -- so he's the youngest monarch in the world -- the only one who's not gray or bald!"" Saunders said he believed that in contrast to Beatrix, Britain's Queen Elizabeth would never abdicate, because of the 1,000 years of history behind her, and the trauma of her uncle, King Edward VIII's abdication. ""(Britain's royals) believe they have a divine right to rule, which goes back to the Norman Conquest of 1066. They will never break that chain,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Dean Obeidallah, John Avlon and I kick off this week's episode of ""The Big Three"" podcast by tackling Congress' Benghazi hearings from three distinct perspectives. Ever the centrist, my beloved husband John questions whether the hearings are an earnest search for the truth or a hyperpartisan GOP political witch hunt aimed at embarrassing the Obama administration while derailing Hillary Clinton's potential 2016 presidential bid. Dean and I duke it out from opposite perspectives, and we all agree on a surprising point at the end. Then, on to a discussion of the dramatic fractures within the GOP on immigration reform -- a split between former Sen. Jim DeMint's Heritage Foundation and his protÃ©gÃ© Sen. Marco Rubio -- which give Dean cause for celebration. But I'm not sure he will ultimately like the outcome of these GOP growing pains, which I suspect reveal a realignment of Republican reformers from old guard thinking. Cracks in what had been GOP monolithic thinking on issues ranging from immigration to gun control to gay rights -- in a week where Delaware became the 11th state to pass marriage equality with a genuine bipartisan majority -- could reinvigorate the GOP brand and lead to a more competitive party nationally. John thinks renewal and competition in any party orthodoxy is healthy for America, but Dean is clearly rooting for DeMint's success, even if it means the end of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act. To be fair, Dean's a comedian, so maybe his partisanship is good for laughs, but it will give way to a desire for good policy to win the day -- even if the Republicans get some credit. We'll let you decide. Finally, was Gov. Chris Christie's lap band surgery motivated by political ambition or personal health? One of us thinks Americans are too obsessed with weight to elect an obese president. Another worries that the act of losing weight will obscure Christie's record in New Jersey if he decides to challenge Hillary Clinton in 2016. Is it possible for aspiring elected officials to make decisions independent of their political future? We hope you have as much fun hearing us analyze these issues as we had laughing it out over them.

In a statement to CNN, the Pakistani Taliban took responsibility for bombings at the offices of candidates in Peshawar and the Orakzai Agency. Both attacks Sunday targeted independent candidates. The Taliban said it targeted secular candidates, but many parties have been hit by the increasing violence. ""A man cannot be secular and Muslim at a time.

"(CNN) -- A heavily glaciated region of the Himalayas is bucking the trend of global ice loss and showing small signs of increasing in mass, according to a new study. Data examining six regions in the Karakoram mountains in the western Himalayas, which contains 7,700 square miles (nearly 20,000 square kilometers) of glaciers, revealed more than half of them are either stable or have been advancing in recent years. French scientists observed the size and shape of ice covering 2,168 square miles (5,615 square kilometers) in central Karakoram using satellite data from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (STRM) and the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT5). Between 1999 and 2008 the glaciers gained, on average, the water equivalent of around 11 centimeters a year, according to the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Lead author, Julie Gardelle from University of Grenoble in France says explanations for this increase are still not clear, but might lie in the localized climate. ""Studies have already reported an increase in winter precipitation and a lowering of summer temperatures since the 1960s in low-altitude valleys of Karakoram,"" Gardelle said. ""Given the wide extent of high mountain Asia, we cannot expect the climate to be uniform over the whole range, so a peculiar atmospheric behavior over Karakoram may not be surprising,"" she added. The study confirms an anomaly in the region which was put forward in 2005 and contrasts with the experience of the central and eastern Himalayas where most glaciers are shrinking, say researchers. That story is one which is being repeated globally, say the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) and has been since the end of the Little Ice Age around 150 years ago. WGMS estimate that since 1980 the cumulative average thickness loss of monitored glaciers across the world has been 11.3 meters. Despite the overall picture of retreat, there are instances where glaciers are able to re-advance and Karakoram is an example, says WGMS director Michael Kemp. ""The Himalayas is the highest mountain range on Earth with the highest elevation difference. It's a huge area. So we expect regions (of it) to act a bit different,"" Kemp said. Glacier data in the wider Himalayan region hit the headlines in 2010 when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had to apologize for a ""poorly substantiated"" study they cited which claimed all Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035. Kemp told CNN at the time that the data, which found its way into their Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), was flawed, saying there were ""simply no observations available to make these sorts of statements."" But this most recent work using satellites is of great value, he says, giving a picture of what is happening in a region where data has traditionally been scarce due to its remoteness and political issues -- the Karakoram range borders India, Pakistan and China. Despite the slight gains, Gardelle says, the message on climate change remains the same. ""Global warming is far from spatially homogeneous and continuous with time. In our warming world, there are regions of the Earth where, during a few years or decades, the atmosphere is not warming or even cooling,"" Gardelle said. ""Karakoram may be one of those, but we lack consistent high elevation weather station to conclude firmly on this.""","Glaciers in the Karakoram mountains in western Himalayas are stable or gaining mass, new study says .
Data from two satellites reveals small increases since beginning of 21st century .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans in the emerging middle class are becoming savvy consumers, now concerned with brands. They want information about products and they want it now. Skeptical about the messages of the mass media, they crave one-on-one interaction. That's where ""zonal champions"" come in. It's a phrase coined by South African marketing agency The Creative Counsel, describing individuals who live, breathe and promote a brand in specific zones of South Africa. This is marketing turned upside down, but it works in Africa. While the rest of the world is utilizing social media to advertise commodities, The Creative Counsel is utilizing what it calls the ""traditional"" type of social media -- word of mouth. Magdeline Mataboga is a zonal champion. She walks from home to home introducing members of her low-income community to a range of consumer brands. This is called below-the-line marketing and the target market is the lower-end consumer. In the African market you will find millions of these customers, who might have been overlooked in the past by big multinational businesses. Read this: 'Africa's tallest building' set for $10 billion tech city . Zunaid Dinath, chief officer of sales and distribution at mobile communications company Vodacom, says: ""I think typically we've always catered for the formal market and the upper end of the spectrum, but I think when you go to the lower end of the market ... there's a huge opportunity there and they are the next value chain and the next million customers will come from there."" The Creative Counsel is a $50 million company helping multinationals to reach these million consumers; through doing so they are pioneering African marketing solutions. Gil Oved, co-founder and co-CEO of The Creative Council, says: ""Multinational brands are coming from all over the world and they want in on Africa as is obvious, and agencies like ours are helping them engage a consumer in a new, inventive way, which is actually a very old traditional way. It's one-on-one conversations."" And these conversations are taking place at every social event -- be it after church on a Sunday, after a sports match, at ladies clubs, or at stokvels or shisa nyamas -- unique South African social gatherings. Zonal champions will inform and educate members of the emerging middle class in South Africa on what to buy, and why they should buy it. This marketing strategy works in Africa because, as Ran Neu-Ner, co-founder and co-CEO of The Creative Counsel explains, African consumers ""will use something a friend has recommended or a sister or a brother or a parent or any relative has recommended. ""They're quite wary and skeptical to try new things,"" he adds. ""You need to bear in mind one thing -- their disposable income is very, very low, so they can't take chances, they can't buy something and if it doesn't work go and replace it with a competitor, they don't have the means, so they've got to be 100% certain that the purchase that they make, they're comfortable with and it will fulfill their needs."" Read more: African consumers 'underestimated' And to make sure the product will fulfill their needs, these consumers ask a trusted member of the community -- a zonal champion. Vodacom is one of The Creative Counsel's clients; it too utilizes zonal champions to spread its marketing message to consumers who are hard to reach. Shameel Joosub, Group CEO for Vodacom explains: ""In reaching your customers you need to reach them in different ways and one of the big things is that the traditional media doesn't necessarily reach into the far more rural parts of a country... so a lot of it has to be done through word of mouth and promotions. ""What we do is we hire people that actually go out into the different townships, into the different rural areas and really promote the product. They walk the streets and communicate, so they go to taxi ranks and places where people gather and really spend a lot of time promoting the product."" Nontando Vena is a Vodacom promoter who spends a lot of time at a taxi rank in a township called Soshanguve, north of Johannesburg. She says that this type of marketing is effective because it's in a language that consumers understand. ""Because you sound like them mostly and they can relate, if they've got any questions that need to be answered they're able to approach you better,"" she says. She says that her community members sometimes call her Miss Vodacom, because she represents the brand. For the community, a big multinational such as Vodacom now has a face and a voice and can give one-on-one advice on a daily basis. ""Zonal champions aren't like normal promoters, they don't usually have working hours ... when you live and breathe a brand and you're passionate about it, you do it 24/7, 365,"" says Oved. Read More: Consumer giant targets Africa's billion potential shoppers . Apart from bridging the gap between the big multinational and the consumer this marketing strategy also provides employment opportunities for South Africans. Unemployment in South Africa remains a pressing issue, where more than 24% of the citizens are unemployed. Neu-Ner says that they found a niche: ""We found that there's a whole lot of people uneducated and previously probably unemployable, so to speak, and we found a methodology of training and managing these people so we can actually give them a job as a zonal champion or a brand champion, as someone who can drive a message into their communities. ""Typically our trainings are a day, two days, three or four days at maximum and the guys walk in with absolutely no sales knowledge, no knowledge of what a brand is, no marketing knowledge and they walk out doing things like using body language techniques to sell products."" But it's about more than selling products. It's about developing trust that will ultimately lead to sales. Oved explains: ""There's a wonderful Zulu idiom, it goes, 'Isandla siya kezane,' which means one hand washes the other. That is the kind of communal perspective that Africans have, which brands that come from all over the world need to understand. ""It means that if you're a brand that needs to support me in the community, create employment opportunities, gives me real product information, I will support you and buy your product -- one hand washes the other. ""If brands can tap into that and build that trust, then they'll win the African continent over.""","African consumers largely skeptical about traditional mass-media advertising .

""As we got more and more comfortable using it and being honest in what we were saying, I think a lot of people started tuning in and saying, 'You know, this is our only gateway into what's really going on in the campaign,'"" Abby said to CBS after an interview on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Some of the tweets have been scrutinized, like one written by Liddy during a recent foreign policy debate. It poked fun at the credentials of the other candidates compared to those of her father, who served as U.S. ambassador to China under President Obama. ""Looks like they don't need adults in the room. Panda Express is enough experience to carry on,"" the tweet said. Others are serious, like the recent tweet that paid homage to service members on Veterans Day, and some are just plain fun. ""Is it us? Or did everyone get a bad haircut for this debate?"" read a tweet last week. During an interview with CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" on Wednesday, the conversation ranged from their father's campaign momentum to his attire and haircut. In a question that stemmed from their hair-related tweets, Morgan asked which of the candidates has the worst haircut. ""We think our dad had the best haircut,"" Abby said after a pause, refusing to rise to Morgan's bait. ""It might have been the humidity in Michigan, but I think everyone must have gone to the same barber before the debate."" They've ventured into slightly chartered territory. Most recently Meghan McCain, daughter of 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain, leveraged a behind-the-scenes blog into an online column, a book deal and a contributor role at MSNBC. The five sons of current and former Republican candidate Mitt Romney traveled via bus during the last election cycle. Although children of the other candidates have accompanied their parents on the trail, this time around none has done so as consistently or as publicly as the Huntsman daughters. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Rich Galen said children of presidential candidates are rarely in the limelight and that the spouses usually hold a more important role. ""They tend to generate more problems than they solve, both for the campaign staff because of tinkering and for the campaign itself because they become a separate story,"" Galen said of candidate's mates. ""Huntsman's daughters are trying to help their dad, but as he is bumping along at between 1 and 3%, no one is paying much attention to Jon or to his daughters,"" Galen said. But Huntsman communications director Tim Miller said the campaign is ""thrilled"" the daughters are ""on the trail helping to spread his message."" ""They've been a huge asset in reaching out to young voters and showing the governor's personal side in a fun way,"" Miller said. And they're not just tweeting their observations to their more than 12,000 followers. Mary Anne told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that she is helping the campaign on the finance side while Liddy is helping with outreach to young professionals and college age voters. Abby is ""doing a lot of media stuff."" ""So you know, we do have a big job aside from Jon2012girls,"" Mary Anne said. When asked about the viability of their father's presidential bid, they are quick to offer explanations for his low national and statewide poll numbers, cheerily predicting success. ""He hasn't had a chance to have America see him yet,"" Mary Anne told Morgan on Wednesday. ""He is the only candidate that can give Barack Obama a run for his money, and we hope that America can see that eventually."" Huntsman acknowledges the potential for mishap looms, but he told CNN that his daughters' success represents new campaign realities. ""Here's a reality in my life ... I give a major foreign policy speech on America's role in the world in the 21st century, I get five hits on YouTube. The girls put up this cornball video spoofing another candidate's video, they get half a million views within 24 hours,"" Huntsman said. ""And I say the world isn't fair, but I'm beginning to understand how political communication works these days."" After the Cain campaign released a buzzed-about video showing the pizza executive's mustached chief of staff, Mark Block, taking a long drag on a cigarette, Jon2012girls released a parody spot of their own. Equipped with fake mustaches, the three women blew bubbles instead of smoke. The video has nearly 300,000 hits on YouTube. Yes, they're infusing humor into the campaign, but Abby also stressed the serious side of their message. ""We're doing this to introduce our dad to America,"" she told Morgan. ""I think the campaign trusts us ... And they know that we're only out there to really get his message out as best as we can."" And are more videos forthcoming? ""I guess you'll just have to wait and see,"" Liddy said. ""There's always something up our sleeves,"" Abby said.","Jon Huntsman's daughter hit Twitter, TV, YouTube to support Dad's campaign .

"(CNN) -- A storm system that produced a number of tornadoes in the Midwest was blamed for at least seven deaths in two states, officials said Wednesday. At least three people were killed when a tornado touched down in Harrisburg, Illinois, early Wednesday, the Saline County Sheriff's Office said. About 100 others were injured. The number of fatalities in Harrisburg could rise, the city's mayor said, in the wake of the twister that appeared to have been on the ground for several miles, said the city's mayor, Eric Gregg. The path of destruction was about three or four football fields wide, he said. The scene in the southern part of Harrisburg, where the tornado struck, was one of debris and collapsed houses. Commercial and residential buildings were crushed. A tractor-trailer could be seen laying on its side, off the highway. Crews were searching ""piece by piece"" for survivors, Gregg said. It was ""a path of destruction that is absolutely devastating,"" he said. ""It's a very difficult day for a very good community in southern Illinois."" At least five people were killed in Harrisburg because of the storm, he said. According to the sheriff's office, some 100 people were injured and between 250 and 300 houses were damaged or destroyed. Some 25 businesses were also damaged or destroyed, the sheriff's office said. Crews were also examining some structural damage to the Harrisburg Medical Center, to judge whether any patients must be moved, Gregg said. ""It's like nothing I've ever seen, and something I don't care to see again,"" he said. Earlier, two deaths were reported in Missouri as a result of the storms. A woman was killed overnight in Dallas County, Missouri, the coroner there said, without giving further details. An apparent tornado near Cassville, Missouri, left another person dead, the Barry County Sheriff's Office said. That person was thrown out of a mobile home, the sheriff's office said. Tornado in Kansas captured on video . The pounding rain and swirling, destructive winds raking several Plains states injured others in Kansas, as well. That state was socked Tuesday night and Gov. Sam Brownback declared a state of emergency for a small town hit badly by the severe weather. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center issued tornado watches through noon for parts of Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Arkansas, Illinois and Missouri. Along with tornadoes, the center warned of the possibility of golf-ball-sized hail, winds up to 75 miles per hour and ""dangerous lightning."" The state of emergency was declared for the tiny Kansas town of Harveyville, about 20 miles southwest of Topeka. Emergency teams combed the community to assess damage. Authorities said they believe a tornado hit the town Tuesday night. Some homes and a church were damaged, and there were numerous reports of trees and power lines down throughout the area, according to the Kansas Adjutant General's Department. At least one person was critically injured and transported to a hospital in Topeka while four others were briefly trapped in a structure. ""It is quite hectic,"" said Bill Beasley of the American Medical Response for Shawnee and Wabaunsee counties, who said nine ambulances were dispatched to the scene. The American Red Cross is assisting and officials have set up a shelter at a local high school. There were also reports of a tornado touchdown in Kansas' Reno County, near Hutchinson, and another in central Nebraska. The same powerful winter storm system spawned the severe weather in Dallas County, Missouri, and along the Missouri-Arkansas border. A path of destruction cut six to seven miles through Taney County, Missouri, damaging homes and businesses, according to Sheriff Jim Russell, who said there were ""some injuries,"" but no reports of fatalities. The resort community of Branson is in the county. Russell said he had no specific information about damage in the town.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer suffered a stunning upset defeat to John Isner as the United States took a 2-0 lead Friday in their Davis Cup World Group first round match in Switzerland. Home favorite Federer was in action for the first time since losing to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of the Australian Open and could find no answer to an inspired Isner, who won 4-6 6-3 7-6 6-2. It followed an earlier 6-2 4-6 4-6 6-1 9-7 win for Mardy Fish over Stanislav Wawrinka in the first rubber of the tie. World No.3 Federer was expected to tie it up on the indoor clay court in Fribourg, which was selected by the Swiss hosts, but Isner, best-known for his marathon match against Nicolas Mahut at Wimbledon, again showed his aptitude on the slower surface. Spain fury over drugs slur . After dropping the opening set, the American took the next three to close out victory in two hours 40 minutes, ending a 15-match winning streak for Federer in the Davis Cup. ""The way I played today is the way I need to play in all my matches,"" said Isner after his surprise victory. ""I owe it to Jim Courier (American Davis Cup captain) -- he was on at me to hit all my shots. It's the win of my life."" Fish, despite his higher ranking, was not favored against Wawrinka, but showed his fighting qualities in a four hour 26 minute match. He played superbly in the fourth set to level the match for the loss of a single game and always looked the stronger in the 16-game decider. ""I lost a couple of long ones in Austin last year, and that feels so bad I just needed to win this one.' Fish told the official Davis Cup website.

"(CNN) -- A simple goal brought Alyssa Rieber to attend medical school at the University of Alabama at Birmingham 15 years ago. ""Just helping people,"" she says. ""And I know that sounds so trite, and that's what everybody says, but that's really why I wanted to be a doctor... to help people."" Rieber says she loved the movie ""Doc Hollywood"" with Michael J. Fox, in which a doctor is sentenced to work in a small-town hospital. ""I was like, 'That's what I want to do.' So I was all ready to move out into a small town and take care of everybody and be the town doctor. And then during my first few months of med school, things shifted quite a bit (when) I was diagnosed with cancer."" Rieber says learning about the different types of cancer and the latest research inspired her to study oncology. But it was meeting the other cancer patients in the waiting room that cemented her career path. I found 'life's calling' after paralyzing injury . ""Getting to know them and their stories ... I just decided that that's what I wanted to do."" Rieber's cancer diagnosis was actually the result of an anatomy lesson three months into medical school. Her class was discussing an esophageal cancer patient who had a lymph node in his neck. ""I was assigned to evaluate the lymphatics of the thorax and so this was my assignment for this one case. And I did it, I gave a presentation, all of that."" The next week, she felt a lump in the same place the patient had it. ""Of course, as a hypochondriac medical student, (I thought) I had esophageal cancer and I was going to die."" It took a month before Rieber knew what exactly what she was dealing with. The diagnosis: Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph tissue found in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow and other sites, according to the National Institutes of Health. Rieber says she knew her prognosis was good and was determined to continue medical school while undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments. She went on to start a fellowship at one of the premier cancer centers in the world, the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and she's never left. She now heads the oncology department at Houston's Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital. Having been a cancer patient has influenced how she interacts with patients, she says.

"(CNN)  -- Next month, the Vidalia Onion Committee, a Georgia group that promotes the consumption of sweet onions, will roll out 6-foot cardboard cutouts of the ogre Shrek as a tie-in to the latest film in the series, ""Shrek Forever After."" In turn, the Georgia-based growers group hopes the green guy will turn children on to eating Vidalia onions. ""We do like to market to younger audiences and teach them about our product,"" said Wendy Brannen, the committee's executive director. Although it's not the first time movie advertising has taken to the produce aisle (Disney promoted the DVD release of Peter Pan a few years ago with stickers on fresh tomatoes), it's definitely one of the most prominent displays. It's become almost commonplace to see the latest cartoon character pop up on a cereal box or a Happy Meal, but these characters have been creeping up among fresh fruit and vegetable displays in recent years, which industry officials say is all good if it gets children to eat more produce. In a study published last year by the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, researchers at Ohio State University found that adolescents don't meet guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption, and fruit and juice consumption drops once children turn 6. Popeye and the characters from Disney and Peanuts are among the cartoons that have been featured by produce companies, says Patrick Delaney, communications manager for the United Fresh Produce Association in Washington. And last summer, Sesame Street's Cookie Monster teamed up with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to promote children eating a rainbow of fresh produce. Shrek seemed an obvious choice for the Vidalia campaign, Brannen says, because the ogre compares himself to an onion in the first Shrek film. ""Ogres are like onions,"" Shrek tells Donkey: ""Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers."" Beginning in late April when Vidalia onions are harvested and up through the movie's May 21 premiere, Shrek cutouts will decorate produce aisles in thousands of stores, Brannen says. Along with taking home kid-friendly recipes, shoppers can enter to win a 50-inch television, a Nintendo Wii game system and a Shrek video game. In the meantime, here are our five favorite produce spokescartoons: . Donald Duck . Imagination Farms tapped Disney's wubbable Donald Duck to tout the wonders of cauliflower to the young generation under its Disney Garden line.

Hinkle Produce of Cissna Park, Illinois, puts its pumpkin haul in big orange bins with Charlie, Snoopy and Linus proclaiming, ""It's the Great Pumpkin!"" Popeye . It could be argued that Popeye has been selling kids on spinach since his inception in 1929.

"(CNN) -- Days after a senator and a police official raised security concerns, the Interior Department has reversed a National Parks Service plan to screen visitors only after they arrived by ferry at two of New York's landmarks -- Ellis and Liberty islands. In a letter written to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewel announced the change and requested that a security screening facility be built in Manhattan's Battery Park so visitors will be screened before embarking for the historic islands. Jewell requested that the city immediately begin getting the permits to build a temporary security screening facility in Manhattan before the July 4th opening weekend for Liberty Island, which is home to the Statue of Liberty. Both islands were hard hit by Superstorm Sandy in October and have been closed since then. Ellis Island will remain closed as it undergoes extensive repairs. A National Parks Service spokesman said in a statement that the agency remains committed to implementing a plan that does not compromise the safety of their visitors. ""Safety will continue to be our number one priority as we re-establish a temporary screening facility at Battery Park,"" said park service spokesman John Warren. ""We are prepared to begin work immediately and appreciate the partnership with the City of New York that we will need to allow for a reopening of the Statue on July 4."" Recent park service changes -- with visitors to be allowed on ferries and on the islands before security scrutiny -- were challenged by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and New York City Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly. Criticizing the proposed security changes, Kelly told reporters last week, ""The NYPD and the National Park Service have differences when it comes to ideas on how to protect visitors from a terrorist attack."" ""It's sort of ridiculous. It's sort of saying we are going to screen people at airports after they get on the plane,"" Schumer told reporters last week. ""They've made a serious mistake here, and we are asking them to rethink it, to change it and simply go back to the old procedure."" In response to Jewell's letter announcing the change, Schumer thanked the Interior Department for its quick decision in time for the July holiday weekend. ""This solution wisely avoids any trade-off between speed-of-opening and optimum security procedures,"" said Schumer. ""The Statue of Liberty is vital to maintaining our pre-eminence as the tourist capital of America, and with these procedures in place, it can continue to safely draw people from around the world."" Since 9/11, visitors have been screened at a lower Manhattan security checkpoint before boarding the daily ferries to the islands.","The National Park Service had planned to relocate screening to the islands .

The Russian photographer said his motivation was simple: ""We saw the old photographs of the Pyramids and decided to climb on it."" He also said he wasn't aware of the risk and illegality, but reports that Raskalov's previous daredevil activities (skywalking on the Russky Island Bridge) landed him in custody suggest otherwise.

"(CNN) -- A brush fire near Tampa, Florida, prompted authorities Saturday afternoon to shut down Interstate 75 in both directions, a local sheriff's office said. The blaze was centered in Ruskin, about 20 miles south of Tampa near Florida's Gulf coast, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. First reported as extending five acres, the fire eventually grew to 50 acres, said Hillsborough County Fire Rescue spokesman Ronnie Rivera. Southbound traffic was being diverted off the highway at Sun City Center ""due to zero visibility."" For a time, vehicles likely were also prohibited from moving northbound. The closure extended for 11 miles -- between mile markers 229 and 240 -- the Florida Department of Transportation reported on Twitter. By 3:15 p.m., the fire was contained -- although, by then, a mobile home was destroyed and several vehicles had burned, according to Rivera. Conditions had improved enough to allow for I-75 traffic to resume moving northbound; southbound traffic was still stopped because of poor visibility. The National Weather Service had issued a hazardous weather outlook for the area, warning that ""dry fuels and low relative humidity will result in favorable conditions for the spread of wild fires."" Saturday's forecast for Ruskin was for mostly sunny skies with high temperatures around 76 degrees and sustained south-southwest winds of around 10 mph. Conditions should be even warmer and windier Sunday, the weather service predicts, with a high near 80 degrees and winds gusting as strong as 21 mph. Video on CNN affiliate WFTS's website showed white smoke rising near the highway -- as throngs of vehicles in one direction sat seemingly at a standstill -- and mingled with puffs of clouds on an otherwise picture-perfect spring day.

"(CNN) -- In the end, it was security camera video that made the difference. Yanira Maldonado, an Arizona mother of three children and four stepchildren who spent nine days detained in Mexico under suspicion of smuggling marijuana, was released from a Nogales, Mexico, prison Friday, mainly because of that video. The judge's ruling, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows the surveillance video from a bus terminal and the testimony of three witnesses, were more than sufficient to convince Maria del Carmen Salcedo Garcia, a Mexican federal judge in the border city of Nogales, Mexico; to give Maldonado her freedom back. The prosecution's case, the 29-page document shows, was merely circumstantial. In other words, Maldonado was arrested simply because one of two packages of marijuana discovered on the bus was found under her seat. In the ruling, Salcedo Garcia calls the prosecution's case ""not apt or sufficient to corroborate that Yanira Maldonado ... is the person who transported the narcotics."" Maldonado, 42, and her husband Gary, 41, were traveling together after attending her aunt's funeral in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, according to the ruling and to interviews conducted with the couple by CNN. They boarded a bus belonging to the Tufesa bus company in the city of Los Mochis on their way back home to the town of Goodyear, outside Phoenix. Their bus was stopped at a military checkpoint May 22 in the town of Querobabi, in the state of Sonora, where three soldiers found two packages containing marijuana, the document says. The drugs, wrapped in clear plastic with ""cinnamon-colored"" tape, weighed 6.003 kilos (13.23 pounds), according to evidence presented in court and referenced in the judge's ruling. It had been originally reported by Mexican authorities the two packages had a combined weight of 5.7 kilograms. Both Yanira and Gary Maldonado were initially detained. Gary Maldonado was later released because neither of the two packages of marijuana was found under his seat. One was found under his wife's seat, number 39. The other was under seat 42, which was unoccupied. The bus driver, identified by the court document as Jorge Luis Flores Grijalva, also was detained. He, too, was released from prison last Friday, just hours before Maldonado. According to the judge's ruling, three witnesses -- the bus driver and two fellow passengers -- testified that the Maldonados boarded the bus in Los Mochis carrying only two blankets and her personal purse. The surveillance video, shown to the court last Thursday at a hearing to which CNN had access, shows, in addition to the blankets and the purse, Yanira Maldonado was carrying two bottles of water and nothing more. In issuing the ruling, Salcedo Garcia said the fact that ""the narcotics in question were found under seat number 39 of bus 323 of the Tufesa Bus Company which was occupied by the defendant does not lead us to conclude in an indisputable way that the drugs were in possession of Yanira Maldonado."" The judge also sided with defense attorney Francisco Benitez in saying that it would have been impossible for the Maldonados to somehow hide such an amount of drugs while boarding. ""It is illogical and also not credible to believe the packages could've been placed (by the Maldonados) where they were found,"" the judge said, ""without any other passenger on the bus noticing it."" Speaking to CNN last Wednesday, in her first interview from inside the prison, recorded two days before her release, Maldonado had raised the same objections the judge mentions in her ruling. ""They have cameras in the terminals, on the bus. And they haven't checked that,"" Maldonado told CNN. ""Why don't they check for fingerprints? I don't have my fingerprints on the package."" A top official in the Mexican state of Sonora said that, so far as the Mexican government is concerned, ""the case is closed."" The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to speak publicly about the case, said nobody else is expected to be prosecuted. The soldiers who detained the Maldonados ""were only doing their job,"" the official said.","Surveillance video from a bus terminal and the testimony of three witnesses carried the day .

"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Three million dollars: That's the price a housekeeper's daughter allegedly demanded from her mother's former employer, the family that founded Claire's accessories stores. In exchange, Camille Brown said she would return dozens of allegedly incriminating letters written by Sylvia Schaefer, the wife of Claire's founder Rowland Schaefer, according to newly released audio tapes. That exchange never happened. This week, Florida police have released audio recordings that they say detail a case of extortion. According to police, it all started when the Schaefers fired their longtime housekeeper, Coleen Parkes, who was released after she said she would no longer clean up after the caretakers of the elderly Schaefers. Parkes had worked for the family for 15 years, according to the police documents. The Schaefers, now in their 90s, made millions from Claire's, a staple in many American shopping malls known for enticing teenage girls with its inexpensive jewelry and other accessories. Days after her mother was fired, Camille Brown, 32, e-mailed the Schaefers' daughter, Bonnie, saying that she had more than 50 letters written by Sylvia Schaefer and that she was ready to sell them to the ""highest bidder."" In the e-mail -- which was released as part of court documents -- she asked Bonnie Schaefer for a ""commitment to protecting your family's name and reputation of your father."" Bonnie Schaefer arranged a meeting with the housekeeper's daughter at a hotel lobby on October 2. Camille Brown thought she was meeting with a family representative, but she was actually talking to a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The undercover agent, James Born, wore a wire and recorded his conversation with Brown. On the audio recordings, he can be heard asking, ""What do you feel is fair to get the correspondence back? That's what we really want to know."" Brown responds by saying, ""I feel fair market value is fair."" When pressed for an amount, Brown showed the agent an index card with $3,000,000 written on it, according to court documents. ""Three million dollars?"" Born replies. ""That amount is sufficient based on what I have,"" she responds. When Born says that the family isn't going to agree to $3 million, Brown says, ""That's like the minimum. I can go higher but nothing lower."" As Brown attempts to leave, Born asks about paying in installments, and they set up a second meeting to finalize the agreement. The terms of an agreement were reached at that second meeting on October 9 and signed by both parties. The agreement that Brown signed reads, ""For the total payment of $3,000,000 in US currency demanded by Camille Brown, all efforts to coerce, control, blackmail or extort the Schaefer family or any associated businesses will end and not be resumed."" The agreement also said that in exchange for the money, Brown would hand over the family documents. As Brown left the hotel, she was arrested on one count of extortion. Brown has maintained her innocence. ""Ms. Brown intends to take this case to trial and to present incontrovertible evidence proving that she never tried to blackmail, bribe or extort the Schaefers into buying the letters that were lawfully hers,"" her attorney Guy Fronstin told CNN in an e-mail. In the original e-mail Brown sent to Bonnie Schaefer, she said that the letters were given to her by Sylvia Schaefer. The Schaefer family attorney disputes that. ""We filed a civil suit to get those letters back, so it's the family's position that she didn't lawfully obtain those letters,"" attorney William Shepherd said. He said the case is about taking advantage of an elderly couple. Until a court rules otherwise, the letters that Brown claims she has will remain in her possession. Brown's trial on the extortion charge is scheduled for June 24, and she faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted.

"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Britain says it will continue to press for an independent investigation into the case of three British citizens who say they were tortured before being sentenced Monday to four years in prison on drug charges in the United Arab Emirates. Grant Cameron, Karl Williams and Suneet Jeerh, all in their mid-20s, say they have been subjected to electrical shocks and other abuse. In a letter to London-based legal charity Reprieve, British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote that ""our concerns about the allegations of torture ... have been repeatedly raised with the Emirati authorities, including by the Foreign Secretary and (Foreign Office Minister) Alastair Burt."" The prime minister added that ""the absence of an independent medical examination (of the men) remains a concern,"" and that Britain continues to press for evidence of a full, impartial and independent investigation. The manager of the Dubai police human rights department, Mohammad Al-Mur, said investigators looked into allegations that the men had confessed after being tortured and found no evidence to support the claims. Al-Mur told CNN Arabic that men's accusations ""were rejected after being investigated in accordance with international standards by Dubai police."" The developments come a day ahead of UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan's scheduled state visit to Britain. Cameron, Williams and Jeerh were arrested in July and charged with consumption and possession of the synthetic cannabis product known as spice. Their conviction Monday on the consumption charges carries a minimum of four years of imprisonment. The supply charges against the men were dropped, said Kate Higham, a lawyer for Reprieve. Higham has been in touch with the defendants' attorneys, who have declined to speak with CNN. While pleased that the defendants did not get heavier sentences, ""we think they should not have been convicted at all,"" Higham said. ""We will continue to push for the men's release and return in light of the torture they have suffered. We hope the UAE president would take this opportunity to show that he shares the British public's concern about torture,"" Higham said. The men could have faced 15 years if convicted of possession with intent to distribute. In a text, Cameron's mother, Tracy Cameron, called the sentence ""great news."" Rights group: Britons tortured after arrest on drug charges . Claims of abuse . The men say police beat them and subjected them to electric shocks after their July 10 arrest, according to Reprieve, which provides legal support to prisoners. The case began when Cameron and Williams were visiting Dubai on vacation. Jeerh had moved to Dubai from Britain about six weeks earlier in hopes of getting a job in media, Higham said. The Britons were driving a rented car, and when they reached Jeerh's apartment building, they were arrested. The three allege they were then taken to the desert and then to Williams' and Cameron's hotel, said Marc Calcutt, who had earlier represented them on behalf of Reprieve. ""I remember that the police put a towel on my face so I could not see. They kept telling me I was going to die,"" Williams said in a statement released by Reprieve. ""Then they took off the towel and I could see that there was a gun pointed at my head ... I started to believe that I was going to die in that room."" At one point, police pulled his pants down and zapped his testicles with electric shocks, Williams alleged. Calcutt also said Williams' hand was kicked until it was broken and said he has X-rays to prove it. Tracy Cameron said her son told her that police used a Taser on him and put guns to their heads, but she said she hasn't been able to get all the details because he is never alone. The men were pressured to sign documents in Arabic, without translation, after multiple beatings, Reprieve said. A ""neutral party"" appointed to investigate if any torture had occurred found the claims untrue, a Dubai police statement released in February said. But Calcutt said he was skeptical. ""No one knows who that neutral party is. I have not seen a report. I would love to see any investigative report,"" Calcutt said. Leone Lakhani reported from Abu Dhabi, and Holly Yan wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: Torture claims unfounded, Dubai police official says .

"(CNN) -- Brazil's preparations for hosting the 2014 World Cup have been hit by a series of setbacks in the past year, and the national team's results on the football pitch have been just as patchy. Sunday's 2-2 draw with England at the newly reopened Maracana stadium -- a match that almost didn't take place due to a midweek bureaucratic mixup -- continued a poor start to Luiz Felipe Scolari's second reign as coach. Scolari, who masterminded Brazil's record fifth World Cup success in 2002, has had four draws and a win since losing 2-1 to England in London in February. His side failed to defeat an England team which is struggling to qualify for the World Cup, and may need to go through the playoffs as it is second in its group behind Montenegro. It is not the sort of form the nation's football-mad fans expect ahead of the Confederations Cup warm-up tournament later this month, where Brazil will defend its title on home soil. The iconic Maracana, which hosted the decisive game of the 1950 World Cup when Brazil agonizingly lost to Uruguay, has been extensively renovated since the last time England visited in 1984. The visitors then won 2-0, the last overseas team to triumph at the Rio venue, and the son of one of those players was on target on Sunday. Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain, whose father Mark won one of his eight England caps on that occasion almost 30 years ago, came on as a second-half substitute and fired his team's leveler in the 67th minute. England looked set for another famous win when Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney -- who also scored in February's Wembley match -- ran at the retreating defense and fired a shot that looped into the net after hitting the back of Fernando. However, Brazil ensured that would not happen as Paulinho slotted in a sublime volley from Lucas Moura's right-wing cross with eight minutes to play. The home side had dominated the first half in front of 66,000 fans, but did not take the lead until 12 minutes after the break when Fred pounced following a lofted long-range shot from Hernanes that came back off the crossbar. Scolari now has one more match, against France in Porto Alegro next Sunday, before beginning the eight-nation Confederations Cup against Japan on June 15. The organizers have been rushing to get the stadiums ready in time. Only four of the six stadiums were ready by April's original deadline, while last week the roof at the venue in Salvador collapsed due to ""human error"" following heavy rain. The Maracana reconstruction has been plagued by delays, and last week a court ruled that the ground was not ready for the England match due to safety concerns, before the Rio government appealed the decision -- blaming a failure to deliver the required reports to the legislative body. Meanwhile, German soccer came back to earth with a bump Sunday as the national team lost 4-3 to the United States in Washington. Germany, second in the world rankings, trailed 4-1 before staging a late comeback. The Americans, coached by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann, took a 13th-minute lead through Jozy Altidore's superb volley and then visiting goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen made a mess of a back pass from defender Benedikt Howedes and the ball dribbled across the line and into the net. Germany captain Miroslav Klose thought he had equaled Gerd Muller's national record of 68 goals, but was ruled out for offside. Second-half substitute Heiko Westermann headed in Max Kruse's corner to reduce the deficit but Tottenham forward Clint Dempsey fired two goals to go second on the U.S. all-time list with 35 overall, 14 behind Landon Donovan. Kruse smashed in his first international goal on 79 and Julian Draxler added another from close range, but Germany could not prevent a first loss to the U.S. since 1999. It was the end of a long season for a German squad missing most of the key players who contested the European Champions League final for Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, but it was an important preparation for the Americans -- who next take on Jamaica, Panama and Honduras in three World Cup qualifying matches. It was a joyful reunion for Klinsmann, whose Germany counterpart Joachim Low was his assistant when he coached his national team at the 2006 World Cup. In Sunday's other international friendlies, Cameroon drew 0-0 with Ukraine, the Republic of Ireland beat Georgia 4-0, Algeria won 2-0 against Burkina Faso, South Africa defeated Lesotho by the same score, and there was a stalemate between Sudan and Tanzania.","Paulinho scores a late equalizer in Brazil's 2-2 draw with England in Rio de Janeiro .

"(CNN) -- After age 60, we are all likely passengers on the Alzheimer's Express. These days it's overcrowded with baby boomers and is predicted by 2050 to claim 115 million victims worldwide, including 13.5 million Americans (up from 5.1 million today), bankrupting our health care system. That will happen, says a recent Alzheimer's Association report, unless we slow down this terrible disease. The good news is: Most of us can. It's true that pharmaceutical drugs have failed miserably to stop or reverse the disease. A cure is not on the immediate horizon. ""Maybe not for 100 years, or ever,"" says Dr. Jack C. de la Torre, a prominent Alzheimer's researcher at the National Institutes of Health-funded Banner Sun Health Research Institute in Arizona. ""The answer,"" he says, as do thousands of other Alzheimer's researchers, ""is prevention,"" the same strategy we use against other chronic diseases of aging, such as heart disease. The evidence that we can cut our risk of Alzheimer's is compelling and mounting constantly. It is true that your vulnerability to Alzheimer's and other dementias is definitely influenced by your genes. Early onset Alzheimer's, before age 60, is caused by genetic mutations and is thus quite strongly inherited. But in late-onset Alzheimer's, which appears after age 60 and accounts for 90 to 95 percent of all cases, genes are not destiny; they simply make us more susceptible. I have the major ""susceptibility gene"" known as ApoE4, that triples my risk of developing Alzheimer's in late life. Seventy-seven million other Americans (25 percent of the population) also carry it. But Alzheimer's is more of a personal and public health choice than most people realize, as shown by thousands of scientific papers on the subject. ""A lot of Alzheimer's is about lifestyle -- what you do and even who you are, your personality,"" says prominent Alzheimer's researcher Robert Wilson at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center. Effective deterrents to Alzheimer's, according to Wilson: a higher education, staying mentally active, eating the right foods, exercising, muscle-building and being conscientious, easy-going and an extrovert. Much research ties Alzheimer's to the same lifestyle factors that cause heart attacks and strokes: high cholesterol, blood pressure, high blood sugar, insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. ""Taking care of your heart protects your brain,"" says De la Torre. He urges preventing Alzheimer's by screening for and treating cardiovascular disease in middle age, years before signs of memory loss and dementia appear. Two other striking ways to ward off Alzheimer's: Stop smoking and avoid heavy drinking, especially binge drinking. Smoking doubles your risk of Alzheimer's, according to a recent University of California, San Francisco analysis. Excessive alcohol brings on Alzheimer's two to three years earlier, UCLA scientists found. Bottom line: Most Alzheimer's, like heart disease and cancer, is a slowly developing chronic disease of aging that takes a decade or more to produce memory loss and dementia. Its progression is accelerated or slowed by diet, personality, lifestyle factors and other health conditions, such as treatable thyroid abnormalities and depression. Thus, we all have many years in which to stall this disease and perhaps outlive its devastating symptoms. If we could delay the onset of Alzheimer's by only five years, 1.6 million Americans now expected to get Alzheimer's by 2015, and 6 million by 2050, would be spared, according to the Alzheimer's Association projections. Estimated Medicare savings would be $33 billion in 2020 and $283 billion by midcentury. We can each help save ourselves by intervening as early as possible before the disease seizes our brain and memory loss is irreversible. The older we get, the greater our risk. About half of all people over age 85 have Alzheimer's. Our best hope for defeating the looming global tragedy of Alzheimer's, due to the rapid growth of an aging population, is to keep millions of people from boarding the Alzheimer's Express in the first place, or at least to show them how to jump off before the final destination, which offers no hope of a round-trip ticket. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jean Carper.","Jean Carper says by 2050 13.5 million in U.S. projected to have Alzheimer's .
She says research shows most Alzheimer's can be held off a few years with lifestyle choices .

"(CNN) -- After nearly 15 months being held captive by suspected Islamic militants in the southern Philippines, Warren Rodwell is emaciated, exhausted but delighted to be free at last. Philippine authorities found Rodwell, a 54-year-old Australian, early Saturday in the port city of Pagadian on the island of Mindanao. He had been taken hostage in December 2011, when armed men showed up at the residence where he and his Filipina wife lived on Mindanao. His captors, believed to be part of the Islamic extremist group Abu Sayyaf, demanded a ransom of $2 million, a sum the Australian government refused to pay. As his detention dragged on, his family and officials in Australia and the Philippines continued to work to try to secure his release. Their efforts paid off when a Philippine port employee reportedly spotted a sodden and mud-flecked Rodwell trudging ashore in Pagadian before daybreak on Saturday. Appearing gaunt with sunken cheeks and spindly limbs in photos and videos after his release, Rodwell is now receiving medical treatment. He was expected to be reunited with his brother and sister, who are in the Philippines. Relief for the family . ""We're happy and relieved that Warren has finally been released,"" his sister Denise Cappello said at a news briefing in Manila on Monday. ""I'm sure you will understand that this has been a very difficult and exhausting ordeal for Warren,"" his brother Wayne Rodwell said at the same briefing. ""It has also been a difficult time for his family."" ""He is delighted to be free,"" he said. ""He has, however, lost a lot of weight and is exhausted. He will need special medical support as well as time and space to recover."" Reports in the Australian and Philippine news media suggested that Rodwell's family had paid a ransom worth nearly $100,000 in return for his release. His brother and sister declined to field questions at the news conference in Manila. The Philippine government on Sunday said that its policy is not to pay ransoms for victims of kidnappings, the official Philippines News Agency reported. ""Having said that, we have no information or confirmation on that alleged ransom that was paid,"" Deputy Presidential Spokesperson Abigail Valte said. A separatist group . Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines' minority Muslim population, has been blamed for several terrorist attacks, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as previous kidnappings. Although the Philippine government agreed a preliminary peace deal last year with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, a leading rebel group in the country's restive south, some extremists are still active. ""We wish the Philippine police every success in tracking down the group that took Warren from his home,"" Cappello said. ""We hope they will be brought to justice, so others don't have to experience what Warren has just been through,"" she added. The Australian government welcomed Rodwell's release over the weekend, paying tribute to the Philippine government agencies that try to tackle kidnapping cases. Prime Minister Julia Gillard also acknowledged what his relatives had gone through. ""Mr. Rodwell's family have shown a great deal of courage and stoicism in what has been a tremendously difficult situation,"" she said.","Warren Rodwell was taken hostage in December 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Days after a coup plunged the Central African Republic into chaos, looters roamed the streets of the capital, robbing hospitals and preventing fearful residents from seeking treatment. A coalition of rebels ousted President Francois Bozize this week, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence from France in 1960. After the deposed president fled the nation, a rebel leader declared himself in charge and urged residents to welcome the new leadership. But as the political turmoil rages, aid agencies are warning of a humanitarian crisis as attacks escalate. Violence, looters and fear of the rebels are preventing critically injured patients from going to health facilities in the capital of Bangui, said French medical aid group, Medecins Sans Frontieres. The aid group -- also known as Doctors Without Borders -- said its facilities were raided. ""MSF condemns the looting and robberies of our facilities and reminds all parties that medical personnel must be respected and protected and must be granted all available help in the performance of their duties,"" said Serge St. Louis, MSF head of mission in Bangui. The United Nations, which also said its offices were looted, urged safe and unhindered humanitarian access to victims of violence. About 1.5 million people need assistance, and the number will go up unless aid workers are allowed unlimited access, the United Nations said Tuesday. What's behind the turmoil in the Central African Republic . The most vulnerable are children, who have been separated from relatives and are at risk of being recruited as soldiers, it said. ""Those responsible for violations and abuses of international humanitarian and human rights law, including violence against civilians, sexual and gender-based violence, and recruitment and use of children must be held accountable,"" the U. N. Security Council said in a statement. The nation of 5.1 million has a history of political chaos. In March 2003, Bozize led a coup that deposed his predecessor -- then-President Ange-Felix Patasse. Though Bozize won elections in 2005 and 2011, he did not have full control of the nation. Rebel groups have operated for years, especially in rural areas. Last year, several rebel groups came under the umbrella name of Seleka started seizing parts of the country. Seleka is a coalition of ragtag fighters, whose popularity was boosted by the discontent against the deposed president. They accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal, and demanded that he step down. In January, both warring sides brokered a peace deal that included a cease-fire and an agreement to form a unity government led by Bozize. But that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from its base in the north toward Bangui, seizing towns along the way. Their efforts took a pivotal turn Sunday, when they infiltrated the capital, sending the president fleeing to Cameroon.","As political turmoil rages, aid agencies are warning of a humanitarian crisis.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Japan seems to be seeing some splendid days. This past week the Nikkei 225 hurdled over the 14,500 mark and near a five-year high, while the yen weakened beyond the 100-yen mark against the dollar and to a four-year low. If that wasn't enough, Japan's exporters have started to pick up the black pen to report earnings where only red had been used in the past several years -- Sony this week revealed its first full-year net profit in five years. With investors and exporters feeling the cash surge, the potential for change is at hand but challenges still lie in wait. Analysts warn that parts of Japan Inc. are still very much on the brink. Japanese tech: 'They dropped the ball' ""The weakening yen is benefiting Japan's technology companies but it's not going to get them back to where they used to be five to ten years ago,"" says Steve Durose, Senior Director and Head of Asia-Pacific TMT Ratings at Fitch. ""Fundamentally, the reason why Sharp, Sony and Panasonic are speculative grade now ... is basically because of a loss of tech leadership. They missed out on tablets and phones. They dropped the ball on key products. We've yet to see them come up with compelling products."" Teasing apart, Sony's annual earnings statement for the fiscal year that ended March 31, the company finished the year with a profit of $435 million only because it sold assets worth more than $1.9 billion dollars. ""Excluding those, then Sony is making a big loss,"" says Kelvin Ho, Director of Fitch's Corporate Ratings Group, ""so it doesn't mean they will return the cash to shareholders or retire their debt at an accelerated pace -- but that they intend to invest in strategically important businesses."" Those businesses may involve bulking up Sony's relatively small imaging business, including cameras and sensors, and its music and movie divisions. Recent cinema hits that helped Sony, include the latest James Bond installment ""Skyfall,"" which pulled in more than $1 billion at the global box office, along with the ""Spider-Man"" movie trilogy with Tobey Maguire and the ""Amazing Spider-Man"" reboot in 2012. The question, however, is will Sony's leadership send funds that foster more growth in such divisions? ""The short answer is 'we'll have to see'. It's too early to say whether the company is going down that path on focusing on a small number of profitable products,"" says Durose. ""At one stage last year, people were seriously debating whether Sony should stop making TVs. I remain to be convinced if they can make a profit, but in their latest statement they seem to be committed to the television segment and believe they can grow sales and return to profit. And if they can, I congratulate them."" Sony's television division has been a loss maker over the past several years, adds Durose, as has Sony's flagship smartphone, the Xperia Z. ""By all accounts it's a good phone. It's one of the sturdiest phones on the market. But I think I only know two people who use it,"" he adds. Of Japan's tech firms, Fitch only ranks Sony, Panasonic and Sharp. All three have speculative ratings with negative outlooks. Japanese autos: 'They're back to compete' While the forecast for a resurgence in Japan technology innovation appears in doubt, the prediction for Japan's automobile exports seems more enthusiastic as the yen has weakened. In Toyota's recent earnings report for the fiscal year ended March 31, the world's biggest automaker reported net income of $9.7 billion -- more than triple its earnings from the year prior. ""Japanese automakers have regained confidence and momentum. In the auto industry, momentum is everything,"" says Michael Dunne, President of Dunne and Company and author of American Wheels, Chinese Roads. ""This isn't a temporary blip. They're back to compete."" Still, adds Dunne, Japan's auto sector faces growth challenges because of regional politics in Asia, global competition and a lack of innovation which a weaker yen cannot help. Chronic tensions between Japan and China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea have dampened demand for Japanese automobiles in China, the world's largest car market. ""They (Japanese automakers) will sell three million cars there this year but it could be much higher. If they get things right, within five years it could easily get to five million,"" says Dunne. ""Dealers say a good benchmark is showroom traffic. In China, because of the tension, dealers I know say in October and November of last year that showroom traffic at Japanese dealerships was down by half. It's recovering slowly."" Competition from South Korea and Detroit's Big Three automakers -- General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -- has also been rising. To push back, Dunne says using new-found profits from a weaker yen to move manufacturing plants to cheaper locales overseas is one way to stay competitive -- as long as the pace of expansion is controlled. ""One thing is Toyota began an aggressive schedule to open more production bases overseas but that was the beginning of its problems. To duplicate the quality and fastidiousness of Japanese plants was difficult. They were running to be number one at the expense of quality."" Toyota's well-documented crises of quality from 2009 and 2010 set the company back in consumers' eyes, says Dunne, which has led to challenges from other carmakers. ""The threat from (South Korea's) Hyundai has been well documented. American automakers have boosted quality, innovation and styling too,"" says Dunne. ""For example, the Ford Focus has been a spectacular success. It was the best-selling model in 2012 but Toyota's Corolla had perennially been the best-selling car over the ten years before that."" But Dunne adds Toyota is slowly regaining customer trust after a series of recalls. In December 2012, Toyota agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle a class-action suit by car owners who claimed they suffered economic losses because of unintended acceleration in its cars. That same month, the company also agreed to pay a record $17.4 million to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for problems that led to a 2012 recall in one of its Lexus models. As for direction at the world's largest automaker, Dunne says he has heard good things about the leadership style of Toyota's president and CEO that aims to foster innovation. ""I hear Akio Toyoda enters a room with an entourage of extremely bright engineers and colleagues but he also says 'don't get too burrowed in' and 'let's open our eyes and see what we can do differently'. It seems there's an awakening among the Japanese.""","Weaker Japanese yen boosting equities, exporter profits, investor sentiment .

"(CNN) -- Jessica Heeringa, 25, was due to close the Michigan gas station where she was working alone as a cashier at 11:30 p.m. Friday. But at 11:15, police got a 911 call that the station was unmanned. When police responded, Heeringa was gone. ""Something very bad happened,"" the police chief of Norton Shores, a community of 22,500 near Lake Michigan about 40 miles west of Grand Rapids, told CNN affiliate WOOD-TV. ""This was an abduction, not just a missing person,"" Chief Daniel Shaw told the station. ""There was nothing disturbed inside the store. There was no sign of a struggle or a robbery had occurred,"" Shaw told the station. Heeringa's purse was left in the store, and her car was still there, WOOD reported. Heeringa last served a customer about 10:50 p.m., police said. ""Between the time that last purchase was made and the time that the customers came in and found the store empty is when Jessica was abducted,"" Shaw told WOOD. ""We have spoken with the person who made the purchase there and cleared them of any wrong. And unfortunately, they didn't see anything that would lead them to believe there was something going on at the store that was leading to that abduction."" The chief told the station police are looking for the driver of a silver minivan who was seen in the store's parking area late Friday. Shaw described him as a white male, between 30 and 40, with wavy hair parted in the middle, according to WOOD. The van could have been a Chrysler Town and Country, he told the station. The store did not have security cameras, leaving police with few other clues. ""We are desperately looking for additional information,"" he told WOOD on Monday morning. Heeringa's family and friends were posting missing posters around the area, and a Facebook page was set up for people to offer clues or support. ""We are searching! Hang tight! The whole Country wants you home!"" said a Facebook post from Monday morning. Tips had come in from as far away as New Jersey, Missouri and Arkansas, WOOD reported. Heeringa is described as 5 feet, 1 inches tall, 110 pounds with blond hair, blue eyes and wearing wire-rimmed glasses. She has a 3-year-old son, her family told CNN affiliate WZZM-TV. Besides local police, the county sheriff's department and the Michigan State Police were involved in the investigation, according to local media reports. The FBI has also been contacted, the reports said. ""We've got a team of detectives and investigators on staff all day and night to track down those leads,"" Shaw told WOOD. ""We are very concerned. It's been too long,"" Heeringa's grandfather, Roman Homrich, told Mlive.com on Monday. Heeringa's mother, Shelly Heeringa, told WZZM that she thinks her daughter's abductor was a past customer who knew Jessica and the store. ""She's very helpful, that's why I think he lured her out of the gas station,"" the mother told the station. ""He knew there wasn't security cameras.""

"(CNN) -- On the evening of December 3, 2008, John Francis Cahill, a police officer for 19 years, walked up a trail in California's Santa Cruz Mountains. He stopped, took out a .40-caliber Glock semi-automatic handgun and shot himself in the temple. He was 42 years old. He was the father of two daughters. He was my firstborn son. Most Americans are aware of the high rate of suicide among soldiers. Less attention has been paid to those who protect us on the home front. The Badge of Life, a group of former cops dedicated to preventing police suicide, reports that about 145 police officers take their lives every year, twice the number of cops killed by felons. The rate of police suicides is more than 1Â½ times the rate of the general population. The Badge of Life also reports that for every suicide, a thousand working cops suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, and another thousand struggle with serious depression, marital problems or substance abuse. My son had been through a painful divorce and was distraught about the failure of his marriage, his financial problems and the possible impact of the divorce on his youngest daughter. Only after losing my son did I learn how susceptible cops are to suicide. Kevin Gilmartin, a former Arizona police officer turned clinical psychologist, wrote a book called ""Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement,"" and consults with the FBI and police agencies around the country. His main message is that cops can never let their guard down, that the very things that make cops safe and effective on the job can cause great harm in their personal and family life, and in some cases, destroy them. Gilmartin writes vividly of the dangers of the ""hypervigilance biological roller-coaster,"" where officers on duty are ""alive, alert, energetic, involved and humorous,"" but when off duty, are ""tired, detached, isolated and apathetic."" He points out that hypervigilance on the job produces a healthy amount of cynicism and mistrust, which is necessary for street survival, but off the job, can be destructive for emotional survival and relationships with family and loved ones. Good cops create control out of chaos, and are willing to risk everything during a critical incident, which is usually short-lived. But when a cop gets depressed, these professional habits can become lethal. Cops don't do well when they can't control their situation or the source of their depression, and they begin to despair when they see that their problem -- the ""critical incident"" -- is never-ending. That's what happened to John. He told me how frustrating it was not to be in control, and he often told me, ""This will never end."" He went from depression to despair. I believe he was convinced that everyone would be better off if he was gone. John and I were close. I knew he was struggling, but my perception of him as secure and healthy never allowed me to imagine he could end his own life. Ellen Kirschman, a psychologist, police trainer, and author of ""I Love a Cop,"" writes about the paradox between an officer's work life and personal life, and how police work changes people. She emphasizes that cops are oriented toward control and details situations that lead to suicide, including, ""family conflicts, relationship losses, depression, immediate access to guns, poor coping skills, financial difficulties, shame, failure and a distorted but culturally correct sense of invincibility and independence."" Kirschman defines trauma as a normal reaction to an abnormal event, an emotional reaction that can lead to depression and suicidal thoughts. A police officer can be traumatized by many events that are abnormal or infrequent in other people's lives: shootings, a civilian getting severely injured in a police action, a child's death, a violent confrontation, a bad car crash or a gory crime scene. John Violanti, a former New York state trooper, is a public health professor who has extensively researched police suicide. He is the co-editor of ""Police Suicide: Tactics for Prevention,"" which advocates peer support and stress management programs and emphasizes the importance of mental health treatment and a culture in which asking for help is not seen as a poor career move or a sign of weakness. The Badge of Life promotes ""emotional self-care training,"" with the idea that every officer is a potential trauma victim. The members believe suicide prevention programs are crucial, but argue that departments must go beyond that to train officers to recognize trauma in themselves, to manage stress, to become resilient, and to understand the value of healthy lifestyles, including exercise. My son was the second San Jose police officer to commit suicide in 2008. As a result, the San Jose Police Department started to require agency-wide training. The department told its officers that if they were depressed and feeling suicidal, they could come in confidentially, receive counseling and keep their jobs. In the year after John died, 12 officers came in, got help and stayed on the job. The San Francisco Police Department lost three officers to suicide in 2010. Today, the SFPD's advanced officer training program includes a two-hour session on trauma, depression, substance abuse, suicide and the value of an annual, voluntary mental health checkup, not unlike an annual physical. As part of that training, I speak each week to 30 officers. I tell them John's story, summarize the research on police suicide, tell them that the very things that make them effective as cops can be destructive in their personal lives, and stress that asking for help is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. When I'm back in my car I usually fall apart, revisiting the horror of four years ago. But I know I'm honoring my son by doing this. The California Highway Patrol has also aggressively addressed suicide prevention. But too many other police departments across the nation, even as they invest heavily in training in weapons use, tactics and physical safety, are not acknowledging the hidden risks of police work and protecting those who protect the rest of us. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brian Cahill.","Brian Cahill became a suicide prevention trainer after his son, a police officer, killed himself .
About 145 cops commit suicide a year, he says. Thousands have PTSD and depression .
Cahill: Cops see traumatic stuff every day. What helps them on the job can harm them at home .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court gave unanimous support to an American father's court fight to regain custody of his daughter living overseas, saying the case is still active even if the child is out of the country. This decision could establish important precedent on the discretion of U.S. courts to decide where youngsters caught in parental fights should stay. It also addresses a key question at the intersection of American and international law. ""This dispute is very much alive,"" the justices said in their ruling. The jurisdictional matter before the high court involved a U.S. Army sergeant from Alabama and his Scottish-born wife, who returned alone to her home country with their daughter, Eris. A federal court said the child should remain in Scotland since it was her ""habitual residence"" under international law. The court also said the custody issue was moot since the girl was overseas. Lynne Chafin and her lawyers said the purpose of the Hague Convention treaty was to stop children like her 5-year-old daughter from bouncing back and forth between countries over custody. Justices divided over international custody dispute . But the girl's father, Jeffrey Chafin, says the custody fight began in American courts where the girl was living at the time, and that his legal claims were never fully heard in those venues. The Obama administration supported the father and the Supreme Court ultimately sided with him as well, saying his appeal could continue. ""The Hague Convention mandates the prompt return of children to their countries of habitual residence. But such return does not render this case moot; there is a live discussion between the parties over where their child will be raised,"" the justices said. More than 80 nations are a party to the treaty, including the United States and Britain. The case is: Jeffrey Chafin v.

"New York (CNN) -- It was a security breach at one of the country's busiest airports conducted on a tiny scale. Eighteen workers at New York's JFK Airport were arrested on Wednesday and accused of stealing more than 100,000 mini-bottles of alcohol from LSG Sky Chefs, which provides food and beverages for American Airlines. The arrests capped off a nine-month investigation, dubbed ""Operation Last Call"" by the Port Authority's Office of Inspector General. Most of the accused were employed by LSG, but three were security guards hired by private contractors to guard JFK Airport and American Airlines. The guards are charged with taking bribes to look past the thefts and for receiving stolen property. A speedier trip through airport security could come within a decade . ""The defendants arrested in Operation Last Call violated and sold out their position of trust and access to the secure areas of the airport, including access to commercial aviation, all for personal greed,"" said Robert Van Etten, inspector general for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates JFK Airport. Prosecutors allege that 15 employees of LSG pilfered bottles of alcohol left over from various American Airlines flights and sold them on the underground market to local liquor stores and bodegas. Taking place over many months, these thefts yielded an estimated retail value of $750,000. Law enforcement sources said the ring revolved around Domingo Duran, a retired LSG Sky Chefs employee. An early morning raid on Duran's home in Queens uncovered more than 50,000 mini-bottles of alcohol and $34,000 in cash. Duran faces 15 years in prison on charges of grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property. CNN's attempts to reach Duran for comment were unsuccessful. Two of the three security guards worked for FJC Security Services, which has responsibilities for guarding the facilities at JFK Airport. The third security guard was employed by SCIS Air Security, which has a contract to guard airline property. U.S. watchdog to review airline safety program . An FJC spokesman said that the firm had been alerted to the alleged activity by an anonymous tip in November 2011, a half year after taking over the security contract at JFK. FJC immediately turned over the information to the Port Authority, which commenced a formal investigation. The case culminated when the LSG workers were summoned to an early morning meeting, where they were arrested in their uniforms. ""They were engaged in the widespread theft and distribution of liquor and other duty free items,"" Van Etten said. ""These arrests will serve notice that the Port Authority of will not tolerate criminal activity at its facilities."" LSG Sky Chefs declined comment.

"(CNN) -- It's about to get more difficult to move between smartphone carriers and still keep your existing phone. Smartphones purchased after Saturday can't be legally unlocked without permission from the carrier, according to a recent ruling by the Library of Congress. Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in 1998, making it illegal to access copyrighted content and break digital rights management technologies. The software that locks a smartphone to one carrier is covered by the act, and unlocking a phone is the process of freeing a device so that it can be used with a different wireless carrier. The Library of Congress has the ability to grant exemptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which it has done in the past for smartphone users who wished to unlock their phones. That changed with the most recent group of exemptions that went into effect October 28, but the switch included a 90-day grace period that ends Saturday, as TechNewsDaily pointed out. The new policy only applies to new locked phones purchased after Saturday, meaning it will still be legal to unlock phones purchased before January 26 without permission. One way to get around the requirement is to buy a full-priced unlocked phone that doesn't have a contract, but doing so adds hundreds of dollars to the phone's price tag. Carriers subsidize the costs of smartphones to draw new customers in with contracts, usually for two years, and then make back the money from monthly voice and data bills. In its latest ruling, the Library of Congress decided the software on a phone is only licensed to the end user, meaning they don't own it, so therefore the software is not covered by fair-use rules. Groups that lobbied to keep the exemption argued that making unlocking illegal is anti-competitive and could result in costlier phones and more electronic waste since some consumers would have to buy a new device to switch carriers. But the final ruling says there are more options now for obtaining an unlocked phone than in previous years. Many phones are available unlocked for full price, and carriers do have policies in place for unlocking phones. Currently the rules vary from carrier to carrier. For example, AT&T will unlock an iPhone for current or past customers as long as all contracts have been fulfilled. And Verizon's iPhone 5 is usable on AT&T's network. However, it's unclear whether carriers will tighten these rules about unlocked phones in the future.","Unlocking smartphone bought after Saturday illegal without carrier's permission .

"(CNN) -- A mysterious blast ripped through a busy Turkish customs gate on the border with Syria on Monday, killing at least 13 people and wounding dozens, the Turkish government said. Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc, chief spokesman for the government, said a minivan traveling from Syria to Turkey exploded. He declined to call it a terrorist attack, saying the investigation was still ongoing. ""The type of explosive could not be determined as of this time,"" Arinc said. ""In situations like this all possibilities are considered."" There is no question, however, that this was one of the deadliest blasts to hit Turkey in years. ""It's like hell. People are injured,"" said a Turkish smuggler who asked to use only the name Gokmen because of the illicit nature of his work. He said he was on the Syrian side of the sprawling border terminal when he heard the blast. Security Council condemns Syria's attack on Turkey . Amateur video of the explosion aftermath showed bystanders running amid scattered shrapnel, burned-out cars and ambulances, screaming in panic and pain. Bystanders carried a bleeding man from smoking wreckage near the traffic booths where Turkish border officials normally processed transiting cars and cargo trucks. Turkey and Syria: Why neither side wants war . ""My house is two kilometers (about a mile and a quarter) away from the border ... but the blast was powerful enough that we heard it,"" Mahmut Iri, the mayor of the Turkish border town of Cilvegozu, said in a phone call with CNN. Iri said the explosion hit the last Turkish border gate before Syrian territory. ""I know for a fact that two of the people who died were Turks,"" Iri added. Turkish president: ''Worst-case scenario' in Syria becoming reality . Syrian rebels first overran the Syrian border gate at Bab el Hawa last summer, flushing out government forces after days of fighting. Within several months, Turkey was allowing vehicles through the border gate to rebel-controlled Syria. Turkish officials have not yet commented on the cause of the deadly blast. Over the past 22 months, fighting has frequently spilled over Turkey's 900-kilometer (560-mile) border with Syria. In October, five Turkish civilians were killed when Syrian troops shelled the Turkish border town of Akcakale. And in June, Syrian anti-aircraft fire brought down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet over the Mediterranean Sea. When fighting erupts across the border, Turkish authorities periodically close schools that are close to Turkish territory. In recent months, the NATO military alliance has responded to a Turkish government request for assistance by deploying Patriot missile batteries around major cities close to the Syrian border. Hundreds of American, German and Dutch troops have been sent to Turkey to operate the Patriots, which the Turkish government says are designed to protect Turkey from the threat of Syrian ballistic missiles. On February 1, a suicide bomber attacked the entrance to the U.S. Embassy in Turkey's capital, Ankara, killing a Turkish guard and seriously wounding a Turkish journalist. A violent leftist group called the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, or DHKP-C, claimed responsibility for the attack. In a rambling online manifesto, the group said one of the reasons the U.S. Embassy was targeted was to stop what it called American imperialist plans to colonize Syria and Turkey. Fighting inside Syria . Meanwhile, Syrian rebels claimed to have captured Syria's largest man-made dam on Monday. ""The Free Army took control of the city of Tabqa and the Euphrates (Tabqa) Dam,"" the opposition Media Center in Tabqa announced in an online posting.

CNN could not independently confirm claims that the dam had been captured. The Syrian government did not respond to opposition claims that its forces had lost control of the dam. The Tabqa Dam was completed in the 1970s with the help of thousands of Syrian and Soviet workers. It houses a hydroelectric power station. The dam sits at the end Assad Lake, a man-made reservoir on the Euphrates River named after the father and son who have ruled Syria for the past four decades. Opposition groups distributed videos of Syrian rebels seizing caches of weapons and ammunition from positions once held by Syrian security forces. They also showed video of what appeared to be the dam itself, towering over the surrounding countryside.","NEW: Death toll in minivan explosion rises, government official says .

"Nashville (CNN) -- There is a quiet hum in the air. Moments later, it's clear why. Ringo Starr sweeps in, and it feels like a cool breeze has washed over the room despite the sweltering 100-degree Southern summer heat outside. Ringo Starr still rocking out at 72 . His apparel is basic but he exudes ""rock star"" -- strolling in wearing a pinstriped blazer, a T-shirt, dark jeans and sneakers. Two silver pendants adorn his neck: The longer of the two is a signature peace sign; the other, fashioned from a 45 LP adapter that was immediately given to him when he remarked to its former owner how much he liked it. Such is Starr's charm. Despite being accompanied by no fewer than 15 people, he is disarmingly self-deprecating and modest. Starr talks about his new album . Starr, one of two living members of the Beatles and winner of nine Grammy Awards, turned 72 on Saturday. He spent his birthday with fans and fellow musicians at the Hard Rock Cafe in Nashville. As he always does on his birthday, he celebrates a moment of peace and love at the stroke of noon, and encouraged everyone else to do the same. ""Wherever you are -- on a bus, in the office, in the studio, hanging out ... whatever you're doing, at noon, just go, 'Peace and love.' That's all I ask for my birthday. Peace and love."" A vegetarian, he attributes his trim physique to Pilates and a sensible diet. ""I work out quite a lot, and you know, broccoli is my main course, stuff like that. So, you know, that's how I do it. Just keep yourself fit,"" he says. ""So as long as you do something physical, you know, keep moving."" Starr's life in pictures . Keep moving he does -- weaving through the crowd of well-wishers, family and friends with an easy affability. Not surprisingly, security is tight. He nonetheless radiates warmth, shaking hands cordially with strangers and exchanging affectionate hugs with friends. And it's quite a group of friends he has. Fellow members of his ever-rotating All-Starr band are there in full force: Toto's Steve Lukather with his signature goatee; music producer extraordinaire Todd Rundgren and his instantly recognizable white-and-black mane; a young-looking Richard Page from Mr. Mister; Santana's Gregg Rolie sporting aviators. Country star Vince Gill, Ed Roland from Atlanta-based Collective Soul, Jeff Russo of Tonic, and Roy Orbison Jr. are also on hand to pay tribute to the British icon. The Eagles' legendary Joe Walsh pops his head in during the interview, and jokingly says he'll interrupt and take a seat on Starr's lap. Starr pretends to be aggrieved. ""I have to let him in. He's the brother-in-law. It's a family thing!"" He's referring to his wife of 31 years, Barbara Bach, whose sister Walsh wed three years ago. Outside the Hard Rock, hundreds are thronging for the chance to get up close and personal with their idol. Jamie Donaldson traveled from California with her husband and two kids for this moment. ""I just can't believe I'm here,"" she said. ""This has just been my dream for so long to see a living Beatle in person, and Ringo is just the best!"" She admits it's almost unbearably hot outside, but, ""It's worth it!"" One woman holds a sign that reads, ""Ringo, sign my son!"" Another holds a sign that says, ""You hugged me in 1964, please do it again"". The crowd breaks into an excited chatter when Starr's inner circle lines up on the stage. When the man himself emerges from the restaurant, the screams and shouts crescendo. Starr is about to begin the countdown to shout ""peace and love"" at noon when out of nowhere a loud, monotonous tone begins to blare. Undeterred, Starr continues on, and as if listening to the intended message, the tone silences just in time as the count reaches ""one."" ""Peace and love!"" everyone shouts in unison. To the delight of the crowd, Starr's friends and family, partly led by saxophonist Mark Rivera, begin to sing a John Lennon anthem. ""All we are saying, is give peace a chance."" Starr sings the last line loudly into the microphone, waving both hands in the signature ""peace"" sign high in the air. The crowd watching is hugging, laughing and crying. Happy 72nd birthday, Ringo Starr.","Ringo Starr turned 72 on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- The National Rifle Association's New York state affiliate filed a federal lawsuit Thursday in Buffalo contesting the constitutionality of the SAFE Act, the sweeping gun-control bill Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law in January, the group announced in a press release. The new laws fortify New York's existing assault weapons ban, limit the number of bullets allowed in ammunition magazines and strengthen rules that govern the mentally ill, which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior. ""Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Legislature usurped the legislative and democratic process in passing these extreme anti-gun measures with no committee hearings and no public input,"" Chris Cox, executive director of NRA's Institute for Legislative Action said in the release. ""This obvious disrespect for New Yorkers and their Second Amendment rights will not be tolerated,"" he added. New York's new laws include a statewide gun registry and a uniform licensing standard, altering the current system in which each county or municipality sets its own standard. Residents are now restricted to purchasing ammunition magazines that carry seven bullets, rather than 10. The laws were the first in the nation to be enacted after the Newtown, Connecticut, school massacre. New York authorities said last week they had reached a deal with 23 gun show operators in the state after an investigation revealed weapons were sold without proper background checks.

"(CNN) -- One Harbaugh will win Super Bowl XLVII. Another will lose it. That much is guaranteed after the San Francisco 49ers, coached by Jim Harbaugh, and the Baltimore Ravens, led by his brother John Harbaugh, beat their respective foes in conference championship games Sunday. Those wins mean the Harbaughs will be the first siblings to face off as head coaches in the NFL's title contest and, in fact, for any major U.S. professional sports championship. Both teams rallied from halftime deficits on the road to earn berths in the Super Bowl, which will be played February 3 in New Orleans. Baltimore did it by reeling off 21 straight points to overcome Tom Brady and the New England Patriots. It was sweet revenge for the Ravens, who lost last year's nail-biter AFC Championship to the same Patriots foe on the same Gillette Stadium field in Foxborough, Massachusetts. A few hours earlier, the 49ers rallied from a 17-0 hole to defeat the Atlanta Falcons, who had posted the best regular season record in the NFC. John Harbaugh joked to reporters, after the Ravens' win, that he and his brothers had a ""few dreams"" -- one of which may have been meeting up in the Super Bowl -- as well ""as a few fights ... just like all brothers."" ""We'll let the two teams duke it out, as much as possible,"" John Harbaugh said, smiling. The Baltimore coach then made a point to talk about how proud he was of his brother Jim, as well as how much he admired the San Francisco team. ""I'd like to think that when you look at (the) two teams, you're looking at mirror images,"" John Harbaugh said, referring to the Super Bowl foes. ""It's going to be a great football game."" Baltimore's dominant second half leads to win . Beyond their recent playoff history, Baltimore and New England matched up earlier this season -- one in which the Ravens came back from a late 9-point deficit, winning on a last-second field goal by Justin Tucker. Still, victory Sunday evening was hardly guaranteed. New England had the superior regular record, not to mention a storied playoff pedigree having played in five Super Bowls in the past 11 years. They also had Brady, who last Sunday passed Joe Montana as the quarterback with the most playoff wins ever. And the Patriots started out strong, jumping to a 3-0 lead and -- after a Baltimore score -- entering halftime up 13-7. But the second half was all Baltimore. The Ravens scored touchdowns on their first three possessions, two of them on Joe Flacco touchdown passes to receiver Anquan Boldin. Meanwhile, the vaunted Patriots offense sputtered, hurt especially by a Stevan Ridley fumble and two Brady interceptions. Baltimore ended up winning 28-13. ""We came here last year and left with a bitter taste in our mouths,"" Baltimore's Boldin told reporters after the game. ""We felt like this team took something away from us. And we wanted to come back and make that right."" 49ers rally, hold on for 28-24 victory . Led by quarterbacks Montana and Steve Young, San Francisco was one of the NFL's top franchises through much of the 1980s and 1990s. But the 49ers haven't been in the Super Bowl in 1995, and their 2000s were marred by mostly losing regular seasons. The team's fortunes, however, have turned since the 2011 hiring of Jim Harbaugh, a former NFL quarterback himself who'd been coaching at nearby Stanford. The next season, they made it to the NFC Championship, only to fall to the eventual Super Bowl winners, the New York Giants. On Sunday, trailing by three scores midway through the second quarter, San Francisco rallied for two quick touchdowns -- one on a LaMichael James 11-yard run, the other on a four-yard reception by tight end Vernon Davis. Still, Atlanta maintained its slim advantage -- in part thanks to a missed field goal and a fumble by the 49ers Michael Crabtree just inches from the end zone -- into the fourth quarter. But then, running back Frank Gore scored from nine yards out to put San Francisco ahead 28-24. At this point, there were still just over eight minutes left in the game. Atlanta -- paced by quarterback Matt Ryan, known as ""Matty Ice"" for his strong play in the waning minutes of games -- made a run. With just over a minute to go, the Falcons got within striking distance of the goal line. But San Francisco defenders broke up two straight passes, effectively sealing the win. After the game, San Francisco linebacker Patrick Willis said the 49ers prevailed because they refused to give up and stuck together as a team, just as they have all season long. ""One thing about our team all year long is that we continue to fight,"" Willis told Fox, which broadcast the game. ""We have an unbelievable team.""","NEW: Baltimore's John Harbaugh says he admires his brother Jim, the 49ers' coach .

"(CNN) -- Federal intelligence officials are looking at whether more could have been done to prevent the Boston Marathon attacks, President Barack Obama said Tuesday, though he added that he's not aware of any missteps. ""Based on what I can see so far, the FBI performed its duties. The Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing,"" Obama said. ""But this is hard stuff."" The president called the review by the Director of National Intelligence's office ""standard procedure,"" but it comes amid withering criticism from some lawmakers of how well law enforcement, intelligence analysts and the administration handled a 2011 request by Russian officials to investigate one of the two bombing suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. That year, Russian authorities alerted the United States to concerns that Tsarnaev was becoming increasingly radical. The Russians also raised questions about Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, according to several sources. But the FBI found no evidence of extremist activity and closed the case. The names of both Tsarnaev and his mother were placed in a terror database, however. Still, Tsarnaev was allowed to travel the next year to a restive Russian region rife with Islamist terror groups, and he returned to the United States after six mysterious months abroad. Investigators have said they are looking at possible links between Tsarnaev and those groups during his time in the region. Information sharing . In the days following the attacks, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina led criticism of the administration's handling of the Russian reports -- questioning whether intelligence and law enforcement agencies properly shared information that could have prevented the April 15 bombings. Three people died in the attack and more than 260 were wounded, 20 of whom remained hospitalized Tuesday. Authorities say Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his younger brother, Dzhokhar, killed a police officer a few days after the attack. Photos: Galleries from the attack and aftermath . ""I just find it really unnerving that we could have had him in FBI custody in 2011 and did a whole profile of him, and after the attack that his name did not surface, that we didn't check the database or the database had him missing,"" Graham had said of the older Tsarnaev. He continued his criticism Tuesday, after Obama's remarks, comparing the Boston attack with one last year at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead. Both attacks, he said, suggesting warning signs were ignored and communication among intelligence and law enforcement agencies was flawed. Obama said the intelligence review into how Tsarnaev's case was handled, while not prompted by the criticisms, would ""leave no stone unturned."" ""We want to see, is there in fact additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack,"" he said. At the same time, the president rejected Graham's criticisms, saying ""it's not as if the FBI did nothing."" ""They not only investigated the older brother, they interviewed the older brother,"" the president said. ""They concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity."" Criminal investigation . Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body, meanwhile, remained Tuesday in the hands of the Massachusetts Medical Examiner's Office. His widow, Katherine Russell, released a statement Tuesday evening stating that the medical examiner's office ""is prepared to release"" the slain suspect's remains. If and when they do, it won't be to Russell, the mother of his young child. ""It is Katherine Russell's wish that his remains be released to the Tsarnaev family, and we will communicate her wishes to the proper authorities,"" her lawyers said in a statement. Through her attorneys, Russell has denied any knowledge of her husband's involvement in the bombings. She will meet in the coming days with law enforcement, ""as she has done for many hours over the past week, and provide as much assistance to the investigation as she can,"" the lawyers said. The FBI took DNA samples at her Rhode Island home on Monday -- the same day law enforcement sources told CNN that a woman's DNA had been found on a fragment of one of the pressure cooker bombs used in the bombings. The sources cautioned that this doesn't necessarily mean a woman might have conspired with brothers. And an official said that, even if Russell's DNA matches that from the bomb fragment, it doesn't necessarily mean she participated in the bomb's construction. The DNA could also be from a victim, Lawrence Kobilinsky, a DNA expert at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, told CNN's Erin Burnett. As of Tuesday, there was no known match for the DNA found on the bomb fragment. Nor was there a match from at least one fingerprint found in the Boston bomb debris, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN's Susan Candiotti. Very preliminary talks . While the elder Tsarnaev died April 19 after a firefight with police, his 19-year-old brother Dzhokhar is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical center in Devens, Massachusetts, on a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction. He faces a possible death penalty if convicted. Bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's new cell . On Monday, a federal judge appointed prominent defense lawyer Judy Clarke to represent him. Clarke has represented Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber; Eric Rudolph, the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber, and Jared Lee Loughner, who pleaded guilty in the Tucson, Arizona, shooting that killed six and left then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords seriously wounded. Federal prosecutors and the defense team of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev have had some very preliminary talks over the ""past few days"" to potentially allow the surviving suspect to resume providing information to investigators, possibly in exchange for eliminating the possibility of a death penalty if he is convicted, two government sources told CNN on Tuesday. The communications are in the very early stages, and not a sign lawyers for either side is ready to make a deal, said one source, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the private discussions. The source stressed these are not formal talks -- with a U.S. Justice Department official saying it would not be accurate to refer to the conversations as negotiations. Prosecutors have not said they will definitely seek the death penalty in the case, but it is an option under the federal law the 19-year-old is accused of violating. Attorney General Eric Holder would have the final say. These kinds of conversations are not unusual in such high-profile cases, legal sources say. Russian cooperation, links . Over the weekend, news emerged that Russian authorities had intercepted a phone call in early 2011 from one of the Tsarnaev brothers in the United States to their mother in Dagestan. The call included a vague discussion of jihad, an official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. That information didn't make its way to the FBI before the bombings, the official said. Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had regrets Russian intelligence wasn't able to provide more information to U.S. officials before the bombing, and said he hoped the incident would spark greater cooperation between U.S. and Russian counterterrorism officials. Russia has been ""very cooperative with us since the Boston bombing,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""Obviously, old habits die hard,"" he said. ""There's still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back in some cases 10, 20, 30 years, to the Cold War."" Another possible investigative development tied to Russia relates to possible links between Tamerlan Tsarnaev and a Canadian jihadist killed by Russian troops in 2012, a source being briefed on the investigation said. William Plotnikov and six others died in a firefight with Russian forces in the southwestern republic of Dagestan in July 2012 -- while Tsarnaev was visiting the region, the source said. The 23-year-old Plotnikov was born in Russia, but his family moved to Canada when he was a teenager. Why did Tamerlan go to Russia? Tsarnaev flew out of Dagestan two days after Plotnikov's body was prepared for burial, according to the source. Investigators are looking into the possibility he left because of Plotnikov's death, the source said. Like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Plotnikov was once a boxer. Investigators also are looking into whether Tsarnaev had any contact with another militant named Mahmoud Mansur Nidal, who was killed by Russian forces in May 2012 during a gun battle in Dagestan's capital, the source said.

"London (CNN) -- Nearly four decades after he brought an invasion of mutant, flesh-eating rodents to London with his first novel, ""The Rats,"" UK chiller writer James Herbert has died aged 69. Herbert, who followed up his best-selling debut with another hit, ""The Fog,"" and another 21 books over the decades, was seen as a British rival to U.S. horror supremo Stephen King. Other top sellers include ""Portent,"" ""Others"" and ""The Secret of Crickley Hall."" His most recent novel, the paranormal detective story ""Ash,"" was published last year. Publisher Pan Macmillan said that he died peacefully at home Wednesday morning. Jeremy Trevathan, Herbert's editor at Macmillan for 10 years, described him as a ""keystone author in a genre that had its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s."" He was published in 34 languages, including Russian and Chinese, and has sold more than 54 million copies worldwide, according to Pan Macmillan. ""It's a true testament to his writing and his enduring creativity that his books continued to be huge bestsellers right up until his death,"" said Trevathan. ""He has the rare distinction that his novels were considered classics of the genre within his lifetime. His death marks the passing of one of the giants of popular fiction in the 20th century."" Fans of his books paid tribute to the indelible mark they left on the readers' psyche. ""Sad news about James Herbert -- as a teen, I scared myself silly reading him. He led me to King, Barker, others. RIP ... "" said crime writer Ian Rankin on Twitter. Broadcaster Jenni Falconer tweeted: ""Sad news about James Herbert. His book series 'The Rats' has kept me on high alert whenever I'm on the tube!! (I read it 20 yrs ago!)"" Born in the East End of London, the son of street traders, Herbert grew up in Whitechapel -- where Jack the Ripper once stalked his victims -- in an area badly hit by Second World War bombing raids. The rodents he saw scurrying around the ruined buildings were to inspire his first work, according to a fan website. The manuscript for ""The Rats,"" published in 1974 at 175 pages in length, was written in just 10 months while Herbert was working at an advertising agency. He had found a job there after studying graphic design, print and photography at Hornsey College of Art, and eventually rose to a senior role. Four of his novels were made into films, while another was serialized for television and a fifth was dramatized for radio. Herbert was presented with an honor, the Order of the British Empire, by Queen Elizabeth II in 2010. In the same year, he was made the Grand Master of Horror by the World of Horror Convention. He lived in Sussex, in southern England, with his wife of more than 40 years, Eileen, with whom he had three daughters.","James Herbert died peacefully at home, his publisher says .

"(CNN) -- Days after a 10-year-old girl was snatched from her bedroom in the middle of the night -- but found alive nearly 12 hours later and a few miles away -- Los Angeles police pleaded Saturday for the public's help tracking down those responsible. Though they have said they believe two men were involved in the kidnapping, by Saturday police had only identified one by name as a ""wanted suspect"": 30-year-old Tobias Dustin Summers. In a press conference a few hours before Summers' image and information came out, Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Andrew Smith said that police believe this was a ""stranger abduction."" At the same time, he said, investigators are not ruling anything out -- such as whether the abductors had something to do with her family or that acquaintances of hers might have been involved. ""Until we can find these individuals that perpetrated this, we won't know if this was a random case, or whether it was targeted against this family or this child for any particular reason,"" Smith said. ""So, right now, we don't know."" Around 1 a.m. Wednesday, the girl's mother last saw her safe in bed in their home in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Northridge. The mother heard noises at about 3:30 a.m. and checked on her daughter again, discovering that she was missing. That set off an intensive search for the girl that ended about 2:50 p.m. Wednesday, when she was found about five miles southwest of her home. ""A Good Samaritan ... directed the girl to some police officers nearby, and she was ... transported to a local hospital, where she received treatment,"" Cmdr. Andrew Smith, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, told reporters Saturday afternoon. By Saturday, the 10-year-old was back home with her parents, with police on site to provide security and protect the family's privacy. Some 20 members of the police department's robbery and homicide division are working the case, Smith said. In a first preliminary interview with investigators, the girl said she had been put in several vehicles during her 12-hour ordeal, driving to places around the San Fernando Valley. Police were able to locate at least one of those locations -- a storage facility about two miles from the girl's home -- Smith said. The LAPD spokesman did not detail what happened to the girl in that time, urging media to do the same so as not to ""further traumatize... that poor girl."" Smith said that authorities don't have any reason to believe there's any rash of child abductions in the area. Still, with the two suspects on the loose, he urged parents to take precautions, such as locking their doors and being extra vigilant. ""Until these two individuals are caught, we don't know what they're capable of,"" Smith said.","A 10-year-old girl was taken in the middle of the night from her L.A. home, police say .

"(CNN) -- There are indications that the man believed to have killed the head of the Colorado prison system this month may have been released from prison early because of a clerical error. Evan Ebel entered the Department of Corrections in February, 2005, sentenced to three years in prison on robbery and menacing charges. In June 2005, facing more charges, Ebel was sentenced to eight years for assault and three more years for menacing, both concurrent to the original sentence, meaning he could get out in eight years total, in 2013. While Ebel was in prison, he assaulted a prison guard. CNN affiliate KUSA in Denver says it has copy of Ebel's plea agreement from 2008, for that attack. The station broadcast on Friday an enhanced portion of the document, which states, in part, ""The parties stipulate to a sentence capped at four years in the Department of Corrections to be served consecutively to any sentence the defendant is presently serving or has yet to serve."" That word ""consecutively"" should have added four years to the end of the sentence, so Ebel couldn't get out until 2017. But something apparently got lost in translation. By the time the court order, or mittimus, reached the Department of Corrections, it did not specify whether the latest four-year assault sentence should be concurrent, or consecutive. ""The deal I made is it was consecutive,"" Bryan L. Hunt, who prosecuted Ebel as the deputy district attorney in Fremont County told CNN. ""Is there any way it could be automatically changed without me being involved? I don't know of any. Any changes for good behavior reduction would be the jurisdiction of DOC, not me. Once somebody is committed to the DOC, then the exact aspects of the sentence are in the jurisdiction of the DOC."" ""There's very strict case law,"" corrections department spokeswoman Alison Morgan told CNN on Saturday. ""We're not bound by the plea deal. The Department of Corrections is bound by the court order, bound to follow what's directed on the court order. If the court order is silent (does not explicitly say 'consecutive'), we're required to treat it as concurrent."" Questions, speculation . Noted Denver-area attorney Scott Robinson, who represented Ebel in four cases from 2003 to 2005, but didn't speak to him over the past eight years, told CNN he could not know what happened until he sees a transcript of the sentencing hearing. But it's easy to imagine a scenario where ""a very small clerical error, compounded by understandable judicial oversight, ended with disastrous consequence,"" he said. ""We know there's a written plea agreement signed by Hunt and a deceased public defender. It clearly states 'consecutive' but doesn't say consecutive to what,"" he said, after reviewing the documents in KUSA's possession. ""It doesn't mention prior cases. It should have mentioned consecutive to which prior charge."" Robinson said usually one clerk types up the ""minute orders,"" which is the in-court record of the judge's oral orders, and a clerical error could happen then. Next, sometimes the same clerk, but often a second clerk, who may not have been in the courtroom, types up the mittimus, the formal court order that directs corrections offers to commit someone to prison, and something could get lost in translation there. ""He may or may not read them' Robinson said a mittimus order has a place for the judge to sign it, so clerks prepare them and a judge signs them, and that's the next time a clerical error could happen. ""He may or may not read them. If you look at this mittimus, it looks utterly normal, nothing to draw his attention, and the judge signed the order, not realizing no language about consecutive,"" he said. ""In Colorado, the judge cannot change plea agreements from consecutive to concurrent, though a judge can choose to reject any plea agreement he wants,"" Robinson said. ""Knowing that plea agreement called for consecutive sentencing and knowing no judge has power, there's a strong likelihood sentencing went through as contemplated with consecutive sentencing ... routine resolution of a minor prison guard assault case. The judge may not have specifically said consecutive, though probably did. Whoever prepared the minute order probably dropped the ball -- just didn't say anything."" 'This is an educated guess' ""That was it. DOC is stuck with signed court order,"" Robinson suspects, adding, ""This is an educated guess. Less a guess. More an observation."" While Judge David Thorson signed the mittimus, it's unclear who oversaw the sentencing hearing. Hunt said two judges, one man, and a female Judge Marshall were both involved in Ebel's case. CNN left messages at phone numbers for both Judge Thorson and a Judge Julie Marshall in Fremont County, but received no response from either. 'A troubled young man' Of Ebel, one thing sticks out in Hunt's mind: ""He was a troubled young man."" Robinson said if his theory is correct, the domino effect is mind-boggling. ""If you were writing fiction, you might have trouble understanding this thing to be true. Catastrophic for three families -- the Clements, Leon and Ebel families,"" he said. ""What's really agonizing about this situation is it was an utterly routine plea bargain. A mundane task a judge undertakes every single day. Here we are five years later looking at the wreckage that was the result of those errors."" Clements was shot to death at his home outside Colorado Springs on March 19. Ebel was killed two days later in northern Texas in a gunbattle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded. Last week, a 22-year-old woman appeared in court to answer charges that she purchased the gun that Ebel used in the killing of Clement and pizza deliveryman Nathan Leon. Authorities have said the bullets that killed Clements came from a gun that was found with Ebel, who had handwritten directions to the prison chief's house in his car. Investigators also found a pizza box and a pizza delivery uniform jacket that they believe links Ebel to the death of Leon, who worked as pizza delivery driver. Authorities have speculated that Ebel may have killed Leon for his uniform -- to use it as a disguise in the killing of Clements, who was gunned down after he opened his front door.","CNN affiliate KUSA says it has a copy of Evan Ebel's plea agreement from 2008 assault .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's highest court Friday ordered President Robert Mugabe to ensure the African country holds elections by the end of July. Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku said that out of a nine-judge panel only two had dissented to the ruling he delivered. Opinion: Africa's rocky road to democracy . Mugabe ""is hereby ordered and directed to proclaim dates for presidential, general elections ... which elections should take place not later than 31 July 2013,"" he said in a packed Supreme Court chamber. The ruling was made after a former journalist with a defunct daily newspaper asked the court to order Mugabe to call for elections by end of June. Zimbabwe's parliament expires automatically on June 29 but Mugabe would have had until October 31 to hold elections. Earlier this week the country's finance minister, Tendai Biti, told journalists that Zimbabwe was struggling to raise the $132 million needed for conduct elections. The elections -- to be held under a new constitution endorsed in a referendum in March -- will end the power-sharing government of Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai formed in 2009. That followed a violence-marred election in 2008 in which Mugabe had claimed victory but regional leaders regarded as a sham. A new constitution was one of the conditions set by regional leaders before fresh elections. The new constitution limits the president to two five-year terms. Mugabe, 89, has been in power since 1980, when Zimbabwe attained independence from Great Britain, but may seek another term because the new charter does not apply retroactively.","Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku sets a July 31 deadline for elections .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese officials expressed outrage after two U.S. sailors were arrested over accusations that they raped a woman on the island of Okinawa, where the American military presence has generated long-simmering resentment. Defense Minister Satoshi Morimoto on Wednesday called the alleged rape ""vicious and mean"" and said Japanese authorities were lodging protests with the U.S. government and military, as well as demands for better preventive measures. Okinawa Gov. Hirokazu Nakaima, who met with Morimoto over the matter, said it went ""beyond madness"" that the alleged attack took place two months after a U.S. Marine was arrested over accusations he assaulted and molested a woman in Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Police in Okinawa identified the detained sailors as U.S. Navy Seaman Christopher Daniel Browning and Petty Officer Skyler Dozierwalker of Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas. The two men, both 23, are alleged to have raped a Japanese woman in the early hours of Tuesday morning, leaving her with an injury to her neck, police said. They were taken into custody later that day. Tensions over the American military presence on Okinawa have boiled over before. Many residents were incensed by the rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl in 1995 by three U.S. military personnel. And allegations that a Marine raped a 14-year-old girl caused a furor in 2008, although the girl decided not to pursue charges. About half of all U.S. military personnel in Japan are stationed in Okinawa. The U.S. government is ""extremely concerned"" by the allegations against the two service members, U.S. Ambassador to Japan John Roos said in a statement Tuesday. ""We are committed to cooperating fully with the Japanese authorities in their investigation,"" he said. Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shuji Kira on Wednesday summoned Roos over the case, urging the enforcement of stricter discipline and preventive measures. Morimoto, the defense minister, suggested that if the Japanese protests about the matter didn't prove effective enough, he could raise the issue with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Opposition to the presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa runs so deeply that it contributed to the resignation of former Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama in 2010. He had promised to move a U.S. base but later announced that it would stay. His critics said at the time that he gave in to U.S. pressure, and his governing coalition broke up. As well as the cases of misconduct by U.S. troops, some Okinawan residents have complained about issues such as environmental and noise pollution from the American presence. There is also concern in Okinawa about the U.S. deployment of the Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey, a controversial tilt-rotor aircraft that can take off and land like a helicopter but fly like an airplane. Doubts about the Osprey's safety have been fueled by two crashes -- one in Morocco and one in Florida -- earlier this year. The United States and Japan announced in April that nearly half the 19,000 U.S. Marines on Okinawa would leave soon and relocate to other areas in the Asia-Pacific region, including Guam, Hawaii and Australia.","NEW: Japanese defense minister says officials are lodging protests with U.S. authorities .

"(CNN) -- Anxiety and stress are not typically associated with April 1, a day widely celebrated with practical jokes and tomfoolery. However, for thousands of people, April 1 is no joking matter -- it begins the official filing period for H-1B immigration petitions. The current immigration system stifles our country's innovative and entrepreneurial spirit and can cause highly skilled professionals to leave our country and ultimately compete against us. H-1B visas -- three- to six-year work visas sponsored by willing U.S. businesses -- allow foreign-born graduates of U.S. colleges and highly skilled professionals to work legally in this country. For fiscal year 2014, only 85,000 H-1B work visas are available. Of these, 20,000 are reserved for candidates with master's degrees from U.S. institutions. Not only do these high-skilled professionals face a tough job market, but also strict immigration deadlines with an even more restrictive visa cap. The scarcity of H-1B visas, coupled with the complicated process of securing these visas, creates a major roadblock for U.S. companies. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that tens of thousands of unfilled jobs require highly skilled employees. Companies cannot meet the high demand for candidates who possess the skill and knowledge necessary to fill positions where no U.S. candidate is qualified. According to the National Foundation for American Policy, a 2008 study shows that for every new H-1B visa requested, U.S. technology companies increase their employment by five workers, thereby dispelling misconceptions that high-skilled foreign workers take jobs away from Americans. For U.S. companies and foreign candidates alike, the process of getting an H-1B begins far in advance of the April 1 filing date. While candidates start the job search as early as possible to find potential employers willing to sponsor them, companies are forced to make hiring decisions months in advance to ensure that immigration petitions are ready for submission on the first day of the filing period. It is imperative that companies file their petitions on April 1, or at the very least during the first week of April, because of the high demand for these visas. Just last year, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services exhausted the available pool of work visas in mere weeks. This year, USCIS and immigration lawyers expect such a high demand for H-1B visas that the agency may need to rely on a lottery system. Once USCIS meets its H-1B quota, companies and candidates must wait up to a year before they are eligible to file additional petitions. This complicated system has significant ramifications for all parties involved. For instance, a shortage of work visas and the short filing window once a year prevent companies from hiring highly skilled and educated candidates requiring new H-1B visas on a daily basis. According to Compete America, during fiscal year 2009, 96% of employers hired 10 or fewer individuals on new H-1B petitions and 69% hired only one. Ultimately, companies often hire these individuals into other countries instead of the United States to obtain legal work authorization. Potential candidates also suffer the consequences of the broken immigration system. Those who miss the window have to wait for up to a year to participate in the process. Many of them either are forced to return to their native countries or choose to return to avoid stalling their careers. In his recent book, ""The Immigrant Exodus,"" Vivek Wadhwa described the case of Anand Chhatpar and his wife, who were both from India. They met while pursuing graduate studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Together, they launched Fame Express, a startup that produced game applications for Facebook. In their quest for permanent residency, the couple were legally obligated to return to their native India to await approval of their application. Although the couple eventually launched two successful American businesses, USCIS denied their application. The couple, their jobs, their employees, tax revenues and purchasing power now reside in India, competing directly with American firms. Such cases do not benefit the United States. Our lawmakers understand that retaining the best and the brightest is critical to accelerating the country's economic recovery. We should help foreign graduates and foreign professionals, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, through an increased number of available H-1B work visas and a STEM green card program. Taking these actions will lead to more innovation and job creation and ensure that the U.S. maintains its position as a strong leader in the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Beckerman.","Michael Beckerman: Our immigration system stifles innovation and entrepreneurship .

"(CNN) -- The UK's highest selling newspaper may be embarking on a giant cover up -- much to the delight of its critics -- and putting an end to a tradition opponents see as sexist and outdated. The Sun's topless model on Page 3 has been a tradition since the 1970s. A photo of a bare-breasted young woman along with a corny caption was the newspaper's way of giving its largely male readers a break from the often depressing news of the day. Page 3 quickly became part of The Sun's brand, making the transition from black and white photos to color, then onto the paper's website. Page 3 models often support The Sun's campaigning journalism and are taken on tours to meet serving military. Nudity in newspapers is not the exclusive domain of The Sun. The press and advertising campaigns will often use flesh to draw in the eyeballs in parts of Europe. But now The Sun's owner Rupert Murdoch -- in one tweet -- has raised the specter of a world without Page 3. Murdoch said: ""@Kazipooh page three so last century! You maybe right, don't know but considering. Perhaps halfway house with glamorous fashionistas."" Murdoch later tempered this, saying it was the editor's call. But it was music to the ears of campaigners at ""No More Page Three."" The campaign was started by Lucy Holmes when she realized the day after Jessica Ennis won Olympic gold in the heptathlon for Great Britain last summer ""the largest female image in The Sun was of a young woman showing her breasts."" On April 1, it had 88,000 signatures supporting an end to Page 3. The Sun sells 2.28 million copies a day and has many more readers as each copy sold is read by friends or family. A spokesperson for News International said: ""In a YouGov survey commissioned last October almost two thirds of Sun readers voted to keep the Page 3 format and notably it has more than seven million readers daily of which 45 per cent are female. It remains the UK's biggest selling newspaper which means its formula -- brilliant journalism, entertainment, outstanding sports writing -- and Page 3, is working."" The YouGov survey also found readers of most of the other national papers were more likely to favor an end to the Sun's Page 3. Meanwhile, the UK media landscape is changing after the Leveson Inquiry into phone hacking. Sun staffers have been arrested, its sister paper The News of the World was closed by Murdoch and codes of conduct are being imposed on the media. The emphasis is on ethics, and that might not sit well on Page 3. One anti-Page 3 campaigner, Laura Ashton, told CNN: ""It's exploitative, it's from the 1970s, and the girls back then were very young they were putting in the newspaper. They're not much older now. But it really feels very outdated, that kind of sexism."" Others have tried before. Clare Short was a leading Labour Party MP when in 1986 she tried unsuccessfully to push through legislation that would have outlawed topless models in newspapers. In 2007, Short tried again, only for The Sun to launch a ""Hands Off Our Page 3"" campaign with models being driven by bus to pose outside to the former MP's home. In the UK, topless and nude model magazines are largely restricted to the top shelves of stores where children can't reach them. Only a couple of newspapers containing nudity are put on bottom shelf. Elsewhere in Europe, different standards apply in different markets with topless models used on advertising hoardings for everything from soap to sweaters. Some of the UK's Page 3 models have used their exposure as launchpad for other careers. Sam Fox, perhaps the best-known of them, had a string of pop hits. And Linda Lusardi, another pin-up of the 1980s, became an actress in long-running UK shows like ""The Bill"" and ""Emmerdale."" But even Lusardi, voted by Sun readers in 2005 as the best Page 3 girl ever, said: ""It's time for it to go. I really think things have moved on so far with the internet and with everything else that I don't feel that we really need that in our national newspapers anymore.""","Campaigners hope UK's biggest newspaper will stop publishing topless model photos .

"(CNN) -- Cold weather has delayed spring in Washington, but we can detect a clear warming trend in our politics. To be sure, the distance between the Obama administration and congressional Republicans remains vast, executive and judicial nominations remain blocked by an unprecedented number of filibusters and major legislative accomplishments are still months away. But the ice of gridlock is starting to thaw. Evidence of a healthier, more normal politics is beginning to reappear, centered in the Senate, our political institution that has declined the longest and the furthest. Congress has been in session only a few weeks, but the Senate has already passed its first budget in four years, after finding compromises to avoid the fiscal cliff and the ""nuclear option."" Across the range of tough issues, serious legislative work is moving forward, usually on a bipartisan basis. Eight senators, led by Democrat Chuck Schumer and Republicans John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, have made significant progress toward an agreement on immigration. The Judiciary Committee has reported the first major gun control legislation since 1994, though its fate is far from certain. Democrat Carl Levin, joined by McCain, released a devastating report on the abusive trading practices of JPMorgan Chase. Freshman Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown have expressed similar views as have Republicans Bob Corker and Chuck Grassley on the dangers of ''too big to fail"" banks. Democrat Max Baucus, Senate Finance Committee chairman, and Republican Dave Camp, House Ways and Means chairman, have accelerated their effort, started two years ago, to enact the first major tax reform legislation since 1986. The atmosphere is palpably better. President Barack Obama's ""charm offensive"" on Capitol Hill won approval from many Republicans. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, who after meeting with the president in 2010, called him ""thin- skinned"" and recommended that he ""take valium,"" praised him generously this time around for the substantive meeting on the budget and related economic issues. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who famously declared that defeating Obama was his highest priority, has this year shown much more graciousness, respect and even occasional humor. Two factors are most responsible for the improvement. First, it turns out that elections do have consequences. Obama's decisive re-election, coupled with what amounted to a national landslide won by the Senate Democrats, has forced the Republicans into a period of reassessment and repositioning. Of course, some Republicans still believe that their party lost because its right wing views were did not come through clearly enough. But most Republicans recognize that the party's combination of extremism and obstruction proved to be a losing strategy. They know the Republican brand is in deep trouble. The election results seemed to have convinced at least some of the Senate Republicans that finding areas in which to cooperate with the president is necessary. But the second factor, less understood than the impact of election returns, is just as important. By the end of 2012, for many returning senators and those newly elected, dismay about the Senate has hardened into disgust and determination to change it. Across the political spectrum, senators are fed up with lurching from crisis to crisis, leaders dictating straight party votes, endless filibusters and constant failure to address the nation's problems. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, compared the Senate to ""the Russian Duma ... an endless series of secret conclaves .., with meetings everywhere but in the committee room or the open air of the Senate floor."" Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, took pride in the ""zone of civility"" created by the increasing number of women senators. Sen. Schumer, D-New York, longingly ""looked forward to the good old days when we had major legislation go through committees."" The shorthand for what the overwhelming number of senators want is ""regular order"" -- legislation that results from committee consideration, vigorous debate, the opportunity to offer amendments and hard bargaining to reach principled compromise -- and the Senate is changing as its leaders respond to the members' frustration and anger. Legislating in our diverse, contentious country, with our system of separation of powers, has never been, and will never be, easy. Former Sen. Gary Hart once described the great Senate of the 1970s as ""a kind of controlled madhouse."" The path to major legislative accomplishments is always treacherous and strewn with seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Today, the partisan divide is much deeper and the political culture far more vitriolic than 20 or 30 years ago. Although senators cannot choose the era in which they serve, they can choose the way they approach their work and they can determine the way the Senate functions. It doesn't take much time, or that many people, to change the Senate. Hopefully, day by day, that change is starting to happen.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Jurors in the murder trial of Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell ended their first day of deliberations, Tuesday without a verdict. Deliberations will resume Wednesday morning. Gosnell, 72, is accused of killing babies by using scissors to cut their spinal cords. Authorities allege that some of the infants were born alive and viable during the sixth, seventh and eighth months of pregnancy. Gosnell originally faced first-degree murder charges in the deaths of seven babies and a count of third-degree murder in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, 41. Mongar died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. Judge Jeffrey Minehart threw out three of the seven first-degree murder charges last week. Gosnell also is charged with conspiracy, abortion at 24 or more weeks of pregnancy, theft, corruption of minors, solicitation and other related offenses. He has pleaded not guilty. On Monday, defense attorney Jack McMahon gave an impassioned, 2Â½-hour closing argument disputing the prosecution's evidence, claiming that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already dead as a result of Gosnell administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion. McMahon, stalking the jury box, accused prosecutors of ""the most extraordinary hype and exaggeration in the history of the criminal justice system,"" even adding that they are ""elitist"" and ""racist."" Gosnell, who is African-American, has been accused by authorities of preying on low-income, minority women. McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance. On Tuesday, Minehart spent just over 90 minutes giving the jurors their instructions. Jurors appeared to listen intently; Gosnell took notes, and attorneys watched the jury box. After retiring for deliberations, the jury sent back questions regarding one of the names of a patient and wanted the definition of ""theft by deception."" The judge also tossed out all five abuse-of-corpse charges for storing the feet of aborted fetuses in plastic containers. Minehart dismissed one count of infanticide, the intentional killing of an infant. Gosnell also is accused of reusing unsanitary instruments; performing procedures in filthy rooms, including some in which litter boxes and animals allegedly were present at the time; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia. Nine others who worked in the west Philadelphia medical office, including Gosnell's wife and sister-in-law, also were charged. Eight have pleaded guilty. Also on trial is co-defendant Eileen O'Neill, 56, who worked as a doctor at the Women's Medical Society. O'Neill, who is a medical school graduate, is charged with participating in the operation of a ""corrupt organization"" and ""theft by deception"" for operating without a license to practice medicine. Meanwhile, a gag order preventing attorneys or the jury from speaking to the media remains in place. If he is found guilty of first-degree murder, Gosnell, who is not a board-certified obstetrician or gynecologist, could be sentenced to death. CNN's David Ariosto contributed to this report.","NEW: Deliberations will resume Wednesday morning .

"(CNN) -- A California woman who police say planted two bottles of tainted orange juice at a San Jose Starbucks has been charged with attempted murder, a police spokesman said Tuesday. Ramineh Behbehanian, 50, is accused of adding rubbing alcohol to the contents of the bottles and then placing them into a refrigerated display case, Police Sgt. Jason Dwyer told reporters. ""According to our San Jose firefighters that were on scene and the fire captain there -- they really are the experts there -- it was a lethal dose,"" he said. Behbehanian was arrested Monday after a customer spotted her allegedly pulling out two bottles of orange juice from a bag and putting them in the display case, he said. The customer reported it to employees, according to police. The customer also got a license plate number, and investigators later traced the plate to Behbehanian's residence, Starbucks spokesman Zack Hutson said. The employees immediately pulled the bottles of orange juice from the display case, and the store was evacuated until firefighters could determine the contents of the bottles, Hutson said. The store employees pulled all the remaining juices from the cold case and destroyed them, he said. Nearby Starbucks stores were also notified of the incident and told to check the juice bottles. Hutson said the coffee chain was ""immensely grateful"" to the customer who alerted employees to the tainted juice bottles. Dwyer would not comment on the evidence in the case nor a possible motive, saying authorities were ""still very much in investigative mode."" He did say the bottles were opened rather than injected by a syringe. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: A customer spotted the suspect switching out the bottles, Starbucks says .

"(EW.com) -- Turns out putting Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson into the lead role is a good idea to keep a franchise going. G.I. Joe: Retaliation soldiered into the top spot over Easter weekend, piling up $41.2 million over three days and bringing the four-day cume to $51.7 million. Retaliation didn't quite set the record for Easter weekend — those bragging rights belong to 2010′s Clash of the Titans ($61.2 million) — and it didn't quite match the opening of G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra's $54.7 million bow in 2009. But Johnson and Channing Tatum's starpower helped keep the attrition from the poorly received Cobra to a minimum. Plus, the overseas figures are far out-pacing Cobra, bringing Retaliation to a healthy $132 million global total, roughly matching the $130-plus million budget for Paramount. Not surprisingly, the testosterone-heavy action pic attracted a 61 percent male crowd who gave it a strong ""A--"" CinemaScore. Also having a good Friday and good run in general was Dreamworks' animated Stone Age comedy The Croods, which grossed $26.5 domestically in its second weekend and sailed past the $200 million mark internationally for a 10-day total of $229.1 million. Tyler Perry turned far away from Madea with his steamy thriller Temptation, which paid off for Lionsgate with a voluptuous $22.3 million. Starring Friday Night Lights' Jurnee Smollett-Bell and Kim Kardashian, who brought the film outsize media attention, Temptation didn't reach the heights of Madea's Big Happy Family opened ($25.3 million) or Why Did I Get Married Too? ($29.3 million), which were both sequels, but it did outperform industry expectations. Tyler Perry's name still means money, even if precedes the full title Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor. It's the ninth Perry film to debut over $20 million; the only other directors to have reached that distinction are Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis. Despite its Twilight connections, no one had overly high hopes for the alien invasion romance The Host, based on the novel by Stephenie Meyer. Neither the novel nor the three leads — Saoirse Ronan, Max Irons, and Jake Abel — were nearly as squeal inducing to the largely female audiences that made Twilight popular. Weighed down by laughably bad reviews and unappealing trailers, The Host disappointed with $11 million in sixth place. 1. G.I. Joe: Retaliation -- $41.2 million . 2. The Croods -- $26.5 million . 3. Tyler Perry's Temptation -- $22.3 million . 4. Olympus Has Fallen -- $14 million . 5. Oz the Great and Powerful -- $11.6 million . 6. The Host -- $11 million . In the limited market, the Derek Cianfrance-directed The Place Behind the Pines, starring Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes, and Bradley Cooper, grossed $270,184 in only four theaters.

"(CNN) -- The International Olympic Committee announced Wednesday that Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid have made it on to the short list of cities bidding to host the 2020 Olympic Games. Baku and Doha were rejected for the second time in a row after failing to make the 2016 games. ""The executive board has decided that the following cities can continue to the next phase and become candidates for 2020. In the order of drawing lots: Istanbul, Tokyo, and Madrid,"" said IOC spokesman Mark Adams. The three remaining candidate cities will enter into Phase 2 of the selection period. Files from the cities will be submitted to the IOC by January 7, 2013. Following an official visit by the IOC Evaluation Commission between February and April of 2013, a report will be made to the 2020 IOC Evaluation Commission and candidate cities will brief IOC members. The election of the host city of the XXXII Olympic Summer Games will take place on September 7, 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires. In culling the field from five to three cities, the IOC executive board relied ""on application files, the report of a working group of experts which is formed to assess the application forms of each city, the city's compliance with elements like the World Anti-Doping Code, and other criteria,"" said Adams. Doha, the capital of the Gulf state of Qatar, had proposed changing the games to October 2-18, to mitigate the extreme temperatures athletes would have to experience during the usual July-August summer games. Based on a 10-year average, Doha temperatures in October range from 30 to 36 degrees Celsius (86 to 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit). The working group also decided against Baku, the capital city of Azerbaijan, for its infrastructural limitations.

"Washington (CNN) -- Millions of undocumented immigrants would get immediate but provisional status to live and work in America under a compromise plan proposed Monday by a bipartisan group of eight senators. While temporarily removing legal uncertainty for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants, the senators' outline also called for strengthening border controls, improved monitoring of visitors and cracking down on hiring undocumented workers. Only after those steps occurred could the undocumented immigrants already in the country begin the process of getting permanent residence -- green cards -- as a step toward citizenship, the senators told a news conference. ""They would no longer be deported, provided they don't have a criminal record. They would no longer be harassed, they would be allowed to stay here and work,"" said Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York in describing the immediate impact of the framework if crafted into legislation and enacted. The outline for a possible immigration bill reflects a new willingness by mainstream Republicans to compromise following their party's defeat in November, when President Barack Obama got strong backing from Latino voters. ""Elections, elections,"" answered Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a veteran of past immigration battles in Congress, when asked to explain the push now for a bill that proved unattainable two years ago. ""The Republican Party is losing the support of our Hispanic citizens,"" McCain said. ""We realize that there are many issues on which we think we are in agreement with our Hispanic citizens, but this is a preeminent issue with those citizens."" His party and all Americans now realized that ""we cannot continue as a nation with 11 million people residing in the shadows,"" McCain added. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a tea party-backed conservative considered a rising star in the Republican party, said the goal was to create a ""modern immigration system"" that treated everyone fairly -- both the undocumented and those waiting to come to America legally. ""None of this is possible if we don't address the reality there are 11 million people in this country who are undocumented,"" Rubio said. However, another tea party-backed Republican, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, objected to the framework by his colleagues, saying the guidelines ""contemplate a policy that will grant special benefits to illegal immigrants based on their unlawful presence in the country."" Other conservatives immediately voiced their opposition to what they called amnesty, a code word on the political right for providing undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. ""When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration,"" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who serves on the immigration subcommittee in the House. ""By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration."" NumbersUSA, a group seeking to reduce U.S. immigration, called the Senate plan an attempt to ""out-amnesty Obama"" and said it was activating its 1.3 million members to push for congressional opposition. House Speaker John Boehner's office was noncommittal, saying he looked forward to learning more about the senators' plan. A similar effort on immigration is said to be under way in the House, involving a group of Republicans and Democrats. Two senior House Democratic sources briefed on the effort told CNN the group was working to release some sort of outline of its plan soon, possibly as early as this week, but concede ""they are not as far along as the Senate."" Like the Senate framework, the House plan will include a path to citizenship, but details of how that will work are still being discussed. McCain and Rubio, joined by three Democratic colleagues at the news conference, acknowledged the political challenge, with Rubio calling the legislative process ahead ""enormously complicated."" Read the senate plan . Obama is expected to deliver a speech in Las Vegas on Tuesday to discuss comprehensive immigration legislation, which he calls a priority of his second term. According to senior administration officials, the president will say the senators' plan represents progress and argue that now is the time to act. He will lay out his vision for immigration reform, which is consistent with the Senate plan, they said. Obama is not expected to present legislation during his speech, nor anytime this week. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said the president welcomed the senators' framework, calling it a ""big deal"" because it included an eventual path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. ""He is encouraged by the progress we have seen from members of both parties in the Senate, and looks forward to working with members of both parties to reach a point in the hopefully not too distant future where we have a bill that has bipartisan support, that is very specific, and that he can sign because it meets his principles,"" Carney said. Path to citizenship: Senators outline bipartisan immigration plan . Meanwhile, a litany of left-leaning advocacy groups spoke out on the senators' plan, praising it as a good first step but cautioning against harming the rights of workers. ""The people of this country are ready for us to be one country again without second-class people being mistreated simply because they lack paper even though they are already contributing to our economy and our tax system,"" noted NAACP President Ben Jealous. Democratic senators backing the plan include Schumer, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Michael Bennet of Colorado. On the Republican side, McCain and Rubio were joined by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona. What you don't know about Latinos in America . The eight senators based their framework on four ""pillars,"" described as: . -- A ""tough but fair"" path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already living in the United States, but only after bolstering the nation's border security; . -- Overhauling the country's legal immigration system, including attaching green cards to advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, or math from U.S. universities; . -- Establishing an employment verification system that holds employers accountable for hiring undocumented workers; . -- Creating a guest-worker program for positions that Americans are either unable or unwilling to fill. Lawmakers: GOP needs to back immigration overhaul . A source familiar with how the eight senators came up with the plan told CNN that Graham called Schumer after the November vote to restart work on an immigration bill that broke down in 2010. Soon, a core group of six senators formed and met five times in the following weeks in the offices of Schumer and McCain, the source said, adding that Flake and Bennet also took part in some of the meetings and were the last to agree to the proposal. Opinion: Worker visas are the key to immigration reform . Schumer said Monday that an initial timetable called for delivering the text of a bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee by March, and Senate passage by late spring or in the summer. He and Durbin called Obama on Sunday to tell him of the agreement by the senators, Schumer said, describing the president as ""delighted."" DREAMer's clout increases in immigration debate . Obama came under criticism from Latino activists for failing to deliver on 2008 campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority of his first term. Last year, as his re-election campaign heated up, the Obama administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the Latino community. Exit polls in November indicated Latino voters gave overwhelming support to Obama over GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves.

"(CNN) -- On a recent flight from Atlanta, I was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and a half. The woman seated behind me played two Adele songs on a loop on her iPad. On speaker. For an hour. No one said anything. At one point the woman took a call. ""I'm on the plane,"" I heard her tell the caller. ""It's Adele on my iPad!"" Then, ""I don't have headphones. But everyone likes Adele!"" Anyone who has ever been on a plane, and is over the age of 10, has probably experienced some form of air rage. Creating it, witnessing it or just making a supreme mental effort not to succumb to it by thumping your seatmate for an outrageous offense such as playing loud music, noisily speaking on the phone or eating food so stinky it might actually be considered a weapon. The good news: you're not alone. The bad news: air rage is becoming routine. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) saw a 29% rise in incidents on board flights between 2009 and 2010. The Transportation Security Administration, however, has seen a decline over the last three years in security-related disturbances the agency has been called to deal with on planes. Air rage: Passengers 'quicker to snap' However you slice it, you don't have to work too hard to notice multiple recent examples of passengers losing their cool in lavish fashion. This year alone we've seen some impressive displays of in-flight fury. January started with an unruly passenger aboard a Reykjavik to New York flight who finished his journey rather inelegantly duct-taped to a seat after an apparent display of screaming, hitting and spitting at fellow passengers. Later that month, a Jetblue flight from New York to San Diego made an unscheduled stop in Denver to remove a woman who allegedly became verbally abusive after another passenger was moved to a neighboring ""even more legroom"" seat near her. The source of the woman's rage was apparently that the man had not paid for the extra legroom ($65), but had been moved there due to a broken television in his seat. In February, a male passenger on a flight to Atlanta is accused of hitting another passenger's crying baby, uttering a racial slur as he did so. Man accused of slapping toddler will plead not guilty . According to an FBI affidavit, a passenger on a February Hawaiian airlines flight from New York assaulted a flight attendant, spat food at people and bit an air marshal. And another February incident proved that you don't even have to be up in the air to experience air travel-related anger. Yan Linkun, identified by NBC News as an executive and Chinese Communist Party official, became incensed at Kunming Changshui International Airport in Kunming, China. Learning he'd missed not one but two flights, Linkun vented his rage by flinging equipment and smashing windows in an impressive tirade that has since gone viral. Airline squeeze: It's not you, it's the seat . Frustrations on the ground and in the air may seem to invite air rage. Before fliers even reach their allocated metal bird, they've often struggled through security and customs lines and may face delays at the gate or on board. And the United States' recent mandatory government spending cuts could make those slowdowns at airports worse. Airlines, angling to make a profit, are chipping away at legroom or charging extra for a little more room, introducing new fees or bundling and unbundling the existing charges and re-jiggering mileage programs to favor the elite big-spenders. Travelers take aim at kids on a plane . Air travelers are agitated, but it doesn't quite explain why some boil over on planes. Is the altitude getting to them? HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky points out that fliers can experience mild brain swelling even at low altitudes that can make it harder to keep your cool. Or are enraged passengers just under the influence? ""If you want to look at one single contributing factor, you would have to point at alcohol,"" Dr. Drew says. Andrew Thomson, creator of airrage.org and author of several air-travel related books including ""Air Rage: Crisis in the Skies,"" agrees. ""Alcohol,"" he writes, ""is the leading driver of air rage."" In fact, many of the air rage incidents above were allegedly alcohol-related. Fortunately, no one on my flight was outwardly enraged or inebriated, though I'm sure, like me, many passengers were entertaining extravagant fantasies of how they'd deal with that offending Adele fan and her iPad. What in-flight behaviors push you to the verge of an outburst? Share your stories below.","A string of air rage incidents in the first months of the year highlight air traveler tensions .

"(CNN) -- America's longest war is expected to conclude by the end of next year, when the United States plans to withdraw all its combat troops from Afghanistan. But many challenges remain. Insurgents are still a ""resilient and determined"" threat, according to a Pentagon report released this week. Afghan security forces must be fully trained to take over for U.S. troops. And the two countries have to come to an agreement over what kind of troop presence the U.S. will have in 2014. ""How this war winds down is very important to Afghanistan, to the United States and so many other countries,"" said CNN's Erin Burnett, who has been in Afghanistan this week talking to U.S. officials, troops and Afghan civilians. ""People paid for this with their lives. People have died, people have spent a decade of their lives fighting this war away from home. And of course, the U.S. has spent about $650 billion on the war alone."" Read more: Taliban claim bombing killing American, Afghans . Burnett talked to CNN.com on Thursday about her trip and what she's been hearing from various people about the transition and their hopes for Afghanistan's future. Here is an edited version of the conversation: . CNN.com: You talked with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Thursday. What's he saying about the war effort? Has the U.S. accomplished its mission? Erin Burnett: Panetta points out the success in bringing down key members of core al Qaeda, and he believes he has made real progress on fighting al Qaeda and terrorism in Afghanistan. But he acknowledges that insurgents are still a problem, and he acknowledges that al Qaeda and terrorists have now spread and they're in other places. He specifically mentioned to me Yemen, Somalia and Mali. And he still thinks that al Qaeda is the single biggest threat to the American homeland. CNN.com: What does that mean for U.S. troops in Afghanistan after the 2014 drawdown? Burnett: Both Panetta and (Army Maj. Gen. Robert) Abrams, the regional commander in Kandahar, are very wary of discussing troop count. ... Some of it's going to come down to the treatment of U.S. troops' indemnity, which Panetta told me he's sure won't be a problem but the deputy foreign minister here in Afghanistan said was a serious issue that is on the table. We're a long way away from having the details set in an agreement that the United States would actually sign. I got the sense that the overall agreement is something that's going to take a significant amount of time. CNN.com: Are Afghan forces going to be prepared by 2014? Burnett: In Kabul, traffic is a really huge problem, and they now have Afghan National Police doing the traffic control. Traffic control is something we in America take for granted, but you can see there's still a long way to go for them in terms of learning basic protocols. And that kind of fits in with the recent Pentagon report that said only one in 23 brigades of the Afghan National Security Forces are actually ready to do their job from A to Z -- from dealing with things like electricity to (medical evacuations), whatever it is to operate a war. The deputy foreign minister I talked to said, ""Look that's not really fair, we're trying to train brigades on one thing at a time."" But you had issues like that. I talked to a U.S. sergeant in Kandahar who works at a forward operating base and his job has now become training Afghans. I asked him what his relationship was with them. And he said he had to trust them completely and they were like his brothers. This is a guy who's served four tours, missed three Christmases, put a lot of time in. And he really was loyal to them. When I asked him explicitly, saying, ""A lot of the coverage is pretty negative on how this training's coming, what have you seen?"" he was very positive and he gave some examples on the communication they have with each other and their units and what significant progress he feels they have made. He really felt a sense of accomplishment and achievement, and you have to hope that his version of things ends up being the real version. Read more: Navy SEAL killed in Afghanistan was smart, in superb shape . CNN.com: What's the general feeling among the Afghan people? Are they glad the U.S. is making plans to leave? Burnett: I'm hearing two totally different stories. Some people we've spoken to here sort of take it for granted that there's going to be a civil war when the United States leaves. It happened before when the Soviet Union left. One female member of parliament I talked to, she wasn't totally in that camp, but she was extremely afraid of it, saying: ""I hope that it won't and I have to have confidence that we're going to be able to overcome it. But yes, I have that fear."" And then there are others who really try to be more optimistic. We were at a bazaar today, and we asked a whole bunch of people whether they thought it was a good thing that the United States was leaving. Many said they were glad, and they basically said we're glad because it's time we take this on ourselves. There was a real sense of pride that they could do it. These weren't people in the military. These were regular people on the street. CNN.com: What else has stood out to you during your trip? Burnett: During the Taliban, basically there were thousands of girls going to school in Afghanistan. Now you have millions of girls going to school. So there's been real progress on women's rights. Obviously, there remain a lot of problems -- honor killings, forced marriages, domestic violence -- but there has been real progress. There are women's rights activists who are really afraid that when the U.S. leaves, a lot of the progress will be rolled back. The female member of parliament I talked to, she is worried but hopeful. She has two daughters, 13 and 14. They really want to stay in their country, and they say, in their own experience, that there's been such a change in what girls can do. One of them wants to be president. One of them wants to be a space engineer. It was a pretty cool and inspiring thing to see, but it sort of brought home the risks and what's at stake here. ... This was the most meaningful to me: the hopes that they have and the fact that they want to stay in their country and they want to fight for its future. If you have that going for you, then I think that's probably the best sign of hope that there is. Read more: U.S. citizen rescued from the Taliban in Afghanistan . Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET.

"New York (CNN) -- After a sudden increase in shootings over the weekend, the New York Police Department has deployed more officers, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. More uniformed officers will be assigned to public housing developments citywide, and plainclothes officers will go to borough- and precinct-based anti-crime units during hours that are prone to shootings. As weekend temperatures topped 90 degrees Fahrenheit, New York City saw a sudden increase in shootings, with 26 people felled by bullets in 72 hours -- seven fatally. Three of the injured victims were younger than 16, Browne said. ""When we have hot temperatures, we see that the crime rate seems to go up,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday. Investigators are also monitoring gangs for any signs of planned retribution based on shootings over the weekend, Browne said. Mobile and fixed camera-equipped observation towers will also be used near the sites of the recent shootings, Browne said in a statement. But even after the shootings in the 72-hour period from Friday through Sunday, Bloomberg emphasized that the year's homicides are down 24% from last year, for a total of 127 through Sunday, which is 40 less than the same period in 2012. ""One shooting is one too many, but last week we had the fewest shootings in a decade, including this weekend's shootings,"" Bloomberg said. In November 2012, New York City logged a record-breaking ""murder-free Monday,"" when there was not a single reported slaying, stabbing or shooting in any of the five boroughs, the New York Police Department said. ""It is unusual in a city of 8 million people, but we never read that much into one day,"" said Browne, who said it was the ""first time in memory"" that the city had such a lull in violent crime. At the close of 2012, Bloomberg called New York City the ""safest big city in America,"" giving the NYPD credit. ""The fact that the safest big city in America is safer than ever is a testament to the hard work and determination of the men and women who put their lives on the line for us every day -- and it also reflects our commitment to doing everything possible to stop gun violence,"" he said. CNN's Laura Ly contributed to this report.","In New York, 26 people were reported shot in a 72-hour period from Friday to Sunday .

"(CNN) -- When we left ""The Walking Dead"" crew in the midseason finale in December, the original survivors were coming head-to-head with the Governor and his followers in the isolated community of Woodbury. Gunbattles ensued, as did dramatic rescue attempts that led to a cliffhanger involving two of the show's central characters -- brothers Daryl and Merle Dixon -- in a ring, surrounded by an angry mob calling for their heads. Will Rick Grimes and the original survivors integrate into Woodbury? Or will human-on-human violence prove to be more dangerous than the roaming flesh-eaters? AMC's popular zombie series resumes on Sunday, and CNN spoke with Robert Kirkman, executive producer and creator of the original comic book series, about what fans can expect for the last half of season 3, life after outgoing showrunner Glen Mazzara and how long even the undead can survive the apocalypse on TV. CNN: ""The Walking Dead's"" ratings have exploded this season. What's connecting with audiences? Robert Kirkman: AMC has a really great program with building viewership. They do a tremendous amount of work, running marathons, promoting those marathons, promoting the DVDs and working with partners like Netflix and iTunes to make sure everything is available. So while people are hearing news about the show, AMC is doing a really good job at helping develop the audience. Also, we're awesome. People seem to like the show. CNN: Was there concern in the beginning that the adaptation might not be able to transition from the comic world to a broader audience? Kirkman: I'm somewhat of a pessimist. I never expected this to get made; I never expected the pilot to get picked up; I never expected the episodes to make it to air. I didn't really treat this show like it was happening until it premiered and until the ratings came in. There was a good 24-hour period where I was thinking, ""this is not going to last."" I think that's relative to its success. There's really nothing like this on television. There's really no comparison. I never thought it would succeed or succeed as well it has. It's all been pretty surprising. AMC took this risk and put something really unique on television, and people are responding to it on the level where it's having other networks try to think outside the box. As a television fan, when I see things like ""American Horror Story,"" these kind of crazy shows that you wouldn't expect to see on television, things like ""The Following"" -- it's really exciting to see all this new stuff coming in. CNN: Obviously, the story and the art in the comic books stand out. Is the aesthetic of the show taking a certain direction that you're noticing? Kirkman: Not necessarily. We try to focus on the struggle of human survival. That's really what's at the core of this show: the appeal of watching people persevere and endure and succeed. This show is very much about trying to rebuild civilization in a micro sort of way. It's about keeping a family together and keeping your loved ones safe. It's much more about that heart and emotion than the more splashy stuff you see with the zombies, the action and the horror. CNN: The hook is ""you get to see zombies eat people. Who doesn't love that?"" But there's the mental anguish that the viewers are put through. Kirkman: Yeah, the zombies eat people, and that's cool and everything, but you really care about those people that are getting eaten. You feel for the other characters when they run around, and you hope that the rest of the characters don't get eaten. That's a very important component. CNN: As executive producer and a writer, how much input do you have on each episode that we see? Kirkman: Well, I mean, I'm one of the writers in the writers' room. There's a piece of every writer in every episode, little suggestions here and there. Things that make it into the final episode that we sort of throw out on the fly in the writers' room. I, like all the writers, have tremendous influence in terms of what goes into the show. I go on set as a producer, I oversee visual effects with a lot of the other producers; I'm giving notes on edits and cuts. I work hand-in-hand with all the other executive producers and Glen Mazzara in season 3 and craft the show into what it is. CNN: Speaking of Glen, it was recently announced that he'd be leaving at the end of season 3 for ""creative differences."" Where do you see the creative direction of the show going? Kirkman: I think the creative couldn't be at a better place. I think we have a really strong season 3. Moving forward, it's important to note that television is a collaborative medium, and there may be an element that changes from season to season, but the core group, the core people that make ""The Walking Dead"" what it is, changes a little bit from season to season. The majority of people remain, so the show is still going to have the same flavor. I couldn't be more excited about all the things we're going to be doing in season 4. CNN: Let's talk about the rest of season 3. What can viewers expect? What are some of the issues and themes that manifest? Kirkman: I think we have some really cool stuff ahead. If you've seen the first half of the season, you know the people in Woodbury are there. They're led by the Governor, and they're definitely going to be a problem. You got Rick with his people, and they're trying to survive, and you have these two groups who are on this collision course. It's going to be coming to a head. You're going to see big conflicts and pretty huge stakes, and some pretty dangerous things are going to happen to these people. Some of them may not survive. As fast-paced and explosive as the first half of the season has been, we're really going to be upping the ante and escalating things where we reach a finale, where some pretty crazy stuff is going to go down. CNN: Who do you think is the most compelling character at the moment? Kirkman: It's really hard to pick. I could gush about every single character. The work that Chandler (Riggs) is doing on Carl is amazing. I think all the actors would agree: Watching his transformation over the first three seasons of this show is a really cool piece of this show. He's been expanding his role in very cool ways, becoming this child soldier that we've gotten to know. He's a character that I would recommend people pay attention to and watch. It's watching these characters grow and change over time. That's really the core aspect, and you don't really see that in a lot of television shows. When you look at season 3, sure, Glenn's there, Rick's there, Daryl Dixon's there -- but they're vastly different than they were in season 1. CNN: With a show that's become so engaged with its fans, do you pay attention to reactions, either positive or negative? Kirkman: I've gotten the benefit of working in the comic industry for 10 years. I've always been very tuned in to fan reactions, message boards and all that kind of stuff. I'm pretty good at ignoring the negative comments and not letting them get me too much. There's always going to be negative comments. Honestly, I've learned if you don't have negativity in fan reactions, you're just not reaching enough fans. With ""The Walking Dead"" being as popular as it is, I actually enjoy the negative comments. We're reaching people to a point where they care so much, they voice their opinions. CNN: You've written two novels about ""The Walking Dead."" Have you had talks about turning those into films? Kirkman: There's always stuff like that thrown out, but there's no plans like that right now. It's enough for ""The Walking Dead"" to be a television show, a comic, a video game, another video game and another video game. There's quite a lot going on in ""The Walking Dead"" world. I can't say there's never going to be a movie; it's just not on our radar yet. CNN: In a perfect world, how many seasons do you see this show lasting? Kirkman: I think we'd be incredibly fortunate if we were one of those shows that got to go seven seasons. I think that's a good possibility in our future, the way things are going. Hopefully, we'll make it there. At the same time, this is a very unique show. You never know. Personally, if I could wave a magic wand, I'd make it go 20 seasons. This is the kind of story that is exciting to watch these characters grown and change over time. The comic book has been going for a decade and probably will go for another decade, I hope. I have no intention of ending that any time soon. I think there will always be a wealth of story potential in a universe like this.","""The Walking Dead"" third season resumes Sunday .

"(CNN) -- With the arrival of Lollapalooza 2012, 100,000 attendees are expected to descend on Chicago's Grant Park every day this weekend. The event has been sold out for several months, with The Black Keys, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jack White headlining in addition to an Ozzy Osbourne-led reunion of Black Sabbath. But equally important to Lollapalooza founder Perry Farrell is his contingent of top DJs, which include Kaskade and Bassnectar. ""We are now blowing out our dance artists. We have two electronic dance musicians headlining. One is Justice, the other Avicii,"" he said with genuine excitement. Dance artists are the new rock stars, and they're commanding rock star salaries. ""They're making millions,"" Farrell said. ""The agents are asking the same fees they would ask for a rock artist because they're saying, 'Look, we're as attractive as a rock artist, so why shouldn't we be making the same amount of money?'"" Farrell's band, Jane's Addiction, won't be performing at Lolla this year, but on Saturday night they'll be playing an after-party at the nearby Aragon Ballroom. Although tickets sold out in five minutes, fans of the pioneering alternative group will be able to see the show via a 360-degree live webcast. Lollapalooza has grown in size, but Farrell hopes to restore some of the intimacy with after-parties -- both official and unofficial (at last count, there were 31 official after-parties listed on the Lollapalooza website). ""We're taking the city, and we're filling the arteries of the city and its nightclubs and ballrooms with our Lollapalooza audience and musicians. We're taking it up a notch, and we're taking it to four in the morning,"" he said. ""I just love that. It's not just Grant Park -- the whole city is alive!"" From 1991-1997, Lollapalooza was a touring festival. It went on hiatus in 1998, returned for one year in 2003, then resurrected itself as a single location event in 2005. It has been an annual fixture in Grant Park ever since. In 2011, Farrell expanded the brand to Chile and Brazil in 2012, and will be making a big announcement about Lollapalooza's plans for expansion this Sunday. (Hint: It's not a Lollapalooza cruise.) Back in Chicago, doors have barely opened on Lollapalooza 2012, but wheeling and dealing is already in motion to secure next year's lineup. ""You've got to really work at it. You've got to bring to the people something that they didn't expect, they won't forget and they've never had before. It's not easy to do that,"" Farrell said. ""That's something you have to pull out of the ether."" His dream headliner? ""There are a couple of legendary rock groups that I would love to get. Most of the time, the reason that you don't get to work with them is it's their problem -- meaning they're not together, or they broke up, or they hate each other or they're not healthy."" But in the meantime, Farrell already has one ace in the hole. ""I already know who's going to be headlining next year,"" he said with a sly smile.","100,000 attendees a day are expected to visit Lollapalooza this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's military says it's questioning a leader of Boko Haram, the Islamic militant group blamed for the killings of hundreds of civilians, after capturing him in the country's northeast early Sunday. Nigerian troops captured Mohammed Zangina shortly after midnight in the city of Maiduguri, said Lt. Col. Sagir Musa, a military spokesman. Zangina is a member of the Shura Committee, the movement's governing body, and has coordinated ""most of the most of the suicide attacks and bombings"" in several cities, including the capital Abuja, Musa said. Nigeria launched a military crackdown on Boko Haram on New Year's Day. Human Rights Watch says the group -- whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege"" -- has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria. In the past, the group attacked other Muslims it felt were on an immoral path. But it has increasingly targeted Christians with numerous attacks on churches, as well as striking police stations. Boko Haram and other Muslim groups say the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the Nigerian government. But the U.S. State Department has accused its leaders of having ties to the al Qaeda terrorist network and of hoping to drive a wedge between Nigeria's Christian and Muslim communities. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.","Nigeria says Mohammed Zangina helped coordinate Boko Haram attacks .

"(CNN) -- Don Price's passion for military airplanes flows through his veins, passed down from his father's stories of piloting Boeing B-17s in World War II. These days, Price restores those planes and, in doing so, rekindles a connection with his father. Restoration is a complicated and expensive process -- Price worked on one plane for five years -- but he says the payoff is worth it. ""As a kid, you look at war more romantically. It's good versus bad, like cops and robbers,"" he said. ""But as you get older and you realize what they physically had to go through, the hardships, it changes your perspective."" So when he learned a restored B-17 known as the Liberty Belle was consumed by fire after making an emergency landing in an Illinois cornfield Monday, Price felt as though he had lost a family member. The seven people aboard the Belle escaped with minor injuries but the plane, which cost more than $3 million to restore, was reduced to a charred shell as firefighters struggled to put out the fire. The passengers aboard were all members of the Liberty Foundation, which owned the plane. The Belle toured the country offering paid flights to World War II veterans and aviation enthusiasts. ""The Liberty Belle was the first B-17 that I got to ride on,"" Price said. ""It's a huge loss."" Though the plane had been grounded for maintenance issues over the weekend, it was cleared for flight on Monday. Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board said an inspection will be carried out to determine the cause of the fire. ""From what I can tell from the pictures, the pilot made a spectacular landing,"" Price said. ""He got the landing gear down and found the best field possible. If they had crash-landed it, no one would've gotten out of the plane."" He said he vividly recalls looking at the massive Boeing B-17 with wide-eyed wonder on a family trip to the Wright-Patterson Air Force Museum. Price, then 4 years old, crawled through the shiny aluminum plane out the back door and into his father's arms. ""This is the plane I flew in the war,"" his father told him. Growing up, Price heard people call his dad a ""gifted"" pilot. He knew he'd flown what was dubbed The Flying Fortress during the war. But Price said never thought of Lt. William M. Price III as much more than dad -- until he was much older. As history laid bare the harsh realities of WWII, Price said, he decided to record his father's experiences. ""I decided to interview him because I started to realize he was one of the heroes that they made movies about,"" he said. ""During the time he was flying, he had a one in four chance of finishing a mission alive."" He completed 25. Lt. Price was assigned to the 384th Bombardment Group (Heavy) of the 8th Air Force at the height of the war. During one of his early missions, he and six other airmen bailed out of their plane over the English Channel after it became apparent that their bullet-riddled bomber wouldn't make it back to England. They were rescued by an English fisherman. Price was also one of the 43 wounded airmen to return from an air strike on a German ball bearing company during what military historians christened ""Black Thursday."" The Air Force lost 600 men and 60 planes over enemy territory that day, according to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force. Price survived. More than 60 years after the end of World War II, Don Price refurbishes military airplanes in honor of his father. As a volunteer member in the Gulf Coast Wing of the Commemorative Air Force, Price worked for five years to restore a B-17 known as the Texas Raiders to flying condition. Since 1967, Commemorative Air Force has spent more than $1.1 million to restore Raiders to flying condition, in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration specifications. The most recent restoration work on the plane was completed in October 2009. Price described the Raiders' first flight after that as nerve-wracking because he knew the plane hadn't left the ground in seven years. ""It was definitely an adrenaline rush to take off and know that it was finally flyable,"" he said. ""It was an even happier moment when we landed and knew we could go back up again."" After Monday's crash, both of the Gulf Coast Wing's B-17s were grounded as a precaution and will undergo inspection of their fuel systems. Retired naval pilot Felix Usis called the loss of the Belle devastating because the plane was in pristine condition. During World War II, he said, 12,371 B-17s were built. As of Monday, only 14 flight-worthy planes were left. ""We now have one less,"" he said. After retiring from years as a commercial airline captain, Usis began volunteering as a military historian at the Military Aviation Museum in Virginia Beach, Virginia. He lamented not only the loss of a historic artifact, but also the Liberty Foundation's loss of a major investment. ""In 1944, the cost per delivery of a B-17 was $204,370. If you multiply that figure by the 12,000 that were delivered you can start to see that the cost of war was very expensive even back then."" Sandra Thompson, spokeswoman for the Gulf Coast Wing, noted that most of the B-17's parts are no longer manufactured. ""When you restore a part that is broken or cracked and corroded, you have to create a part that is no longer produced,"" she said. The process, called ""forgery,"" can take years of scouring the globe for a company willing to recreate a single part. Generating all the materials necessary to completely restore a plane can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. But Thompson said the driving force behind all of the hard work and money lies within the volunteers. ""There is a passion many of us have in seeing the past being given life again through the restoration,"" she said. And in seeing families, like the Prices, brought back together again. ""There are so few World War II veterans living today, and when we reintroduce this aircraft with those veterans, it brings tears and old memories back into perspective,"" Thompson said. ""That makes it very worthwhile for the volunteers who restore these planes."" World War II service members were always recognized for their contributions to freedom, Price said. But when Vietnam made the military unpopular, his father stopped telling stories. ""I asked him if I could record some of his stories and he was amazed and touched because he thought no one would care about what he'd done,"" he said. ""It took a while for people to figure out that their fathers, uncles and brothers did heroic deeds worth being thankful for."" The World War II generation is often remembered as this nation's greatest war generation but Price said it's important to not to forget the men and women in uniform who are still sacrificing for America. ""Part of the hope is that by keeping the history alive and maintaining records of what it took to overcome a totalitarian dictator, we won't make some of the same mistakes we did before,"" he said. ""Learning more and more from my dad and about him made a world of difference in my world view. I became proud of my country and my father.""","Don Price restores military airplanes as a way to connect with his father .

"(CNN) -- The world record long jump of 29 feet, 4 1/4 inches, set by American Mike Powell, has stood for nearly 22 years. That imposing distance is nearly five times Powell's 6-foot-2 height. But an athletic, evolved guppy would scoff at that accomplishment, if you can consider guppies athletic. And if guppies scoffed. The popular pet fish can jump up to eight times their body length, at speeds of more than 4 feet per second, according to a recently published research paper in the online peer-reviewed journal PLOS One. University of Maryland biologist Daphne De Freitas Soares and biology lecturer Hilary S. Bierman discovered the guppies' ability while using high-speed videography and digital imaging to analyze the jumping behavior of nine guppies from a wild Trinidadian species, Poecilia reticulata, related to the familiar pet-shop fish. While studying evolutionary changes to the guppies' brain stems, one of the fish jumped out of a laboratory tank and into Soares' cup of iced chai, prompting closer scrutiny, she said. Soares and Bierman reported the jumping guppies started from a still position, swam backwards slowly, then changed direction and hurtled into the air. No researcher has ever reported seeing a fish preparing to jump like that, Soares and Bierman said. The Maryland researchers concluded that while many fish launch out of the water into the air to capture prey, migrate, or avoid predators, the guppies have a different evolutionary motive: to reach all the available habitat in Trinidad's mountain streams. By dispersing, guppies move away from areas of heavy predation, minimize competition with one another and keep the species' genetic variability high, the researchers said. That probably comes as no consolation to your children if their guppies jump out of their fish bowl. But at least now, you'll have a plausible explanation.","U. of Maryland researchers say they've witnessed never-before-seen behavior in fish .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Six years ago an ad in the Sunday paper changed a young Pakistani woman's life and made aviation history. Seven Pakistani women are trained to fly the country's F-7 fighter jets -- though none have seen combat so far. The ad read: ""Pakistan Air Force recruiting females cadets."" Back then Ambreen Gul was 20-years old and living in Karachi. Her mother wanted her to be a doctor. She remembers her reaction when she told her she wants to fly. ""She was like: 'You're a girl,'"" says Gul. ""How will you do it? How will you fly?"" The following day Gul took the first step in proving her mother wrong. She was among the first in line at the recruitment center. For nearly six decades it was only men who had flown Pakistan's fighter jets. Today Gul is one of seven women who are trained and ready to fly Pakistan's F-7 supersonic fighter jets. ""This is a feeling that makes you proud and makes you humble also,"" says Gul. Humility doesn't mean lack of confidence. ""We can do everything better than the men,"" explains cadet Nida Tariq. ""We're more hardworking, more consistent and more patient,"" adds cadet Anam Faiq. To become a fighter pilot takes three years of training at the Air Force Academy in Risalpur, Pakistan, where the halls are lined with grainy black-and-white pictures of nearly six decades of male graduates who went on to fly for the Pakistan Air Force. The training is often intensely physical. Here, equal opportunity means equal treatment. If they are not good enough as per their male counterparts, we don't let them fly,"" says commanding officer Tanvir Piracha. Some of Pakistan's female pilots wear hijabs. Others prefer to go without the Muslim headdress. Most say changing the misconception of Muslim women is just as important as serving their country. ""Islam gives equal opportunity to females. Whatever we want to do we can,"" says pilot Nadia Gul. ""To tell you the truth I've been given equal opportunity or I suppose more than men have been given,"" says Air Force cadet Sharista Beg. Air Force officials say fighter pilots are playing a vital role in the fight against the Taliban. They're training in counterinsurgency, collecting aerial intelligence and targeting militant strongholds in the treacherous mountains of Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. Ambreen Gul says her goal now is to fly in combat. ""I would give my life for my country,"" she says. But women rarely fly in combat anywhere in the world and it's never been done in Pakistan. It's another barrier Gul plans to break.","Ambreen Gul is one of seven women trained to fly F-7 supersonic fighter jet .

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button has drawn a line under his row with McLaren teammate Sergio Perez, saying it is time to ""move forward."" Their battle was one of the main talking points of Sunday's Bahrain Grand Prix, which ended in a runaway victory for triple world champion Sebastian Vettel. Much of the race interest centered on the fight for minor placings, as Perez shunted through the field to take sixth -- his best position since joining from Sauber after last season. Button, the 2009 world champion, was back in 10th -- and complained bitterly after the race about Perez's aggressive tactics, with his car being hit by the Mexican's on more than one occasion. ""I've raced with many team-mates over the years, and I had quite an aggressive teammate in Lewis (Hamilton),"" Button said. ""But I'm not used to driving along a straight and having a teammate coming alongside and banging wheels at 300 kilometers an hour. That is dangerous. ""I've had some tough fights in F1, but not quite as dirty as that, so he has to calm down otherwise something serious will happen soon."" Perez admitted in the post-race conference it had been ""a bit too risky."" ""Banging wheels was a bit too much,"" the 23-year-old said. ""But he was as aggressive as I was as I went off the track a few times."" Perez had been told by team principal Martin Whitmarsh to be more aggressive after just one top-10 placing in his first three races -- finishing ninth in Malaysia. Button took his boss to task about that during a television interview in the paddock at Sakhir, but on Monday softened his stance. ""Important chat yesterday with @SChecoPerez 2 clear the air,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""As a team we will move forward and live 2 fight another day ;) roll on Barcelona."" Whitmarsh hailed the ""maturity"" of the 33-year-old, and admitted he had resisted calls to stop the duo competing against each other. ""I had a lot of noise in my ear, people saying 'Stop this, stop this, it's hurting us,' suggesting I stop them racing,"" he told the UK Press Association. ""I didn't, and I know it could have gone horribly wrong. On balance it was the right thing -- in the long term -- for both drivers to know they are racing each other and are competitive. ""The great thing about Jenson is he's a grown-up, he'll get over it, and they'll have a great relationship. ""He has a balanced, mature approach. He knows his teammate has been under the hammer, is young, has had a bit of pressure, has something to learn and a point to prove."" Whitmarsh's approach is in stark contrast to that of other teams on the grid, with both Red Bull and Mercedes having issued driver orders during the season's second race in Malaysia. Vettel ignored instructions and overtook teammate Mark Webber before claiming victory, but Mercedes' Nico Rosberg obeyed when told to stay behind Lewis Hamilton despite seemingly being quicker.","Jenson Button says he has ""cleared the air"" with McLaren teammate Sergio Perez .

"(CNN) -- U.S. prosecutors have accused the head of Guinea-Bissau's military of plotting to team up with Colombian rebels as part of a ""narco-terrorist"" operation. Antonio Indjai, the head of the West African nation's armed forces, conspired to sell surface-to-air missiles and store and transport cocaine for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla group, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement Thursday. Indjai ""conspired to use his power and authority to be a middleman and his country to be a way-station for people he believed to be terrorists and narco-traffickers so they could store, and ultimately transport, narcotics to the United States, and procure surface-to-air missiles and other military-grade hardware to be used against United States troops,"" Bharara said. ""As with so many allegedly corrupt officials, he sold himself and use of his country for a price."" He faces conspiracy charges for alleged plans to engage in narco-terrorsim, distribute cocaine and transfer anti-aircraft missiles. Authorities said the charges stem from a sting by confidential sources of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The West African nation's government did not immediately comment Thursday. The charges against Indjai come nearly two weeks after the former head of the country's navy appeared in a New York court, accused of being a drug kingpin involved in smuggling cocaine from Latin American paramilitaries into the United States. Rear Adm. Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto, once head of Guinea-Bissau's navy, was seized on a boat on the Atlantic Ocean by officials from the U.S. DEA. Four other Guinea-Bissau citizens were also detained and extradited to the United States. Guinea-Bissau, a small coastal nation of about 1.6 million people sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, has been wracked by successive coups and attempted coups since it gained independence from Portugal in 1974. The current transitional government took over after the last military-backed coup in April 2012. A U.S. Justice Department report in 2011 highlighted West Africa's growing role in the international drug trade and put Guinea-Bissau at the center of that illegal activity. ""Due to its lack of law enforcement capabilities, its susceptibility to corruption, its porous borders, and its strategic location, Guinea-Bissau remains a significant hub of narcotics trafficking on the verge of developing into a narco-state,"" the report said. ""While many officials within the Government of Guinea-Bissau recognize the extent of the drug problem and express a willingness to address it, a crippling lack of resources and capacity remains a hindrance to real progress in combating drug trafficking."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","Antonio Indjai faces conspiracy charges for an alleged plot with Colombian rebels .

"London (CNN) -- ""Everything I do is centered around women,"" says Pinky Lilani. As founder of the Women of the Future Awards, the Asian Women of Achievement Awards and the Global Empowerment Award, it's fair to assume this is no exaggeration. ""Plenty of women are confident and talented but they still need champions; they need mentors,"" she explains. And, since emigrating from India to the UK 34 years ago, Lilani has become just that -- earning herself an OBE from Queen Elizabeth II for services to women along the way. To mark this year's International Women's Day we asked her which extraordinary women she believes are under-acknowledged for their achievements. From an empress to a humble florist, in her own words Lilani presents her five unsung heroines . Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah (1915-2000), politician, diplomat and author . Shaista Ikramullah was a woman before her time. Her autobiography ""From Purdah to Parliament"" is a mesmerizing tale of a fearless Muslim woman who fought her way from veiled to valiant. Ikramullah grew up in a society where women were not encouraged to have an education, but she ignored this culture and went on to become the first Muslim woman to receive a PhD from the University of London. She was one of very few Muslim women to take part in the Pakistan movement and witness first hand the fall of the British empire. She became a member of Pakistan's parliament, an ambassador to Morocco and her country's delegate to the United Nations. This would have been a colossal feat for any woman at that time, let alone a Pakistani. She also found time to be a mother of four and was a role model to millions. Her book ""Behind the Veil: Ceremonies, Customs and Colour"" is a collection of essays on Muslim society from a woman's perspective. It was published in 1953 but is still a crucial work for a country where, in my opinion, women are not given as much opportunity to progress as they are across the border in India. Constance Spry (1886 -1960), educator, florist and author . My mother used to enter flower arranging competitions in Calcutta. She learnt everything she knew from Constance Spry. In fact, the only book I brought with me from India was my mother's ""Constance Spry Book of Flower Arranging"". Constance had many strings to her bow -- this is also the woman who invented coronation chicken! She created the dish when catering for foreign delegates at the coronation of Elizabeth II. The role of women was at the core of what she did. During both the World Wars she gave frequent lectures, teaching women about first aid, cookery, dressmaking and how to grow your own vegetables in times of austerity -- all priceless tools for empowerment. But for me her flower arrangements are still her greatest achievement. After all, a beautified life is one full of spirit. Anna Jarvis (1864-1948), founder of Mother's Day . As a daughter and a mother to two sons, I really believe in the commemoration of motherhood. A lot of people forget to thank their mother, but thanks to an American woman called Anna Jarvis, who successfully campaigned to make Mother's Day a national holiday nearly 100 years ago, we have this day to remind us. Sadly, before her death, Jarvis became disenchanted by the commercialization of her own accomplishment. She is recorded as saying that ""a printed card means nothing except that you are too lazy to write to the woman who has done more for you than anyone in the world."" It's true that Mother's Day has become far too commercial. We shouldn't need a calendar date to acknowledge our mothers, but if it acts as a reminder of how pivotal mothers are then so be it. Empress Dowager Cixi (1835-1908), empress of China . She may have been barbaric, some even say a despot, but I still see her as a heroine. Cixi was an indigenous girl, an outsider who went from lowly concubine to China's leader for 47 years. It's a rags to riches tale like no other. In a time when a childless Chinese woman was expected to kill herself as a mark of respect, she went on to be the most powerful female ruler China has ever had. Yes, she may have resorted to Machiavellian tactics to get there but she managed to command a respect that no woman in China had ever achieved before. Her resolve, resilience and tenacity should act as inspiration to any woman fighting against the odds. Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan (1906 - 2000), philanthropist and fourth wife of Aga Khan III . I grew up in an Ismaili community so we followed the Aga Khan. I always remember people talking about his French wife, Begum Om Habibeh (originally Yvette Blanche), with great compassion. They came to my parent's wedding in Calcutta -- she was wearing a sari and a mink. I had never seen anyone wear a mink before. It is extraordinary that a glamorous European woman managed to integrate so well into Ismaili society-- she had such an empathy with the community. She was an unlikely national treasure but we loved her like Britain loves Kate Middleton -- she was always out in the community helping the poor and elderly and would relentlessly encourage education for women. Her legacy remains in the Om Habibeh Foundation, whose programs have contributed to health, education and inclusion in some of the poorest areas of Egypt, where her and the Aga Khan are buried.

"(CNN)  -- The new seven wonders of the world were named Saturday following an online vote that generated server-crushing traffic in its final hours. The Great Wall of China was among the top vote-getters of the ""New 7 Wonders of the World"" project. The final tally produced this list of the world's top human-built wonders: . • The Great Wall of China . • Petra in Jordan . • Brazil's statue of Christ the Redeemer . • Peru's Machu Picchu . • Mexico's Chichen Itza pyramid . • The Colosseum in Rome . • India's Taj Mahal .

""We have traffic that is simply off the scale,"" Tia Vering, spokeswoman for the ""New 7 Wonders of the World"" campaign, told CNN.com. ""Things are just going ballistic."" The new wonders were announced at a star-studded event Saturday in Lisbon, Portugal, that featured performances by Jennifer Lopez and Chaka Khan. The event was hosted by Oscar winners Hilary Swank and Ben Kingsley as well as Bollywood star Bipasha Basu. Send CNN.com photos and video of your favorite ""wonder"" The top contenders for the seven wonders were last made public in early June. The oldest candidate was Britain's Stonehenge; the newest was Australia's Sydney Opera House. The U.S. Statue of Liberty also was among the choices. Voting nearly doubled after the June results, when organizers said about 50 million votes had been cast. A single user can cast multiple votes. To be considered for the competition, all structures had to be built or discovered before 2000. All are among top tourist attractions around the world. Of the seven ancient wonders of the world, only one remains standing today, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Some nations have enthusiastically endorsed the new wonders campaign. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Jordan's Queen Rania actively promoted their countries' hopefuls. But the new wonders campaign hasn't been universally recognized. The United Nations' cultural organization, UNESCO, issued a statement saying it has ""no link whatsoever"" to the vote. Egypt's top antiquities expert also objected to the list. He said Egypt's pyramids are a ""symbol of the genius of the ancient people"" -- and are above any sort of online poll. As a result, the organizers struck up a compromise. The pyramids have been assured honorary status, in addition to the new seven wonders. The new wonders project was the brainchild of Swiss businessman Bernard Weber. He said he wanted to invite the people of the world to take part in selecting the world's greatest wonders. ""So that everybody can decide what the new seven wonders should be and not some government, not some individuals, not some institutions,"" he said. Vering said she believes the vote has accomplished that goal.

"(CNN) -- The judge in James Holmes' murder trial on Tuesday accepted his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. The suspect in last summer's shooting spree that killed 12 people and wounded dozens at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater will be taken to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo for evaluation. He's expected to be returned to the Arapahoe County Jail on August 2. Judge Carlos Samour Jr. has told attorneys he expects the trial to take place in 2014. The burden is on the prosecution to prove that Holmes was sane at the time of the shootings. Attorneys will use the results of the mental evaluation as evidence at the trial. Samour's ruling Tuesday came about a month after Holmes' attorneys asked to change his plea from a standard not guilty. The original not-guilty plea was entered by a judge on Holmes' behalf in March, over his objection, his defense team said. The defendant offered to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life behind bars if authorities would spare his life, but prosecutors in Arapahoe County announced in April they would seek the death penalty. The defense then decided to make an insanity plea. Asked by the judge Tuesday whether he had any questions about the plea, Holmes replied in a clear voice, ""No."" Samour also ruled Tuesday that a package Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist before the shooting can be processed as evidence. He sent Dr. Lynne Fenton $400 in burned $20 bills, a sticky note with an infinity sign, and a spiral notebook containing a placard. Written on it: ""James Holmes, Of Life,"" according to court documents. The defense had previously argued that the contents of the package is covered by doctor-patient confidentiality. But with an insanity plea, that confidentiality no longer applies. Before the shooting, Fenton, who works at the University of Colorado's medical campus, warned campus police that Holmes was dangerous.

"PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- Police on Thursday released a video showing officers arresting a 45-year-old New York woman at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport just before she died while handcuffed in a holding cell. Video shows Carol Ann Gotbaum being arrested at a Phoenix airport shortly before she died while in custody. Authorities also gave a more complete account of Carol Ann Gotbaum's arrest, detention and death September 28. Police have said she apparently strangled herself as she tried to maneuver her way out of handcuffs that were secured behind her back. According to the police report, Gotbaum's husband, Noah, called the airport several times that night, trying to reach his wife or the airport police, telling them they didn't know the circumstances involving his wife, whom he described as suicidal. Noah Gotbaum claimed his wife's body in Phoenix Thursday after an autopsy. The body was set to be returned to New York on Thursday night, according to Michael Manning, a Phoenix attorney whom Gotbaum's family has retained. Police said in a Wednesday statement they did attempt to calm an irate Gotbaum before arresting her. And they said they had no idea of her ""personal issues,"" including that she was on her way to check into an alcohol treatment center.  Watch Gotbaum appear to yell as officers handcuff her at the airport » . Police spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill told reporters Thursday there were indications that alcohol may have played a role in the incident, although toxicology tests administered during the autopsy would determine that. Results of such tests typically take several weeks. Gotbaum, who was flying through Phoenix on her way to Tucson, became angry when she was denied access to her flight and argued with a gate attendant, police said. According to the police statement, Gotbaum ""became agitated and loud"" and threw her hand-held PDA, which shattered after narrowly missing a person. She then left the gate area, but the gate attendant summoned police. The video showed Gotbaum after she apparently had just left the gate area. She was by herself, standing in the middle of a concourse, doubled over, and she seemed to be screaming. Although the video contained no audio, witnesses -- including a federal police officer -- said Gotbaum was ""screaming at the top of her lungs, 'I'm not a terrorist, I'm not a terrorist,' "" according to Sgt. Mike Polombo, who is investigating the incident. In the video, a Transportation Security Administration officer approached and spoke with Gotbaum, followed by three police officers. While speaking with them, Gotbaum waved her arms. She backed away from an officer who reached for her, and she became combative before dropping to the ground. As officers were on the ground with Gotbaum attempting to handcuff her, she continued to scream profanities, Polombo said. The video showed police eventually bringing Gotbaum to her feet and walking with her, although she continued to pull away. She can be seen locking her legs, forcing the officers to drag her. Officers did not need to use pepper spray or a Taser device on Gotbaum, Hill said. ""She did not bite or kick or hit any of the officers. She was just resisting [arrest]."" Gotbaum was placed in a holding room at the airport and searched by a female officer but ""continued to be uncooperative,"" the police statement said. According to the 108-page police report on the incident, also released Thursday, Gotbaum told authorities she was a ""depressed, pathetic housewife."" ""In the holding room, there is a bench with an 'eyehook' on it. The officers took a 'shackle,' which is described as a metal chain, approximately 16 inches long, with a large 'handcuff' on each side. The total length of the chain with handcuffs is approximately 24 inches,"" the statement said. ""One of the handcuffs on the 'shackle' was attached to the 'eyehook' on the bench. The other handcuff of the shackle was attached to the chain of the handcuffs that were already on Ms. Gotbaum's hands. ""So Ms. Gotbaum was handcuffed with her hands behind her back, and additionally those handcuffs were attached to a shackle that kept her attached to the bench."" Gotbaum was not deemed a threat to herself or others, the police statement said. If she had been, she would have been monitored by an officer. Phoenix police policy is that prisoners can be left alone in holding rooms as long as they are checked every 15 minutes. Hill told reporters Thursday that Gotbaum was left alone for six or eight minutes. Police previously had said it was 15 or 20 minutes. After officers left, she continued to scream, the police statement said. However, police checked on her when she fell silent and found her unconscious. Gotbaum was found sitting on the floor, with her head on the bench and the handcuffs under her chin, the police report said. ""Initial information ... indicated that Ms. Gotbaum had somehow worked the handcuffs to the front of her body, probably from under her legs, and had pulled the chain from the shackle across her neck area,"" the statement said. Officers used CPR, a defibrillator and other measures in attempts to save her life. A police officer said in the police report that Gotbaum vomited while CPR was being performed on her and that when she did, he could smell alcohol. Gotbaum was pronounced dead by firefighters who arrived shortly afterward. ""Officers had no information ... that Ms. Gotbaum had traveled unescorted"" from New York City to Phoenix ""in order to seek treatment for a substance abuse issue,"" the statement said. ""The officers had no knowledge of any of Ms. Gotbaum's personal issues. They had not been apprised of any calls from the family to the airport seeking to locate Ms. Gotbaum."" According to the police report, Noah Gotbaum called the airport communications division several times trying to reach the airport police or his wife, whom he described as suicidal. He told an operator that his wife got bumped off a flight, according to a transcript, and ""the last thing I heard was she was screaming into the telephone."" ""This is a medical emergency,"" Noah Gotbaum said in another call. ""They're not dealing with some lout who's just drank too much on an airplane. That's not what's going on here."" Hill said Thursday that police are aware of no policy violations, but he said the incident remains under investigation, as any in-custody death would be. Manning has previously said Gotbaum had an ""emotional reaction"" after she was not allowed to board her flight. He said the family has not decided whether to take legal action against police. It's unclear why Gotbaum was not allowed to board the plane. About 200,000 people travel through Sky Harbor Airport daily, Hill said, and police receive three to five calls a day regarding irate passengers. However, he said, so far this year only 265 people have been arrested, 14 of them for disorderly conduct. The officers involved in the incident with Gotbaum ""are still very upset about what happened,"" Hill said. ""They did everything they could to save Ms. Gotbaum."" Gotbaum, the mother of three young children, lived in New York. She was the daughter-in-law of longtime New York City public advocate Betsy Gotbaum, who called her ""a wonderful, wonderful person.""

"(CNN) -- There's a lot that will happen in 2013 with respect to health care, but the truth of the matter is that most of it will be in preparation for 2014. That's the year the Affordable Care Act really kicks into effect. Here are my guesses for what to watch in 2013: . 1. The Medicaid expansion . Much of this year's election was fought over whether Medicaid should be cut. Now the big decision is how much Medicaid will be expanded. About half of the uninsured who hope for coverage under the Affordable Care Act will do so under Medicaid, an estimated 16 million to 17 million people. But June's Supreme Court ruling made the expansion optional, and states get to decide if they will participate. At last count, 17 states have said yes, and nine have said no. The rest will need to commit in 2013. My guess is that most will. The Obama administration has decided to play hardball, and leaving that money on the table will be met with screams by the uninsured and providers alike. 2. Medicaid provider payments . These are going up. Way up. Part of the Affordable Care Act makes Medicaid payments to physicians look more like Medicare payments. There is such a difference that many physicians will see fees for primary care services go up by 73%. Physicians will be thrilled. Those who think Medicaid costs too much already will not. 3. The health insurance exchanges . In 2014, the other half of the uninsured will need to go to the health insurance exchanges to get their insurance. These are tightly regulated marketplaces where individuals will be able to get community-rated insurance and can't be turned down even if they have chronic conditions. People who make between 133% and 400% of the federal poverty line will get subsidies in the form of tax credits to help defer the cost. But many states are choosing not to form local exchanges, leaving it to the federal government. For those states that opt for exchanges, there's a ton of work to do next year to get them ready to go. The federal government will be responsible for all the states that are opting out, and it has even more work to do. Expect a lot of news on their development. October 1, 2013, is the date they're all supposed to go live. 4. Medicare taxes . Taxes are going up. Right now, employees pay a tax of 1.45% for Medicare (employers pay an equal amount). Starting next year, for couples making more than $250,000 that tax will go up by 0.9% on income above the threshold. Additionally, investment income will also be taxed at 3.8% for people above the threshold. This is the first time that unearned income will be subject to a Medicare tax. 5. Medicare reform . This got a lot of attention in the election, and in the first few rounds of fiscal cliff negotiations. Talk of raising the eligibility age is dead for now, and discussions of turning Medicare into a voucher program are in the dustbin of history as well. I don't think that any huge changes will happen on this front, short of those already put in place by the Affordable Care Act and quietly re-embraced by Republicans post-election. The Obama administration has proposed some new cuts, but almost none of those will affect 2013. 6. Insurance transparency . A small but important benefit of the Affordable Care Act will start in 2013. From now on, insurance companies are mandated to describe all plans in easy-to-understand English in a standardized format. Here's a sample (PDF). This will make things easier for many people, although insurance policies will still be hard to understand. 7. Health care spending . Although many believe that health care costs will rise more slowly in 2013, at about 3.8%, we will still be spending $2.9 trillion. That's a lot of money. As we continue to fight over the budget deficit and the debt, expect the costs of health care to continue getting a lot of attention. That should account for most of the excitement next year. Whether I'm right or wrong, we'll be covering it here on CNN.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron E. Carroll.","Aaron Carroll: Next year will be in preparation for 2014 when Affordable Care Act kicks in .

"(CNN) -- A young woman claims she was in a car with her fiancé when three police officers came by. She says two of them raped her while the third kept guard and later attempted to extort money from her fiancé. All parties involved were arrested -- the woman, her fiancé, and the three police officers. The 27-year-old woman was charged with public indecency. What has shocked the public about the incident is not only the preposterousness of the young lady's arrest, but the subsequent accusation by the judges that has effectively transformed a victim into an offender. News: Police say woman, husband were in ""immoral position"" International human rights organizations have historically held that rape by security forces amounts to torture. In Tunisia, rape is a serious crime that is severely punished. This single incident brings to the forefront how such transgressions are allowed to take place, and reveals serious flaws in the Tunisian criminal justice system and in Tunisian law as a whole. The incident also highlights the current government's lack of competence in addressing the issues that affect Tunisians most directly. A Ministry of Human Rights spokesman told CNN: ""These kind of crimes and violations committed by the police rarely happen and do not represent the security system. The judicial system did its role and the three accused policemen are arrested."" Throughout Ben Ali's era, police officers have had free reign in the country. They pillaged, raped, and repressed citizens all over the nation. They were, after all, the former dictator's trusted safe keepers. Today's police force constitutes the very same apparatus that kept the former president in power. The Ministry of Interior has not made a significant effort (if any at all) to reform the ministry -- which would include retraining the police, doing away with repressive security measures and, most importantly, removing the figures that have long represented oppression from the ministry's leadership roles. In fact, as of today, all that has been accomplished is the formation of a ""task force"" that aims to discuss possibilities of reform. The task force only held its first meeting on September 27 -- months after the current minister of the interior took office. On the legislative front, there have been no changes in citizen protection laws since the National Constituent Assembly was voted in. One of the assembly's latest encounters with women's rights dealt with a clause drafted by the constitutional Committee on Rights and Liberties. The clause relegated women to a ""complementary"" status with men, and would have been included in the final constitution had it not been struck down by the central coordination committee. It is important to remember that women's rights in Tunisia today do not depend on the actions of a few, and that while progress is slow, not all is lost. Women in Tunisia have long enjoyed a Personal Status Code that is advanced when compared to neighboring countries. There is a serious risk, however, that any progress brought forth by the code could be reversed. Whereas civil society has been vigilant in defending this young woman's rights and raising awareness about violence against women, the government has yet to act in a constructive manner. Many official figures, particularly those hailing from the ruling Islamist party Ennahda, have been defending the judiciary's decisions. For example, Amer Laarayedh, the head of Ennahda's political bureau and a member of the Constituent Assembly, insists that the protests taking place in support of the victim are attempts by the opposition to bring down the government. The Ministry of Justice denies that the victim was even accused. The Ministry of Interior retains that the couple was found in an ""immoral position"" when the police first stopped the car. The courts and Tunisian government had a historic opportunity to define Tunisian society and rebuke state impunity. But instead of standing up against the heinous crime of rape and affirming the need to respect human dignity, the Tunisian judiciary and Ministry of Interior have put human rights to shame. Following Tuesday's hearing, the victim's lawyers have expressed optimism that the charges brought forth against her would be dropped. The incident, however, calls for a serious review of Tunisian law -- including those codifying public morality or criminalizing indecency. * CNN put Hassine's points to the Tunisian government. In relation to the public indecency charge against the 27-year-old woman, a Ministry of Human Rights spokesman said: ""Amnesty (International) said that the Tunisian authorities must drop the indecency charges but how can the government interfere in the judicial system? In all democracies, the judicial system is independent and makes its own decisions. It is up to the judge to decide whether she is guilty or not. In my personal opinion, I hope the charges will be dropped however, I should not let my opinion influence the decision of the judge.""

"Madrid (CNN) -- A 73-year-old Spanish man was gored in the right leg on the first day of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona and a 21-year-old Japanese runner was dragged by a bull, authorities said. Those were two of six runners who were rushed to the hospital after the frenetic race down the narrow cobblestone streets of the old Spanish town. One of the others taken to the hospital was a 26-year-old Australian who suffered a knee injury. The Red Cross also treated 72 others for minor injuries at the scene, authorities said. The runner from Ikeda, Japan -- whose gender was not immediately released -- was dragged by what appeared to be a bull's horn, hooked through clothing, on the pavement downhill toward the bullring, images from Spanish state television showed. The runner suffered back injuries. There have been 15 deaths since record-keeping began in 1924 and thousands of injuries in the tradition that dates back 400 years. Author Ernest Hemingway wrote about it in his 1920s novel, ""The Sun Also Rises,"" also published under the title, ""Fiesta,"" and crowds have poured in from around the globe ever since. The town has since erected a statue to Hemingway outside the bullring. The running starts at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) for eight consecutive days, through July 14, and lasts just a few minutes, from the corrals through the hard pavement of old town streets to the bullring, where the bulls face certain death against matadors later in the day. What happened last year . The weekends of the fiesta traditionally see the largest crowds, when Pamplona's population of 200,000 can triple. The race was packed on Saturday, and the run lasted just two minutes and 53 seconds to cover the 825-meter (902 yard) course. The six fighting bulls from the Dolores Aguirre Ybarra ranch, each weighing about a half ton, stayed together for the first part of the course. At one point four of them charged ahead, as runners behind tried to dodge the two remaining bulls trying to catch up. The Spanish man was the only one gored on Saturday. Besides the Japanese and the Australian, the other three sent to hospital were Spaniards, aged 19 to 49, who suffered shoulder, rib or wrist injuries, authorities said. The bulls were accompanied, as usual, by a pack of six tame steers to help guide them to the bullring. The running of the bulls is the marquee event of the week-long fiesta, named for Pamplona's patron saint, San Fermin. It includes non-stop activities, including concerts, parades and amusement park rides, that aim to appeal to all ages. The event is huge boon to the local economy.

"(CNN) -- After reaching a record high of 14,253.77 on Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose an additional 0.3% on Wednesday to reach a new record high of 14,296.39. First off, the latest Dow number is not really a record. If we adjust it for inflation, the Dow still has a way to go. But is the rising number a sign that the economy, which has been improving sluggishly, is about to improve dramatically? Probably not. For example, the previous peak in the Dow in 2007 was just before the onset of the Great Recession, and remember what happened then? Right, the economy crashed. People got scared. Hell broke loose. No -- not really, but there was plenty of fear going around. Flash to present day. Some people are surprised that the stock market is doing so well, particularly in light of such high levels of unemployment. But maybe we should welcome the optimism since it can push along the economy. The steady rise of the Dow since early 2009 has been driven mainly by two factors: the slow improvement in economic conditions and optimism since the recession ended, and the Federal Reserve's attempt to stimulate the economy using quantitative easing policies. Under the policies, the Federal Reserve has purchased large volumes of financial assets, and the increase in demand for these assets from the Fed has lowered long-term interest rates and put upward pressure on the prices of stocks and bonds. As asset prices increase, people feel wealthier and more secure because of increased value of retirement funds, education savings, and so on, and the increase in wealth and security makes it more likely that consumers will spend money on goods and services. This boosts GDP and employment, and the improved outlook for the economy can increase stock prices even further. A case in point -- my parents. They are retired and did a lot of traveling. But when the 2007 recession hit and wiped out their retirement savings and equity in their home, they stopped traveling and instead began trying to rebuild what had been lost. They hunkered down, waiting for the storm to pass so to speak. Gradually, they started to spend a bit more as stock prices and the economy improved, but they are not yet back to where they were before the recession. My parents are more optimistic now, and that spurs them to spend more, which helps businesses and the economy. There are many Americans who went through similar experiences. If we add all of them together, we can see why things seem better than before. More people feel like we're on the right track. The high stock market prices reflect this sentiment. But the real question remains: What does the Dow tells us about the future of the economy? There is some evidence that the stock market can predict economic prospects, but the correlation is unreliable. The improvement in the Dow is a good sign, but let's not treat it as reading the tea leaves. Just as no one can predict the stock market, no one can really predict the economy, even if the Dow is doing great. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Thoma.","Mark Thoma: The latest Dow number is not really a record when adjusted for inflation .
Thoma: It's good that the stock market is doing well, but it's not a reliable predictor of economy .
He says Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing has contributed to Dow's rise .

"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- At first glance, it looks like a standard road sign to Mecca, the Saudi Arabian pilgrimage site for millions of Muslims every year. But look again at this piece of graffiti art and you see that the Ka'ba, the cube-shaped building at the spiritual heart of Mecca shown on its genuine road signs, has been replaced by a cluster of high rise buildings. It is the work of Sarah Mohanna Al Abdali, a 22-year-old graphic design graduate, and she sprayed it on walls around her home city of Jeddah as a comment on overdevelopment in Mecca, the holiest Muslim city. It is a bold statement to make in the socially conservative kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the method -- spray painting walls in public places -- even more so. ""At first I was worried about how the conservatives would react and whether I would get any bad comments, but no-one has said anything,"" said Al Abdali, who works as a university teaching assistant. ""Saudi is going through a lot of change and street art is the perfect medium to experiment in. Al Abdali began experimenting with graffiti about six months ago and is one of a small but growing number of street artists in the kingdom. A blog, Saudi Street Art, displays some of their work. ""It's something very new here,"" she said. ""I started with very random shapes but I wanted to develop more techniques that people could relate to. ""You don't see a lot of street art here, there's just vandalism. I'm excited to be doing something new. ""I like street art because it's there for the people. You don't need to overdo your ideas, it's a simple way of expressing yourself. And it's free, which you don't see in many forms of art."" Al Abdali sprayed her Mecca sign on walls around the historic area of Jeddah where it would be seen by as many passing people as possible. ""I didn't want it to be a beautiful artwork, I wanted to create debate,"" she said. She was pleased with the response it received. ""People took photos and shared them on Facebook and Twitter,"" she said. ""Some people related to it because it was straight to the point; other people didn't care. It's interesting to hear the different views every time someone comes up and asks me if I did it."" Al Abdali is also gaining recognition. She was one of four artists chosen to exhibit at an off shoot of the Edge of Arabia show, the first major contemporary art exhibition in Saudi Arabia, according to its organizers. In a country where a lot of culture is controlled by the government, Al Abdali is one of growing number of young rebels finding their own way of pushing boundaries. Stand-up comedy is another art form gaining popularity just out of government reach. There are no comedy clubs and live shows are rare, but comedians are gaining a following through their own shows on YouTube. Omar Hussein hosts a satirical news show called ""On The Fly."" It goes out monthly on YouTube and episodes are watched online by hundreds of thousands of people. ""If we create our own entertainment, we preserve our culture,"" Hussein said. ""We are no longer reliant on culture that comes from abroad. ""We reflect something that's happening in our community in a comical manner and it's up to you to decide what's right and wrong."" While pushing gently at social boundaries -- such as women's rights -- the comedians say they self-censor, avoiding taboo topics like religion and the monarchy. Saudi Arabia is ruled by the Al Saud family, much of whose power to rule comes from its association with the Wahhabi religious establishment. Wahabism is an austere form of Islam that has been a major social and political force in the kingdom. ""If you self-censor, it's the best way to do this media that's accepted by our society, because our society, they want to be entertained but they don't want you to cross boundaries or taboos,"" said Hussein. ""We are not breaking anything. We are speaking, that's it,"" said fellow comedian Bader Saleh. ""There's stuff you can say without crossing any red lines."" Journalist and satirist Mohammad Bazaid, who launched his own satirical news show two years ago, says he wants to create debate you can't see elsewhere. ""The problem with traditional media is they tell you want to think about a certain issue,"" he said. ""I don't want to drag that with me into new media. I want people to look at a news headline and think twice about what it means."" But he too is wary. People have been arrested for work they post on social media. ""There's always a margin of concern,"" Bazaid added. ""We are always afraid, not of doing something wrong, but being understood in the wrong way."" One Saudi blogger, who asked not to be named, said young people find subtle ways around government control. ""A lot of cultural events are organized by the government, and the government puts a lot of restrictions on what can be done,"" he said. ""For culture to thrive, you need people who will push boundaries and that doesn't happen in a government-controlled environment."" He said that young people can go to gigs or live comedy, provided organizers promote them discreetly and avoid official attention. ""Often it's a gray area, where it's not quite legal but not totally secret. Invitations may go out on Facebook and instructions for how to buy tickets or where to go will be kept private until the day before.""","Artist Sarah Mohanna Al Abdali is experimenting with new art-form of graffiti in conservative Saudi Arabia .

"(CNN) -- This month, Inside the Middle East travels to Morocco, a North African kingdom located on the western edge of the Arab world. Host Leone Lakhani visits the bustling commercial hub of Casablanca, which for many recalls the film classic starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. But modern-day Casablanca, like the rest of Morocco, is much different than the movies. In a nation where nearly half of those between the ages of 15 and 29 are either unemployed or out of school, frustration at the lack of opportunities is mounting. Some young Moroccans took to the streets over the past year to protest these realities while others took to the recording studio to speak out - both of which come with risk. One Moroccan rapper, El Haqed, was imprisoned earlier this year because of his lyrics. The program meets several young rappers - from Casablanca to Tangiers - to hear some of the sounds of Morocco's urban rage. The program also journeys to the southern stretches of Morocco's Atlantic coastline, to the traditional Berber city of Agadir. Berbers were the first inhabitants of North Africa, and many still follow older customs and practice ancestral crafts. One of these - a beauty oil made from Argan tree seeds - is quickly becoming all the rage among celebrities and high-end shoppers in the West. Lakhani sat down with one Moroccan who is helping to produce the oil - and jobs for women in the country. And what trip to Morocco would be complete without tasting the nation's world-famous cuisine? The team heads north to Fes, Morocco's culinary capital, to receive cooking lessons from Lahcen Beqqi, a top chef who has figured out how to blend traditional cooking with modern techniques.

"(CNN) -- David Beckham was sent off just six minutes after coming onto the pitch as three further dismissals and a mass brawl overshadowed Paris Saint-Germain's 1-0 win over Evian. The former England captain, who joined PSG in January on a five-month deal, was introduced as an 83rd-minute substitute for PSG before being given his marching orders for a lunging challenge on Youssef Adnane. PSG, who are close to securing a first French Ligue 1 title in 19 years following the win, saw Italian midfielder Marco Verratti pick up a second yellow card two minutes before Beckham was brought on. Tempers flared on and off the pitch, with PSG assistant coach Claude Makelele sent to the stands for remonstrating with officials. PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu and Evian's Saber Khelifa were given red cards following a mass brawl which broke out on the final whistle. The sending off could be Beckham's last act in a PSG shirt, with the 37-year-old's contract set to expire at the end of the current season. ""The referee lacked lucidity,"" PSG sporting director Leonardo told French newspaper Le Parisien. ""He made mistakes. The red card shown to Beckham, for example, was really unfair. ""It was always a very tense match. Nobody wanted to lose -- especially not Evian, who are struggling to stay up,"" added Leonardo, referring to Evian's place in the Ligue 1 table, with the club level of points with third from bottom Sochaux. ""I also believe that our team is really tired at the end of the season."" The visitors' winning goal came in the 50th minute from Argentine Javier Pastore and allows PSG to wrap up the title on Sunday if they record a better result against Valenciennes than second-placed Marseille manage in Saturday's match with Bastia. Sunday's red card wasn't the first Beckham has received in France. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United star was infamously dismissed for kicking out at Argentina's Diego Simeone while playing for England at the 1998 World Cup. Beckham was vilified by fans following the red card, with many blaming the midfielder for England's exit from the tournament. Glenn Hoddle's team lost the second round match in Saint Etienne on penalties following a 2-2 draw.","David Beckham sent off as Paris Saint-Germain beat Evian 1-0 .

"Ramallah, West Bank (CNN) -- Mingling with customers in the bar he opened two years ago, Yazan Khalili is enjoying the booming consumer economy in his home city of Ramallah, in the West Bank. But despite the success of his bar, Beit Aneesah, Khalili worries that the boom is unsustainable and his customers could soon have no money to spend. ""The economy itself is based on a bubble and you never know when this bubble will burst,"" said Khalili. ""It's like living on the hand of a genie. Things might just disappear."" The city has boomed over the past five years, with new restaurants, cafes and even luxury hotels. The West Bank's first five-star hotel, Movenpick Ramallah, a locally owned franchise of the Swiss chain, opened in 2010, aimed primarily at corporate clients. Like many, Khalili worries that the new age of consumerism is just too good to be true. ""Since banks give loans, anyone who wants to open a business becomes a possibility. In that sense, it's not hard to open it,"" he said. ""It's not hard to get permission to open a bar from the municipality. From the ministry of economy, from the bank to get a loan, it's not hard to do it, it was possible."" In this new economic world, Khalili sometimes longs for the old days. ""There were businesses, but they were more organic businesses that understood the conflict, that were able to survive the hardship of the occupation. ""That's based on more local products, consumption. Enough, depending on what you have,"" he added. The United Nations describes the Palestinian Territories as Occupied, but Israel disputes the use of the term. Israel controls the flow of goods into and out of the West Bank, it says, to maintain security and prevent terror attacks. Most of the money in the economy comes from the government -- The Palestinian Authority -- the largest employer in the West Bank, and most of its money in turn comes from donor aid. Many Palestinians are borrowing money to fund their basic needs and it is feared that, if donor aid dries up, many will be without work to fund their lifestyles. Naser Abdelkarim, professor of financial economics at Birzeit University, said: ""So the money comes from donors, yes. The largest borrower from the banking sector in (the Palestinian territories) is the government, and that's the danger. ""The large debt, public debt, we have around $5 billion in public debt that consists of around 70% of GDP, too huge for a government that's just born."" A World Bank report in July concluded that the Palestinian economy has grown at an average of 7.7% a year between 2007 and 2011, but that the growth was not sustainable. It said the growth had been driven by foreign aid and that the private sector would need to take over to strengthen the economy. John Nasir, lead author of the study, said in a press release: ""Economic sustainability cannot be based on foreign aid so it is critical for the Palestinian Authority to increase trade and spur private sector growth."" Something the government says it is trying to do, even as it grapples with cash shortfalls. The economic boom also allowed Shryine Ziadeh to follow her dream of opening the West Bank's first ballet school. ""When I was young and dancing ballet, I wished that I could do this and teach ballet,"" said Ziadeh, who opened her school last year with the help of her family. ""I started it because in Ramallah we don't have ballet schools, we don't have dance schools in general."" However, now the costs are mounting and Ziadeh is working two jobs to earn enough money to repay her parents. ""I'm young and I don't have enough salary to go to the bank every month,"" she said. ""I needed to rent the place, a good place, to have floors and mirrors and sound system. ""So my parents started to help me with it and now I'm working two jobs to repay."" Restaurant owner Sari Sarikini said he feels the impact of Israeli security restrictions, which mean he has to buy all his supplies from Israeli wholesalers. ""We have to build our country,"" he said. ""Any country that's been built from scratch will have a lot of debt. The question is where is this money being geared? Is it being geared at service providers? ""I don't like to see service business, I like to see more self-sustaining businesses."" If the economy stalls, people will not have money to spend in bars like Khalili's. ""Encouraging a kind of economy that you can spend, that there's money to spend, that you can consume, in the same time you're living on the edge of, not a catastrophe, of economical catastrophe,"" said Khalili. ""The minute the economy fails, the first thing people will stop doing is going to bars, restaurants. Places like this will not survive in a destroyed economy.""

"(CNN) -- After five years of trying, an international group of authors have achieved their aim of taking their Palestine Festival of Literature to Gaza for the first time. The annual traveling festival, known as PalFest, was set up in 2008 to bring book readings and cultural events to Palestinians who otherwise had little access to the outside world. Each year the literary festival has visited several cities in the West Bank, but has been unable to gain permission from Israel to visit Gaza. Israel imposed an economic blockade of Gaza when Hamas took over in 2007, which it says is needed to stop the transit of weaponry to be used by militants in attacks on Israel . This year, the group of 37 writers, artists and community organizers applied instead to enter Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, which re-opened last year. After a two-week wait, they were granted permission from the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to enter Gaza. Also on Inside the Middle East: Gaza music students find smart ways around travel ban . ""We didn't know if we would get in until the very last minute,"" said Jamal Mahjoub, a British Sudanese author who traveled with PalFest. ""We didn't know if we would manage until we actually crossed the border."" The group included Palestinians living in Jerusalem, West Bank and around the world, and prominent Arab authors including Egyptians Ahdaf Soueif and Khaled al Khamissi. None of them had been to Gaza before. They spent five days in Gaza from May 5-9, running workshops for university students, free public events and visiting refugee camps. Also on Inside the Middle East: Iraqi artist inspired by George W Bush shoe thrower . The 10-piece Egyptian band Eskenderella, which became well-known for playing in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution, played its first concert in Gaza to a packed hall. Omar Robert Hamilton, an independent filmmaker and founder of PalFest, said: ""Coming to Gaza was a necessity. We have tried every year but always failed before. Everything was incomplete until we came. ""It was vital to come here because of the fact that it's so divided and considered a separate entity, but at the same time totally connected to the West Bank."" In total around 2,000 Gazans attended the PalFest events. In one event, each author had 10 minutes to give the message they had always wanted to say to Gazans. Hamilton added: ""It's been pretty overwhelming. Everyone is so welcoming and pleased that we have managed to get there. ""They are very frustrated by the lack of access to the outside world. It's been a very emotional trip, but overwhelmingly positive. ""We began PalFest as an attempt to help connect Palestine with the rest of the world. Lack of access to art, culture and education is a form of restriction. ""We wanted to do what we could to support cultural life in Palestine, and to put on a festival that would be taken for granted anywhere else."" PalFest collected more than 1,500 books -- including copies of an anthology of extracts from works by festival participants -- which were distributed to cultural centers and university libraries. Also on Inside the Middle East: Unspoiled island sanctuary caught on camera . Mahjoub said: ""There was a real thirst for any books they could get their hands on: poetry, contemporary novels, books about history and politics. It's hard for people and institutions to get enough books and resources. ""They are hungry for any kind of cultural life, as there are no cinemas and few concerts."" He added: ""The most important thing has been meeting people and talking on a cultural level, to hear about their experiences and their isolation. ""We have driven up and down the country and have tried to get as broad a picture as possible of what it's like to live here. I didn't come to lecture people about my literature, but to find out what their experiences are."" PalFest organizers said that on Wednesday evening the closing event was shut down by the police, but added that police later apologized for the incident, saying it was an ""individual error."" PalFest is supported by organizations including the UK Arts Council and the British Council. Its patrons including Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe, British author Philip Pullman and British actor Emma Thompson. This year's festival also included one event in Ramallah in the West Bank and one in Cairo, Egypt, on May 11.","PalFest is a traveling festival that visits Palestinian communities .

"Washington (CNN) -- The director of the National Weather Service announced his sudden retirement last week after an internal investigation found the agency shifted some of its funding internally without asking Congress, according to officials familiar with the situation. Jack Hayes, a veteran meteorologist who headed the weather service since 2007, announced his retirement Friday and will be succeeded by an acting assistant administrator Tuesday, said a statement by Jane Lubchenco, the undersecretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere. Lubchenco's statement Friday made no mention of the investigation that found more than $30 million had been used by the National Weather Service to pay for costs that differed from the intended budgeted funding. All the officials involved emphasized that there was no evidence that any of the money was for personal gain. ""National Weather Service employees engaged in the reprogramming of funds without congressional notification as required,"" said a statement Monday by Scott Smullen, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the weather service. ""The investigation also found that no funds were used on inappropriate items, they were simply used in different categories than originally budgeted,"" Smullen's statement said. The investigation found no evidence of corruption or personal financial gain in these actions. ""We do not believe any money was moved out of the National Weather Service."" Richard Hirn, the general counsel and legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, said Monday that most of the shifted funds helped make up a shortfall between rising salaries for weather forecasters and the amount of money appropriated to pay them. Weakened storm soaks Southeast U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, called Friday for Congress to look into the matter. According to a statement by Snowe, senior staff at the National Weather Service ""have been conducting improper and potentially illegal transfers of taxpayers' money."" ""While the director of the National Weather Service has stepped down, there are many more remaining questions which require answers from both National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Commerce -- and any and all individuals who bear responsibility in this misconduct must be held fully to account,"" her statement said. In addition, the senator expressed concern that ""the investigative report raises fundamental concerns that the core operations of the National Weather Service are underfunded"" and the Department of Commerce lacks sufficient overview. Specifically, Snowe's statement said that the chief financial officer of the National Weather Service ""was misappropriating funds from his program accounts and redirecting them to 122 weather offices nationwide, which conduct critical forecasting of weather events and major storms."" ""At this time, NOAA has not found any evidence that the CFO, or any other NWS employee, made personal financial gains from this misappropriation,"" Snowe's statement said. ""According to NOAA, disciplinary action is being reviewed for individuals involved in this behavior."" The weather service chief financial officer at the time in question was Robert J. Byrd. In announcing the retirement of Hayes, Lubchenco named Laura Furgione as acting assistant administrator of the weather service. Furgione headed the weather service Alaska region and most recently has been its deputy assistant administrator. Lubchenco's statement praised Hayes for pursuing ""a number of important advancements that have resulted and will continue to result in lives saved throughout the country."" In a memorandum to staff last week, Lubchenco said NOAA will ask Congress to reprogram $35 million in funding to address the situation. Snowe said Congress needs to take a closer look at the matter before deciding on that request. However, Hirn said that a failure to approve the reprogramming of the funds could force unpaid furloughs of weather forecasters across the country. Lubchenco's memorandum listed a series of steps taken in response to recommendations by the investigation, including tightened oversight of spending, changes in management structure and steps to ensure that reports of problems receive proper attention. In a separate issue, an audit of nine NOAA contracts released last week found they lacked sufficient supporting information or were too subjective in granting performance awards, providing ""little incentive for contractors to excel."" The audit by the inspector general's office of the U.S. Department of Commerce found $43.8 million in performance awards to contractors had been granted without proper justification.","NEW: Steps taken at the weather service to tighten spending oversight .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Joshua Miller trotted off the football field after making a special-teams play and headed to the bench. Automated external defibrillators are increasingly available in public places, including airports and malls. Louis Acompora manned his lacrosse goal, blocked a shot with his chest and prepared to make a play on the ball in his first high school game. Within seconds, each teen collapsed. In both cases, coaches, medical personnel and parents rushed to the boys, figuring they were dehydrated, had had the wind knocked out of them or had suffered a concussion. Before they realized the boys were in cardiac arrest, both were dead. Two 14-year-old boys. Two lives that could have been saved, their parents said, with one solution: an automated external defibrillator. If a defibrillator had been nearby, ""there is no doubt in my mind Louis would be alive today,"" said Louis' dad, John Acompora. Eight years after their sons died, Acompora and his wife, Karen, and Ken and Jerri Miller have made it their mission to make sure other parents don't suffer the same wrenching loss. The couples successfully lobbied in their home states of Ohio and New York to pass laws mandating defibrillators in schools. Now, these two families have joined cardiologist Dr. Terry Gordon and lawmakers to push for a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives to mandate federal funding for defibrillators in primary and secondary schools across the nation. The automated external defibrillator is a portable, self-contained machine that can shock the heart back into rhythm. The device comes with complete audio instructions. In most cases, you'll hear it tell you to remove the person's clothes and place the electrode patches in specific locations. Statistics show more than 200,000 Americans die of sudden cardiac arrest every year, according to the American Heart Association. Up to 50,000 of these deaths could have been prevented, the association said, if someone had initiated what the group calls the Cardiac Chain of Survival and a defibrillator had been available. In a study presented last fall at the annual heart association meeting, a team of heart experts from Johns Hopkins University reported evidence that at least 522 lives can be saved annually in the United States and Canada by the widespread placement of automated external defibrillators. U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton, an Ohio Democrat, introduced a measure in Congress named for young Miller that would establish a grant program to help schools nationwide afford defibrillators. ""The availability of automatic external defibrillators can be the difference between life and death when an individual goes into sudden cardiac arrest,"" she said. ""Schools are central gathering places in our communities, and placing AEDs in our schools will not only potentially save the lives of students enrolled there, but they will be available for teachers and staff, parents and volunteers, and the many other members of the community who pass through our schools every single day."" Gordon joined the cause after seeing videotape of Miller's tragic death. ""It was the most sickening thing in the world,"" Gordon said. ""In that normally boisterous stadium you could hear a pin drop -- except for his mother wailing."" Gordon is making it his goal to try and re-educate people on the importance of the lifesaving devices. ""When someone collapses from a cardiac arrest, their heart starts to quiver, and unless immediately shocked, they'll die,"" he said. Calling 911 and waiting for paramedics is not enough, he said. Gordon said the average response time is eight to 12 minutes. ""If you do the math, for every minute that they are lying there, the chances [of survival] decrease,"" he said. ""That's why only a precious few survive."" One of the big fears that many people have about defibrillators, Gordon said, is that they will hurt someone by using the machine. But in fact, the defibrillator won't automatically shock anyone. Once placed on the patient, the defibrillator analyzes the heartbeat and won't deliver a shock if one is not medically needed. The device may prompt the rescuer to begin CPR. If a shock is needed, the machine instructs the person using it to stand clear. After the first jolt, it will continue to analyze the patient's heartbeat to see whether more shocks are needed. For every minute a person isn't shocked, his or her chance of survival drops 10 percent, Gordon said. With CPR alone, that survival rate improves, but use of a defibrillator can be as much as 10 times more effective, he said. Studies have shown the devices can be used safely by anyone -- even children. Gordon said in one study where paramedics and seventh-graders were trained on the machine, the students only took 29 seconds longer to figure out how to use them. One of the biggest concerns people have is that there is a liability if they try to use the defibrillator without training, but citizens are protected by the Good Samaritan law, Gordon said. The Acompora and Miller families believe defibrillators at their children's schools could have changed their lives. Because the biggest problem in stocking schools with defibrillators is funding, the bill before the House would require the federal government to match funds for the devices. Defibrillators cost about $1,500. ""What's a life worth?"" Ken Miller asked. John Acompora said the answer is in the number of people whose lives have been saved because of the devices being in schools. ""You're asking the wrong person if this is a worthwhile device,"" he said. ""That morning I would have given everything to have owned one.""

"(CNN) -- Chinese golf prodigy Guan Tianlang will have another chance to shine at a top professional tournament after being invited to play in a PGA Tour event in New Orleans next week. The 14-year-old stunned the sporting world at last week's Masters when he not only made the halfway cut as the youngest player to ever enter the prestigious major, but also finished as the leading amateur. He will line up at the Zurich Classic, whose title sponsor was also involved with the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship he won last year to qualify for Augusta. ""Guan's victory in Thailand in November and his historic achievement last week at Augusta National Golf Club are truly remarkable. We are excited to have him join us,"" Zurich CEO Martin Senn said Thursday. The tournament, won last year by Jason Dufner, is hosted by the Fore!Kids Foundation, which has raised almost $23 million for children since its inception in 1958. ""Guan represents the aspirations of millions of young golfers and golf fans of all ages worldwide,"" its CEO Steve Worthy said. Dufner, who claimed the $1.15 million first prize last year when he beat Ernie Els in a playoff, is expected to defend his title in a field also including the South African, 2011 winner Bubba Watson, fellow major champion Keegan Bradley and world No. 3 Justin Rose. Meanwhile, Sergio Garcia was off the pace after making a quick trans-Atlantic crossing to appear at his home Spanish Open. The world No. 13, who tied for eighth at Augusta, was four shots behind the leaders after shooting par 72 in Thursday's opening round. Compatriot Miguel Angel Jimenez, making his comeback after breaking a leg skiing last year, was in a tie for 112th after carding a rusty 76, to be in a group including former European Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal.

"Washington (CNN) -- In the hours after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, law enforcement officials were searching for a dark-skinned Middle Eastern man in connection to the attack that killed 168 people, including 19 children. Meanwhile, Timothy McVeigh, the real bomber, was getting away. Following the 1996 bombing at the Atlanta Olympics, investigators and the media initially focused on a local security guard named Richard Jewell. The real terrorist, Eric Robert Rudolph, who later admitted to planting the pipe bomb that killed two and injured 111 others, remained free until he was caught in 2003. And even in 2011 in Norway, when a bomb went off outside the prime minister's office, killing eight people, followed by the shooting deaths of 69 people at a Labour Party youth camp, police immediately started looking for Muslims or radical Islamists. Days later, Anders Behring Breivik, a white Norwegian, was arrested. He claimed the attacks were necessary to protect Norway from multiculturalism. In each case, the initial rush to judgment by law enforcement and the media may have distracted officials from the real perpetrator and caused unnecessary harm to individuals and ethnic groups who had nothing to do with the attacks. After Monday's bombing at the Boston Marathon, which left three dead and more than 170 others hurt, there had been initial reports of a Saudi national being questioned. On Tuesday, a U.S. official told CNN that, ""as of now"" there was no foreign or al Qaeda connection, but the investigation is ongoing. The Saudi male in question was a spectator at the race, the official said. The man was injured and was running away because of his injury. He was stopped and authorities questioned him, but ""it came up empty. He was just at the wrong place at the wrong time."" Juliette Kayyem, CNN contributor and former U.S. assistant secretary for homeland security, cautioned against putting too much stock in the early reports of Arab involvement. ""I'm pretty cautious about stuff like this, remembering the Oklahoma bombing when it was famously reported that four men in Arab garb were responsible for it,"" said Kayyem on Piers Morgan Live. ""So that's why I think it's important to sort of be cautious on who are they interviewing yet, because the rumors tend to all merge together. And it's important to just sort of let the story line figure out where it's going and then let the forensics sort of lead to the suspects,"" she said. The media has been guilty of making quick assumptions about possible culprits, especially in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing and the Norway massacre. A.M. Rosenthal, after the Oklahoma City bombing, bemoaned in The New York Times the lack of commitment from Western governments to stop Mideast terrorism, saying it was essential ""these Mideastern leaders and their public know that their countries will be held directly responsible for all attacks carried out by terrorists whom they help or harbor -- and that this decision has no expiration date, no statute of limitations."" In the Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin quoted others to help link the attacks in Norway to so-called Islamic radicals. She pointed to Gary Schmitt of the American Enterprise Institute who said, ""There has been a lot of talk over the past few months on how we've got al-Qaeda on the run and, compared with what it once was, it's become a rump organization. ""But as the attack in Oslo reminds us, there are plenty of al-Qaeda allies still operating. No doubt cutting the head off a snake is important; the problem is, we're dealing with global nest of snakes."" But after the bombings in Boston, most major media so far have been cautious in reporting on who perpetrated the attacks, and federal officials, including the president, have been especially reluctant to blame the attack on foreign or domestic elements. ""What we don't yet know...is who carried out this attack or why, whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual,"" President Barack Obama said Tuesday. ""They want to be absolutely sure what they're dealing with before kind of getting ahead of it"" said CNN analyst Paul Cruickshank on Piers Morgan Live.","In attacks in Oklahoma City, Atlanta and Norway, reports of an initial suspect were wrong .
Officials and the media were guilty of a rush to judgment in those instances .

"(CNN) -- Getting anyone in Lebanon to weigh in on where to find the best shawarma or falafel is asking for trouble. The country's most popular pastimes are, without question, eating and debating, so expect a heated argument, especially since Lebanon is jammed with incredible restaurants, street-food stalls and bakeries. Besides eating and talking about food, the Lebanese also love to feed their guests, so meals with friends and family can go on for hours and include dozens of different dishes. Any visitor with a big appetite, a little patience, and an adventurous spirit is bound to eat more and better in Lebanon than virtually anywhere else in the world. I'm biased. I'm Lebanese, although living in New York these days. Two summers ago I moved back to Beirut for a year and wrote my memoir, ""Jasmine and Fire: A Bittersweet Year in Beirut."" Although I'd spent my childhood in Beirut during the Lebanese civil war of 1975 to 1990, I'd been exposed to only a fraction of the country's mind-boggling variety of food. So on my recent return to Lebanon, I made a point to go on food adventures across the country, from the cedar-covered mountains in the north down to the ancient city of Tyre in the south. For travelers to Lebanon who want to get a deeper sense of the country's food culture beyond the well-known staples of hummus, tabbouleh and kebabs, Beirut is an excellent place to start. Read more: The Lebanese art rockers creating the soundtrack to the Arab Spring . It's packed with classic family-style restaurants, imaginative chefs, street stalls serving food like kaak (sesame bread), and bakeries that turn out fresh Arabic bread and the hot zaatar flatbreads known as man'ouches. Just about every Lebanese restaurant in Beirut serves a different dish of the day at lunchtime, usually something deliciously humble that reminds many patrons of their mother's cooking. Recurring hits include kibbeh—a national specialty made with lamb, bulgur wheat, onions and pine-nuts baked into a savory pie or into meatballs soaked in minty yogurt sauce—or any of a variety of slow-cooked stews known as yakhnes, served over vermicelli-laced rice with garlicky bits of lamb and braised vegetables topped with homemade yogurt. Lunch also often includes vibrant salads made with local greens like purslane, and savory pastries stuffed with spiced chard and sweet onions. In Beirut, some excellent places to sample dishes like these and many more are Al Balad—a downtown favorite—and Tawlet, an innovative restaurant in the hopping Mar Mikhael neighborhood. After eating around Beirut for a few days, it would be a shame not to take a least a daytrip or two outside the city. Lebanon is relatively small, so getting up to the northern tip of the country or all the way down south takes only about two hours, barring horrendous traffic. In northern Lebanon, in the town of Becharre near the famous cedar tree forests, the local specialty is kibbeh mishwiyeh: fresh minced lamb rolled up with bulgur wheat to form giant meatballs the size of tennis balls, stuffed with caramelized onions and pine nuts and grilled until crunchy on the outside.

Nearby in Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city, the iconic pastry shop Abdel Rahman Hallab specializes in regional pastries like halawit jibneh—soft ricotta-like cheese rolled in pastry and topped with sugar syrup—and sfiha, small savory pies topped with spicy beef or lamb and pine nuts. With any travel to towns near the border with Syria, like Tripoli, it's important for travelers to be aware of the changing and potentially volatile situation. Along the Mediterranean coast south of Tripoli is the seafood-centric town of Batroun. Local restaurants such as Jammal serve bizrieh—tiny fish, fried and piled in huge mounds on platters for guests to eat by hand, and topped only with squirts of fresh lemon. Batroun also specializes in a wonderful style of kibbeh balls, made with fish instead of meat. Classic local cafes like The Garage serve Batroun's renowned sweet-and-tart lemonade, made from the local citrus harvest and served ice-cold. Just 45 minutes from Beirut is Byblos, a historic coastal city with stunning ancient Roman ruins and a well-preserved Crusader-era castle. But among the archeological attractions it would be a shame to miss out on a platter of fresh local Sultan Ibrahim fish at Bab El Mina restaurant. Fried, drizzled with lemon, and served with crunchy pita bread coated in olive oil, it goes perfectly with a crisp Lebanese beer. Baalbeck, in the Bekaa Valley, is the agricultural heart of Lebanon, and a road-trip there from Beirut leads past the town of Chtaura, where farms produce some of the Middle East's most sought-after dairy products. Pick up a labneh (strained yogurt) sandwich drizzled with mint and sea salt and rolled into soft, papery khibz markouk bread. About an hour south of Beirut is Tyre, a coastal city dating back to Alexander the Great. Here fishermen take boats out from the ancient harbor and return with fish to deliver to local restaurants. The best ones, like Le Phénicien, turn the day's catch—such as luqqos, a mild white fleshy Mediterranean fish—into simple but exquisitely fresh preparations. Read more: Skiing provides escape for Lebanese . Food adventures can keep any determined eater busy every minute of a visit to Lebanon, but even the most restless road-tripper shouldn't turn down an invitation to a Lebanese home for a meal. On a lucky day, the main course might be m'loukhiyeh, a fragrant, soupy stew made from mallow leaves topped with tender spiced chicken and served over rice, with a tangy vinegar and onion dressing. In homes, as at restaurants, the meal will likely start with a mezze—a spread of dishes that usually includes hummus, fattoush (tomato, mint and bread salad), babaghanoush, labneh, and more—but it's important to leave room for the main course. Then again, I've never managed to take my own advice, especially since the most intent Lebanese hosts won't let guests leave the table without tasting everything in sight and having seconds. Advice? Just surrender.","Many Beirut restaurants serve a different dish of the day at lunchtime, usually something that reminds patrons of their mother's cooking .

"Dubai (CNN) -- In a Dubai cafÃ©, patrons sip camel-milk lattes, camel-ccinos and shakes made with camel milk. The newly opened Cafe2Go is one of the first to put camel milk on its menu and it seems to be passing the taste test with intrigued customers. ""I'm surprised because I was thinking it was tasting really different from the normal milk, but ... it's really nice,"" said customer Nadia Rizk. ""I thought it would be weird when I tried it, but it's just like everything else,"" said another, Sal Hobbi. It is the latest sign of a boom in camel-milk products in the United Arab Emirates. A few years ago, Al-Nassma became the first company in the country to produce camel-milk chocolate. ""It tastes really nice,"" said Martin Van Almsick, general manager of Al Nassma Chocolate. ""And the thing is, you don't have to be an expert to notice. This is a great chocolate, everybody can tell."" Camel milk has been a staple for Bedouins for centuries, but it has never before been produced in scale or used commercially in this way. For Emiratis, it is a way of combining local pride with a healthy option. Camel milk is lower in fat and higher in Vitamin C than cow's milk, according to scientists. ""In the milk are all the vitamins, all the minerals, fat, carbohydrates, that you need for daily life,"" said Ulrich Wernery, scientific director of the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory. Also on Inside the Middle East: Saudi foodies ditch fast food for fine dining . And it's not just being used in coffee and chocolate. There's also camel-milk cheese and ""Camelicious"" -- bottled camel milk sold in supermarkets and sometimes flavored with date or chocolate. They are produced by ""Emirates Industry for Camel Milk and Products,"" one of the world's first large-scale camel milk farms, based in the desert outside Dubai. ""We are using the camel milk, and our grandfathers using the camel milk, for many years,"" said Mutasher Al Badry, its manager. ""It is not new to us, and it was in our culture to have the milk, and the camel milk products as well,"" he added. ""We are converting the culture to commercial."" The farm has thousands of camels, each producing around six liters of milk a day, but demand is so high they are struggling to keep up. Farm manager Peter Nagy says that to produce milk, it's important to keep the animals happy . ""That's the whole idea, that's the whole concept,"" he said. ""To keep animals quiet, happy. And then, they will produce milk for us."" See also: Dubai diners flock to eat new 'camel burger' Both Emirates Industry for Camel Milk and Products and Al Nassma Chocolate receive funding from Dubai's ruling sheikhs, who say they are motivated as much by the desire to promote a healthy product as by profit. In future, they hope, it will be on sale way beyond the shores of the United Arab Emirates. ""We are planning to be a global leader, and also we are planning to be a reference for the world in the camel industry,"" said Al Badry.","Camel milk is used in lattes, milkshakes, chocolate and cheese in Dubai .

"(Matador Network)  -- From choosing the right festival to tips on camping and pacing yourself through the shows, here's (almost) everything you'll need to know about preparing for your next music festival. When I went to my first summer musical festival a few years back, I was unprepared and could've used a little guidance. Since then, I've covered Lollapalooza, Pitchfork Music Festival, moe.down and other summer festivals, acquiring along the way a checklist of sorts that I wish I'd had before embarking on that first one. Seasoned veteran or festival novice, I hope these tips will make your experience more rocking, relaxing and fun. Find the right festival for you . One of the best places to start is Jambase.com, an aggregator of all things related to music festivals and concerts. Check out the history of each particular festival via its website or third-party music blogs/sites. Each festival tries to set itself apart, creating a specific slant through lineup, location and overall vibe. Generally, festivals will be teaming up with local and regional media and artists to offer unique side shows ranging from improv theater to art exhibits to on-site record stores and activist booths promoting voter registration and green initiatives. Matador Network: 10 wildest electronic music festivals worldwide . As you do your research, ask yourself the following four questions: . 1. How much can you spend? Festival passes range from $50 to $250 or higher, depending on venue, location and who's headlining and promoting the festival. 2. What type of music do you want to hear? Musical tastes are pretty diverse these days, as most people enjoy several genres, and festival lineups reflect this. Though some are genre-exclusive, most showcase acts playing everything from bluegrass to hip hop. 3. Are you prepared to camp? For festivals like Bonnaroo and Coachella, much of the experience is about pitching your tent and camping out for the weekend. Some camping events do offer luxury cabins or tents in return for higher ticket prices. Cover story: What is Bonnaroo? Most festivals provide maps pre-arrival, so you'll want to know where the camping areas are in relation to the parking and stages. If the distance is far, try to keep your gear light or invest in a small pull wagon or cart. Depending on how much sleep you want to get or how close you want to be to the action (many festivals run 24 hours), you'll want to know if the camping sites are near the stages, scattered across the grounds, or both. Bring the usual camping gear -- tent, sleeping bag, etc. -- and don't forget a car charger for your phone, laptop and other gadgets. The world's best music festivals . 4. Are hotels an option? If you're attending a festival located in a city or metropolitan area, such as Pitchfork in Chicago, getting a hotel room for the weekend on your own is an option, or you can take advantage of the festival's package lodging deals. Learn the local history before you go . As with all travel, having a cultural awareness of where you're going can enrich your festival experience and take you beyond simple enjoyment of the music. The uniqueness of many of the best festivals is rooted in their locality. For example, Glastonbury in the UK is held on festival grounds that have been used as such for centuries. Being clued in on local culture and history will also help if you plan on venturing away during the show to give your ears a rest or want to take a pre- or post-festival excursion to visit nearby attractions. Stretch your comfort zone . One of the best parts about the summer music festival experience is observing the meshing of different cultures and being around new groups of people. As more and more festivals incorporate different genres, I've seen an increasingly diverse cross-section of fans at festivals. Take the opportunity to interact with other festival-goers, and don't be afraid to ask for that camping tool you forgot. Chat about last night's set or join in a game of Frisbee. Matador Network: 10 bluegrass festivals for summer 2011 . Be smart about drugs and alcohol . I don't include this tip to be a killjoy, but only as a word of caution. I've seen festival experiences come to an early and nightmarish end as a result of irresponsible drug and alcohol use. It's a fact that music culture and drug culture overlap, especially in a live-music setting, but be wise about bringing drugs or large amounts of booze with you. At most festivals, you're going to be thoroughly searched before you even get though the gates. Security will either confiscate prohibited materials or ask you to leave with no ticket refunds. Matador: A first-timer's guide to participating at Burning Man . Make time to chill . One of the biggest lessons I've learned is to plan out a few intervals of rest and not run myself ragged trying to see every band. If you've done initial research on the area, take a short trek to one of the quiet spots you learned about and give your cochleas a break. Many festivals have also begun featuring morning yoga classes, a great chance to recharge the mind and body. I can't stress this enough: however you do it, whether it's reading a book, taking a nap, or journaling in a quiet spot, make time to give your ears and other senses a rest. Knowing the festival ground layout and scheduling in time to relax is the most important tip I can give.

"(TIME.com) -- Parents' prescription-drug use has dangerous implications for kids. A recent study published in the journal Pediatrics shows that the rise in prescription-medication use among U.S. adults has led to more poisonings among children -- despite efforts to prevent that outcome. The phenomenon is so concerning that researchers are advising pediatricians to talk with parents about how to safely store prescription drugs away from kids of all ages. The investigators write that despite public-health interventions like educational campaigns and the introduction of child-resistant medicine bottles, between 2001 and 2008, pediatric emergency-department visits due to medication exposures increased 30%, while the rate of hospitalizations increased 36%. Simultaneously, the number of U.S. adults using prescription medications has also gone up. Researchers decided to explore whether there is a connection between the two. Their findings don't look good for child safety. Research shows that more children are being exposed to medications not intended for them, and that most of these poisonings come from consuming prescription drugs vs. over-the-counter ones. Most of these drug exposures happen in a child's home, from medications belonging to an adult relative. TIME.com: Study: Internet access may increase prescription-drug misuse . The researchers looked at two databases and compared monthly pediatric poisonings with the number of adult drug prescriptions from 2000 to 2009. During those years, there was a rise in adult prescriptions for diabetes drugs, statins and other lipid-lowering medications as well as beta-blockers and opioids. They noted a significant association between the rise in adult prescriptions for those drugs -- including hypoglycemics, antihyperlipidemics, b-blockers, and opioids -- and poisonings among children for those specific medications. The strongest link between drugs and emergency-department visits for pediatric poisonings was connected to lipid medications and beta-blockers. Serious injuries and hospitalizations occurred most often for opioids and diabetes medications. Children under age 5 had the highest risk of poisonings, followed by 13- to 19-year-olds. For young kids, medication poisonings are more commonly caused by unintentional consumption, but for teens, it's more likely from recreational use. It's not enough to keep prescription meds out of the reach of young kids; households with teens should be equally mindful of where those drugs are stored to avoid harm and overdose from risky behavior. TIME.com: More kids accidentally ingesting marijuana following new drug policies . The authors suggest that although public-health initiatives, like the 2008 Preventing Overdoses and Treatment Exposures Task Force, may be effective, kids are still being exposed at greater levels. ""Pediatricians should consult parents of patients on storing medications, focusing on how exposures vary based on the child's age and intention. Physicians prescribing drugs to adults should also be aware of the potential risk of exposures to children and provide guidance accordingly,"" the authors write. Unfortunately, adult prescription-drug use is unlikely to fall anytime soon, especially given the high obesity rates in the U.S. Many of the drugs specifically implicated in the study, like antihyperlipidemics, oral hypoglycemics and b-blockers, are taken to treat obesity-related conditions. The researchers conclude that based on their findings, there's a growing need for improved interventions for prescription-drug ingestion, including more age-specific prevention strategies. This study was initially published on TIME.com. More adult prescription drug use leads to increased poisonings in kids . &copy 2012 TIME, Inc. TIME is a registered trademark of Time Inc.

"New York (CNN) -- After winning half of a staggering $587 million Powerball payout in November (netted to $136.5 million after taxes) Mark and Cindy Hill of Dearborn, Missouri, had unlimited options. They could have decided to travel the world, fill their garage with sports cars, or even buy their own island -- fantasies most people entertain when dreaming of a big win. But the couple chose to stay put in Dearborn. Mark still meets friends daily for coffee at a local convenience store. And although he considered buying a Camaro after his win, Mark opted for a pickup. In fact, what the Hills have elected to do with their windfall is far from island buying -- which brings us back to the sewage treatment plant. It's one of many civic projects the Hills have decided to fund for their local community, and specifically Mark's hometown of Camden Point, Missouri -- a small enclave comprising fewer than 500 residents. They'll pay for a new fire station and a new ball field. They'll also donate $50,000 towards the sewage treatment plant. The fire station will have direct access to highways, and the ball field will be set further away from one -- allowing the kids to play out of the range of traffic. As for the sewage treatment plant, that will enable residents to do away with personal septic tanks. Walt Stubbs, Camden Point fire chief, says not only will the new location give the fire department better access to the community, but it will help integrate the local ambulance district with the fire station, improving emergency response times. The Hills also donated a scholarship fund to nearby North Platte High School in Dearborn, where both graduated. City officials estimated these works would have taken around 25 years to complete if the city had to rely on its existing tax base. Stubbs concurs with this figure -- and says the changes they're now able to make weren't even in their 5 or 10 year plans. Stubbs, who went to high school with the Hills, says their decision to use their winnings from the largest Powerball jackpot in history, for the community comes as no surprise, if you know the couple. ""Money changes a lot of people,"" Stubbs says. ""They are just good people and are willing to help others."" Perhaps the Hills were heeding the words of the famously philanthropic Andrew Carnegie: ""Surplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community."" Indeed at the press conference, Cindy Hill echoed Carnegie's sentiment; ""For some reason (God) put it in our hands,"" she said, ""I think to make sure it goes to the right things.""","Mark and Cindy Hill won half of a $587 million payout .

"London (CNN) -- To Iraqi artist Hanaa' Malallah her shoes are weapons of mass destruction that appear in many of her works. Her inspiration is an incident in 2008, when Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi threw his shoes at former president George W. Bush, five years after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The invasion was aimed at rooting out Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, but U.S. inspectors eventually conceded that he did not have any. Malallah's exhibition, ""Iraq -- How, Where, For Whom?"" held jointly with the British duo kennardphillipps, opens in London on Friday April 20. Her shoes appear in a photograph labeled I.W.M.D (Iraq's Weapon's of Mass Destruction). They are also embroidered on an American flag, on an Iraqi flag, and the originals are in a glass display case. ""They are my shoes,"" said Malallah. ""I bought them after I arrived in Britain and I used them for three years."" She added: ""Shoes are our way of resistance. It's all we have. My resistance is through art."" Malallah, formerly a university art lecturer in Baghdad, says she left Iraq in late 2006 after two of her colleagues were killed and she received threats from militias. She now lives in Britain. ""They started to kill a lot of academics,"" she said. ""I was a woman without a headscarf, teaching in the university and I received threats, so I had to leave. ""Two months after I left, a group of militias entered my home and stole everything. My sister called to say my flat had gone. ""I don't have anyone left there now and I think I would lose my life just like that if I went back. It's hard. There are no words to describe it, so I use my art to explain."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Can Baghdad be beautiful again? Malallah said her art reflects three decades of living with war in Iraq, from the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s through the first Gulf War in 1991 and subsequent sanctions, to the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 and the chaos that followed. Much of her work uses what she describes as the ""ruins technique,"" using burnt fabric to depict destruction, often on abstract canvases. She said she experienced the war by ""tasting"" it, as there was no electricity or media to provide information. Describing life in Baghdad since 1991, Malallah said: ""Baghdad was heavily bombed in the First Gulf War. It was hell out of the world. I saw destruction every day and I lived with death every day. ""There was a shortage of food, water and electricity, but you have to survive. Many managed to survive and a lot didn't. Three of my students were killed working in the artistic area. ""I speak to my colleagues by phone and there are still big problems and people dying every day for lots of reasons."" She added: ""I hated Saddam Hussein, but we were better off than now. At least there was a government. If we want to remove a dictator, we have to do it by ourselves."" Malallah's work is shown alongside that of the British duo kennardphillipps, Peter Kennard and Cat Phillipps, who started collaborating in late 2002 in opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. ""We were going on all the anti-war demos, but it was evident the invasion was going to happen anyway and we wanted to find another way to protest against it,"" said Phillipps. They create work from media images of the war, such as photo montages and collages from newspaper clippings. Their most famous work, a photomontage called ""Photo Op,"" is a digitally altered image that shows a smiling Tony Blair, the British prime minister at the time of the invasion, in front of an explosion. Also on Inside the Middle East: Artists use email scams to scoop prize . Another, called ""Presidential Seal,"" shows the American president's empty podium, with the microphones pointing to a backdrop of newspaper clippings and photos which have been smashed with a hammer, creating an impression of debris and chaos. Malallah hopes the exhibition will eventually be shown in Iraq. She said most professional artists had fled the country, leaving a dearth of new talent. ""It's a very bad situation for artists in Iraq at the moment,"" said Malallah. ""They have no contact with the outside world. ""There are a lot of good artists who have left the country and it has really affected those who are left."" ""Iraq -- How, Where, For Whom?"" opens at The Mosaic Rooms, in London, on Friday April 20 and runs until June 8, 2012.","Hanaa' Malallah says she left Iraq in 2006 after receiving threats from militias .

"(CNN) -- Country singer Billy Currington -- charged with threatening a charter boat captain who the performer allegedly thought sped too fast by his dock in coastal Georgia -- turned himself in to authorities, a district attorney's spokesman said. Currington, 39, was released on bail a few hours after arriving at the sheriff's department in Chatham County, Georgia, on Thursday afternoon, county district attorney's spokesman Daniel Baxter said. A grand jury in Savannah handed up a two-count indictment Wednesday accusing Currington of terroristic threats for allegedly threatening bodily harm against Charles Harvey Ferrelle last week. An elder abuse charge was included because Farrelle is 70 years old. The police report, obtained by CNN affiliate WSAV, says Ferrelle filed a criminal complaint saying ""he feared for his life"" after Currington screamed at him and followed him in a boat. Ferrelle, a charter boat captain, was giving a boat tour around Tybee Island, Georgia, when he passed by Currington's property on April 15, the report said. Currington yelled at the boat from shore and then jumped in his own boat and followed as Ferrelle went to his slip at a nearby dock, it said. Currington threatened that ""he was going to f--k Mr. Ferrelle up,"" the police report said. ""If I hadn't gotten into my slip fast enough, I believe he would have run me over,"" Ferrelle told an investigator. Currington and his representatives did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment. But the singer posted a message to fans through his Twitter account: ""hey guys, I wanted to thank everyone for the huge amount of support that I have received already. Unfortunately, I can't comment on this situation as this is an ongoing legal matter. It means a lot to me to have your support during this time."" Although Currington resides primarily in Nashville, he is a native of Rincon, Georgia, which is about 35 miles inland from Tybee Island. Currington's hit country songs include ""Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right,"" ""Good Directions,"" ""People Are Crazy,"" ""That's How Country Boys Roll,"" ""Pretty Good at Drinkin' Beer,"" and ""Let Me Down Easy."" CNN's Alan Duke, Denise Quan and Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Billy Currington turned himself in to authorities Thursday, the district attorney's office says .

"(CNN) -- Mobile devices may have placed an amazing array of technology in the palms of our hands, but they've also given us a bamboozling array of buzzwords and acronyms. To help avoid confusion as the cell phone industry meets for its annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, CNN has compiled a handy jargon buster. Android: An operating system created for mobile devices by a consortium of tech firms led by Google. Different versions of Android are typically named after sugary treats, namely Gingerbread, Honeycomb and Ice Cream Sandwich. AMOLED: Active-matrix organic light-emitting diode. This is the technology behind ultra-thin display screens used on many smartphones. These use on-off switching to consume less power than previous ""passive matrix OLED"" displays. Cloud computing: The offloading of data storage or processing to the internet or a shared network. Cloud technology allows phones to outsource their functions, provided there's a good Wi-Fi connection. 4G: Fourth generation. A loose term covering the wireless network technology that will power the next generation of mobile phones. Already deployed in parts of Europe it promises data speeds of 300Mbps -- 20 times faster than existing 3G networks. Haptics: Tactile feedback, in the form of tiny vibrations, that helps users interact with their touch screens. Ice Cream Sandwich: Not as tasty as it sounds. This is the latest version of Android operating system. iOS: A mobile operating system created by Apple to run devices including the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Mbps: Megabits per second. The rate at which data flows to-and-from devices. The bigger the number, the faster the flow. MVAS: Mobile value-added service (see VAS). NFC: Near field communication: Technology that allows smartphones to communicate with other nearby devices. It allows simple data transfer between mobiles. It can also be used in contactless payment systems, allowing mobiles to behave like debit cards. OLED: Display screen technology (see AMOLED). Padphones: Is it a pad? Is it a phone? It's both! These tablet devices feature a phone docking station, allowing a phone's functions to be upgraded into a tablet environment. Quad core: Refers to the phone's capacity for crunching data. The higher the number of processing cores, the faster the phone. The quadcores unveiled in Barcelona should, in theory, be the fastest to date, capable of simultaneously running several complex apps. This will, however, depend on whether they work well with phone operating systems. SMS: Short message service -- or text messaging. The original and, some say, the best mobile phone app. This cheap, widely-available, stripped-down communication system refuses to die despite technology advances. Stylus: Once thought extinct, the stylus seems to be making a comeback this year. This detachable pointer allows users to prod and write on their touch screens with greater accuracy -- until it gets left in the back of a taxi. Symbian: Mobile phone operating system maintained by technology firm Accenture. Symbian was favored almost exclusively by Nokia, but Nokia is now switching to a mobile version of Microsoft's Windows 7. 3G: Third generation. The technology currently being used by many mobile systems. These support data transfer rates that allow users to surf the internet and watch videos. VAS: Value-added service. Usually refers to any device function beyond its core purpose. Once upon a time, this meant any functionality above phone calls and text messages, but user-expectations are somewhat higher these days.","Mobile phone industry has created a confusing lexicon of acronyms and buzzwords .

"(CNN) -- Lara Zankoul and Lara Atallah are both young Lebanese photographers taking their first steps in promising artistic careers. Their work, however, could hardly be more different. While Atallah focuses on the gritty reality of life in urban Beirut, Zankoul's images are whimsical and surreal, created from her imagination. They are both among the latest emerging artists to be featured in the Young Collectors Auction run by Ayyam Gallery in Dubai. The auction, held on Tuesday (May 15), featured 75 lots from 63 emerging and established Middle Eastern artists, 10 of them aged 30 or under. Ayyam Gallery has been running Young Collectors Auctions since 2008, aimed at supporting emerging artists and opening the art market to new collectors. Almost all the works had estimates well below $10,000, with most in the region of $2,000 to $3,000. ""The art market here is quite young and people are interested in buying art, but intimidated by the gallery scene and auctions,"" said Hisham Samawi, Ayyam's auctioneer. ""We wanted to start something with a relaxed atmosphere, lower estimates and young emerging artists."" See also: Auctions celebrate art of Islamic world . The recipe has been a success and Ayyam has just run its 13th Young Collectors' Auction. The latest raised a total of $550,000. Samawi believes Middle Eastern art could be on the verge of an explosion similar to that seen in the Chinese and Indian art markets in recent years. ""There's great art in this region and internationally it's undervalued,"" he said. ""There has been a steady increase in prices and this is just the beginning. Politically there's so much going on and that's reflected by artists."" Here we feature 10 emerging Middle Eastern artists aged 30 or under from the Ayyam Young Collectors Auction who could be names to watch out for in the future. 1. Lara Zankoul, Lebanon, born 1987 . Zankoul, 24, studied economics at university and only began photography as a hobby in 2009. ""Over time the hobby grew and grew and became an obsession,"" she said. ""I promoted my work through social media and gradually started to gain more followers and feedback and eventually freelance projects."" She held her first exhibition collective two years ago and is part of Ayyam's incubator program. Zankoul's photography consists of surreal compositions she creates from her imagination, rather than an attempt to capture reality. ""I like to create worlds of my own. A lot of work goes into setting up the scene,"" said Zankoul, who once dragged a bed into the sea for a photograph. For now, she still works full time as an economic researcher alongside her photography. 2. Lara Atallah, Lebanon, born 1989 . Atallah, 22, captures the gritty reality of urban Beirut in her photography, aiming to tackle social problems. She had just graduated in graphic design from the University of Beirut last year when she got her break entering a competition organized by Ayyam Gallery. Her entry was a series of photographs of an abandoned school building. ""Photography is a means, not an end,"" said Atallah. ""The ideas I like to get across do not get much attention from artists and people in general."" Other subjects she has tackled include the destruction of Beirut's architectural heritage, and street vendors and their makeshift shelters. ""There's no such thing as the right time to start out as an artist, it takes a lot of determination,"" said Atallah. ""But since I've started I've discovered a lot of different artists from this region. There's a very rich art scene."" See also: Megabucks sex up Middle East art explosion . 3. Eman Mohammed, Palestinian Territories, born 1989 . Mohammed says she is the only Palestinian woman working as a photojournalist in Gaza and says she has faced prejudice over her career choice. She began covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as a teenager in 2006 and has gained an international reputation for her work, which includes images of air strikes, funerals of militants, and Gaza's deep-sea fishermen. Mohammed won the 2009 Carmignac Gestion Judges' Special Prize, received an honorable mention in UNICEF's 2009 Photo of the Year contest and has been part of collective exhibitions in the United States, Canada, Israel, Ireland and the Netherlands. 4. Babak Kazemi, Iran, born 1983 . Kazemi, a graphic-design graduate, makes unusual and often surreal photographic collages. His work includes vintage-style sepia photographs superimposed with brightly colored Disney images of Mickey and Minnie Mouse. He experiments with a technique called petroleum printing, involving immersing collages in petroleum products. 5. Saeed Salem, Yemen, born 1984 . Salem, of Yemeni descent, was born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and -- after studying abroad -- has set up a photographic studio there called 181 Degrees. In his series Neonland, he explores the bright lights of Jeddah's cosmopolitan city center. In exhibition publicity he said: ""These neon kiosks are a symbol of Jeddah ... they are iconic and you only find them in this city ... It's like a mini hypermarket. ""To me, they symbolize both the old Arabic culture: a place to meet and talk; as well as something very futuristic."" 6. Abdalla Omari, Syria, born 1986 . Painter and filmmaker Omari, from Damascus, is one of the few people on this list already working full-time as an artist. Omari has made and collaborated in animation films, series and video arts and took part in the 2010 Damascus International Cinema Festival. 7. Ali Taptik, Turkey, born 1983 . Taptik, from Istanbul, is working on a Masters thesis on the history of architecture and taught himself photography. His series ""Accident and Fate"" is a narrative on urban life, exploring relationships, places, people, emotions and coincidences. 8. Navid Azimi Sajadi, Iran, born 1982 . Sajadi, who describes himself as an iconoclast, works through painting, photography, installation and sculpture. He uses symbols from his Iranian heritage as well as Middle Eastern stereotypes shown in Western media. 9. Rhea Karam, Lebanon, born 1982 . Rhea Karam was born in Beirut, grew up in France and is now based in New York, where she graduated from the International Center of Photography. She has exhibited internationally and won awards including the Best of Show at the 2011 Colorado Photographic Arts Center juried exhibition. 10. Lamya Gargash, United Arab Emirates, born 1982 . Gargash's photographs document the forgotten public and private spaces in Emirati society and capture the notion of hospitality and the politics of interior design. As well as taking part in numerous photography exhibitions, Gargash has won awards for her film-making. Gargash was the featured artist at the inaugural UAE Pavilion of the Venice Biennale in 2009.

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for a former State Department contract worker accused of leaking national secrets to a Fox News reporter are questioning whether search warrants in the case were properly obtained and may ask a federal judge to throw out evidence seized with the warrants. Also in U.S. District court Tuesday, the judge questioned prosecutors and the defense about the pace of the case against former State Department contractor Stephen Jin-Woo Kim. One search warrant in the case has caused a major national controversy because in an affidavit, an FBI agent stated that Fox News correspondent James Rosen could be an ""aider and abettor and/or a co-conspirator"" in a crime. Rosen has not been charged. Based on news reports, the Kim defense began questioning the warrants in the hearing Tuesday. After the hearing, the United States Attorney's Office for Washington defended the warrants. ""The government has followed all applicable laws, regulations, and Department of Justice policies in this case. The government will respond to any legal motion if and when it is filed by the defense,"" the office said in a statement. Prosecutors and the defense also explained to Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly that the process of declassifying information is likely to prolong the 2Â½-year-old criminal case. Kim's lead lawyer, Abbe Lowell -- who has represented some of Washington's most famous defendants including former Sen. John Edwards and former ""super-lobbyist"" Jack Abramoff -- also tried to get more information to help his client. Much of the Kim prosecution until now has been shrouded under a veil of national security considerations, but Lowell argued for less secrecy and more openness in the handling of the case. Lowell told Kollar-Kotelly that the intelligence community had imposed so many constraints on the flow of information that Lowell is not even allowed to utter the name of the reporter involved or the news organization because the government considers it classified information. From the beginning, the identities of Rosen and Fox News have been associated publicly with the Kim case. An article Rosen wrote in June 2009 reporting that U.S. officials believed North Korea might test more nuclear weapons is understood to have been the initial news item that launched the investigation. Lowell is seeking to get the government to determine whether hundreds of pages of information that may be relevant to the case will be kept classified or declassified. ""The (intelligence community) holds onto this information like it's diamonds and gold,"" Lowell said. Prosecutors said they were in a difficult position because intelligence officials decide what information can be legally released. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Malis, the government's ""leaks prosecutor,"" said in court that his team ""doesn't have access to the information Lowell is seeking. It's not our choice."" U.S. prosecutors said it could take months for the intelligence community to sift through all of the information in the case that is potentially in dispute, if it's required. In cases involving classified information, courts must apply a law called the Classified Information Procedures Act or CIPA, which lays out a painstaking, multipart process allowing intelligence experts a chance to redact certain documents. This process must be completed before sensitive information may be introduced as evidence at trial. Kollar-Kotelly said she was setting a trial date for next spring, but she told the lawyers she would prefer to start the trial in late November.","Lawyers for an ex-State Department contractor accused of leaks question search warrants .

"(CNN) -- The man who police say plowed his vehicle into a California Walmart, where he then attacked several customers, was booked Monday on four counts of assault with a deadly weapon and resisting arrest. Haamid Zaid, 33, of Seaside, California, is suspected of having been under the influence of drugs, but the motive is under investigation, according to Albert Morales, an officer with the San Jose Police Department. ""Once Mr. Zaid emerged from the vehicle, he used some type of metal object to attack people,"" Morales said of the Sunday incident at the San Jose store. The suspect was later subdued by a group of customers until police arrived, he said . One of the victims, a 61-year-old man, was transported to an area hospital. The injury was considered serious but not life-threatening. Three other unidentified victims were treated for injuries at the scene and released, authorities said. Detectives are reviewing surveillance video to help determine how the vehicle plowed into the store and whether the crash was intentional.

"(CNN) -- If Rush Limbaugh says same-sex marriage is inevitable, it's inevitable. Here's what the conservative radio host had to say about the topic on a recent show: . ""This issue is lost. I don't care what the Supreme Court does. This is now inevitable. And it's inevitable because we lost the language on this."" In a separate clip, he says he would agree with gay rights activists who claim the ""genie isn't going to get put back in the bottle"" on this issue. ""I think the inertia is clearly moving in the direction that there is going to be gay marriage, at some point, nationwide."" Does he sound begrudging? Yes. Do I care? No. If the King Conservative is endorsing the inevitability of same-sex marriage, then my generation -- the one demographers talk about when they mention the ""sea change"" in public opinion on this topic; the people born after 1981 who support ""gay marriage"" at a rate of 70% -- will live to see it happen. That's so exciting that I almost want to end the column right here and now. Who cares what the Supreme Court decides? Rush said equality is on the way! But then the question becomes: How soon? And: What happens until then? Finally: Doesn't this in-between part matter? Those doubts are what bother me about a new and hotly debated Time magazine cover that declares, quite prematurely, and in all-caps: ""Gay marriage already won."" ""The Supreme Court hasn't made up its mind,"" the subhead says, ""but America has."" The trouble: America hasn't. New-York-America has. Washington-America has. California-America, which voted in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage, could easily overturn that law if a new election were held today. Sutter: Gays live in 50 Americas . But there are plenty of gay and lesbian people who live in states like South Carolina, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Georgia -- where far different views dominate the discourse. Unless the Supreme Court rules broadly against California's ban on same-sex marriage, which seems unlikely to the smart people who have been dissecting the arguments, then some gay people could be waiting decades for equal rights under the law. How long, exactly, is the subject of some debate. ""In Republican-leaning red states, which uniformly have banned gay marriage, few seem to be having second thoughts,"" writes Ronald Brownstein in the National Journal. ""For the near future, the nation appears locked onto a trajectory in which almost all reliably blue states will establish gay marriage (or civil unions) and possibly not a single reliably red state will follow."" Trajectory, locked. Awesome. I did find a glimmer of hope, however, in an analysis from Nate Silver, The New York Times blogger and data wiz who correctly predicted the outcome of the 2012 presidential election. Silver says even the reddest of the red states will change eventually. Thirty-two states would support same-sex marriage in a popular vote by the year 2016, he writes in a recent blog post. ""And by 2020, voters in 44 states would do so, assuming that same-sex marriage continues to gain support at roughly its previous rate."" The six states left out? South Carolina, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, according to his analysis. With Mississippi being last. I recently spent some time in that state, which passed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage by a majority vote of 86%. In states like that, gay people find it difficult in some communities just to exist, much less hold commitment ceremonies. I met gay kids who had been harassed at school; a couple that keep a security camera on their porch; and a man who says he was fired because of his sexual orientation. (That's legal in Mississippi and 28 other states, by the way, and it's something no one's talking about.) Opinion: Which state matches your values on LGBT rights? The conversation is changing -- there are plenty of proud, brave and openly gay people living in the Deep South -- but it's happening at an uneven clip. And these delays matter for real people. In Mississippi, I met folks like L.B. and Sara Bell, who are legally married in Connecticut but don't get any of the rights that go with that partnership in the Hospitality State. They told me they would like to start a family but worry about both of them getting custody, since Mississippi bans adoption by same-sex parents. Sara, who would like to carry the child, is 31. If same-sex marriage isn't legalized until, say, 2030, she would be 48. It would be nice to overlook this mushy, awkward middle period -- our county's pimply adolescence on gay rights -- and jump straight to an all-inclusive future. But these teenage years matter. They affect how millions of Americans live today. And the transition could also affect what type of nation we become. Let's hope they go by quickly. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.","Time magazine's cover declares ""GAY MARRIAGE ALREADY WON""

"(CNN) -- Mike McLelland came to the law late in life. He was already around 40 when he started law school at Texas Wesleyan University in Fort Worth, drawn in by his work with the mentally ill, classmate and one-time law partner Michael Burns said. Becoming a district attorney ""was what he always wanted to do,"" Burns said. McLelland was killed over the weekend, shot to death along with his wife, Cynthia. Friends found the couple dead Saturday evening in their home in Forney, on the eastern outskirts of Dallas. He was elected in 2010 to the post of district attorney in Kaufman County, where one of his assistant prosecutors was gunned down outside the courthouse in January. Now his own slaying is at the heart of a Texas-size whodunit that has left local, state and federal investigators scrambling for answers. ""They were the consummate good people,"" Burns said. ""We kidded Mike because he had no identifiable vices, and we all had vices. We either drank too much or smoked too much or chased women. But Mike had no identifiable vices, and Cynthia was solid gold."" Who's killing Texas prosecutors? Chilling mystery leaves county on edge . Another colleague, Anderson County District Attorney Doug Lowe, called McLelland ""a big bear of a guy, never met a stranger."" ""He said what he meant, and I'm sorry this tragedy followed him,"" Lowe told CNN's The Situation Room. Both McLellands had master's degrees in psychology, said Burns, now the district attorney in Palo Pinto County, on the opposite side of the sprawling Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. They had met in the field and were dating while Mike attended law school, he said. Their marriage was the second for both; they had five children between them, all grown now, Burns said. The 63-year-old McLelland grew up in Wortham, where his parents had a ranch. He joined the Army after attending the University of Texas and still held a major's commission in the reserves when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Persian Gulf war. Burns said McLelland was called up shortly after finishing law school and trained soldiers in psychological warfare during the 1991 conflict. Burns, who had been a police officer, and McLelland were older than the average student at Texas Wesleyan and soon became study partners. ""He decided that he wanted to go into the law particularly to be a prosecutor, but those opportunities don't come along that often,"" Burns said. ""So when we graduated, we went down to Corpus Christi, down on the coast, and opened a law office and practiced criminal defense work."" Drawing on his earlier training, McLelland took on a lot of court-appointed work for mentally ill defendants, Burns said. Cynthia was a gourmet cook, and ""she used to bring some of the most fantastic lunches to the office when we were there,"" he said. Eventually, both moved back to north Texas, where McLelland set up a law practice in Kaufman County. He had been a psychologist for the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation before going to law school and became a mental health judge after getting his law degree; his wife got a job at the state mental hospital in Terrell and was still practicing there when she was killed, Burns said. Burns was elected to his office in 2006. When McLelland decided to run for Kaufman County's chief prosecutor's post four years later, his friend came over to ""get the lay of the land about what it was like to be an elected DA"" Pete Shulte, another friend of McLelland's, told CNN's Starting Point that lawyering was a collegial business in the county of about 100,000. ""Everybody knew each other here. It was a great place to practice law,"" Shulte said. ""Everybody liked the district attorney's office. There just wasn't a lot of activity out here. So the biggest shock out here this morning is why, in Kaufman, Texas, are we having an assistant DA get killed and an elected DA. It's really sending some shock waves through the community."" McLelland won a three-way race in the 2010 Republican primary and ran unopposed in the general election. Burns said he and McLelland kept in touch ""here and there"" until January, when McLelland's assistant district attorney, Mark Hasse, was shot to death in a still-unsolved case. ""He was bound and determined to find out who had done that to Mark, and Mike was fearless,"" Burns said. He was like, 'They better come prepared, because there'll be a fight.' "" After Hasse's killing, McLelland publicly vowed to bring the ""scum"" who killed his assistant to justice. ""We're going to pull you out of whatever hole you're in, we're going to bring you back and let the people of Kaufman County prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law,"" he said. But in mid-February, Burns said McLelland told him, ""My greatest fear is that it was one person, acting alone, who doesn't drink,"" eliminating the chance that a liquored-up perpetrator would ever confess. ""That's vintage McLelland right there."" Since the killings, Burns said prosecutors from several counties have exchanged theories about what happened, ""but frankly, none of us know."" ""We're used to hearing this sort of thing happening in Colombia or even Mexico. We're not used to hearing about judicial officials targeted in the United States,"" Burns said. ""It's hard to say whether this is a local phenomenon that involves only one issue locally there, or whether this is the beginning of a trend. As a prosecutor, I can just tell you, we can't ignore it."" ""We're looking out the peephole when the doorbell rings now, where we maybe we weren't before,"" he added. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report. Watch The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer weekdays at 4pm to 6pm ET and Saturdays at 6pm ET.

"Washington (CNN) -- Depending on whom you ask, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid's decision to scuttle a controversial assault weapons ban proposal from a broader Democrat-backed gun control package is either shrewd strategy or political cowardice. There's a little bit of truth in both perspectives, gun policy advocates say. ""It's not surprising what Sen. Reid did,"" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. The Nevada lawmaker decided not to include the proposed assault weapons ban in gun legislation going to the full Senate for consideration because including it would guarantee the measure would be blocked by a Republican filibuster. ""I think there's justification for such a ban but politically it hits right in the area where we have the biggest divide,"" Webster said. Senate leader says new weapons ban won't pass . The ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons is proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and fiercely opposed by the National Rifle Association, Republicans and some Democrats. The ban would get fewer than 40 votes, Reid said, far below the threshold needed to defeat a filibuster or pass the Senate. The proposal to update a similar 1994 ban that expired a decade later was one of four measures passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to the Connecticut school massacre in December. Instead, Feinstein could propose the ban as an amendment to gun legislation on the Senate floor in order to get a vote on it, Reid said. The other proposals that are part of the gun control package would expand background checks, toughen laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases and design steps to improve school safety. Lawmakers seem prepared to tackle gun control: 'This one feels different' But it's the assault weapons ban that draws some of the most intense emotion in the wake of last year's deadly mass shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School and an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. Congressional hearings have been filled with tearful testimony, poignant photographs and fiery rhetoric. They are the type of raw displays likely to spook lawmakers wary of losing votes and tank gun control reform efforts, political experts say. ""In thinking about what is politically doable, for people who are more in the middle it's hardest to do anything that could characterize a politician as casting an anti-gun vote,"" Webster said. Will states go where Congress hasn't on gun laws? The proposed assault weapons ban enjoys high profile support from the White House, families of victims of some of the nation's most deadly shootings and celebrities like filmmaker and progressive activist Michael Moore. Gun rights advocates such as the National Rifle Association, the nation's most powerful gun lobby, have stridently criticized the proposal. NRA President David Keene characterized the measure as a ""feel-good proposal"" doomed to fail. Moore, whose documentary ""Bowling for Columbine,"" explored the nation's gun violence epidemic, had similarly blunt words about Reid, calling him a ""weenie"" during an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday and suggested viewers send the senator critical e-mails. ""If a man with an assault weapon goes into the school where Harry Reid's grandchildren go to school tomorrow and kills his grandchildren, would he stand in front of that microphone at 5 o'clock and say, 'I know how Dianne (Feinstein), you know, had to witness the mayor getting murdered and my grandchildren just got killed today, but you know, we can't get it passed because we just don't have the votes,' "" Moore said during the interview. Reid has found himself in a delicate position as he tries to navigate the desires of many members of his pro-gun rights Nevada constituency and the White House and members of his caucus' intensified push on gun control. As Senate majority leader, Reid has great influence to speed or slow the consideration of legislation on Capitol Hill. Reid introduces gun violence bill . The nation's top Democrat in Congress has faced scrutiny in recent months for his close ties with the NRA. Reid twice opposed the assault weapons ban, in 1992 and 2004, has a B rating by the NRA for his pro-gun rights voting record and since 2008 has received just shy of $8,450 from several gun lobbies, according to an analysis of campaign contributions from the Center for Responsive Politics. The NRA has also previously supported Reid in his primary races. Reid slipped a provision into the 2010 national health care law that restricts the government from collecting data on gun ownership, as reported by CNN's National Political Correspondent Jim Acosta. ""He's under incredible pressure right now because he's got, as any member of Congress or senator does, he's got his own beliefs. He's got the views and the demands of his constituents on the one hand and the pressure he faces from party leaders and his president on the other,"" Keene told journalists at a Christian Science Monitor-sponsored breakfast in January. ""So where Harry Reid ends up in this debate is anybody's guess and I think that's one of the guessing games that's going on around Washington now."" Call to arms for a 'common sense' gun law . Voters on both sides of the issue are now getting a much clearer picture of where Reid stands and will soon have a better sense of how their own lawmakers measure up, said Richard Feldman, who served as regional political director for the NRA during its rise to power in the 1980s and is president of a gun rights group, the Independent Firearm Owners Association. Allowing Feinstein's assault weapons ban to stand on its own as a separate amendment ""is going to work out to his benefit,"" Feldman said of Reid's choice. ""Having that straight up or down vote will be the most useful vote that gun rights activists and the other side will have to show this is someone who supports you and someone who opposes you."" Obama remains committed to assault weapons ban, White House says . Feldman also suggests keeping an eye on which lawmakers offer amendments to strip out portions of the broader gun control bill and the roll call votes on those amendments as well. In the meantime, some gun control advocates are urging cooler heads as the nation awaits votes on the highly anticipated package of gun-related bills. ""Everybody needs to take a deep breath,"" said Ladd Everitt, a spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence adding that he feels Reid rightly calculated how to get the broader gun control measure the best chance at success. ""I'd rather not fall on my sword,"" Everitt said. ""I'd rather have a smart package so we can get it to the floor."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pulls assault weapons ban from Dem gun control package .

"Seoul (CNN) -- The world knows North Korea for its loud and over-the-top warmongering rhetoric about the U.S. But the true war is being fought in whispers, across secret phone lines and smuggled radios. And it's those whispers that reveal how close the peninsula may be to an actual war. ""North Koreans want to go to war soon and unite the country. They want to get out of their difficult lives through war,"" said Kim Seong Min, with Free North Korea Radio. ""North Koreans are not getting any information from the outside world. They think they will win if a war breaks out."" Kim is a foot soldier in the propaganda war. He hopes to turn North Korea's people against the regime, broadcasting a message of democracy over the radio. He records commentaries and news bulletins that are blasted over a shortwave radio frequency. In his job, he speaks to paid sources who slip him information via Chinese mobile phones at the border. He also has sources within the elite Pyongyang military ranks. Kim says the angry war rhetoric is a product of Kim Jong Un's weak standing as a new leader. ""Kim Jong Un is not even 30 years old and everyone in North Korea knows this. He also doesn't have a solid position within the army. North Koreans are also not sure how to handle the fact that their leader is so young."" That's similar to what defectors are telling the Daily NK, an online news site based in Seoul funded by a U.S. endowment. The Daily NK also has sources within the military elite and the general North Korean population. ""The sources we're hearing from are exhausted with the drills and the mobilization of the masses. Some feel nationalistic pride that comes with the rhetoric out of North Korea. At the same time, they're aware of the stagnant economy on the decline and the real need for change and opening,"" says Daily NK's Gregory Pence. Pence is a Chicago native who came to Seoul as a Fulbright scholar. He stayed to work on the mission of opening up North Korea's human rights abuses to the international community. Pence says opinions at the Daily NK, which is staffed with North Korean defectors, vary. But many at the publication fear that poor decisions can be made in times of fear. What will hold back war, Pence believes, is regime preservation. ""North Korea risks outright annihilation. If a war broke out and escalated, it would cost the peninsula, the world,"" Pence adds. ""In the end, North Korea would not exist. And the leadership is aware of that.""","True war on Korean Peninsula being fought in whispers, secret phone lines and smuggled radios .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Environmental activists and Japanese whaling authorities have reported fresh clashes in Antarctic waters, with each side accusing the other of causing dangerous collisions between ships. The conflicting claims follow harsh words and threats of legal action exchanged between the two sides last week amid activists' attempts to impede the Japanese vessels' annual hunt for whales in the Southern Ocean. The Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) -- which conducts whaling activities under the authority of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries -- accused ships from the environmental group Sea Shepherd of ""sabotage."" During an attempt by the whaling fleet's main ship, the Nisshin Maru, to refuel on Monday, Sea Shepherd vessels ""repeatedly forced their way"" between the Japanese ship and the fuel tanker, ramming into them in the process, the ICR said. It released short videos showing collisions between vessels. Competing accounts . But Sea Shepherd's Australian division countered with a different version of events, saying that the Nisshin Maru had caused the collisions. The group said that a Sea Shepherd ship, the Bob Barker, became ""sandwiched"" between the Nisshin Maru and the fuel tanker after positioning itself to block the refueling. ""In the turbulence of the combined wake, the Bob Barker was slammed back and forth between the Nisshin Maru and the fuel tanker,"" Sea Shepherd said. It also claimed the Nisshin Maru rammed another Sea Shepherd vessel, the Sam Simon, ""causing hull damage along most of the port side of the ship and smashing their satellite communications dome."" No injuries were reported in the clashes, but the Nisshin Maru ""decided to interrupt her refueling procedure due to the extremely dangerous and foolhardy behavior"" of the Sea Shepherd vessels, the ICR said. Crews are still determining to what extent the Nisshin Maru and the refueling ship were damaged, it said. The two sides also traded accusations about the use of water cannon and ropes that snarl up ships' propellers. Sea Shepherd says the fuel tanker's presence in the area is illegal, but the ICR says it is ""essential for the safe navigation"" of its ships, which are carrying out a ""perfectly legal activity."" Legal threats . The Australian government last week called the Japanese activities in the Southern Ocean ""unacceptable"" and vowed to press on with an international legal action to stop the annual whale hunt. Those comments came after reported clashes in which Sea Shepherd vessels blocked a previous refueling attempt. Sea Shepherd said the Japanese ships had intruded into Australian territorial waters and breached international and Australian law. But the ICR says a U.S. court has banned Sea Shepherd from threatening whaling ships' operations or sailing within 500 yards them. It said it will provide ""additional evidence"" to the court about the latest incident. Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand on Tuesday called for ""cool heads"" to prevail in the tense situation in the Southern Ocean, local broadcaster TVNZ reported. Japan annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium, utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. Each year, environmental groups such as Sea Shepherd face off with Japan's hunters in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships, the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki in Tokyo, and Neda Farshbaf in Atlanta contributed to this report.","The two sides trade accusations over who caused ships to collide .

"(CNN) -- Two men have pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges tied to the shooting death of a Chicago teenage girl, who days before had performed at a Washington brunch in the run-up to President Barack Obama's inauguration. Kenneth Williams, 20, and Michael Ward, 18, have been in custody since last month, when a judge ordered that they be held without bond after their first court appearance. On Thursday, they formally pleaded not guilty to a host of charges, the Cook County State Attorney's Office said. The two young men are accused of killing 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton on January 29. Police: Killing was case of mistaken identity . Police said Ward and Williams were gang members seeking revenge against the people who had shot Williams in July, men against whom Williams had refused to press charges when police arrested them. He and Ward thought they had spotted members of a rival gang at the park when police said Ward sneaked up on Hadiya and her friends and began shooting. Williams was the getaway driver, Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy has said. Ward later confessed to shooting Hadiya and two others in a case of mistaken identity, according to McCarthy. He is charged with 141 counts of murder, 10 counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, eight counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and one count of mob action, according to the Cook County State Attorney's Office. Opinion: Chicago's violence took my dad, friends . Williams, meanwhile, faces 17 counts of murder, 10 counts of aggravated discharge of a firearm, two counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery with a firearm and one count of mob action. The Cook County State Attorney's Office did not return calls from CNN on Friday, seeking an explanation as to why the two men face so many murder charges even though only one person was killed. The Chicago Tribune, citing interviews with legal experts and former prosecutors, said it is not uncommon in Illinois for prosecutors to press a large number of charges -- with the understanding that, as the investigation evolves, many of the charges might be dropped. The newspaper pointed out that William Balfour at one point faced 53 murder charges in the 2008 deaths of three of actress/singer Jennifer Hudson's relatives. He was convicted last May on three counts of first-degree murder. Nurses dodge bullets to provide care in Chicago . Whatever the rationale, Ward's lawyer Jeffrey Granich slammed the 141 murder charges against his client as ""extreme."" He said that, in his 20 years as a practicing lawyer, he's never seen that many murder charges related to the death of a single person. ""What the prosecutors are trying to do ..., because this is a politically charged case and a case that has gotten a lot of media attention, is to show off how seriously they are taking this case,"" Granich speculated. ""Unfortunately, with this indictment, they show not that they are serious, but that they are being absurd."" The case helped shine attention on the high murder rate of late in Chicago. It also became intertwined with the national debate over gun violence, with Obama referring to Hadiya's life and death in his latest State of the Union address as her parents looked on.","Kenneth Williams and Michael Ward are accused of killing Hadiya Pendleton, 15 .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was re-elected chairman of his Justice and Development Party, or AKP, at a boisterous party rally Sunday attended by throngs of supporters as well as foreign leaders. At the AKP party congress, Erdogan once again sought to cement the role of the AKP not only as a party that has reshaped Turkish politics but also as a role model for regional democratic Islamist movements in the wake of the Arab Spring. In a two-and-a-half-hour speech, delivered in front of an adoring crowd of party delegates, Erdogan detailed his party's achievements after nearly a decade in power, while also laying out a road map for what his role could be in the future. ""We have shown, both at home and abroad, that a country with a Muslim population can have a thriving and advanced democracy,"" said Erdogan, who called the AKP a ""conservative democratic party."" ""This understating that we have put forth has gone beyond our borders and has practically become an example to all Muslim countries,"" he announced to an audience that included Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy as well as Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan regional government in Iraq. Few answers in Syria . Erdogan, who won his party's chairmanship for the third time on Sunday with 1,421 votes, has reached the AKP's term limit. What his role will be after that has been the source of much debate in Turkey. Erdogan told delegates that he will continue to serve and that, ""This is not a goodbye but a pause in the notes of a song."" ""One of the most important aspects of the convention was the message that the prime minister is not going anywhere,"" Suat Kiniklioglu, a former AKP parliamentarian and director of the Strategic Communication Center based in Ankara, wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""Instead he will try to become a president who can maintain his party affiliation, or will try to change the system into a presidential or semi-presidential system,"" he wrote. Kurdish conflict escalating, report says . Turkish critics regularly accuse Erdogan of authoritarian tendencies, citing the arrests of scores of journalists and hundreds of political rivals in recent years. Some commentators have warned that a presidential system could weaken democracy in Turkey. ""This was mainly about consolidating his own power and thickening the cement on which his party stands on,"" Yavuz Baydar, a columnist for the newspaper Today's Zaman, said in an interview with CNN. ""He does not take for granted that he needs a broader base to become a fully empowered president. Either he will seek a more reformist base or he will go more conservative, omitting 'democrat' from 'conservative democrat,' "" said Baydar. Refugees languish in squalor at Turkish border . The AKP's internal constitution was amended during the party congress to allow parliamentarians who have already served three terms -- such as Erdogan -- to be re-elected after sitting out an election cycle. The party congress also led to the appointment of a slew of new names to the central coordination committee of the AKP. Some political analysts said the choice of appointees signaled Erdogan appeared to be making overtures to the conservative side of the political spectrum, ahead of municipal elections next October. However, one notable change included the removal of Erdogan's interior minister from one of the AKP's top leadership councils. Interior Minister Idris Naim Sahin's hawkish stance towards Turkey's long-simmering Kurdish conflict has sparked controversy both within the AKP and throughout Turkey. ""As of today, we want to turn to a blank page and write in it with our Kurdish brothers. We want to protect that page from terror and make it a new page of peace and brotherhood,"" said Erdogan. His remarks echoed themes of previous speeches, when Erdogan's government launched a series of reforms aimed at relaxing cultural restrictions on Kurds in Turkey. As part of what was described as the ""democratic opening,"" the Turkish state established a Kurdish-language TV channel for the first time and eased bans on Kurdish language education in schools. But the peace overtures have failed to bring an end to an insurgency that has claimed the lives of more than 30,000 people over the last three decades. Over the last year, violence has spiked in predominantly Kurdish southeastern Turkey to deadly levels unseen in more than a decade. After winning numerous elections since his party first swept to power in 2002, Erdogan appears to have a popular mandate under Turkey's constitution, which was written by a military junta in the 1980s. A new constitution could conceivably expand rights for Turkey's restive Kurdish minority. But that process has stalled amid disagreements with opposition political parties, who accuse the AKP of trying to rewrite the constitution unilaterally.

"(CNN) -- A Border Patrol agent was shot and killed Tuesday, while another was wounded near Naco, Arizona, authorities said. The agents fell under fire after responding to a sensor that had gone off near the border, according to a statement from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The agent killed was identified as 30-year-old Nicholas Ivie. A native of Provo, Utah, he joined the Border Patrol in January 2008. Ivie is survived by a wife and two children. The agent who was wounded was not identified. After the shooting, he was airlifted to an area hospital and was reported to be in stable condition. His injuries were not life-threatening. ""Agent Ivie died in the line of duty, protecting our nation against those who threaten our way of life. His death only strengthens our resolve to enforce the rule of law and bring those responsible to justice,"" Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar said in a statement. The FBI is conducting a joint investigation with the Cochise County Sheriff's Office. James Turgal, special agent in charge of the FBI for the Phoenix division, declined to say whether the agents involved in the incident returned fire. He also declined to comment on whether any weapons had been found. Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, said investigators are at the scene. ""Every time that a law enforcement person is either killed or shot or injured in the line of duty, we have to take a moment and think of our families and think of the heroes involved,"" Breuer said. Agent Ivie is the 14th killed in the line of duty since 2008, including three this year. He was killed near a border station recently named for Brian Terry, whose 2010 death led to the public disclosure of the botched Fast and Furious gun-smuggling sting, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa. ""There's no way to know at this point how the agent was killed, but because of Operation Fast and Furious, we'll wonder for years if the guns used in any killing along the border were part of an ill-advised gunwalking strategy sanctioned by the federal government. It's a sad commentary,"" the Republican senator said. Turgal declined to comment on whether there could be a possible Fast and Furious connection to Tuesday's killing.

"(CNN) -- A display board at an Alabama airport crashed down Friday, killing a child underneath and leaving at least one other person in critical condition, hospital and airport officials said. The large digital sign -- showing when and where flights were arriving to and departing -- collapsed around 1:30 p.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) inside Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, airport spokeswoman Toni Herrera-Bast said. It fell on multiple people who were transported to area hospitals. One of them, Luke Bressette, died from his injuries, said Justin Cohen with Children's of Alabama. The boy's age was not immediately known, but officials described him as a child. At least one person is in critical condition at UAB Hospital, hospital spokeswoman Megan Davis said. Larry Snyder was riding up the escalator when he saw the display board fall, telling CNN affiliate WIAT that one family was especially affected. ""The family was crushed, little kids crushed underneath the sign. And everybody was scattering to lift it up,"" Snyder said, adding that he was among those who helped. Video footage showed people sweeping up the area and a cut-out spot on a wall with protruding wires. As of early Friday evening, authorities didn't know why the board fell, according to Herrera-Bast. The incident happened in a new part of the airport, in a public area before security checkpoints. According to CNN affiliate WVTM, the area opened up March 13 and includes a covered parking deck, children's play area, eating establishments, a new baggage system and other features.

"(CNN) -- For award-winning Nigerian film director Obi Emelonye, the London premiere of ""Last flight to Abuja"" in early June was supposed to be a celebratory event, a marquee moment introducing his suspense-filled airplane disaster thriller to the rest of the world with pomp and grandeur. But then June 3rd happened. On that fateful Sunday, the Dana Air Flight 992 from the Nigerian capital of Abuja crashed into a densely populated neighborhood in Lagos, killing all 153 people aboard as well as at least 10 people on the ground. The tragic news left Emelonye, whose high-octane action movie is based on a series of fatal air crashes that stunned Nigeria in 2006, in a state of shock. ""The coincidences and the timing of it was scary,"" he says. ""This was five days to the London premiere that we've been building up to -- my first reaction was to cancel the premiere."" Read related: Nigerians demand answers in wake of Dana Air crash . But after consulting his team, Nigerian officials and some of the families of the bereaved, Emelonye was convinced to go ahead with the original plan, using the movie to spotlight aviation safety in Nigeria. ""They said 'no, this might end up being one of the longest lasting legacies to the lives of these people that were lost so needlessly in those crashes,'"" he remembers. ""This film was supposed to flag some of those issues that have now taken their lives, so it's in their interest that this story goes out there -- if for nothing, to put the issue of aviation safety squarely in the public agenda so that we don't forget."" Five days later, in an emotional event attended by hundreds of people, Emelonye made sure the premiere was dedicated to the Dana Air crash victims -- attendees observed one minute of silence while the film's end credits were replaced by the names of those who lost their lives on that ill-fated flight. Emelonye says that ""Last Flight to Abuja,"" written in 2007 and shot in November last year, has now become a campaign film, raising attention for safer flying in Nigeria and the rest of the continent. ""The film has taken on added significance way beyond my planning,"" he explains. ""It has become an advocacy ... for aviation safety, not just in Nigeria but for the whole of Africa, and it's a responsibility I take very seriously."" Read related: 'Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world . As a result, Emelonye says that some of the profits of the film will be donated to a fund dedicated to helping the families of the air crash victims. ""We're trying to give back financially because we feel whatever profits from this film should go to, in some way, to continue the campaign for safer skies,"" he says. ""In the absence of social security, there are people in dire hardship from that accident and we'll contribute something and kind of compel our partners to contribute also."" At just 30 years old, Emelonye is one of the rising stars of Nigeria's booming movie-making industry, known as Nollywood. Passionate and self-taught, he left behind a career in law to follow his dream of becoming a filmmaker. He achieved critical and commercial acclaim last year with ""The Mirror Boy,"" a fantasy/adventure film released all across the African continent and the UK. Read related: Veteran director reveals secrets of Nollywood's success . And now he is aiming for further success with ""Last Flight to Abuja,"" a big-budget production starring many of Nollywood's biggest names. The 81-minute long film has already become a box office hit in Nigeria and is shown in screens across West Africa and in London. Emelonye says he hopes the movie, along with promoting civil aviation safety in Nigeria, will open up his country's burgeoning film industry to a wider audience, dismissing the low-quality tag that's often attached to Nollywood productions. ""We have a film that has pushed the boundaries with Nollywood and introduced a new genre in Nollywood filmmaking,"" he says. Emelonye says Nollywood films are growing in popularity because they offer audiences a narrative they can connect to. ""There's something I call the quintessential African voice, which has kind of given Nollywood, in spite of its qualitative problems, international attention -- it's watched across Africa, it's watched across the world, even though they're shot on very low quality cameras, very simplistic stories, they have a common connection with people that is great.""","Obi Emelonye is the director of Nollywood's latest hit, ""Last flight to Abuja""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A court in Pakistan reissued an arrest warrant Saturday for former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf in connection with the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, a public prosecutor told CNN. Prosecutors claim that an investigation shows Musharraf was responsible for not providing adequate protection for Bhutto and has not responded to a prosecutor's request to answer questions, prompting the court-ordered arrest warrant. Authorities were unable to serve an arrest warrant issued last week because Musharraf is not in Pakistan, prosecutor Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali told CNN. Ali said the court ordered authorities to serve the new warrant at all of Musharraf's residences, including those abroad. Musharraf is currently living in self-imposed exile in London. Ali said the court was adjourned until March 5. Bhutto, who spent many years in exile, was assassinated in 2007 as she campaigned against Musharraf for the presidency. Some have accused Musharraf of being involved in the assassination, but Musharraf denies any involvement. Late last year, Pakistani authorities arrested two police officials in the case. A United Nations panel looking into Bhutto's assassination concluded that Pakistan's former military-led government failed to adequately protect her and that intelligence agencies hindered the subsequent investigation. The panel's scathing report in April 2010 said the suicide bombing that killed Bhutto ""could have been prevented"" and that police deliberately failed to pursue an effective investigation into the killings. But Musharraf's government has said Bhutto had been afforded adequate protection. Musharraf's legal adviser told CNN that Musharraf has not appeared before the court because the accusations against him are baseless and politically motivated. ""This is political victimization against Musharraf,"" Muhammad Ali Saif said. ""Musharraf was never contacted by investigators to get his version of the assassination."" Musharraf went to London after resigning in 2008. He decided to start a political party last year and make a comeback. He has said he wants to return for a presidential run in 2013 because he sees suffering in Pakistan and doesn't see a political party offering a solution. Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Prosecutors say Pervez Musharraf didn't adequately protect Benazir Bhutto, assassinated in 2007 .

"(CNN) -- The concepts of emotional intelligence (EI), self-worth, authenticity and employee meditation rooms might conjure up thoughts of new age healing centers. But the benefits of tapping employees' emotional happiness mean the ideas are now being picked up by mainstream corporations. Brochner Hotels, one of Copenhagen' s oldest and most successful boutique hotel chains, is one business discovering the benefits of EI. Karim Nielsen, the chain's CEO, says he introduced the strategy to shift the company's culture. Nielsen points to a reluctance, at times, of staff members to engage with customers, to sell its products and promote the brand. ""The front desk is like a stop sign they don't go beyond,"" he says. Now, Nielsen is sending all hotel employees through EI training to help them become more open and confident, understand their own limitations and fears, and to boost their self-worth and comfort in dealing with other people. Attendees get a full EI profile of themselves, which helps break down how they relate to others, their level of empathy, authenticity, and leadership abilities. This information is used to improve their communication with others. The classes also, typically, include meditation or visualization practices. Nielsen uses it to ""empower [employees] and make them more of the great people they already are."" He adds, ""it gives us a very open, expressive work environment, where people are not afraid to speak up and where everyone [is] bringing solutions to the table."" Dan Iversen, managing director of Behavior Change Specialist, which has trained around 7,000 business leaders across Europe, helped customize the Brochner hotels training programs. ""We teach people how to actively and intelligently use their feelings in the development of individuals and teams,"" Iversen says. But do feelings really have a place in business? Yes, Iversen says. ""From kids we're taught to disregard our feelings, to stop crying when we fall, and to sit still and be quiet. But feelings exist. We accept that and we work with that. It sounds simple but for most people this takes training."" He adds, ""what often limit us are our own attitudes and beliefs, and that's where EI can be really powerful. You can't be a good salesperson if you're convinced you're not."" At Denmark's division of Saint-Gobain, a Fortune 500 company and worldwide leader in construction markets, BCS was asked to help improve cooperation and team work. ""It was a bit like a schoolyard sometimes,' says procurement director Jan Warrer. ""People would have disagreements, not take responsibility and not know how to resolve things. But, we now have a far better atmosphere, we communicate openly, we deal with problems as they come up, and we move forward."" He adds, ""if someone feels bad about a decision I make, I stop and think about that. You can't argue with somebody's feelings. In business we talk so much about key numbers and economic models, but the best solutions are often made when we reflect and cooperate."" Sven Kristensen, CEO of Wuerth Denmark, a multi-national wholesale organization says EI is so important that they've built the BCS training into their leadership programme. ""Just think about the last big decision you made. How much of it was based in emotion and how much was based in intellect? Most all big decisions are based in both."" The research into EI was pioneered by John Mayer, professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire, together with Dr. Peter Salovey. He defines it as ""the capacity to reason about emotional information and the capacity of emotional information to enhance thinking."" Historically, placing weight on emotions has been dismissed. ""What's remarkable is that for so many years, people didn't see emotions as conveying important messages,"" he says. ""For much of the 19th and 20th century there was a constant emphasis on the cognitive. Emotions were seen as irrational and as interfering with the logical. But EI is key to relationships and provides an adaptive advantage and smooth social abilities,"" he adds. Iversen says it can be implemented in the workforce by using feelings actively in personal and team development, strengthening the self worth in individuals and teams by acknowledging what people do, and to constructing a ""no bull-shit"" culture for dealing with conflict. At Brochner Hotels, Nielsen says that's exactly what they do. ""It's okay to tell someone you're having a bad day, or an issue with something they did. And, as a leader, it's important to show people who you really are, to be yourself. You get a whole different kind of leader that way. All those things that are typically taboo, they are not taboo here."" And as EI gains ground, those taboos may begin to drop elsewhere too. Mayer has noticed a sea change in acceptance of EI in recent years. ""When I was a kid people talked a lot about your intelligence as something cognitive, but I think that in the future EI will become a second measure of intelligence."" Still, he says, EI is no substitute for standard intelligence. ""I usually make the case that as long as my engineers can build a bridge that won't fall down, I don't care if they're emotionally intelligent.""","Emotional intelligence (EI) training is being picked up by mainstream corporations .

"(CNN) -- The angry Frenchman came upon an audacious solution when he couldn't fly business class, a plan worthy of ""Catch Me If You Can."" Told the section was full, Philippe Jeannard just went into the cockpit and pretended to be crew, even dressing the part, police allege. Unlike Leonardo DiCaprio in the film based on the true story of a successful con artist posing as a pilot, Jeannard was caught right away at Philadelphia International Airport and is now being held on $1 million bail, Philadelphia police said Friday. The 61-year-old later remarked that he ""hated Americans,"" said police, who are still ascertaining his exact motive. Jeannard, who is from La Rochelle, on the west coast of France, is a retired winemaker who was on a layover from France and was changing planes to his final destination in West Palm Beach, Florida, said Philadelphia Inspector Joseph Sullivan. There's no indication that Jeannard was drunk, but he appeared to have had some drinks, Sullivan said. Police arrested the man on charges of trespassing, impersonating a public servant and lying to police, Inspector Joseph Sullivan said. The FBI is also investigating, a spokesman said Friday. The incident occurred on a US Airways flight, Philadelphia police say. US Airways declined to comment, citing the FBI investigation, spokesman Andrew Christie said. Jeannard boarded the plane Wednesday evening wearing a white button-down shirt with an Air France logo over the pocket and a black jacket with four gold stripes on the epaulets, akin to one worn by pilots, police said. He also was carrying a bad fake of an Air France crew badge and a fake crew identification card, according to police and Air France spokesman Cedric Leurquin. Before he boarded the US Airways flight, Jeannard had a disagreement with airline personnel who could not accommodate his request to be upgraded to business class, police said. Police believe he sauntered into the cockpit while passengers were boarding the plane. The pilot's door is usually open at that time, police said. A flight attendant conducting a routine head count entered the cockpit and saw the man sitting in the jump seat behind the captain's seat. He identified himself as an Air France pilot. At least two pilots were doing preflight checks on the Airbus when the man entered the cockpit, Sullivan said. ""He identified himself as a pilot and started to sit in the jump seat. But he immediately had a problem getting strapped in and it was obvious to the real pilots that he couldn't be a pilot,"" Sullivan told CNN. ""He didn't know what he was doing."" The flight crew told him he would have to fill out paperwork, but the man didn't have credentials, police said. The captain then told him to leave the area, and the man became irate, police said. Unable to calm him down, the flight crew escorted him off the plane, police said. An airline agent tried to rebook him on another flight while U.S. Airways corporate security was notified, police said. When corporate security realized they had a possible crime on their hands, the man had left the terminal for his rebooked flight, police said. Corporate security contacted Philadelphia police, who found and arrested the man at his new terminal, Sullivan said. The original U.S. Airways flight departed. Was the act a fit of pique or a prank? Police say they don't know whether the suspect was simply a prankster trying to mimic Frank W. Abagnale Jr. or he had other motives. (Abagnale -- who infamously eluded authorities for years in the 1960s while posing as, among other things, an airline pilot, a doctor and an attorney -- was the inspiration for the 2002 film ""Catch Me If You Can,"" starring DiCaprio and Tom Hanks). 'Who did you say you were again?' On-screen imposters . Despite the man's comment to police that he hates Americans, a federal law enforcement official said that investigators so far have not found any link to terrorism. Air France confirmed that none of its employees had tried to board the Charlotte-bound flight. Jeannard wasn't wearing the airline's official uniform and badge. The Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Security Administration wouldn't discuss the case and referred calls to the FBI.

"(CNN) -- Beginning this week, under-12s are banned from the first seven rows of economy class on AirAsia X flights to China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Australia and Nepal. In an official press release, AirAsia X's CEO Azran Osman-Rani described the new rollout as a ""heavenly package for those who want peace of mind."" Not to mention peace of ear. Readers take aim at kids on a plane . Passengers booked on AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of AirAsia, can now opt for the seats for an additional cost of RM 35 (U.S. $11) or RM 110 (U.S. $35.50) -- the standard fee charged for picking specific seats in economy class and in the ""hot seats"" section, which provide more leg room. The child-free area, called the ""Quiet Zone,"" has softer lighting and is sectioned off from the rest of the plane by toilets and bulkheads, the theory being you won't be able to hear the kids who are toward the back of the plane. Still, anyone who's been within 100 meters of a screaming child will know that their cries won't be stifled by a few partition curtains. Just as cigarette smoke could waft into the non-smoking areas before it was banned, so too will noise, said George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, speaking to NBC news when AirAsia X's new option was announced last year. ""If you were just one row away from the smoking section, you still got the smoke,"" he said. ""And you'll still hear the screams ... if a child has strong lungs."" Osman-Rani was eager to note that kids aren't actually being banned from traveling and that the new offering was about customizing preferences and ""fair choice,"" pointing out that the flights will be adding three baby bassinets to the other two economy cabin sections. AirAsia's competitor, Malaysia Airlines, started flying last year year with child-free first class cabins as well as a child-free upper deck economy section on its A380 service.

"(CNN) -- An Australian radio DJ whose prank targeting Prince William's pregnant wife led to the suicide of a nurse has been voted the best DJ in the land by his employer. Michael Christian, along with Mel Greig, were suspended after the December 2012 prank in which they called a nurse at King Edward VII's Hospital pretending to be Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles to gain information about the condition of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. After the pair played the prank on air, the nurse who transferred the call through to the ward, Jacintha Saldanha, committed suicide. Aussie DJ scandal: Does radio share the blame?

Christian was the joint winner. A trip to Los Angeles awaits. ""From the start I felt like I had something to prove to myself,"" he said in a statement. ""That regardless of all that's happened in the past few months I'm still at the top of my game."" Australia's Communications Minister Stephen Conroy said it was too soon for Christian to be honored this way. ""I think there's a bit of bad taste involved there,"" Conroy told news radio station, 3AW. ""There was some very serious consequences of what was a prank and to be seen to be rewarding people so soon after such an event, I think is just in bad taste,"" he said. 'Truly appalling' After the prank caused an international uproar, the two DJs were taken off the air. Southern Cross Austereo suspended all prank calls, pulled advertising and ordered a comprehensive review of relevant policies and process. Greig and Christian apologized in interviews with the Australian TV shows ""A Current Affair"" and ""Today Tonight."" ""There is nothing that can make me feel worse than what I feel right now,"" Greig said on ""Today Tonight."" Nurse death sparks outrage, casts glare on 'shock jocks' Christian told ""A Current Affair"" the prank had become ""a tragic turn of events that I don't think anyone could have predicted or expected."" The chairman of the hospital where the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge was a patient slammed the Australian radio station's decision to broadcast the recorded prank call as ""truly appalling."" ""The immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill-considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients,"" wrote the chairman, Simon Glenarthur. ""The longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is, frankly, tragic beyond words."" 'World's worst accents ever' Audio of the call posted online suggests a woman spoke briefly to the DJs before she put the call through to the ward where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for acute morning sickness. ""They were the world's worst accents ever,"" Greig told listeners then. ""We were sure 100 people at least before us would've tried the same thing. ... We were expecting to be hung up on. We didn't even know what to say when we got through."" Off the air, Greig and Christian tweeted about the practical joke, promising ""more on the #royalprank."" The pair's Twitter accounts were later taken down. A St. James's Palace spokesman said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were saddened to learn of Saldanha's death. Another palace spokesman told CNN that ""at no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident. On the contrary, we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times."" Greig remains off the air. Christian resumed DJ duties in February.","He is the co-winner of a contest conducted by his radio network .

"London (CNN) -- His fur is worn in places, his nose is rather threadbare and he's a little saggy round the middle. But staff at Bristol Airport in the west of England believe the elderly teddy bear left in the departure lounge more than a year ago, along with a photograph dated 1918, must have a loving family somewhere. The picture, produced as a postcard from the studio of Dura Ltd., shows a teddy with two small children in light dresses. The older one, her hair tied in ribbons, has her arm around the bear. On the back is written: ""With dearest love and kisses to our darling Daddie from your loving little daughter & Sonnie. Dora & Glyn."" Also written is: ""Taken on baby's birthday March 4 1918, one year and 5 months old."" Airport staff were initially hopeful that the bear would be reclaimed, but so far no one has come forward. Efforts by airport staff and police to trace its owners have also proved fruitless -- so now the airport is hoping the general public can lend a hand in solving the mystery. ""It is obvious the bear has been well loved for many years,"" said Jacqui Mills, a spokeswoman for Bristol Airport. ""During the last 14 months we had been hopeful that the search would result in him being reunited to his family. We have not been successful in this search and have drawn a blank."" Since the case was publicized, history and teddy bear experts from as far afield as the United States and Canada have been in touch via e-mail to offer help in finding information, she said. Some antique experts believe the teddy is a British-made Farnell Bear from the early 1900s. Others believe it could be either French or German. Anyone with information that might help find the bear's owners should contact: yourairport@bristolairport.com.","The bear was left in the departure lounge of Bristol Airport over a year ago .

"(CNN) -- ""At the end of six seasons, six beautiful seasons, it's like high school -- time to graduate and go to college,"" Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino told CNN as he and his cast mates bid farewell to their MTV hit ""Jersey Shore"" at the New York Television Festival. And just like after high school, it's time for the ""Jersey Shore"" cast to really get to work, just like the reality TV stars who came before them. The ""Jersey Shore"" cast members are all expanding their empires while also giving back to the community that made them famous, via a planned one-hour fund-raiser to rebuild the actual Jersey Shore, which was devastated along with other areas on the East Coast during Hurricane Sandy. ""Restore the Shore"" will be broadcast live from Times Square on Thursday, November 15, at 11 p.m. ET and tape-delayed on the West Coast. Unlike the graduates of ""American Idol,"" ""Project Runway,"" or even ""The Hills,"" the self-proclaimed guidos of the ""Jersey Shore"" represent a region. Love them or hate them (or love to hate them), the TV special may bolster their reputations (not to mention their brands) when they might have been criticized for leaving the area a little worse for wear. ""I think of everyone in the celebrity world, we get bullied the most,"" said Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi. ""People are just mean to us. Yes, I got drunk, I blacked out, I got arrested, but that's what happens to everybody. They just don't have a camera following them."" The final episode of ""Jersey Shore"" airs December 13, and with the end in sight, the cast are thinking about what to do when the party's over, spinoffs notwithstanding. Sammi Giancola is going back to college to finish her sociology degree. Ruthie Alcaide from season eight of ""The Real World,"" who became a spokesperson for alcohol awareness, might provide a role model for Sorrentino, whose own situation also involved a stint in rehab. He doesn't think his hard-won sobriety had anything to do with the show coming to an end, but now that he's famous, he can't see himself falling back on his former career as a mortgage broker. ""I can't be 'the Situation' forever,"" he acknowledged, adding that he hopes to milk it for a little while longer (at least until the next TV gig comes along). He's also written a comic book using his ""Jersey Shore"" persona as a superhero: ""By day he is Mike, almost like Clark Kent, and by night, he is 'the Situation,' who has the power of persuasion with females and gets that power from a tanning bed."" Sorrentino also hopes to make other endorsement and branding deals, pending an unresolved suit from Viacom over copyright of phrases that originated on the show. The highest-earning member of the ""Jersey Shore"" cast, Paul ""Pauly D"" DelVecchio, who banked a reported $11 million last year, knows he can't rely on his reality-TV fame. The DJ signed with 50 Cent's record label and is coproducing an album with the rap mogul. (He's also partnered with 50 to put out a line of headphones and will DJ Britney Spears' wedding). ""I'm actually applying for unemployment now that the show's ending,"" he joked. ""But I hear they pay you less now, so that's not going to work."" Already a queen of branding, Polizzi has more deals for her own fashion and beauty lines than the rest of the cast: indoor and sunless tanning, slippers, sunglasses, perfume, jewelry and a maternity line on the way. But this isn't enough, she said, so she's also getting into the music business, because the brands are not her long game. ""My parents, they're just trying to get everything out of this moment, and they want to have a family business, so we started Team Snooki Music,"" she said. ""We're just trying to make a living so my kids can go to college, and they don't have to worry about anything. You have to plan."" Polizzi also hopes to get back on the air via her own TV talk show, ""like a 'Chelsea Handler'-type show,"" she told CNN, ""late at night, when I can talk about anything, because I have no filter."" Her BFF Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley is less ambitious, setting her sights on a television career behind the scenes as a producer. While she plans to continue selling brands such as her tanning line, Farley said she wants to actually ""create something."" ""I would love to do a fun makeover show with young women and men to up their confidence,"" she said, ""and then do a show about bullying, really break down the barriers and help change the laws behind them, because it's behind the times."" Farley might actually have a shot at launching one of these shows at MTV, she noted, because she's been shadowing the network's producers and executives just as much as they've been watching her these past six seasons. ""I could go to MTV and be like, 'Hey, do you know me? I'm kind of on one of your shows, and I have an idea...'"" The strategy's also in line with the network's spinoff habit, such as how ""Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County"" led to ""The Hills"" which led to ""The City"" which led to ""Audrina"" on sister network VH1. Deena Cortese doesn't think her previous career as a dental assistant is in the cards anymore, because the show has tainted her reputation, not improved it. ""Be honest,"" she said. ""Would anybody trust me doing that anymore? Probably not."" But she thinks she has another fallback position in the real world: starting her own beauty salon. As they prepare to say goodbye to the perks of being (temporarily) famous -- ""I'm going to miss getting courtside seats to the Knicks games!"" Pauly D said -- they always have the inevitable reunion show to look forward to, because, as show creator SallyAnn Salsano said, we've never seen the real ""Jersey Shore."" ""What really happened in that house, no one knows,"" she said. ""You guys got the PG-version."" Could the fund-raiser special change the cast members' reputations? Will it help them succeed at their goals? It's too soon to tell, but at least it shows a new side of people who were about to be typecast forever.","The cast members of ""Jersey Shore"" are expanding their empires beyond the program .

"(CNN) -- He was born Roger Kynard Erickson in 1947 in Dallas, but his fans know him as Roky (pronounced Rocky). For a career that spans nearly half a century, Erickson has spent little time actually performing, but he still has a loyal following and is on tour again. Music, he says, has been a lifelong part of him. He learned to play piano as a child, taught himself acoustic guitar at 12 and then learned the electric guitar. ""It was just something that I would also look forward to,"" he says. "" If I could, I would get out of school, then I would go home and play the guitar."" In an interview posted on YouTube, part of a documentary, Erickson says he listened to the radio a lot, which inspired him to be a rock 'n' roll star. He rose to the occasion as a teenager, when he dropped out of 11th grade and soon wrote his most famous composition ""You're Gonna Miss Me,"" which he first recorded with a band called the Spades. Baseball champ and domestic abuse survivor . He says his influences include Little Richard, Bob Dylan, James Brown and the Beatles, but he is credited with influencing other groups as well, many of which describe him as a psychedelic rock icon. ""In 1990, a tribute album had R.E.M, the Butthole Surfers and the Jesus and Mary Chain performing Erickson's songs,"" the Chicago Tribune wrote in 2006. ""In the film (a documentary) ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons sounds like he's still in awe of Erickson and the Elevators, with whom he shared stages several times in the '60s,"" the article says, referring to Erickson's band, the 13th Floor Elevators. With the Elevators, Erickson recorded ""You're Gonna Miss Me"" again, which landed him on the pop charts in 1966. He went on to become an influential singer and songwriter during the psychedelic rock era of the 1960s. He also had an affinity for marijuana and LSD. In 1969, he was arrested for possession of a joint. He pleaded insanity, hoping that being in a mental institution would be better than going to prison, although it only cut his confinement from four years to three. While he was institutionalized, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and underwent various treatments including shock therapy. After his release, his career was never the same. What followed was many difficult years of battling mental illness, often untreated. The problems that kept Erickson from success in music also took a toll on his family life, leading to a separation from his wife and son. His life began to turn around when his brother took over guardianship for him in 2001. ""From June 2001 until July 2002, Roky lived with his brother in Pittsburgh, where he finally began to receive the treatment and care he needs,"" according to his website. From cancer survivor to cancer doctor . In 2005, Erickson emerged at SXSW in Austin, Texas, and began performing again. In recent years, he has found his way back to touring with the help of his son, Jegar. Jegar Erickson says he may never know his dad as a father, ""but if I have a chance to help a man get to a better place, I'm in."" ""I've been working with him for about five years now,"" Jegar Erickson said of his father last fall. ""He's amazing. ... It doesn't even matter what kind of day he's had. I mean he could have had like everything go wrong and then he walks on that stage and it's like a switch. ""It just turns on and it's magic and you feed off of it and anyone who gets a chance to be around him, it's truly incredible,"" the younger Erickson said. ""There (are) no words to describe what it's like to have the chance to play on a stage with him or to understand what it's like to approach music the way that he approaches it."" He says playing alongside his father ""teaches me so much,"" and that no matter how bad things get for the elder Erickson, ""he's still positive.""

"(CNN) -- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration offices across the nation may soon have more cloudy days as the forced government spending cuts cause the agency to ask thousands of employees to take unpaid days off. Proposed four-day furloughs would affect nearly 12,000 people, which includes workers at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, from July 1 to September 30, in time for what is expected to be an active hurricane season. NOAA oversees the National Weather Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the National Hurricane Center and other offices that provide forecasts, severe weather alerts and other important information to the public. With fiscal uncertainty and tight budgets hitting government agencies, NOAA had to make tough choices, said the agency's director of communications. NOAA was forced to reduce its fiscal year 2013 budget by 7%. ""Unfortunately, after much serious deliberation, in order to help address current budget shortfalls, we are moving forward ... to implement furloughs across the agency ... unfortunately, furloughs are necessary to help close the gaps,"" Ciaran Clayton said. This news comes on top of a NOAA hiring freeze that went into effect in March. A Republican senator bemoaned the spending cuts, which also took effect in March. ""Sen. (Marco) Rubio has always said that the sequester was dumb, in part because it does not prioritize core public safety functions,"" said his press secretary, Alex Conant. Richard Hirn, an attorney for the union that represents NOAA employees, believes the furloughs will harm employees and only bring ""minimal savings."" ""NOAA's plans to furlough operational employees at the National Weather Service as we enter the severe storm, flood and hurricane season is unnecessary and places the public at great risk,"" said Hirn, general counsel for the National Weather Service Employees Organization. Forecasters at Colorado State University have predicted an above-average 2013 Atlantic hurricane season with 18 tropical storms, nine of which are expected to become hurricanes. NOAA's hurricane hunters, who bear the responsibility of flying into storms and taking crucial data, will still fly this season, although civilian flight crew members will alternately be furloughed. A primary concern raised by some employees affected by the furloughs are the unexpected events that pop up with little to no warning. ""It is not an average job; you can't tell a tornado to wait 10 minutes because you are doing something else,"" said Daniel Sobien, president of NWSEO. States like Florida are assessing the effect of federal forced spending cuts on their ability to prepare for upcoming weather events. ""Gov. (Rick) Scott will provide a full update to local emergency personnel at the governor's hurricane conference in Fort Lauderdale next week,"" said Frank Collins, a spokesman for the governor. NOAA administrators said the impact on public services will be ""minimized,"" and if a major weather event requires more staff, furloughs would be canceled. But the union has its doubts. Sobien said that it would be impossible to fill every shift because 10% of NOAA's positions are vacant and the number is forecasters is down significantly. Where once there were 10 forecasters per office, now many operate with four or five, he said. The designated furlough dates are July 5, July 19, August 5 and August 30.","NOAA has had to reduce its budget by 7% this fiscal year .

"(CNN) -- At his version of an ICU unit, Jaret Daniels pays extraordinary attention to his young charges. Each of the creatures is kept in its own plastic cup, isolated to prevent the spread of disease. Not just any food will do. In their climate-controlled environment, the Schaus swallowtail caterpillars munch voraciously on wild lime. Daniels, an entomologist at the University of Florida, is raising seven immature butterflies belonging to a species that is critically endangered and just ""hanging on."" The pressure, Daniels said, is enough to keep him up at night. He and others are trying to save an insect that is on the brink of extinction and in need of human intervention. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued an emergency directive in 2012 to collect females in Biscayne National Park and raise their eggs. While no females were collected last year, officials announced this week that an adult female was snared on the park's Elliott Key last month, along with six larvae. The female produced one egg. Federal and state officials say the Schaus' hopes might depend on a breeding program that may help safeguard a portion of the remaining population. ""I know what I am doing,"" Daniels told CNN on Tuesday. ""I am going to do the best that I can do."" The Schaus swallowtail, contained to a relatively small area in southeastern Florida, in 1976 was listed under the Endangered Species Act as threatened. It reached the endangered status eight years later. The colorful butterfly's numbers have dropped precipitously over the decades. Captive breeding was tried in the 1980s and 1990s, boosting the Schaus numbers for a time. That didn't last long. During a 2011 survey, there were only 41 sightings, mostly on Elliott Key. That number dropped to four last year. Habitat destruction, drought, hurricanes and pesticide use outside Biscayne National Park were likely contributing factors to the insect's demise, experts say. But a glimmer of hope broke out this spring in the park south of Miami when seven adult butterflies were spotted. Marissa Streifel, a research technician, collected the adult female on May 21. Daniels had a hard time hearing her during a static-laden phone call. ""I recall her saying, 'We got one. Woo-hoo!' "" Daniels said. Streifel used a net to capture the female, a challenge in the dense hammock vegetation. ""If you know how to use it well, the chance of injuring the butterfly is extremely low,"" Daniels said. After four days in an enclosure, the female was released. Because of heavy rain and poor weather conditions, she produced only one viable egg, the size of the head of a pin. It is one of the larvae in the University of Florida laboratory in Gainesville. But in a razor-thin scenario, that's certainly better than none. Schaus swallowtails generally live only two weeks in the wild, perhaps 30 to 40 days in captivity. They reproduce only once a year. After a 10- to 11-month pupa stage, butterflies will emerge bearing black-brown wings with yellow markings and a broad rusty patch beneath the hind wing. They feature aquamarine spots. Experts hope all seven in the lab will survive to adulthood. Elsa Alvear, chief of resource management at Biscayne National Park, told CNN they ""may make a difference between extinction and nonextinction."" ""This species used to be found in a lot of places in South Florida and the Keys,"" she said. ""We want to get numbers up and see it restored to more than just one island."" The search for more females is continuing this summer. Researchers hope they can net a female that will produce a couple hundred eggs, providing a huge boost to the desperate situation. ""If she is productive, you can ramp up that population pretty quickly,"" said Daniels. Of the seven butterflies, one is in the pupa phase and another is close to it. Once they complete that lengthy stage, they emerge, show their spectacular colors and take flight. That's expected to take place next spring, unless officials decide to simulate spring rains to bring them out early. Daniels said he is cautiously optimistic about the latest developments, although the Schaus swallowtail faces daunting challenges. There is no flexibility if weather or other factors turn against the insect. ""Even a minor disturbance can deal a death blow to this organism,"" Daniels said. Alvear said volunteers at the national park are helping to plant wild lime and torchwood, both food sources for the Schaus swallowtail. ""It is a beautiful butterfly, and it would be a shame to lose this,"" she said.","Researchers are caring for caterpillars of endangered species .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored his 19th consecutive league goal on Saturday setting another La Liga record as Barcelona drew 2-2 at relegation-threatened Celta Vigo. The Argentine's 73rd minute strike -- his 29th in 19 league matches -- makes him the first player in the history of Spanish football to score against every other league opponent in succession. ""It is a unheard of record that no one has ever achieved. This shows how great this player is,"" said Barcelona assistant coach Jordi Roura. Messi's second-half strike gave the Catalans the lead for the first time in the match, after they had gone behind to a Natxo Insa goal in the 38th minute. The visitors were back on level terms five minutes later thanks to a Cristian Tello strike and when Messi slotted home with 17 minutes remaining Barcelona looked odds-on for all three points. But the home side had other ideas and with two minutes remaining found an equalizer through Borja Oubina. Real Madrid failed to capitalize on their rivals slip up, drawing 1-1 at Zaragoza. Rodri put the home side ahead after six minutes with Cristiano Ronaldo equalizing in the 38th minute, before a stalemate ensued in the second half. The result means Barcelona remain 13 points clear at the top. Atletico Madrid will move into second ahead of Real if they beat Valencia on Sunday. Malaga warmed up for their Champions League clash with reigning German champions Borussia Dortmund with a 3-1 away to Rayo Vallecano. Meanwhile in Serie A, Juventus remain on course for a second consecutive league title after beating Inter Milan 2-1 at the San Siro on Saturday. The reigning champions were ahead after three minutes when Fabio Quagliarella's shot from the edge of the area found the back of the net. Rodrigo Palacio equalized in the 54th minute, but the scores weren't level for long as Alessandro Matri grabbed the winner six minutes later. The win maintains their nine-point lead at the top of the table over Napoli who were 5-3 winners at Torino. Seventh-placed Inter now trail the leaders by 21 points and with much work to do if they are secure a place in the Champions League next season. AC Milan consolidated third place with a 1-0 win at Cheivo as fourth-place Fiorentina lost 2-1 at Cagliari.

"(CNN) -- Once, high school football was the thing that brought people together in the eastern Ohio town of Steubenville. That was before two star players of the Steubenville High School football team, demigods in this small, down-on-its-luck town along the banks of the Ohio River, were accused last summer of raping a 16-year-old girl, part of a series of alleged assaults chronicled on social media. With the two boys at the center of the case set to go to trial on rape charges on Wednesday, an unwelcome national spotlight is shining on Steubenville. The case has attracted the attention of bloggers and even Anonymous, a loosely organized cooperative of activist hackers, who have questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the veracity of the investigation. Amid social media pressure and allegations of a cover-up, community leaders went on the offensive on the eve of the trial to offer support for community businesses and the embattled football team known as ""Big Red."" ""We all want to see justice prevail for the victim and the defendants in this case. All of you are here today because you are doing your job and writing your story,"" Susan Hershey, the president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce, told reporters on Tuesday. ""There (are), however, always multiple sides to every story. There is the other side of our community, a side that has been overshadowed by this incident. Unfortunately, our community has been painted with one very unflattering, broad brush."" Critics have accused community leaders of trying to paper over rampant misconduct by players of the Steubenville High School team, and have suggested that other students took part in the assaults or failed to do enough stop them. While community leaders refused to address the allegations directly, they defended the actions of the police department. ""We are a good city. We have good people here. Our police department is outstanding. They have done everything they can in this particular case,"" he said. Social media . Photos, video and social media messages are at the heart of criminal charges against the two players -- Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both juveniles -- accused of sexually assaulting the girl during a series of end-of-summer parties in August. Both boys have been identified by a judge in court, by defense attorneys and in newspapers and other media reports. CNN is not identifying the girl, who also is a juvenile, in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims. Crime blogger Alexandria Goddard, a former Steubenville resident, discovered and preserved many of the online messages about the case, at least some of which are now in the hands of authorities. She first spotted the story in the small town's newspaper and started looking into the situation on a hunch that the highly regarded football team's members were getting special treatment at the expense of the victim. One image circulated online and posted on a website maintained by Anonymous showed the girl, dressed in a T-shirt and blue shorts, her body limp, being held hand and foot by two males who appear to be teenagers. Text messages posted to social networking sites that night seemed to brag about the incident, calling the girl ""sloppy,"" making references to rape and suggesting that she had been urinated on, Goddard has said. CNN has not been able to establish whether this is true. In one 12-minute video, posted by Anonymous, one teenager makes multiple jokes about the girl's condition, saying she must have died because she didn't move during one assault. Police got involved on August 14, when the girl's mother reported the alleged assaults, according to Steubenville Police Chief William McCafferty. The family provided a zip drive showing a Twitter page, possibly with a photo, McCafferty said. McCafferty has said the same day the boys were charged, Jefferson County authorities asked for help from the state attorney general's office in investigating and prosecuting the case. On Tuesday, McCafferty told reporters that in the weeks after the story broke he received what he called ""hate e-mails."" ""Those bother me. I have a little girl,"" he said. While the attention died down for a bit, it began anew this week ahead of the trial. ""It's been tough for a lot of us. But we've gotten good feedback from the community,"" he said. Steubenville was once a thriving steel mill town. With the mills closed, the town is a shadow of its former self as a number of its residents moved away to find work elsewhere and a number of businesses closed. Today, its population is primarily blue collar with a median income between $33,000 and $34,000, well below the national average. The Steubenville High School football games have long been a gathering point for residents, who point to the team's against-all-odds play that helped elevate its reputation in the state. Since the case gained national prominence, community leaders have been working with organizations to help students deal with the stresses of the case, City Manager Cathy Davison said. Some of the students are angry about the things being said by critics, she said, adding that some students were unsure whether they should wear their Steubenville letter jackets in public. Resident Jerry Barilla, who has been a proponent of the football team, called the critics' allegations hurtful. ""Anybody that is attacking your family or your hometown, naturally you are going to stand up and defend it,"" he said. ""We are proud of them, and they show our worth, our values, our work ethic. ... Naturally, we are going to stand behind them and support them,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- ""This is the Charm Blow, we are abandoning ship."" With that message -- delivered at 4:20 p.m. Sunday -- radio communication between the boat and the Coast Guard went dead. Since then, searchers have been scouring the waters off San Francisco for the reported occupants of a 29-foot sailboat -- a couple, their 4-year-old child and the child's cousin, who the Coast Guard said is younger than 8. Coast Guard spokeswoman Pamela Boehland said the search will continue through the night. The man had called the Coast Guard an hour earlier to say that the boat had begun taking on water and its electronics were failing, the Coast Guard said. At that time, the boat was some 65 miles (105 kilometers) off Pillar Point, south of San Francisco. The four might have boarded a life raft, said the Coast Guard, which appealed to the public for help Monday in identifying the missing seafarers. ""We don't have a lot of information to go on,"" Boehland told CNN. ""All we know is that there were those four people on board and the two young children, and we're hoping that there is still time to save them."" The focus of the search was 60 to 65 miles off Monterey Bay, said Lt. Heather Lampert, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. Several aircraft and vessels have joined the search. Asked about the possibility that the report could be a hoax, given that no one has come forward to identify a family as missing, the Coast Guard said that it operates under the assumption that such reports are legitimate. If the boat did not have a life raft, the chances of survival are slim, said Mario Vittone, a recently retired Coast Guard helicopter rescue swimmer and a marine safety specialist. ""They're not going to live long, even in life jackets,"" he said. ""That's cold water out there."" According to the National Oceanographic Data Center, the water temperature off San Francisco was 49.3 degrees Fahrenheit (9.6 C).

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VICE) -- Two men stand in the yard of a Nepalese jail, facing the camera. One looks straight into the lens while the other looks away. They are on trial for poaching and could be sharing a cell for the next 20 years if convicted. Patrick Brown takes their picture. Brown and Ben Davies have been documenting the illegal trade of endangered animals in Asia for more than ten years, covering its dealers, stockpiles, trafficking routes and markets. They knows that poachers are but a small part of a much bigger contraband industry that is centuries old. ""A poacher who kills a rhino and removes its horn in India gets $350,"" Brown explains. ""By the time it reaches Hong Kong, the horn is worth about $95,600 per killogram."" Money fuels illegal animal trade, as it does any other form of smuggling, but the demand and value of these animals is built upon false beliefs and superstition. Rhino horns have no medicinal purpose, but myths about their effect on health and potency have pushed their value to more than five times the price of gold in black markets. Animal trade thrives on novelty and on the belief that exotic animals exude certain powers. More and more people are becoming aware of the myths, but sellers are also adapting. As Patrick Brown explains, porous rhino horns are now often soaked in Viagra before they reach the market. See the rest of Picture Perfect: Patrick Brown at VICE.COM . The exact size of that market is impossible to figure out, but experts estimate that its value is somewhere in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Legal global wildlife trade has doubled since the 1990s, and the evidence is nothing short of disheartening: more than 100 million sharks are killed each year, elephants have evolved to have shorter tusks because of poaching, and there are more Bengalese tigers in Texas than in the bay of Bengal. The trade pandemic is only made worse by the shortage of animal specialists at checkpoints. ""The problem seems insurmountable,"" Patrick Brown said, ""but one way of curbing rampant killing is to educate future generations."" Brown does not think of himself as an animal activist, but rather talks about exposing a subculture of society and documenting the story of what happens to these animals. He hopes his work will raise public and political awareness about this issue and has said that his ultimate goal is to educate the developing world. Brown and Davies' decade-long project will culminate with the publication of ""Trading to Extinction"" later this year. The book was made possible by the crowd-funding site Emphas.is and will include an introduction by journalist Ben Davies.","Photographer Patrick Brown documents the illegal trade of endangered animals in Asia .

"(CNN) -- Only 800 printed sets of the multi-volume Encyclopedia Britannica are stacked in the company's Kentucky warehouse, the company says, and when the last one sells, there'll be no more. It could be just a matter of days. ""They are flying off the shelves,"" Jorge Cauz, president of Encyclopedia Britannica, told CNN Friday. Just three weeks after the publisher of the iconic encyclopedia announced it would be ceasing print production after 244 years, more than 3,000 printed copies of the final edition, the 2010 version, have sold at the standard price of $1,395 Cauz said. New versions of the coveted 32-volume set, which up until the last decade was peddled by door-to-door salesmen, will now be available exclusively on the Internet. News of the publishing shutdown rattled consumers enough to cause a spike in sales to 1,050 a week, company spokesman Peter Duckler told CNN. Before the announcement, the company averaged a mere 60 sales a week. Worldwide, the company is now selling 150 copies a day, Duckler said. Cauz said he wasn't sure if the printed copies would last more than a few days. The encyclopedia's end adds to a trend that is seeing newspapers, magazines, books and journals turn into online URL addresses almost daily. One nostalgic customer, who wasted no time ordering one of the last published sets when he heard they'd soon be gone forever, called the transition the ""passing of an era."" ""I remember being so engrossed in all the things you could possibly know,"" David Wise of Chicago told CNN. Wise,44, had a hand-me-down encyclopedia set from his aunt and uncle, and fondly recalls reading it every night before dinner in his youth. ""I have young kids. I thought, there's no way I'm not going to let them have that experience,"" he said. Wise recalled his family's set was missing the ""F"" volume. ""There was a slight gap in my education,"" he joked. For Wise, the encyclopedia series encompasses not only what one can learn from the content of the books, but how much society has learned over time. ""In the first edition they didn't know what California was,"" Wise told CNN. ""Now we're studying intergalactic space!"" The first edition of Encyclopedia Britannica, dating back to 1768, takes up no more than 8 inches on his desk. The newest version covers multiple shelves on his bookcase. Wise says the encyclopedia catalogs ""a robust explosion of human knowledge."" While Wise mourns the loss of a cherished a tradition, Cauz, 55, is less than disheartened about having to retire the printed version, along with its hard covers and pages that must be turned by hand. ""The youth has an attachment to the digital screen,"" he, explained. ""That's how they learn and explore, and so that's where we will be."" Cauz celebrates the company's ability to mold with the changing times, adapt to technological advancements, and enhance the experience for customers new and old. He said even Internet subscriptions have spiked since the announcement of print cessation. ""Society still pays high regard to facts and scholarly knowledge,"" he said. ""The whole idea of Britannica being alive and vibrant is here.""","Only a few copies of the final printed Encyclopedia Britannica are left, the company says .
Sales jumped from 60 copies a week to 1,050 after the announcement .

"(CNN) -- The pregnant coach of the Seton Hill University women's lacrosse team was among two people killed Saturday when the bus they were on veered off the highway and crashed into a tree in southern Pennsylvania, authorities said. Kristina Quigley, 30, who was six months pregnant with a boy, died from injuries at Penn State Hershey Medical Center, according to the Cumberland County Department of Public Safety. ""Her unborn child did not survive,"" the county agency said. The 61-year-old bus driver, Anthony Guaetta, was pronounced dead at the scene. The bus was carrying 23 people, who were players or associated with team, when it crashed, authorities said. Three individuals -- a figure that does not include the driver, but likely includes Quigley -- were transported to Penn State Hershey Medical Center with serious injuries, the university said in a statement. Others received treatment for minor injuries, with eight going to Carlisle Regional Medical Center, seven to Harrisburg Hospital and four to Holy Spirit Hospital in Camp Hill. According to her bio on the school's website, Quigley was in her second season as head women's lacrosse coach at Seton Hill, a Catholic university outside Pittsburgh founded by the Sisters of Charity in 1885. A Baltimore, Maryland, native and graduate of Duquesne University, she came to Pennsylvania after starting a Division II program at Erskine College in Due West, South Carolina. Quigley leaves behind a husband and a young son, Seton Hill said in a statement. A memorial Mass will be held in memory of her and the bus driver, and in support of all those injured, at 7 p.m. Sunday on the Pennsylvania campus. The chartered bus was heading from Greensburg to Millersville, where the Griffins were set to take on an opponent from Millersville University in a Division II matchup slated to start at 1 p.m. It was traveling eastbound on the Pennsylvania Turnpike when it veered off the road near Carlise, struck a guard rail, traveled 70 yards through grass and then struck a tree, said Trooper Rob Hicks, a spokesman for state police. Rain and snow were falling when the accident occurred shortly before 9 a.m., but state police don't know yet whether the weather played a role, said Megan Silverstrim, a spokeswoman with the Cumberland County Department of Public Safety. The bus was owned and operated by Pennsylvania-based Mlaker Transportation, which issued a statement Saturday saying it ""is cooperating fully with police, officials from Seton Hill University and others to assist the student-athletes, coaches and others on the motorcoach."" The company said its been in operation for more than 40 years and ""places the safe transportation of all our passengers at the highest level."" The accident was still under investigation Saturday afternoon, a state police spokesman said. The National Safety Transportation Board is gathering information but has yet to decide whether it will investigate, said spokesman Keith Holloway. In an unrelated incident last month, a bus carrying the University of Maine women's basketball team crashed on a highway near Boston, but no one was killed, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. The bus crossed the median and traveled into the woods next to the highway, authorities told WCVB. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: Rain and snow were falling, though it's not known if that led to crash, an official says .

"(CNN) -- With just months to go before the presidential campaign ends all meaningful activity on Capitol Hill, members of Congress are struggling to move a few must-pass pieces of legislation. One of the most pressing is the highway bill, which Congress is considering this week. Not only does all federal funding for transportation depend on passing a bill by March 31; the highway trust fund itself is scheduled to go broke in 2013 and the deal in the making pays for only two years. This is essential national maintenance. Yet Congress is - you guessed it - gridlocked. We all know Washington is broken. What's less clear: Did it ever work better? If it did, what was different? What ingredients have been lost, and can we recapture them? One place to look, especially apt in this instance: The 1956 congressional debate that created the interstate highway system. The 1956 Federal Aid Highway Act was the health-care legislation of its day, an epic Washington battle. The pressure had been building for decades as the number of cars exploded. Traffic was a national nightmare. Many intercity roads were hardly passable, and most Americans recognized that new highways were essential to continue the unprecedented growth the country had been enjoying since the end of World War II. What no one could agree on was how to pay for the new system. The 1950s were a more consensual era, of course. Both Democrats and Republicans had wanted to nominate Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for president in 1952, and during the debate over the highway bill, his approval ratings rarely dipped below 70%. But that doesn't mean there were no disagreements. Opinion: What's wrong with Congress? It's not big enough . Ideological divisions were if anything sharper than they are today -- Republicans were the party of big business, Democrats the champions of the people and the New Deal. Elections were just as competitive, partisan jockeying just as intense. And the debate about how to pay for the highway system -- tolls, taxes, bonds or some other way -- wasn't just about money. It was about values - what kind of country we wanted to be. The debate built in intensity through the early '50s. There were blue-ribbon commissions, competing proposals, an array of shifting alliances and armies of lobbyists. The president's proposal and a rival Democratic plan were both shot down in early summer 1955. The main obstacles: truckers, motorists and the oil industry, all resisting new gasoline, tire and vehicle sales taxes. While the American Trucking Association worked behind the scenes in Washington, a national grassroots campaign whipped truck drivers into a frenzy, producing thousands of phone calls and telegrams to Congress. But something strange happened over the next nine months -- a last, pivotal round of deal-making -- and a compromise package passed easily in April 1956. The biggest public works program since the pyramids, all told -- highways plus local connecting roads -- came in at $50 billion, more than two-thirds of the federal budget in 1956. But the years of negotiating paid off, and the deal held. In the end, only one Senator voted no, and the bill passed on a voice vote in the House; approval was so overwhelming, there was no need to count. What changed in those nine months? Part of it was leadership, with sheer determination by lawmakers. The bill had dozens of moving parts and many fathers on both sides of the aisle. But the last, critical puzzle piece was the highway trust fund, which set aside the taxes paid by truckers and motorists for the highway system and nothing else. And the two men who worked together to advance the trust fund could hardly have made an odder couple: Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey, a Midwest Republican and former corporate executive who came to Washington to cut government spending, and U.S. Rep. Hale Boggs of Louisiana, a glad-handing, big-spending, bring-home-the-bacon liberal Democrat. Both were more interested in problem-solving than ideological purity, in part because in 1956, only problem-solving would win votes. Both parties knew they needed to deliver a highway system. But America was different, too. The truckers and motorists who blocked the highway bill in 1955 changed their minds in 1956. Flouting one of the nation's most ingrained traditions, they accepted a voluntary tax. They recognized that though they would pay, they would also benefit, and in the end the roads would be more than worth the cost. This was partly because of the trust fund. But that wasn't all. Truckers, motorists, auto manufacturers, oil companies and others understood that better highways would mean more commerce. More commerce meant industry would produce more goods. More production would put more people to work. And their increased consumption would lead to yet more growth. This was the win-win-win perpetual-motion machine that had been driving the economy since 1945. And based on the prosperity of the previous decade, most voters believed a rising tide would still lift all boats. Can we apply these lessons today? I'm not sure. So much is so different, and we can't turn back the clock. Still, it's something to ponder as Democrats and Republicans shout past each other on Capitol Hill in coming weeks. It doesn't have to be this way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tamar Jacoby.","Tamar Jacoby: Congress weighing highway bill that provides transportation funds .
She says 1956 debate that created interestate system should give Congress a clue .

"(CNN) -- A day after the United States promised new missile defense interceptors to guard against a North Korean attack, Pyongyang responded Saturday by blasting the Americans' ""hostile policy"" and saying it won't negotiate with them over its nuclear program. ""(North Korea's) nuclear weapons serve as an all-powerful treasured sword for protecting the sovereignty and security of the country,"" a foreign ministry spokesman said, according to the state-run KCNA news agency. ""Therefore, they cannot be disputed ... as long as the U.S. nuclear threat and hostile policy persist."" The stern statement marked the latest in the war of words, and more, pitting North Korea against the United States and, in fact, many other countries worldwide. Tensions have escalated since December, when North Korea successfully launched a long-range rocket for the first time under what the United States and other Western nations say was the guise of putting a satellite into orbit. They rose to yet another level when North Korea launched a nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to agree on stepped-up sanctions intent on pressuring Pyongyang. In Saturday's statement, the North Korean foreign ministry spokesman claimed the United States ""hostile policy ... has become more pronounced."" Washington's latest salvo on this front came Friday, when U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said 14 more missile interceptors -- bringing the total to 44 -- will be in place on the West Coast by 2017 to guard against a possible North Korean attack. U.S. to beef up missile defense against North Korea, Iran . North Korea blamed the United States on Saturday for ""having compelled (North Korea) to have access to nukes"" because it ""escalated the situation of the Korean Peninsula to an extreme phase."" The statement challenged claims that North Korea was pursuing its nuclear program as a ""bargaining chip"" to gain economic benefits through negotiations, such as food and other humanitarian aid. ""The U.S. poor temptation that it would help (North Korea) if the latter makes other choice(s) may work on other countries, but it sounds nonsensical to (North Korea),"" the foreign ministry spokesman said.

"(CNN) -- Users have one week to vote on the proposed changes to Facebook's policy, including the ability of users to vote on future privacy changes. Voting opened on Monday, and users have until Monday, December 10, at noon PST to make their opinions heard. Facebook has put up a custom voting app powered by a third-party company for this vote, and the results will be tallied by an independent auditor. ""This feedback allows us to respond to your questions and make substantive changes to our proposals before they are implemented,"" Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of communications and public policy, said in a blog post announcing the vote. Facebook proposed the latest changes to its Data Use Policy and Statement of Rights and Responsibilities on November 21. Users and privacy groups immediately expressed concerns over the modifications. In addition to a proposed end to public voting on these types of issues, Facebook wanted to change to how users control who can send them messages. Also, an addition to the Data Use Policy would allow Facebook to share data with affiliated business, such as Instagram. On Friday, two privacy groups, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Center for Digital Democracy, sent an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg objecting to the proposal. ""Because these proposed changes raise privacy risks for users, may be contrary to law, and violate your previous commitments to users about site governance, we urge you to withdraw the proposed changes,"" read the letter. They also say the changes could violate Facebook's settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, in which the social network said it would obtain consent from users before sharing their personal data with third parties, and provide users with clear notice when that information is shared. Facebook has a rocky history with privacy changes and resulting backlash from members. In 2009, the site made previously private data such as friend lists and profile photos public by default. The following year, users were automatically oped into a new ""Instant Personalization"" feature that shared private information with outside companies such as Pandora. The outpouring of comments on the Facebook post announcing the proposed policy updates was huge. More than 20,000 people commented on the post, voicing concerns over the company's proposed updates. ""I don't want advertisers to have my information. I made this account back in 2005 as a way to keep in touch with friends, not be bombarded by ever increasing advertisements,"" commented user Nic Raines. In that post, Facebook also proposed to end public voting on changes to site governance. The voting option was first rolled out in 2009 in response to privacy complaints over a chance to the sites term of use. At the time, Facebook had just 175 million users. This voting app is a improvement over the previous system. Past votes just required 7,000 users to comment on an official Facebook post. Facebook said the reason it wanted to do away with votes was that the comment system valued ""quantity over quality,"" a problem the new system already seems to address. There are about 1 billion people on Facebook, not including bots or fake accounts. Facebook will require 30% of those active registered users to take part in the vote for the outcome to be binding. If less than that percent vote, the company will take the results under advisement. Getting 300 million Facebook users to vote could be difficult, especially with the lack of viral appeal such as a fake lottery ticket. In addition to voting and commenting, Facebook users can join a live webcast on Tuesday, during which Facebook officials will answer questions.

"(CNN) -- Four Humvees carrying 33 Mexican soldiers crossed the border into the United States, and officials on both sides say it was a harmless mistake. The convoy of military vehicles crossed the recently-opened Donna-Rio Bravo International Bridge, which links the two cities of the same names in Texas and Mexico. The incident happened about 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, Customs and Border Protection spokesman Rick Pauza said. The soldiers ""just said they inadvertently crossed onto the U.S. side,"" he said. The military men were processed at the port of entry before being allowed to cross back, he said. For its part, the Mexican military said that while patrolling the border, they accidentally got on the international bridge and had no choice but to enter the American side because that is where the turnaround is located. ""Everything was fine. There was no resistance and no other issues there,"" Pauza said. Any time the Mexican military crosses the international border, it draws attention, however, as previous incursions have been recorded. In 2008, seven members of the Mexican military were found inside the United States, telling border agents that they became lost and accidentally entered the country. In 2006, a group of soldiers -- or men dressed as soldiers, as Mexican officials said -- were recorded accompanying suspected drug smugglers who became stuck in the Rio Grande. CNN's Simon Hernandez-Arthur contributed to this report.","The incursion was accidental, officials say .

"This story is the third in a series focusing on the FBI as the agency hits the 100-year mark. Lucky Luciano organized the U.S. mob into a commission overseen by New York's five families. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Teflon Don is dead and gone. The Mustache Petes of the Mafia's old guard are mostly behind bars. And the crime rackets have gone global. Think La Cosa Nostra is just a quaint throwback, the stuff of gangster movies? Fuggedaboudit. Although the Mafia may not be as strong as it once was, FBI agents say organized crime is far from dead. Not only is the traditional mob still at it, but new organized crime groups also are vying for a piece of the action. Weakened by two decades of prosecutions, the traditional Italian crime organizations plug away at what they know best: labor racketeering, infiltrating unions and construction industries, gambling and loan sharking. ""What you see in the movies about honor and code is a fallacy. That doesn't exist. It's completely about the money,"" said Mike Gaeta, a veteran agent who heads the FBI squad in charge of investigating the Genovese family. ""As the economy evolves, they evolve.""  Watch how the FBI's tactics have changed over the years » . The scams are growing in sophistication, focusing more than ever on the big money. Everyone pays the price, according to Gaeta. ""There is a mob tax placed on everything from your garbage collection, food delivery, the rent that you pay,"" he said. ""I don't know what the percentage is, but there is a premium that you pay because of the control that organized crime has on labor unions and on the contractors who are engaged in those job sites."" There are more than 3,000 Mafia members and associates in the U.S., the FBI estimates on its Web site. The presence is most pronounced around New York, southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The FBI has about 100 agents and 11 squads investigating mob activities at the New York hub. The FBI touts its success against New York's five major Mafia families -- Gambino, Genovese, Bonanno, Colombo and Lucchese -- as one of the bureau's biggest accomplishments in its 100-year history. Major arrests and convictions in the 1980s and 1990s crippled the mob. If they didn't get whacked first, the top dogs of the five families faced multiple prosecutions and long prison terms. Among the big names to take the perp walk as a result: John Gotti, Vincent Gigante and Joseph Massino.  Learn more about mob bosses » . The federal racketeering law passed in 1970 known as the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO, allowed agents to build stronger cases and secure stiffer sentences. It was added to the bureau's traditional crime-fighting arsenal of wiretaps, physical surveillance of targets and undercover agents. As the years rolled by, the FBI benefited from ""flipping"" mob insiders like Massino, who, facing life sentences for RICO convictions, decided to violate the Mafia's code of silence -- omerta. Massino talked to avoid the death penalty for murder, becoming the Mafia's highest-ranking turncoat, and is now serving a life sentence. Seamus McElearney, who spearheads FBI investigations against the Colombo crime family, has persuaded several mobsters to turn informant, and one case sticks out in his mind. ""This individual was able to realize that he'd be going away for the rest of his life, and like anything in life, you build a rapport with someone, and you have to get over that trust factor. And he started to trust me and realize this was his best option,"" McElearney said, describing what it takes to persuade a witness to switch sides. The FBI also uses forensic accounting and other sophisticated tools to penetrate the mob. ""Looking at these guys from a financial point of view, because that's one of the best ways to hurt them is in the pocketbook ... ultimately led to the devastation of the family,"" said Supervisory Special Agent Nora Conley, who investigates the Bonanno family. The mob adapted to investigations and convictions as layer upon layer of wiseguys-in-waiting stepped up. The Italians may still control the lion's share of illegal organized crime activity, but competitors are vying for a piece of the action. Law enforcement officials say Asians, Russians and Albanians have established their own crime organizations in the United States. These groups are smaller and more disorganized than their Italian counterparts but pose their own danger. Kevin Hallinan, an FBI supervisor who has worked organized crime for 18 years, said that groups of Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese nationals, for example, are heavily involved in immigrant-smuggling, gambling, prostitution, counterfeiting and extortion of legitimate businesses as well as other crimes. ""Drugs are a serious problem,"" Hallinan said. ""It's quick money. They have known transportation routes. A lot of the folks have international connections and know people at the ports, at the airports, and can get the drugs here."" He continued, ""the big challenge for Asian organized crime and Albanian organized crime is having the finances to pay for a load of heroin, to pay for a load of cocaine, and then have the facilitator get it into the country, and then have the means of distribution, which the Italians have had in the past."" Russian and Albanian groups ""are more like criminal enterprises than organized crime,"" observes agent Dennis Bolles, who heads the squad investigating them. ""Whether it is insurance fraud, bank fraud, identity theft, Medicaid fraud, securities fraud, mortgage fraud [or] multimillion-dollar scams, the Russians are very sophisticated,"" Bolles said. ""They are very educated people. Some are former KGB. Some are former government officials -- masters degrees, PhDs -- and now they find themselves in the U.S., and they are using those brains to commit scams."" The FBI learned the hard way that foot-dragging on organized crime investigations can be costly. In the 1930s, as Genovese family leader Lucky Luciano rose to power and brought the five families into a unified commission, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover resisted going after the mob. His inaction allowed the Mafia to become fully entrenched into American society and business.  Watch how Hoover dropped the ball » . It wasn't until the 1950s that the Mafia became a law enforcement priority. Sen. Estes Kefauver led congressional hearings on organized crime in May 1950, and the 1963 congressional testimony of Mafia turncoat Joseph Valachi brought attention to a problem that long had been ignored. ""From there, the program skyrocketed and became a very material priority for the FBI as criminal programs,"" Assistant FBI Director Mark Mershon said. FBI officials credit that effort and the intelligence-gathering skills learned in mob investigations for giving today's agents a foundation for future investigations, including of terrorists. ""You have to understand who are the players, who are the leaders, how are they financed, how do they recruit, how do they handle their memberships,"" FBI Director Robert Mueller recently said as the bureau approached the 100-year mark. CNN's Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.","Mafia became entrenched because FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover ignored it in 1930s .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Mehmet Oz is being sued for injures sustained by a New Jersey man. Was this person under Dr. Oz' care? Was he someone Dr. Oz had spoken with about a medical issue? Did Dr. Oz, in an uncharacteristic fit of anger, punch the Jersey guy? Nope. This man is simply one of the millions of people who have watched Dr. Oz on TV over the years. So why is he suing? Because, the plaintiff claims, he was injured when he tried Dr. Oz' home sleep remedy known as the ""Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie."" Shake your head in disbelief all you want, but this is far from the most ludicrous lawsuit we have seen in recent years. Who can forget the Michigan woman who filed a lawsuit in 2011 against the producers of the film ""Drive""? Her complaint alleged that she was misled by the movie's trailer which promised ""Fast and the Furious"" type driving, which, alas, the film didn't deliver. And then there was the lawsuit filed last year against the Dallas Cowboys by a woman claiming she sustained burns on her legs. What did she say the Cowboys did wrong? She claims they failed to warn her that sitting for an extended period of time on a black bench outside the Cowboys' stadium on a hot August day could cause burns. More? Well, while in Tennessee, a couple sued Steak 'n Shake after their son ingested a sauce labeled ""Mega Death Hot Sauce."" It should be noted that the sauce bottle bears the image of a skull engulfed in flames. And that brings us to Dr. Oz. On his April 17, 2012, show, he offered advice about how to sleep better. One suggestion was filling the toe of a pair of socks with uncooked rice. The socks were then to be placed in the microwave and heated until warm. However, Dr. Oz expressly warned viewers, ""Don't get it too hot, just warm."" The heated footsie was then to be worn for 20 minutes. The reasoning being that the heated socks will cause blood to be diverted to your feet, which in turn will cool the rest of your body. As Dr. Oz explained, ""you're going to be able to sleep better because your body has to be cold in order to be sleepy."" However, the plaintiff claims that he suffered third degree burns from this remedy. How? Well, he apparently fell asleep with the socks on and didn't realize his feet had been burned until he woke up in the middle of night and tried to walk. The plaintiff also claims that Dr. Oz should have offered a specific warning to avoid using this remedy to people who, like him, have diabetes and hence less feeling in their feet. Let's be honest: These above lawsuits are at best legally questionable and at worst frivolous. But don't blame the person seeking the money. Blame the lawyers. Personal injury lawyers have enticed people for years with their TV commercials and ads on the walls of buses and trains telling us that if you have been wronged, you might be entitled to a big cash award or settlement. This is, of course, followed by the line: ""We don't get paid unless you do."" So, understandably, people flock to these lawyers with complaints about every imaginable wrong seeking a payday. The lawyers then file lawsuits, hoping for a quick settlement so that they can do as little work as possible before seeing their own payday. Full disclosure: When I practiced law, I represented corporations against lawsuits. Consequently, I'm a bit biased against plaintiffs' lawyers. But it's easy for even a non-corporate lawyer to see that these ridiculous lawsuits give the reputable plaintiffs' attorneys -- and, frankly, all lawyers -- a black eye. It's not that I'm without sympathy for the growing number of lawyers out there struggling to make ends meet. The practice of law has grown increasingly competitive and challenging. I can understand the lure of taking a questionable case that will reap you some media coverage and money. But that's not a good enough reason to do it. Lawyers need to collectively rein in these types of cases. If they don't, the government will do it for them under the guise of ""tort reform."" The new laws that result would in all likelihood make it harder to file a lawsuit and would limit damages in personal injury cases. And this will make it even more challenging for lawyers to earn a living. Worse, these reforms may prevent some truly injured people from receiving the full compensation they deserve because of caps on damages. As for Dr. Oz, I hope that he doesn't settle quickly out of court. Instead, I hope they fully litigate this case. In all likelihood he will prevail. But even if the plaintiff does ultimately win, it still will have sent a clear message to plaintiffs' attorneys who take these legally questionable cases: If you want money, you are going to have to really earn it.

"Savar, Bangladesh (CNN) -- A week after a building containing thousands of Bangladeshi garment workers came crashing down around them, the death toll from the South Asian nation's deadliest industrial disaster rose above 400. Workers using heavy machinery are gradually picking apart the huge, splintered slabs of concrete at the scene of the collapse in Savar, a suburb of the capital, Dhaka. They continue to find and remove bodies, many of them decomposed and difficult to recognize. Meanwhile, throngs of mourners attended a funeral for 32 unidentified victims whose bodies were unclaimed. And Pope Francis, speaking at a Mass on Wednesday, referred to the building collapse in a sharp condemnation of worker exploitation and ""slave labor."" ""Not paying a just (wage), not providing work, focusing exclusively on the balance books, on financial statements, only looking at making personal profit. That goes against God!"" he said, quoted on the Vatican Radio website. The collapse of the building has caused widespread anger among Bangladesh's millions of garment workers about the risky conditions in which many of them must work. Anger in Bangladesh focuses on building owner, rejection of aid . Frequent protests, some of them involving violent clashes with police, have taken place in Dhaka and nearby manufacturing districts since the disaster. On Wednesday, when workers around the world were holding May Day rallies, thousands of Bangladeshis took to the streets once again, although no clashes were initially reported. As trucks carrying rubble leave the scene of the catastrophe, people search desperately for missing relatives crowd around them, wanting to make sure they're not mistakenly taking away the bodies of their loved ones, said Maj. Gen. Hassan Sarwardy, the military official leading the recovery efforts. There was confusion earlier about exactly how many people were still unaccounted for in the collapse, Sarwardy said at a news briefing Wednesday. Authorities were waiting for the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association to provide a list of all the people who were inside the five garment factories in the building when it caved in, he said. When that information was obtained, Sarwardy said it appeared about 149 people were still missing. ""It is very unlikely that someone is still alive under the rubble on the seventh day of the building collapse ... but the almighty Allah knows better,"" the military official said. Authorities say the number of people confirmed dead so far is 412, while 2,443 people have been recovered alive, according to the official Bangladesh State News Agency. And so, the search for the human remains still entombed within the ruins goes on amid the stench of death that pervades the site. Those involved in the search are using face masks and cans of air freshener to try to block out the smell, and electronic sensors and sniffer dogs to try to find the bodies. Col. Shayekh Jaman, one of the officials involved in the operation, said Wednesday that he believed the grueling, painstaking efforts could continue for about 10 more days. ""It is a delicate and time-consuming operation, but we are doing everything we can,"" he said. After building collapse, Shahina's death breaks rescuers' hearts . Lost relatives . Meanwhile, hundreds of people such as Sheikh Nasir Uddin are left in limbo. At the school playground in Savar where bodies recovered from the wreckage are initially brought for identification, Uddin said he had being looking for his nephew, Abul Kalam Azad, for the past week. He said visits to all the hospitals in Savar and Dhaka where the injured and the dead were taken had proved fruitless. ""Nobody can tell me about my nephew, who was working at an apparel factory in the building,"" he said. Much of the rage voiced in protests has been directed at Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, who was arrested near the Indian border over the weekend. Protesters have called for him to be hanged. Rana and the owners of the factories in his building have been accused of ordering workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse, despite the discovery of large cracks the day before. Americans face tough choices over Bangladesh . The Bangladeshi government is also coming under criticism for lax enforcement of safety regulations in factories and claims by Britain and the United Nations that it refused offers of help with rescue efforts. Home Minister Mahiuddin Khan Alamgir said Tuesday that the rejection was because Bangladesh had only wanted equipment to be sent, not the additional search and rescue experts offered by the outside agencies. EU considers trade action . In a sign of the growing international pressure on Dhaka to improve labor conditions, the European Union said Tuesday that it was considering trade action against Bangladesh. The statement carries weight, since the EU is Bangladesh's largest trade partner. The Bangladeshi government said this week that it would begin inspecting the safety and security of all garment factories in the country. Major Western retailers and clothing brands, some of which sourced products from the factories in the collapsed building, are also facing difficult questions about how closely they scrutinize working conditions at their suppliers. ""We understand that businesses operating in this building appear to have links to numerous companies in the U.S. and Europe and so we'll continue to engage with U.S. companies to discuss what role they can play in improving working conditions, including in Bangladesh,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Wednesday. The catastrophic building collapse happened about five months after a fire at Tazreen Fashions Factory, a garment maker in another suburb of Dhaka, killed at least 112 people.

"(CNN) -- North Korea on Thursday set out demanding conditions for any talks with Washington and Seoul, calling for the withdrawal of U.N. sanctions against it and a permanent end to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. The United States and South Korea ""should immediately stop all their provocative acts against the DPRK and apologize for all of them,"" the North's National Defense Commission said in a statement carried by state-run media, using the shortened version of North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The commission listed a number of ""practical measures"" it said the United States and South Korea should take if they want to avoid ""sledge-hammer retaliatory blows of the army and people"" of North Korea and if ""they truly stand for dialogue and negotiations."" But the nature of the demands, such as the lifting of the U.N. sanctions imposed after the North's latest nuclear test, appeared to offer almost no chance of negotiations between the two sides amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea: Lifting of U.N. sanctions if a condition for talks with U.S. ""It is hard to understand North Korea's claims,"" Cho Tai-young, a spokesman for the South Korean foreign ministry, said at a news briefing. ""They are preposterous."" A torrent of unnerving threats from Pyongyang in recent weeks has strained already fragile relations in the region. The North's rhetoric intensified when the U.N. Security Council voted last month to slap the tougher sanctions on the regime and amid the U.S.-South Korean military drills under way in South Korea at the moment. The United States said this month that for it to enter talks, North Korea would have to show a serious commitment to moving away from its nuclear program, something the regime of Kim Jong Un insists it won't do. On Thursday, the North suggested that the United States would have to make the first move on the nuclear issue. ""They should bear in mind that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can begin with the pullout of the nuclear war means introduced by the U.S. and this may lead to the global denuclearization,"" the defense commission said. North Korea has repeatedly described the annual military exercises taking place in South Korea as threats of nuclear war, singling out aspects of the drills like the practice mission flown by U.S. stealth bombers as evidence. The stealth bombers can carry conventional or nuclear weapons, but they used inert munitions in their training flight. North Korea's missile capabilities . The United States says such displays of military strength during the drills were aimed at reassuring it allies in the region, not antagonizing the regime in Pyongyang. President Barack Obama warned Kim Jong Un this week that the North's threats against the United States and South Korea had only served to isolate the regime further. ""This is the same kind of pattern that we saw his father engage in and his grandfather before that,"" Obama said in an interview with NBC News broadcast Tuesday, referring to the two previous North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung. ""Since I came into office, the one thing I was clear about was, we're not going to reward this kind of provocative behavior. You don't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way,"" he said. Nuclear weapons: Who has what?

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- The defense attorney for a Philadelphia abortion doctor charged with murder in the deaths of four babies on Monday attacked prosecutors' evidence that live births took place at Dr. Kermit Gosnell's clinic as he presented closing arguments in the case. Gosnell, 72, is accused of killing babies with scissors that were used to cut their spinal cords. Authorities allege that some of the infants were born viable and alive during the sixth, seventh and eighth months of pregnancy. Although he did not call a single witness to the stand, Gosnell's defense attorney, Jack McMahon, gave an impassioned, 2 1/2-hour closing argument to the jury refuting the prosecution's evidence and once again claiming that none of the infants was killed; rather, he said, they were already dead as a result of Gosnell administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion. Defense calls no witnesses . McMahon, stalking the jury box, accused prosecutors of ""the most extraordinary hype and exaggeration in the history of the criminal justice system,"" even adding that they are ""elitist"" and ""racist."" Gosnell, who is African-American, has been accused by authorities of preying on low-income, minority women. McMahon argued that Gosnell offered people who were poor and without health insurance access to health care. ""These are desperate, young girls who were in trouble. But he provided these desperate young girls with relief,"" McMahon said. Flipping through a series of photos of the Women's Medical Clinic, McMahon argued that the images rebuffed their ""House of Horrors"" claim. ""This isn't a perfect place by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not what they say it is,"" McMahon bellowed. ""Are you going to believe Mr. Cameron or your lying eyes."" McMahon then asked the jury to find courage and ""be fair,"" he said. ""Be true to yourself,"" he said, ""Go by what the evidence is, not what everyone wants it to be."" Judge tosses 3 murder charges . Before Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Edward Cameron delivered his closing arguments, an examination chair with stirrups, a sonogram machine and other medical devices that were on permanent display in the center of the courtroom during the trial were returned to their place facing the jury box. District Attorney Seth Williams, flanked by a security detail, entered the packed courtroom and observed from the back of the room. ""This case is not about us,"" Cameron said. ""It's about Karnamaya Mongar, and those four babies that are dead, and getting them justice."" Cameron then summarized testimony from almost all 54 witnesses who took the stand during the seven-week trial. As he read through key facets of testimony, four enlarged photos of three fetuses, and a photo of Mongar and her husband, faced the jury before being placed on several monitors throughout the courtroom. At one point Cameron turned to Gosnell, who wrote notes incessantly on a notepad, and yelled. ""Are you human?"" he asked, hands on his hips while Gosnell smirked back at him. ""It's time for us to extinguish the fire he created."" Philadelphia doctor performed illegal late-term abortions, ex-employee testifies . Gosnell originally faced eight counts of murder in the deaths of seven babies and Mongar, 41, who died of an anesthetic overdose during a second-trimester abortion. He is also charged with conspiracy, abortion at 24 or more weeks of pregnancy, theft, corruption of minors, solicitation and other related offenses. Common Pleas Court Judge Jeffrey P. Minehart threw out three of the seven first-degree murder charges against Gosnell last week. He has pleaded not guilty. The judge also tossed all five abuse of corpse charges for storing the feet of aborted fetuses in plastic containers. Minehart also dismissed one count of infanticide, the intentional killing of an infant. Gosnell is also accused of reusing unsanitary instruments; performing procedures in filthy rooms, including some having litter boxes and animals present during operations; and allowing unlicensed employees -- including a teenage high school student -- to perform operations and administer anesthesia. Nine others who worked in the west Philadelphia medical office, including Gosnell's wife and sister-in-law, also were charged. Eight have pleaded guilty. Also on trial is co-defendant Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at the Women's Medical Society. O'Neill, who did not have a medical license, is not charged with performing abortions but with participating in the operation of a ""corrupt organization"" and ""theft by deception"" for operating without a doctor's license. ""She was pretending to be a doctor and doesn't deserve the title,"" Cameron said, turning to O'Neill who looked down at her notepad and scribbled. Meanwhile, a gag order preventing attorneys or the jury from speaking to the media remains in place. If he is found guilty, Gosnell, who is not a board-certified obstetrician or gynecologist, could be sentenced to death.

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama would make a great stand-up comic, not because he's the funniest president ever but because he uses jokes the same way many of us comedians do: as a weapon. Traditionally, the (intentionally) funny lines by our presidents have had one thing in common: They were self-deprecating. Sure, some presidents have used jokes to take jabs at their opponents, but not to the extent of Obama. During his tenure, he has increasingly unleashed biting comedic barbs against his critics and political adversaries. These jokes are intended to do more than simply entertain you. They have an agenda. Obama's humor is often delivered the way a comedian dealing with a heckler would do it. He tries to undermine his opponents with it and get the crowd -- in this case the public -- on his side. I can assure you that having a crowd laugh at your critic/heckler is not only effective in dominating them, it's also very satisfying. Let's look at some of the more typical self-deprecating jokes made by presidents at past White House Correspondents' Dinners, where press and president unleash their biting wits on one another. In 1988, Ronald Reagan joked about his advanced age by commenting that his staff had claimed that ""preparing me for a press conference was like reinventing the wheel. Not true. I was around when the wheel was invented, and it was easier."" President Clinton, at the 2000 Correspondents' Dinner, mentioned that he was a fan of that night's comedian, Jay Leno: ""Because, together, we give hope to gray-haired, chunky baby boomers everywhere."" And then there was President George W. Bush. There are no words to describe my gratitude for all the material he provided comedians. But he could also be intentionally funny at his own expense. Gallery: President Obama: A year in facial expressions . At the 2001 Correspondents' Dinner, Bush took out a book written about his verbal gaffes and reviewed them with the audience. One of the funniest moments was regarding his famous grammatically incorrect line ""Rarely is the question asked: 'Is our children learning?' "" Bush then comically explained, ""If they would read it closely, they would see I'm using the transitive plural tense, so the word 'is' are correct."" Now, let's look at Obama. Yes, he has often used self-deprecating humor. For example, at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner, he joked, ""Some people now suggest that I'm too professorial. And I'd like to address that head-on by assigning all of you some reading that will help you draw your own conclusions."" But here's where Obama has increasingly taken presidential comedy to a new place. At that same event, Obama took on two critics point-blank, using cutting humor. The first was the thin-skinned Donald Trump, who at that time was considering running for president against Obama in 2012. Obama made three sharply barbed jokes at Trump's expense. One was about how trivial Trump's decisions on ""The Apprentice"" were when compared with that of the POTUS. The second ridiculed Trump for what he would allegedly do to the White House if he won: turn it into a garish-looking hotel and spa. And Obama mocked Trump's obsession with the ""birther"" issue by joking that, next, ""The Donald"" would focus on topics like ""Did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?"" Obama then took on actor Matt Damon, who had been publicly critical of the president. Obama quipped, ""Matt Damon said he was disappointed in my performance. Well, Matt, I just saw 'The Adjustment Bureau,' so right back atcha, buddy."" At the 2012 Correspondents' Dinner, Obama took on his then-opponent Mitt Romney: ""I guess Gov. Romney is feeling pretty good about things, because he took a few hours off the other day to see 'The Hunger Games.' ... It's a movie about people who court wealthy sponsors and then brutally savage each other until only one contestant is left standing. I'm sure this was a really good change of pace for him."" Gallery: Obama's face all over the place . And then at the Alfred E. Smith Dinner in New York a few weeks before the most recent presidential election, Obama mocked Romney again: ""Earlier today, I went shopping at some stores in Midtown. I understand Gov. Romney went shopping for some stores in Midtown."" And we even saw it on display again this week when Obama joked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he was happy to be in the Middle East because it's, ""good to get away from Congress."" Clearly, Republican House Speaker John Boehner understood who Obama was targeting with this joke, telling CNN's Jake Tapper, ""I'd rather be heckled than ignored."" You can dismiss these as simply jokes, but then you aren't grasping how political comedy works. These jokes are funny but also have a message embedded within. For example, the jokes about Romney intentionally furthered the image Obama wanted to paint of Mitt, namely that he was very wealthy and out of touch with the average person. The change in presidential humor, I believe, can be traced to the influence of ""The Daily Show."" Since 1999, Jon Stewart has redefined political comedy, using it to entertain, educate and eviscerate. Obama and his joke-writers have simply embraced this style of political comedy to comically undermine critics. Like it or not, those seeking the presidency in 2016 better do more than build a network of fundraisers and supporters. You'd better work on your comedic barbs, because American politics is becoming the country's toughest room to play. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah.","Dean Obeidallah says Obama uses jokes like many comedians do: as weapons .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- A gold mine in the western Sudanese state of Darfur collapsed this week, killing scores of people and leaving many still unaccounted for, an official says. ""Fifty-two bodies have so far been recovered,"" said Yaqub al-Damuki, minister of information for the Darfur Regional Authority. ""But the search is still going on."" State-run Ashorooq TV, quoting a local official, reported Thursday that the collapse killed more than 60 people. It said the accident occurred after people dug in dangerous areas of the mine. The mine collapsed in the Jebel Amir area of the town of El Serief in north Darfur on Monday, an eyewitness said. Fighting between two Arab tribes over land and mining rights in the area this year has killed hundreds of people. The violence in the area has also sent thousands into camps for internally displaced people. Independent gold mining has seen a boom in Sudan in the past few years, as the country looks for new sources to boost its economy. In 2011, South Sudan separated from Sudan, taking with it most of the country's oil revenue. One eyewitness said that the mines in the area were not well organized. ""The mining tunnels were very close to each other,"" Hamid al-Tijani said, adding that area mines ""were supposed to be closed and then reorganized."" ""But that did not happen."" The death toll, al-Tijani said, could get higher. ""Anyone not accounted for is presumed dead,"" he said. Authorities ordered the mine shut until calm is restored in the region.","Darfur Regional Authority official says 52 bodies have been recovered .

There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries in Michoacan, according to state civil protection officials. Some people in the capital said they could feel the tremors. Some neighborhoods there were without power, according to a preliminary report from the federal electrical commission. The quake was 46 miles deep, the USGS said.

"(Departures.com) -- Sumptuous restaurant meals are one of the decadent pleasures of traveling. But there are times -- say, after a long day of exploring or business meetings -- when the idea of eating dinner in a bathrobe seems equally compelling. Happily, now that many of the world's top hotels offer five-star room service, there's no need to sacrifice haute cuisine for comfort. Once considered the last resort of weary business travelers (and the subject of Marx Brothers' comedy), room-service dining has finally come into its own. Gone are the days when hotel guests could expect only defrosted seafood and soggy breakfast pastries on their trays; now, sophisticated dishes made with artisanal ingredients are making their way upstairs. Some are even whipped up by superstar chefs; at New York City's Chambers Hotel, for instance, guests can order sublime French-Asian dishes from Má Pêche, the ground-floor restaurant run by David Chang (of Momofuku fame). Among the many other room-service treats you won't need to lift a finger to enjoy (unless that finger is helping to hold a fork) are lunchtime specialties like Wagyu-pastrami sandwiches (at the Little Nell in Aspen) and custom-mixed cocktails (at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel). The delivery is as memorable as the food at Twin Farms in Vermont, where servers light candles, uncork wine and dim the lights for a private romantic dinner. The pièce de résistance, though, may well be at Le Taha'a, a French Polynesian getaway, where ukulele-strumming canoeists deliver breakfast to guests' overwater bungalows.

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts child welfare authorities have found no evidence of neglect or abuse connected with a 10-year-old Brockton rapper who does adult-themed music videos. Local police filed a complaint in February against the child's father, prompting an investigation that was terminated Thursday, Department of Children and Families spokeswoman Cayenne Isaksen told CNN. The child, Luie Rivera Jr., whose stage name is ""Lil Poopy,"" is seen in videos posted online, including on YouTube, smacking a woman's backside, flashing wads of cash, riding in a Ferrari, dancing with women in sexually suggestive positions and rapping about how ""coke is not a bad word."" Lil Poopy is a member of the group Coke Boys, led by internationally known Moroccan-born rapper French Montana. He has also performed alongside hip hop moguls such as P. Diddy. Joseph Krowski Jr., Rivera's attorney, said the family is ""happy and relieved it's over, but disappointed that it ever got this far."" ""I, as a lawyer, didn't understand how it could go to a Department of Child and Families 51 A investigation,"" he told CNN, referring to the section of state law that covers such cases. ""Those investigations are reserved for situations where there's an imminent threat of severe abuse to a child."" According to Isaksen, anyone can file a 51 A report, which is an allegation of child abuse and/or neglect; in fact, she told CNN the agency encourages the public to do so. But it's the department's responsibility to determine whether the report is valid, Isaksen said. Krowski said he believes a racially motivated double standard was applied to his client, who he said turned 10 in February, and his family, which is of Puerto Rican descent. ""You can find Hollywood, white actors depicted in much more racy films. They receive praise and acclaim,"" he said. ""Then you look at a video that has brown-color skin and they're engaged in rap music and that invites an investigation."" Isaksen declined to comment on whether Rivera's race fueled the investigation. According to Krowski, the investigation was based on small ""snippets"" of Rivera's music. He said his client also raps about more age-appropriate topics, like sports and school. Despite the investigation, which Krowski called ""offensive,"" the amount of media exposure has been ""a bonus"" to Rivera's budding career as a rapper. Krowski said his client has received an outpouring of offers to do shows and go on tour. Still, Krowski said the Rivera family ""would have rather done it the other way.""","No neglect or abuse tied to 10-year-old rapper on music videos, officials say .

"(CNN) -- One moment they were reeling in a fish, and the next they were shipwrecked . Two American siblings, Dan and Kate Suski, are recovering on the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia after a weekend fishing trip turned into a harrowing experience. Their charter boat sank Sunday, and the pair endured many hours in the water before reaching a beach, a Saint Lucia police detective said. Four people were on the boat -- the two Americans, a captain and one crew member. A Saint Lucia resident found the Suski siblings on the beach and called police, the detective said. The captain and crew member were found hours later. ""We are feeling stronger each day and looking forward to reuniting with family and friends,"" Dan Suski told CNN via e-mail. He and his sister expect to return to the United States by Sunday. ""They told me they had a fish on the line, and were fighting the fish, then heard a noise,"" said David Suski, an older brother who was not on the trip but was briefed by his siblings. The captain checked out the engine room, which was filling up with water, David Suski said. It was only about ""three to five minutes from the time they heard the noise to when they had to abandon the boat and it sank,"" he said. The sea was very rough, and it soon became dark, David Suski said. Officials later told them their boat sank about 12 miles off the coast.

"(CNN) -- Imagine you served for one year with the U.S. Army in Iraq. Imagine you served an additional tour in Afghanistan a year later. And imagine being injured in that last tour after a roadside bomb exploded from beneath a trashcan as your Humvee rolled by. Your buddy sitting next to you was killed. After you left the Army and returned home, you had trouble focusing. You had headaches and issues with your vision. You realize you returned with what might be a Traumatic Brain Injury. And maybe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, too. Imagine you also have two kids younger than 7 who haven't seen you very much for the last half decade. Imagine you're struggling to find a job. You've got a lot on your plate. And you're understandably stressed. You don't want to let down your family. And you don't want to be viewed as weak or a wimp by your buddies. Opinion: Why women are less free after Iraq War . You summon the courage to overcome the stigma, and you go to your local Department of Veterans Affairs to get some help. You file a claim for disability benefits to get the care and compensation you've earned and the support you need to keep your family afloat financially. You're hopeful. Now imagine waiting 600 days before you get an answer from the Department of Veterans Affairs. 600 days. 600 days of staring at your mailbox. 600 days of phone calls to check in. 600 days of bills piling up. 600 days of disappointment. Sounds crazy, right? Well, for thousands of veterans nationwide, it's real life. If you are a young vet who's filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs in New York or Los Angeles, you will wait an average of 600 days. And you're not alone. More than 900,000 veterans of all generations are stuck in a bureaucratic logjam that, in 2013, is the almost too absurd to believe. After 10 years of war, three VA secretaries, and an increase in the overall department budget of 40% since 2009, an incredible 97% of veteran's claims are still on paper. Yep, paper. America has soldiers in Nevada piloting drones remotely that can strike a target thousands of miles and two continents away, but 97% of our veterans' benefits claims are still on paper. Earlier this month, the Center for Investigative Reporting released a leaked internal VA document that showed the entire world what veterans nationwide have known for years: the VA backlog problem is even worse than reported. The VA has reported that the average claim wait time was 273 days. For the first claim filed, it's longer: 316 to 327 days. In Los Angeles, that figure is 619. In New York, it's 642. In Indianapolis, it's 612 days. And vets with first-time claims in Reno, Nevada, wait 681 days. The VA has testified that it has hired 3,300 new claims processors, but it has failed to report that, because of staff turnover, the net increase in processors is only 300 since 2010. And, in Chicago; Waco, Texas; and Oakland, California, the overall number of claims processors has gone down. Since the internal documents were leaked last week, we've yet to see a public response from VA Secretary Eric Shinseki or from the commander in chief. Some 2.6 million men and woman answered the call to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. But now, a decade later, President Barack Obama is not answering their calls for help. And the public still doesn't seem to get it. That's why this week I'm joining veterans from across America as we take our stories to Washington. Hans Blix: Why invading Iraq was a terrible mistake . Veteran leaders from some 22 states are converging on the Capitol to ""Storm the Hill,"" where we'll be pressing elected officials to confront and solve the backlog. You can see their faces and read about their stories at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America website, www.IAVA.org. They are an amazing group of men and women (and one dog) that have overcome tremendous obstacles. And now, they're taking on another one: the VA backlog. Just like we've been trained, we won't quit until the job is done. No matter how long it takes, we'll keep fighting. Our brothers and sisters deserve support for their sacrifices. And every single American should stand with us to #EndTheVAbacklog once and for all. Ten years after the start of the Iraq War, there are a lot of folks who say they support the troops. Now is the time for them to show it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Rieckhoff.","Paul Rieckhoff: Afghanistan, Iraq veterans can wait 600 days or longer for claim response .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams avenged her 2009 French Open defeat against Svetlana Kuznetsova when beating the unseeded Russian 6-1 3-6 6-3 in a gripping quarterfinal. Kuznetsova lifted the trophy at Roland Garros in 2009 but was unable to repeat her success despite breaking the world No. 1's serve for the first time in the tournament. Williams cruised to the first set in 28 minutes but that was an inaccurate barometer of what was to come, with the remainder of the match taking an hour and a half. Despite Kuznetsova taking an early break in the third set, Williams found another level to reach the French Open semifinals for the first time since 2003. The 31-year-old may have 15 grand slams to her name but she will be conscious that only one of those came in Paris, back in 2002 when beating sister Venus in the final. ""I was so determined to get through that match, and I really, really, really wanted it more than anyone, I think,"" she told reporters afterwards. ""I was really just fighting, giving it everything I had out there. I've been able to come back a lot throughout my career. I don't think anything really changed."" Victory extended Williams' record winning streak to 29 matches, a run that has only been bettered by her sister Venus (35) and Belgium's Justine Henin (32) this century. She will face Italian fifth seed Sara Errani in the semifinal after last year's runner-up continued her fine form at Roland Garros when beating fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska 6-4 7-6 (8-6). The victory was Errani's first against a player ranked in the top five and now she must beat Williams for the first time if she is to return to the final, where she was beaten by Maria Sharapova last year. Former champion Monica Seles, who won the French Open three times between 1990-1992, believes Errani's chances are slim. ""I think Serena is playing the best clay court tennis of her life,"" she told CNN. ""I think that having a tough match like she did today, when she played three sets, will only make her stronger. She's also as focused as I've ever seen her."" Williams may have lost in the first round in Paris last year but she has dominated the women's game since -- winning Wimbledon, the Olympic singles and doubles, the U.S. Open and the WTA Championships. After paying tribute to Kuznetsova, who came into Roland Garros ranked No. 39 after missing the second half of last year with a knee injury, Williams turned her attentions to an opponent against whom she boasts a 5-0 record. ""Svetlana played very well,"" she said after her toughest match of the championships. ""She's such a great player. She's taken a little time off due to injury, but she's been consistent, at least in the slams. ""She has won this tournament before so I am happy to get through such a tough match. It was very difficult and I am very tired. ""Against Sara, it will be another tough match, she's a great fighter."" Errani is now through to her third grand slam semifinal, having also made the last four at the U.S. Open last year. Having finally ended a run of 28 matches against players ranked in the top five, she is now hoping that Williams' relative lack of success may count in her favor. ""It's going to be very difficult because she's very strong, and physically she's an incredible athlete,"" Errani said. ""She has a lot of power and it's never easy to play against her. But maybe clay is a bit better than the other surfaces for me."" On Wednesday, defending champion Sharapova takes on Jelena Jankovic and Maria Kirilenko faces Victoria Azarenka in the remaining quarterfinals.","Serena Williams beats 2009 French Open Svetlana Kuznetsova in three sets .

"Rome (CNN) -- With only two full days left of Pope Benedict XVI's papacy, more details emerged Tuesday of what the future holds both for the retiring pontiff and the cardinals who will choose his successor. The pontiff will keep the name Benedict XVI and still be addressed as ""his holiness"" once he retires, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told reporters at the Vatican. Interactive: Where does the pope live? He will also be known as pope emeritus, emeritus pope or Roman pontifex emeritus. The guidance clears up questions about how Benedict -- the first pope to resign in almost 600 years -- should be addressed as he moves into a life of seclusion and prayer after his Thursday resignation. Benedict will hold his final general audience Wednesday, for which 50,000 tickets have been given out, Lombardi said, though many more people than that could show up. The pope in retirement: What to expect . Benedict will arrive in his Popemobile, which will drive around St. Peter's Square among the faithful before the pope gives the address. He won't give the usual brief personal greetings to people afterward but will meet delegations of heads of state in Vatican City later. Benedict will meet with the cardinals who are already in Rome on Thursday morning. The 85-year-old will then be flown by helicopter to Castel Gandolfo, the pope's summer residence near Rome, in the afternoon. The church bell will toll and he will make his very last public appearance, greeting crowds from a balcony there. At the moment that Benedict's papacy ends, at 8 p.m. local time, the Swiss Guards -- the soldiers who for more than five centuries have protected the pope and his residence -- will leave the gates of Castel Gandolfo. He will from that point have Vatican police protection instead. Benedict will stay there until work to restore a monastery within the Vatican grounds is completed later in the spring. Scandal threatens to overshadow pope's final days . Cardinals gather . Meanwhile, the cardinals who must elect the new pope are already gathering in Rome, Lombardi said. The dean cardinal will on March 1 summon the cardinals to a general congregation, Lombardi said. That could come as soon as March 4, although the date is not yet fixed. The cardinals will then decide exactly when to hold the conclave, during which they vote for the new pontiff. Special prayers will be said during the ""sede vacante,"" or empty seat, period, seeking guidance for the election of the new pope. The cardinals will lead the prayers. After his resignation, Benedict -- who cited the frailty of age as the reason he resigned -- will no longer use the Fisherman's Ring, the symbol of the pope, Lombardi said. The ring will be destroyed, along with Benedict's papal seal, after his departure from office. He will wear a simple white cassock, without the customary red mantle of the pontiff. He will also no longer wear red shoes, probably adopting instead the brown shoes that he received as a gift in Leon, Mexico, during a trip last year. Pope leads final public prayer . Swirling rumors . Benedict shocked the Roman Catholic world when he announced his resignation two weeks ago. His final week in office has been clouded by scandal, with allegations swirling in the Italian media that gay clergy may have made themselves vulnerable to blackmail by male prostitutes. The Vatican vehemently denied the allegations Saturday. Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said it was ""deplorable"" that as the time for the Roman Catholic cardinals to elect a new pope approaches, a rash of ""often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories"" has appeared. Benedict also moved up the resignation Monday of a Scottish archbishop linked over the weekend by a British newspaper to inappropriate relationships with priests. Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the archbishop of Scotland, told the pope in November that he would resign effective on his 75th birthday, on March 17. Opinion: Benedict a pope aware of his flaws . But Benedict decided to make the resignation effective immediately in light of the pope's imminent resignation, the Scottish Catholic Media Office said. The announcement came a day after a report by the British Sunday newspaper The Observer that three priests and one former priest leveled allegations against O'Brien that date back 30 years. Speaking in London on Tuesday, one of Britain's most senior Roman Catholics, the former Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, described the circumstances of O'Brien's resignation as ""very sad."" Murphy-O'Connor said that it was O'Brien's decision to step down and that he had not been forced or asked to do so. He described O'Brien as a ""very honest man."" An apostolic administrator, most likely a senior bishop, will examine the allegations against O'Brien, Murphy-O'Connor said. He also said he was in no doubt that there needs to be reform within the Roman Catholic Church and that the issues being raised now need to be addressed ""at the highest level."" CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. Jo Shelley contributed to this report.","Benedict XVI will keep his name and still be addressed as ""his holiness"" after he resigns .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan agreed to spend 90 days in a ""locked in"" drug rehab facility as part of a plea deal to settle criminal charges against her Monday. The actress entered pleas of no contest on two misdemeanor charges relating to a traffic accident last summer, and she did not challenge the finding that she violated her shoplifting probation with those convictions. ""A suggestion -- don't drive,"" Los Angeles Superior Judge James Dabney told Lohan after he handed down her sentence. Her six years of legal troubles trace back to two drunken driving arrests in 2007 and include other incidents in which she was behind the wheel. While Michael Lohan was satisfied his daughter would get drug treatment in rehab -- not jail -- her father expressed anger outside the courthouse with her lawyer, Mark Heller. ""I want to know why are you're still up here?"" Michael Lohan shouted at Heller. ""Go home, you've done enough damage. Leave my daughter alone and stay out of the press. You're a parasite."" Lawyer: Lindsay Lohan needs luck . Lohan said Heller ""just wants to use my daughter as way to get his name in the papers."" A sheriff's deputy stepped between Michael Lohan and Heller to separate the men. ""My reaction is one of sadness and compassion for the conduct that that gentleman is displaying publicly,"" Heller told reporters later. Michael Lohan accused Heller of unethical and criminal conduct in his representation of his daughter, saying prosecutors were investigating Heller for tampering with ""a star witness"" in Lohan's case. ""It is an open investigation and they just told me they are investigating him,"" Michael Lohan said. Los Angeles County district attorney spokeswoman Jane Robison said that office is not involved in the case. The spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney's office said he was unaware of any probe. The spokeman for the Santa Monica city attorney's office, which was involved in the case, did not immediately respond to CNN's call. Heller said he was not aware of what Michael Lohan was alleging. ""That's a very sad and unfortunate statement,"" Heller said. ""Anybody is able in this great country to make any allegations that they want."" He then brought the interview back to Lindsay Lohan. ""The only issue here today is that a sweet, wonderful 26-year-old girl has finally been able to bring some closure to a chapter in her life that has been very unfortunate,"" Heller sad. ""Lindsay Lohan has been very fragile and very concerned by what's been happening here and the only thing I've been concerned about is that we've been able to give her story a very, very happy ending."" Lindsay Lohan: The reality show we don't want to watch . She is ""now on a wonderful path and a journey that I think is going to be very rewarding,"" he said. ""Today marks the first day of the rest of her life and her comeback is right before us."" Although Lohan was sentenced to jail time, including five days and 90 days on two charges, the judge will allow her to serve it in rehab. The sentence extends Lohan's probation for two years and requires 18 months of psychotherapy. ""This is it,"" Dabney told her. ""You violate your probation, and we're not going to have discussions of putting you back on probation."" Lohan was charged with reckless driving and lying to a police officer about a June 2012 car crash in which her Porsche crashed in to a dump truck on the Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica, California. Her arrest triggered the probation violation charge. The police report said Lohan denied being behind the wheel, but the prosecutor was expected to call witnesses who say she was driving. ""I think Lindsay needed to go and just deal with some of her issues,"" her father said Monday. ""She got exactly what she needs. Lindsay Lohan acknowledged her drug and alcohol addiction in past court appearances. She's spent 250 days in five rehab facilities since January 2007, including one long court-ordered stint after a failed drug test. The actress has appeared in court at least 20 times before four Los Angeles judges who have now found her in violation of probation six times and sentenced her to a total of nine months in jail. Lohan has spent about two weeks behind bars in six trips to the Los Angeles County jail, served 35 days under house arrest and worked about 67 days of community service at the county morgue.
