"Good or bad, TripAdvisor usually thrives on reviews -- but when antitrust officials in Italy gave their damning opinion of the travel website, it wasn't quite so happy. Slapped with a 500,000 euro fine ($611,000) for unfair trade activity and ""misleading consumers,"" TripAdvisor has hit back, accusing the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) of being out of touch. ""We think the ruling is unreasonable, strongly disagree with its findings and will file an appeal,"" it said in a statement. ""We firmly believe that TripAdvisor is a force for good -- both for consumers and the hospitality industry."" The regulator complained that people reading TripAdvisor Italy were unable to distinguish between genuine and fake reviews posted on the site. It said both were presented by TripAdvisor as ""authentic and genuine in nature."" Demanding payment of the fine within 30 days, the ICA also accused the travel company of failing to provide proper checks to weed out bogus postings. It said TripAdvisor Italy had fallen foul of three articles of the Italian consumer code, ""making it likely to mislead a wide audience of consumers."" 'Zero tolerance' In its response, TripAdvisor said it took aggressive action to fight fraud and had adequate systems in place to prevent it. It complained that the Italian watchdog's ""zero tolerance"" rules meant it would be liable to the same punishment even if just one review out of millions was deemed questionable. ""From our initial review we believe that the ICA's recommendations are unwarranted and out of touch with commercial realities, not just of a user-generated content business, but of any company in any sector,"" it said. ""The bottom line is, if people didn't find the reviews helpful, they wouldn't keep coming back to our site."" Founded in February 2000, TripAdvisor now claims to be the world's largest travel website, hosting millions of reviews from its community of users. The now ubiquitous write-ups have caused numerous upsets within the travel industry, with some operators and hotels complaining of being unfairly maligned. In one recent case, a hotel in Blackpool, England, fined a guest who posted a bad review calling the establishment ""filthy,"" ""dirty"" and ""rotten.""","Italian antitrust body levies $611,000 fine against TripAdvisor Italy .

"President Barack Obama is taking some heat from Republicans on Capitol Hill for reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba, but a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday shows he has the public's backing. About six in 10 Americans favor diplomatic relations with Cuba and two-thirds want the travel restrictions to the island lifted, according to the poll of 1,011 Americans conducted after Obama announced a landmark deal with Cuba to relax sanctions and ease some travel restrictions. Obama relaxed some sanctions and gave a green light to establish an embassy in Havana, but he can't end the embargo against Cuba outright without Congressional approval. More than half of Americans surveyed -- 55% — want the embargo lifted. Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee like Sens. Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham of Florida and South Carolina, respectively, said last week they will pull all the stops to undercut Obama's steps to normalize relations, vowing to hold up funds for the embassy and keep Obama's nominee for ambassador to Cuba from clearing the Senate. Related: Read the full CNN / ORC poll on Cuba . Christie to Obama: Tell Cuba to hand over cop killer . Rubio, whose parents emigrated from Cuba, has led the charge against Obama's accord with Cuba and President Raul Castro, charging Obama with giving away a huge chunk of the U.S.'s leverage to spur political reform in the country. But supporters of the deal to normalize relations say more diplomatic and economic engagement is the key to opening up Cuban society and encouraging democratization. Regardless, Americans continue to have an unfavorable view of Cuba's former leader Fidel Castro, with 81% holding a negative opinion of the former leader and brother of the country's current president.","63% of Americans favor reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba .

"As far as manhunts go, Eric Matthew Frein is an especially challenging target. The suspected cop killer has extensive training as a marksman. Police say he's a survivalist who knows his way around the woods where they think he's hiding. And authorities worry he may be on the hunt for more officers. Here's what we know about Frein, the 31-year-old wanted for the death of Pennsylvania State Police Cpl. Bryon Dickson and the shooting of another officer a week and a half ago. Police say he'd been plotting his attack for months . Before Dickson and Trooper Alex Douglass were shot outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove on September 12, Frein had been mulling an ambush for months, authorities say. ""Based on our investigations, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years,"" State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Sunday. Investigators know Frein ""has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder,"" State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said last week. ""He has very strong feelings about law enforcement and seems to be very angry with a lot of things that go on in our society."" Bivens said while Frein planned his attack and retreat, ""we believe we are closing in on him."" He's the subject of an intense manhunt . Up to 400 law enforcement officers are searching for Frein, including members of the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They've zeroed in on the woods not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis -- about 20 miles from where Dickson and Douglass were shot. His evasiveness has led schools to cancel classes and prompted authorities to ask hunters to avoid the woods in the area. Although Frein is on the run and possibly armed, there is no indication that he is a danger to anyone other than law enforcement, Bivens said. ""I am convinced that Frein has engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement, specifically the Pennsylvania State Police, and will likely stay focused on that fight,"" he said. He's fascinated by the Cold War . Frein claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa and has studied Russian and Serbian languages, according to the FBI. He even belonged to a simulation group that re-enacted Cold War-era European conflicts, officials said. The simulation group, which police declined to name, would use non-lethal Airsoft guns. But authorities believe Frein has turned a non-lethal activity lethal. ""It is believed that Frein has assumed the simulation role, and is now acting it out in real life,"" Bivens said. Frein started wearing a ""mohawk""-type haircut -- different from what he had worn for years -- apparently as part of his mental preparation for his attacks on the troopers, Bivens said. He harbors a grudge against cops . While authorities believe Frein has an intense grudge against law enforcement, one friend said his angst is actually against the federal government. ""He definitely let his opinions about the government be known,"" the friend, who wanted to be identified only as ""Jack,"" told CNN. ""He was obviously a big critic of the federal government, but he never specifically targeted police when he was talking to me,"" Jack said. ""No indications of really any malice towards law enforcement in particular. Most of his aggression was (toward) the federal government."" But others close to Frein told investigators that he had talked about his disdain for law enforcement, authorities said. ""This was nothing he kept quiet,"" Noonan said, adding that he wished those people had spoken up before the shootings. He's a skilled marksman . A trail of clues led authorities to execute a search warrant on the suspect's family's home. That's when Frein's father told authorities that two firearms were missing, according to a probable cause affidavit. The father said one of those missing firearms was an AK-47; the other was a .308 rifle, which police believe was the same type of rifle used to shoot the troopers. The father said his son grew up with guns and was a member of his high school's rifle club. When Frein shoots, his father told authorities, he ""doesn't miss.""","Eric Matthew Frein, 31, is wanted for the shootings of two Pennsylvania police officers .

"(CNN)Bold claims for new battery technology have been around since the invention of the lead-acid battery more than 150 years ago. But researchers at Manchester University in the UK say their latest discovery involving the new wonder material graphene could be the most revolutionary advance in battery technology yet. According to a study published in the journal Nature, graphene membranes could be used to sieve hydrogen gas from the atmosphere -- a development that could pave the way for electric generators powered by air. ""It looks extremely simple and equally promising,"" said Dr Sheng Hu, a post-doctoral researcher in the project. ""Because graphene can be produced these days in square metre sheets, we hope that it will find its way to commercial fuel cells sooner rather than later."" Pencil power . At the heart of the technology is the remarkable physical properties of graphene -- a substance with the same atomic structure as the lead found in the humble household pencil. Isolated in 2004 by a team from Manchester University headed by Andrew Geim and Kostya Novoselov -- both of whom won the Nobel Prize for Physics for their discovery in 2010 -- graphene is already well known as a technological game-changer. The first two-dimensional crystal known to science, graphene is the thinnest, lightest and strongest object ever obtained. It is harder than diamond and 200 times stronger than steel. Flexible, transparent and able to conduct electricity even better than copper, the ground-breaking substance is set to revolutionize everything from smartphones and wearable technology to green technology and medicine. Renowned for its barrier qualities, graphene is just one atom thick - more than a million times thinner than a human hair. Membrane technology . The latest discovery makes graphene attractive for possible uses in proton-conducting membranes which are at the core of modern fuel-cell technology. Fuel cells work by using oxygen and hydrogen as a fuel, converting the chemical energy produced by its input directly into electricity. However, current membranes that separate the protons necessary for this process are relatively inefficient, allowing contamination in the fuel crossover. Using graphene membranes could boost their efficiency and durability. The team found the protons passed through the ultra-thin crystals with relative ease, especially at raised temperatures and with the use of a platinum-based catalyst coated on the membrane film. Harvesting hydrogen . The most surprising aspect of the research, however, found the membranes could be used to extract hydrogen from the atmosphere. The scientists said such harvesting could be combined with fuel cells to create a mobile electric generator fueled simply by hydrogen present in air. ""When you know how it should work, it is a very simple setup. You put a hydrogen-containing gas on one side, apply small electric current and collect pure hydrogen on the other side. This hydrogen can then be burned in a fuel cell. ""We worked with small membranes, and the achieved flow of hydrogen is of course tiny so far. But this is the initial stage of discovery, and the paper is to make experts aware of the existing prospects. To build up and test hydrogen harvesters will require much further effort."" Currently, hydrogen is obtained nearly entirely from fossil fuels. Graphene revolution . Already scientists are finding new ways of processing graphene and new applications for the invisible substance. Because it is flexible and stretchable, it makes it an ideal candidate for solar generation. New research from the Institute of Photonic Sciences in Spain showed that graphene could be far more efficient in the transformation of light into energy. The study found that unlike silicon, which generates only one current-driving electron for each photon it absorbs, graphene can produce multiple electrons. Although the application of graphene in solar cells is only theoretical, the potential could be staggering. Solar cells made with graphene could offer 60% solar cell efficiency -- double the widely-regarded maximum efficiency of silicon cells. Apart from uses in transportation, where its lightness and strength stands to transform the manufacture of cars and planes to make them more fuel efficient, graphene has been studied as a corrosion-proof coating for packaging and even super-thin condoms. In medicine, researchers say it could be used to deliver drugs to specific sites in the body and is being developed as a treatment for people with brain conditions. In industry, its use as a membrane is being studied as a means of purifying water and even as a way of extracting salt and other elements from sea water to make it drinkable.

"Mark Twain first told us that truth can be stranger than fiction, which is of course true. But in this instance, it's funnier, too. That's the premise behind the off-Broadway comedy ""Tail! Spin!,"" the story of some of the most memorable political sex scandals of recent times. Remember these classics? Mark Sanford, former South Carolina Governor: ""As much as I did talk about going to the Appalachian Trail, that isn't where I ended up."" Anthony Weiner, former U.S. Congressman: ""I have engaged in several inappropriate conversations, conducted over Twitter, Facebook, email and occasionally on the phone with women I had met online."" Larry Craig, former Idaho Senator: ""I am not gay. I have never been gay."" It's those -- and hundreds of other priceless lines -- that make ""Tail! Spin!"" unique. The entire play -- every word -- is taken verbatim from the news conferences, interviews, books, texts and, yes, tweets of those involved. ""I realized I could never write the kinds of things that these guys actually said and have an audience believe them. And so that's when I realized, it's got to be verbatim, because that's the only way for folks to see what these things are actually like,"" said playwright Mario Correa. Different male actors play each of the infamous politicians but starring alongside them is Saturday Night Live alum Rachel Dratch who plays all of the wounded wives, mistresses and other women. She portrays 16 characters during the 75 minute performance. ""It pays far less than SNL, but it's good for me because it's, in general, my comfort zone. I started out [at Chicago's famed improve group] Second City doing sketch, and so the idea of like switching characters is kind of something I've been doing for a long time,"" Dratch told CNN. In fact, it wasn't the number of characters -- but rather what those characters were saying that first struck Dratch about the script. ""The thing I was most shocked at was the graphic nature of the talk. Like you hear like, 'oh they were sexting,' and then you see like what were they sexting and you're like, 'whoa.' This is beyond any of my sexting skills,"" Dratch said. Some of the exchanges -- especially messages sent by former U.S. Rep. Mark Foley during the Congressional Page scandal -- may not be fodder for a family website. But most of them confirm the suspicions of many ofthose already cynical about politics—that the main players somehow feel, no matter how they behave, they won't get caught. The difference between life and art in this instance is that the play pays as much attention to the aggrieved women as the offending men, nearly all of whom stood by their husbands during the scandals -- literally. Dratch had to channel what they would have been thinking appearing at those awkward press conferences. ""I imagine when the scandal hits, you know, maybe later they're going to marinate on it and make your decisions. But when it hits you probably just want to like air on the side of 'I'm going to believe what he says, I'm going to keep the family together, blah blah blah,'"" she said. ""I don't know I could see myself doing that in a whirlwind press thing. I'll put myself there or I'll sort it all out later with a skilled therapist."" Despite the starring role of infidelity, Correa -- a former Congressional staffer -- says his play is more about power than sex. ""I think a lot of us make mistakes in our personal lives, I know I have, but the reason we don't take these crazy, sort of outlandish risks and expect to get away with them is because we don't have power to protect us. But these guys are like, 'I'm a member of Congress, of course this is not going to come back to me, I've got a business card.'"" That's exactly what Larry Craig showed to a police officer after being confronted inside a restroom at the Minneapolis airport. Spoiler alert: It didn't help.","A play in New York stars Rachel Dratch and the dialogue is verbatim from political sex scandals .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexico City's thousands of stores went green Wednesday, as amended ordinances on solid waste now outlaw businesses from giving out thin plastic bags that are not biodegradable. Mexico City stores, such as this supermarket, can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags. The law affects all stores, production facilities and service providers within the Federal District, which encompasses the city limits. Nearly 9 million people live inside the district and another 10 million reside in surrounding communities that make up greater Mexico City. Mexico City becomes the second large metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere to outlaw the bags. San Francisco in March 2007 enacted an ordinance that gave supermarkets six months and large chain pharmacies about a year to phase out the bags. Los Angeles is set to impose a ban if the state of California does not enact a statewide 25-cent fee per bag by July. About 90 percent of the bags used in the United States are not recycled. Bans and other restrictions on plastic bags are in place in several countries. China has adopted a strict limit, reducing litter and eliminating the use of 40 billion bags, the World Watch Institute said, citing government estimates. Although compliance has been spotty, violation of the law carries a possible fine of 10,000 yuan ($1,463), World Watch said. In Tanzania, selling the bags carries a maximum six-month jail sentence and a fine of 1.5 million shilling ($1,137). Mumbai, India, outlawed the bags in 2000 and cities in Australia, Italy, South Africa and Taiwan have imposed bans or surcharges. Ireland reported cutting use of the bags by 90 percent after imposing a fee on each one. Some leading environmentalists are calling for a global ban on the bags. Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, says plastic bags are the second-most-common form of litter, behind cigarette butts. The bags are the greatest form of litter on the globe's oceans, the U.N. agency said in a recent report. The bags are also a major threat to ocean wildlife, causing the deaths of 100,000 sea turtles and other marine animals that mistake them for food. ""Thin-film, single-use plastic bags, which choke marine life, should be banned or phased out rapidly everywhere,"" Steiner said in June. ""There is simply zero justification for manufacturing them anymore, anywhere."" Mexico City, which has had some of the worst air pollution in the world, also is looking at improving its environment in other ways. The municipal government announced this month it will place more than 1,100 bicycles at 84 stations throughout the city for residents to use. Officials said they hope to increase bicycle use as a form of transportation to 5 percent, up from the current 1.2 percent.","Mexico City is Western Hemisphere's second large metro area to ban the bags .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A Web site that encourages girls as young as seven to give virtual dolls breast implants and put them on crash diets has caused concern among parents and children's activists. The provocatively named ""Miss Bimbo"" Web site launched in the UK last month and is described as a ""virtual fashion game for girls."" Girls are encouraged to compete against each other to become the ""hottest, coolest, most famous bimbo in the whole world."" When a girl signs up, they are given a naked virtual character to look after and pitted against other girls to earn ""bimbo"" dollars so they can dress her in sexy outfits and take her clubbing. Sound off: What do you think about the ""Miss Bimbo"" Web site? They are told ""stop at nothing,"" even ""meds or plastic surgery,"" to ensure their dolls win. Users are given missions, including securing plastic surgery at the game's clinic to give their dolls bigger breasts, and they have to keep her at her target weight with diet pills, which cost 100 bimbo dollars. Breast implants sell at 11,500 bimbo dollars and net the buyer 2,000 bimbo attitudes, making her more popular on the site. And bagging a billionaire boyfriend is the most desirable way to earn the all important ""mula"" or bimbo dollars. Working, it seems, is a bit of a chore in bimbo world. The site says: ""Bimbo dollars is 'the cabbage,' 'bread,' the 'mula' you'll need to buy nice things and to get by in bimbo world. To earn some bimbo cash you will have to (gasp) work or find a boyfriend to be your sugar daddy and hook you up with a phat expense account!"" The advice on feeding the dolls is even more spurious, encouraging them to feed the dolls ""every now and then"" even though they want to keep their Bimbos ""waif thin."" The British version already has nearly 200,000 players, most of whom are girls aged between 7 and 17, according to the Web site. Although it is free to play, when the contestants run out of virtual dollars they have to send cell phone text messages costing $3 each or use PayPal to top up their accounts. In France, where ""Miss Bimbo's"" sister Web site, ""Ma Bimbo,"" was criticized by dieticians and parents when it began last year, one parent threatened the creators with legal action after his daughter ran up a $200 mobile bill sending texts without his knowledge, according to the Times of London newspaper. Parents' groups are horrified that the game is taking off in Britain, fearing it could send the wrong message about eating disorders and plastic surgery to young girls . Bill Hibberd, of parents' rights group Parentkind, told the Times the game sends a dangerous message to young girls. He said: ""It is one thing if a child recognizes it as a silly and stupid game. ""But the danger is that a nine-year-old fails to appreciate the irony and sees the Bimbo as a cool role model. Then the game becomes a hazard and a menace."" One parent also told The Times the creators were irresponsible. Nick Williams said he was appalled when he saw his daughters Katie, nine, and Sarah, 14, playing the game. Williams, 42, an accountant, said: ""I noticed them looking at possible breast operations and facelifts for their bimbos at the game's plastic surgery clinic. ""Katie is far too young for that kind of thing and it is irresponsible of the site's creators to be leading young girls astray. They are easily influenced at that age as to what is cool."" However, the creators of ""Miss Bimbo"" claim it is ""harmless fun."" Nicolas Jacquart, the 23-year-old Web designer from Tooting, south London, who created it was quoted in the Daily Mail as saying: ""It is not a bad influence for young children. They learn to take care of their bimbos. The missions and goals are morally sound and teach children about the real world."" He added: ""The breast operations are just one part of the game and we are not encouraging young girls to have them, just reflecting real life.""

"The 32-year-old son of actor and kung fu star Jackie Chan has been charged with a drug offense and could face up to three years in jail. The Supreme People's Procuratorate said in a brief statement on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, that it had begun legal proceedings against actor Jaycee Chan for ""the crime of sheltering others to take drugs."" Chan, who is originally from Hong Kong, is one of the highest profile celebrity offenders caught in Beijing's clampdown on drug use in the city. He was arrested alongside 23 year-old Taiwanese actor Kai Ko in August this year. The pair were detained by Beijing police during a raid in Dongcheng district, the city's commercial and cultural center. Both men tested positive for marijuana and police later found more than 100 grams of the drug after searching Chan's apartment. Ko was released after 14 days in administrative detention, while Chan has remained in police custody since his arrest. State broadcaster CCTV aired footage of Chan, his face blurred, showing police where the drugs were hidden at his home, while Ko was shown making a tearful apology. ""I very much regret about what happened. I'm very sorry to those who support me, like me or even know me personally,"" he said. ""I just want to tell them I'm really sorry. I've set the worst example, which had the most terrible influence. And this is a huge mistake."" Celebrity targets . The two actors are being seen as the targets of the capital's latest anti-drugs campaign, which has seen more than 7,000 people detained for using drugs, a 72% year-on-year increase, according to the China Daily. Celebrities are increasingly in the spotlight, with a number of high-profile arrests over drug-related incidents in recent months, including popular movie actor Zhang Mo and singer Li Daimo, who was sentenced to nine months in jail earlier this year for hosting a crystal meth party at his home, according to the China Daily. Earlier this month, dozens of management agencies representing performers in the entertainment industry signed an agreement with Beijing authorities banning drug use from the industry and pledging to sack artists who break the law. 'Extremely furious' Jackie Chan publicly addressed the incident immediately after his son was arrested in August on Sina Weibo. He said he was ""extremely furious"" and ""extremely shocked"" at the news of his son's arrest. ""I hope that young people will see Jaycee as a cautionary tale and stay away from drugs,"" he said. ""I failed to teach my son and I should also bear responsibility. Jaycee and I deeply bow in apology to society."" The elder Chan, who has starred in a number of Hollywood movies including ""Rush Hour"" and ""The Karate Kid,"" has actually campaigned against drug use, and was named an anti-drugs ambassador in China in 2009.

"When it comes to romance, texting is often seen as a bare-minimum form of communication. It's fine for firming up Wednesday night dinner plans, but for expressing heartfelt sentiments? Not so much. That was made pretty clear last week when reality TV star Kristin Cavallari had to defend her fiancé, Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, from those who poked fun at her story of their second engagement. ""I was in the airport, leaving Chicago,"" Cavallari, 26, tells E! News in an upcoming reality special about her nuptials. ""We had just spent however many days together and we were texting and somehow it came up, like, 'Oh, shall we get married?' We're like, 'Yeah, OK.'"" The couple were first engaged in 2011 but split up briefly before reconciling that same year. Even so, Cutler faced criticism over what many saw as a too casual digital proposal. Cavallari later pleaded on Twitter for people to ""stop bashing Jay"" because he had proposed earlier in Mexico ""and it was very romantic."" In the digital age, technology isn't killing courtship. But for many young couples, it's redefining what romance looks like. These days we often text instead of speak, use FaceTime instead of having face-to-face discussions and zip through online dating profiles with the same speed it takes to order a pizza. Convenient, sure, but ""The Notebook"" it's not. These habits have many wondering if technology is getting in the way of real romance. But let's be honest: How many of us have gotten into a heated, or just plain hot, text exchange with a love interest? Chances are, many of the messages saved in your phone are more intimate than your standard pillow talk. From AOL to OKCupid . Since the early days of the Internet, we've used tech as a tool to broaden our prospects for meeting others and finding romance. We've come a long way since those AOL chat rooms, and even traditional dating sites are giving way to smartphone apps that can do the matchmaking for us. Using your phone's GPS feature, mobile social apps such as Blendr, Grindr, Are You Interested? and Plenty of Fish help you zero in on potential dates, or hook-ups, right around the corner. The upside of online dating: Always a funny story to tell . For the daring, OkCupid recently launched a Russian Roulette-style app called CrazyBlindDate, which sets users up on short notice with someone they know almost nothing about. It's not exactly the romanticized version of a fateful meeting, wherein you find your soul mate at spin class or in line for a movie matinee. The lost art of offline dating . ""Those really romantic scenarios are kind of diluted nowadays,"" said Philip Wang, co-founder of Wong Fu Productions, a new-media production company based in Southern California that creates short films and video blogs. Wang and his colleagues created a video series called ""Technology Ruins Romance,"" which makes light of the ways technology could easily solve dilemmas that have been held up as ""romantic"" obstacles. The idea came from watching ""rom-coms where you're sitting there thinking, 'things could've been totally solved if he took out his cell phone, or just messaged her on Facebook,'"" says Wang, 28. ""I understand that movies are meant to escape reality, but even just for fun, you could say, wait, why isn't he just calling her instead of showing up outside of her door and surprising her?"" A lot of the mystery we've typically associated with romance is ""not as strong as it used to be,"" Wang said. The power of Facebook . Some young single people today would rather have information than mystery. When Jason Austin, a 29-year-old IT professional, was skeptical of a potential date he'd met online, he did what anyone who's seen an episode of ""Catfish"" (or just has plain common sense) would do: He turned to Facebook. ""I wanted to know something about her, I can't say that I'm not nosy,""  said Austin, who lives in Pontiac, Michigan. ""I didn't feel comfortable with the information she was telling me. I would text her, possibly when I get off work, I would give her a call and she wouldn't answer, [but] she would text me in the morning and say 'Hey, how was your day yesterday?' It made me kind of suspicious. So in that particular situation, I Googled her."" On her Facebook page, Austin could see ""friends of friends,"" which allows one to see so much more information, he said. ""If you read the comments, you can find out details about that picture, which tells you details about that person."" There can be drawbacks to this Facebook sleuthing, said Dr. Corinne Weisgerber, an associate professor of communication at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. Brushing up on someone's background pre-date means you could skip over some of those foundational moments of discovery in person, she said. But for Michelle Granoski of La Grange, Kentucky, digital tools enhanced her courtship with Shawn Granoski, the man who would become her husband. She came across Shawn's profile on dating site Plenty of Fish and warmed to his photo, which showed him wearing a Mario T-shirt under a black blazer. She messaged him to strike up a conversation. He is not a big phone person and only wanted to talk over AOL instant messenger. Granoski, 26, went along with it after looking him up on Facebook and liking what she found. ""I Facebooked him, and it actually did help. ... If I were to discover his favorite color online, I don't think I would've had any different reaction than I would've had in person,"" she said. After chatting online for two weeks, Shawn drove down from Louisville to meet Granoski while she was a student at Western Kentucky University. Soon they were taking turns driving to see each other, and tied the knot three years later. Romance, on Skype . Although meeting in person will always be essential, the concept of romance has evolved to the point where weeks of instant messaging or e-mailing can plant seeds of a relationship. That's been the case for 20-year-old Cristina Lara, a Cornell University student who relies on Skype and e-mail to nurture her long-distance relationship with her boyfriend, Joshua Mbanusi, while he's working in North Carolina. From the beginning, their courtship was carried out through digital means. Lara's boyfriend, a Cornell alum, asked for her e-mail address instead of her number at first. While some might have taken that as a hint of disinterest, Lara recognized that the frequent, friendly e-mails were his way of showing he liked her. Eventually, he asked for her number, and they went on their first date about a month later. ""A lot of our relationship has been e-mailing and texting and Facebook messaging,"" said Lara, adding that she's kept as mementos a lot of their e-mails and texts -- some of which were unfortunately erased. The couple spent copious amounts of time together, giving their virtual courtship a real-world backbone. So, when her boyfriend revealed that he loved her via text, it wasn't ideal. But it wasn't a deal breaker, either. ""Before class started I got a text from him that said, 'I love you,' "" she said. ""He wanted it to be as organic as possible.

When it comes to romance, ""I think there's a level of flirtatiousness that helps to sustain a relationship, and that's what I had every day with Joshua in person,"" Lara said. Now that they're long distance, the pair makes an effort to fly to see each other when they can. But in the interim, ""for me and Josh, being romantic is having one night a week where [we're] eating together on Skype,"" she said.

"A lunar light show circled the globe Saturday, rewarding many moongazers with bright, crisp detail of the full moon's craters and basins. Called a ""perigee"" moon by scientists, the phenomenon occurs once a year. NASA said the moon appears about 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full moons. See views of the moon from around the world . That's because it will be as close to Earth as it will get for a while -- just over 221,000 miles away. CNN iReporter Halldor Sigurdsson snapped the yellowish-ochre orb perched on the shoulder of a mountain overlooking Reykjavik, Iceland. ""The colors were spectacular,"" wrote Sigurdsson, 47. ""The weather here for viewing the moon rise could not have been better."" Residents of the mainland United States received similar conditions at 11:34 p.m., ET, the peak of this year's ""super moon."" The best time to see the event is just as the moon crosses Earth's horizon. The moon always looks biggest then, although the reason why is a bit of a mystery. Viewing the moon behind buildings and trees creates an optical illusion so it appears even larger, making it a perfect time to try to grab some beautiful pictures. So why is this full moon so super? As the moon makes its elliptical orbit around Earth, there are specific times when it is closest to and farthest away from our planet. Apogee occurs when the moon is farthest away from us, and perigee occurs when it is closest. Experts say viewers may not notice a noticeable size difference, given there are no reference points when the moon is high overhead. ""'Super moon' is a situation when the moon is slightly closer to Earth in its orbit than on average, and this effect is most noticeable when it occurs at the same time as a full moon,"" James Garvin, chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in 2011. ""So, the moon may seem bigger although the difference in its distance from Earth is only a few percent at such times."" Share your big moon photos . Among those staying up late Saturday was Beth Wade of Lake Wylie, South Carolina. She took ""test"" photos of the moon Friday and early Saturday. ""I love nature,"" said Wade, 31, who has a corporate day job and an online vintage clothing shop.""We live on the lake and I love taking photos of the sunset, so anything that is that beautiful, that natural and prominent is great to see. The super moon is a natural phenomenon, and that is what is so awesome about it."" Shari Neluka Atukorala, an iReporter in Kandy, Sri Lanka, said the moon ""was so bright that I could really see the markings on it quite close ... and yet so far."" Not everyone was wowed. Ben Jason Tesiorna, 41, of Davao City, Philippines, took a photo of the moon peeking through clouds.

"(CNN) -- Three violent deaths in two stores marred the opening of the Christmas shopping season Friday. A Wal-Mart employee at this Long Island location was killed in a rush early Friday morning. In the first, a temporary Wal-Mart employee was trampled to death in a rush of thousands of early morning shoppers as he and other employees attempted to unlock the doors of a Long Island, New York, store at 5 a.m., police said. In the second, unrelated incident, two men were shot dead in a Toys ""R"" Us in Palm Desert, California, after they argued in the store, police said. The toy company and authorities said the California shootings had nothing to do with shopping on Black Friday, which is historically one of the year's busiest shopping days. The Wal-Mart worker, whom authorities did not identify, was 34 and lived in Queens, said Nassau County police Detective Lt. Michael Fleming. ""This was utter chaos as these men tried to open the door this morning,"" Fleming said.  Watch police describe the 'utter chaos' » . Video showed as many as a dozen people knocked to the floor in the stampede of people trying to get into the Wal-Mart store, Fleming said. The employee was ""stepped on by hundreds of people"" as other workers attempted to fight their way through the crowd, Fleming said. ""Several minutes"" passed before others were able to clear space around the man and attempt to render aid. Police arrived, and ""as they were giving first aid, those police officers were also jostled and pushed,"" he said. ""Shoppers ... were on a full-out run into the store,"" he said. The crowd had begun forming outside the store by 9 p.m. Thursday, Fleming said. By 5 a.m. Friday, when the doors were unlocked, there were 2,000 or so shoppers, many of whom ""surged forward,"" breaking the doors, he said. The man was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Others in the crowd sustained minor injuries such as sprained ankles, Fleming said. A 28-year-old pregnant woman was taken to a hospital, but ""the baby is going to be OK,"" Fleming said. She was to be released later in the day, he said. The California shootings occurred about 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET), authorities said. By the time police arrived, two men were dead from gunshot wounds, Riverside County sheriff's Sgt. Dennis Gutierrez said. He said authorities are not seeking any other suspects. Gutierrez said that the men did not appear to be store employees and that the dispute appeared unrelated to shopping. ""There was a confrontation inside of the store. But over a toy? I don't think that is accurate,"" he said. Two handguns were found near the men's bodies, Gutierrez said. In a written statement, Toys ""R"" Us spokeswoman Kathleen Waugh said the shooting appeared unrelated to the heavy shopping day. ""Our understanding is that this act seems to have been the result of a personal dispute between the individuals involved,"" she said. She said company officials were ""outraged"" by the shooting and were working with authorities to find out what happened. Gutierrez said no one else in the store was injured. The store remained closed Friday afternoon but was expected to open as usual Saturday.  Watch police confirm two people dead at a Toys 'R' Us store » . He said authorities would not release the men's names until their families have been notified. Daniel Watson said he was at home with his children when his wife called from the Toys ""R"" Us store, where she and her mother were shopping. ""All I could hear was gunshots in the back,"" he said. ""She said, 'They're in here shooting.' I told her to run and hide, stay down and hide."" He said his wife did just that, ducking under a clothes rack until the threat was over. Watson said neither woman was hurt. Asked about the possibility of criminal charges in the Wal-Mart death, Fleming said he would not rule it out but noted that charges would be ""very difficult,"" as it would be ""almost impossible"" to identify people in the crowd from the video, and those in the front of the crowd were pushed by those behind them. Hundreds of people may have lined up in an orderly fashion but got caught up in the rush, he said. Wal-Mart spokesman Kelly Cheeseman issued a statement saying, ""We are saddened to report that a gentleman who was working for a temporary agency on our behalf died at the store and a few other customers were injured. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families at this difficult time."" The company is investigating the incident, the statement said. Officers patrolling the shopping center overnight had had concerns about the size of the crowd, Fleming said, and had tried to get those in line better organized. Wal-Mart security officers were also present overnight, but he said he did not know how many. ""I don't know what it's worth to Wal-Mart or to any of these stores that run these sales events,"" Fleming said, ""but it has become common knowledge that large crowds do gather on the Friday after Thanksgiving in response to these sales and in an effort to do their holiday shopping at the cheapest prices. ""I think it is incumbent upon the commercial establishments to recognize that this has the potential to occur at any store. Today, it happened to be Wal-Mart. It could have been any other store where hundreds and hundreds of people gather."" Asked whether the security had been adequate, Fleming said, ""In light of the outcome, in hindsight, the answer is obviously no. ... This crowd was out of control.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan aircraft bombed a section of eastern Libya on Wednesday as leader Moammar Gadhafi tried to retake control of an area seized by rebel forces. A CNN crew saw the aircraft drop two bombs near al-Brega, a town in the east with key oil and natural gas facilities. Later, a military aircraft dropped a third bomb. People on the ground shot and threw whatever they could at the aircraft, then fled. After one of the attacks, people carrying stretchers were seen running to the site of the bombing. Fighting also raged on the ground, as Gadhafi's forces tried to take control of a university in al-Brega. A doctor told CNN there were four dead and 23 wounded at his hospital in the area, all victims of gunshot wounds. Residents of the town said the rebels maintained control of al-Brega, repelling Libyan ground forces. Earlier Wednesday, military aircraft bombed military camps on the outskirts of the town of Ajdabiya, a tribal leader said. The tribal leader, who did not want to be identified for safety reasons, said youths in Ajdabiya were massing and heading toward the conflict area to help defend the town, which has been in the control of rebel forces in recent days. Some military bases in eastern Libya have fallen into the hands of rebels as more members of the military have abandoned Gadhafi's regime and joined the opposition. The bombings could support calls for the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya to prevent such attacks. The United States has said all options are on the table. Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said imposing a no-fly zone would be ""an extraordinarily complex operation."" Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Wednesday that, while Libyans are not asking for foreign troops on the ground, they need ""the tools to prevent the slaughter of innocents on Libyan streets, and I believe that the global community cannot be on the sidelines while airplanes are allowed to bomb and strafe. A no-fly zone is not a long-term proposition, assuming the outcome is what all desire, and I believe that we ought to be ready to implement it as necessary."" The Arab League met Wednesday to consider a resolution rejecting foreign military intervention in Libya, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, calling for more freedoms and for the longtime ruler to step down. ""We perceive what happened and what is happening is an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments,"" the Arab League said in a statement. As Gadhafi's forces launched their attacks, the 68-year-old leader warned that ""thousands and thousands of people will be killed"" if the United States or NATO ""intervene in our country."" In another of his trademark, rambling speeches carried live on state television, Gadhafi continued to claim that there are no peaceful Libyan protests, only al Qaeda-backed efforts to tear the country apart. He blamed the problems on former prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who were released to Libya and then freed by Libyan authorities after they pledged to reform. He said they turned out to be members of al Qaeda sleeper cells -- but insisted that his country is ""stopping al Qaeda from flourishing"" and preventing Osama bin Laden from moving into North Africa. Gadhafi, who has ruled Libya for more than 41 years, also denied having any assets besides ""history, the people, the glory -- not the American dollars or the oil."" The speech lasted about 2-1/2 hours. He also spoke Wednesday with Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, according to the Venezuelan Ministry of Popular Power. Later, several thousand people, including many young men and women, took part in a pro-Gadhafi rally in Tripoli's Green Square. Some residents of the capital have told CNN they want to protest Gadhafi but fear being killed by his forces. And some have said Gadhafi forces have dragged residents into the streets and forced them to take part in rallies praising the leader. A spokesman for the Libyan government, Musa Ibrahim, told CNN that assertions of widespread military attacks on peaceful demonstrators are wrong. ""This is an armed rebellion, with people going around attacking police stations, army offices, getting a hold of guns and attacking,"" he said. He said the government had supported the initial peaceful protests, but said al Qaeda supporters have hijacked that movement ""and they are leading the country into chaos."" Asked for evidence, he said, ""We have captured dozens of these people, we have figures, we have interviews, we are willing and prepared to take these people and show them on international media."" But numerous witnesses have described indiscriminate killings and attacks. The International Criminal Court announced it is opening an investigation into Libya. ""Following a preliminary examination of available information, the prosecutor has reached the conclusion that an investigation is warranted,"" the court said in a statement. The court said it is focusing on what it considers ""the most serious crimes of concern to the international community."" No possible charges or violations were listed in the statement. The conflict between Gadhafi's government and opponents, in its third week, followed protests in neighboring Egypt and Tunisia that ousted those countries' leaders. International efforts to persuade him to follow the message of protesters and step down have also ratcheted up. The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution Tuesday to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council. It was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya. ""The world has spoken with one voice,"" he said. ""We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights, including those of peaceful assembly and free speech."" He added that reports from the ground ""are sobering,"" with deaths and ongoing repression. ""Arms depots and arsenals have reportedly been opened to gangs who terrorize communities. There are reports that government forces have fired indiscriminately on peaceful protesters and bombed the military bases in the east of the country,"" Ban said. ""The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown, but likely to exceed 1,000,"" with thousands more wounded, he added, using the same fatality figure he had used Friday. Libya's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, the leader's 38-year-old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests, told CNN Tuesday that his talks with the opposition were in ""chaos"" because the opposition is divided, with no clear leaders. U.S. officials made similar comments about the opposition. A U.S. official who wanted to remain anonymous because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it is ""unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult"" for the United States to provide assistance. The capital city of Tripoli remained under the control of Gadhafi's rule, though opposition forces have taken control of the eastern city of Benghazi and a number of other cities. The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya's borders into Egypt and Tunisia, and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders. Ban called for immediate action by the international community. ""Time is of the essence,"" he said. ""Thousands of lives are at stake.""

"(CNN) -- The president of Guinea-Bissau was assassinated Monday morning, a day after an explosion killed the head of the West African country's military, the prime minister said. Circumstances of Joao Bernardo Vieira's death are unclear. It was not immediately clear how President Joao Bernardo Vieira, 69, died. Prime Minister Carlos Gomes confirmed the death to CNN. Early Monday, gunfire and rocket explosions that lasted for about an hour were heard near the presidential palace in the capital, Bissau, according to local media. Looting was later reported at the presidential palace. Army spokesman Zamora Induta said an aide to the president was killed during the gunfire. He added that the gunmen remained at-large and that a 10-member-commission will manage the army until a new chief of staff is named. The army, he said, will remain neutral. Gen. Tagme Na Waie, chief of Guinea-Bissau's military, was killed in a bomb explosion in his office Sunday, according to local news reports. Five other high-ranking military officials were wounded, two of them critically. After the attack, all local radio stations were ordered to immediately suspend their programs. The United Nations said U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed dismay over the killings. ""The secretary-general strongly condemns these violent acts, which have occurred soon after successful legislative elections which paved the way for enhanced U.N. support to the country's peace-building efforts,"" the statement said. ""The secretary-general calls urgently for calm and restraint, and urges the national authorities of Guinea-Bissau to fully investigate these assassinations and bring to justice those responsible for them."" The British government issued a statement advising against ""all but essential travel"" to the country. Na Waie's predecessor also was assassinated. Soldiers shot and killed Gen. Verissimo Correia Seabra in October 2004. Guinea-Bissau, a former Portuguese colony, has a history of military coups. Monday's development is the latest violence over four months as the army and Guinea-Bissau's president have clashed.  See location map of Guinea-Bissau » . The tiny west African country, located between Guinea and Senegal, has a population of 1.5 million and is considered one of the five poorest countries in the world, according to the CIA Factbook. The country has been in a near-constant state of political upheaval since independence from Portugal in 1974. In 1980, Vieira became president after a military coup. He was accused of purging political rivals and suppressing dissent, but several coup attempts throughout the 1980s and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994, the country held its first free elections, and Vieira was elected president. He held the post for five years, until a military mutiny ousted him, and the country plunged into civil war. Successor Kumba Yala took office in 2000. He also was unseated in a military coup after three years. Yala's ouster paved the way for Vieira to run for office again. In 2005, he was re-elected president, pledging to pursue economic development and national reconciliation.

"The head of the Ramadi Awakening Council was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing in Iraq's Anbar province, police officials told CNN. Mohammed Khamis Abu Risha was on a joint patrol with Awakening Council members and Iraqi security forces when he was killed by a suicide bomber, the officials said. At least four others were also killed in the blast, they said. Abu Risha has been among those leading the fight in Ramadi against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a rogue al Qaeda group know by the acronym ISIS. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But ISIS has claimed to have carried out several failed assassination attempts against him in recent months. Abu Risha is the nephew of Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha, head of the Anbar Awakening Council -- a group composed primarily of Sunni Arab fighters who turned on al Qaeda in Iraq in late 2006 and joined forces with the U.S.-led coalition. The sheikh took over as head of the province's Awakening Council after his brother Sheikh Abdul Sattar was assassinated in 2007. While a number of the members of the council, also known as the Sons of Iraq, have been integrated into Iraq's security forces, the sheikh has said he maintains a militia of about 80,000. Iraq's government has put the number at 50,000, according to published reports.","Mohammed Khamis Abu Risha was head of the Ramadi Awakening Council .

"(CNN) -- The bloodied bodies lay stuffed and tangled in the back of a pickup like garbage. Men lifted the bodies one by one and hurled from them from a bridge into a river below as cursing filled the air. ""Brother of a whore!"" they shouted as the corpses splashed and the water ran red. ""Animals!"" ""Dogs!"" At one point, a voice asks mockingly, ""This is a soldier?"" Report: Syrian army stretched amid uprising . This scene, said to have been shot in Syria, surfaced in a video on YouTube, where images of anti-government ferment and violence have emerged consistently since unrest started in the nation in mid-March. CNN could not verify the authenticity of the video, but it illustrates the hostility of the nearly five-month-old conflict across Syria between regime forces and anti-government protesters. It is not clear who the victims were. Were they among the 1,600 civilians or 370 security forces slain in the unrest? The posting on the video says the bodies are anti-government forces being dumped by thugs loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian state TV has aired the video, saying that the bodies are being dumped by anti-government protesters. A banner said the incident took place in Hama over the Orontes River. Razan Zaitouneh, a Syrian activist, said activists doubt the incident could have happened at the Hama location because the river is dry at this time of year. But one prominent anti-government activist, who asked not to be named because of the dangers that could arise from the release of the information, told CNN the state TV account was correct. The bodies are those of Syrian secret police killed by Syrian fighters from Iraq who have joined the anti-government fight, said the activist, who gets information about the goings-on in Syria from an extensive network of informants. That same activist stressed that the antagonists are not representative of the protest movement. Violent fringe elements have appeared during the Syrian tumult. One study last month from the International Crisis Group said some anti-government elements have taken up arms. However, that report said, ""the vast majority of casualties have been peaceful protesters, and the vast majority of the violence has been perpetrated by the security services."" The activist said the emergence of this video is a double-edged sword for protesters. On the one hand, the peaceful demonstrators need to become aware of the existence of fringe elements, he said. This would encourage more people to reject both the regime and these types of attacks and maintain the aims of peaceful protest, he said. At the same time, he added, the incident gives credence to the Syrian government's assertion that it is targeting ""armed gangs."" Such violence, he said, could cause the international community to hesitate in continuing its mounting pressure against the Syrian regime.","YouTube video shows men tossing bodies into a river .

"Washington (CNN) -- Michael Scanlon, a former close business associate of now-disgraced ex-lobbyist Jack Abramoff, was sentenced to 20 months in prison Friday. A federal judge in Washington also sentenced Scanlon to serve three years of supervised release following the prison term after he entered a guilty plea in which he admitted to participating in a bribery and fraud conspiracy. Judge Ellen Huvelle also ordered Scanlon to pay more than $20 million to victims of his scheme to defraud four Native American tribes. Scanlon represented tribes from Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Michigan who were interested in obtaining or keeping gaming licenses to operate casinos on Indian lands. Abramoff recommended Scanlon to the tribes to serve as their lobbyist. In turn, Scanlon admits, he charged the tribes a total of $40 million and secretly kicked back $20 million to Abramoff, according to the Justice Department. The court did not indicate when Scanlon, now 40, will begin serving his sentence or be required to begin reimbursing his victims. He also was sentenced to perform 300 hours of community service. The Abramoff investigation eventually netted a total of 20 lobbyists and public officials who pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial. Rep. Robert Ney was the only member of Congress caught up in the scandal. He resigned and received a 30-month sentence in 2007. Abramoff served four years of a six-year sentence in a federal prison camp in Maryland. After spending additional time in a Baltimore halfway house, Abramoff was released last December.","Michael Scanlon was a close business associate of Jack Abramoff .

"(CNN) -- Five months into the country's uprising, a defiant Syrian regime continues its relentless assault on pro-reform protesters in the face of international rebuke and calls for restraint. The government has maintained the same narrative: it is going after armed terrorists. But opposition activists say it is a systematic, sustained slaughter. Here is an explainer of what is happening inside and outside Syria as efforts to resolve the crisis continue. What are the protesters demanding? Initially, protesters wanted basic reforms, more freedoms, a multi-party political system and an end to emergency law. Some of these reforms have, on paper, been implemented by President Bashar al-Assad, but it was far too little and, by the time it came about, too late. The protests started in March in reaction to the arrest of schoolchildren in the town of Daraa for painting anti-government graffiti and snowballed. Protestors now want a Syria free of the Assad regime and true democratic elections. Assad has been in power since 2000; his father, Hafez, ruled Syria for three decades. How widespread are the protests? Demonstrations have erupted in several of Syria's largest cities -- Damascus, Hama, Deir Ezzor and Homs -- as well as the southern city of Daraa, where protests began months ago. But Aleppo -- considered the largest city -- has been relatively quiet. It is the economic center of Syria and the city's merchant class has been unaffected by the protests, for the most part. How many people have died in the unrest? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based activist group, said more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-March. Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of the observatory, said the dead include more than 1,600 civilians and more than 370 Syrian security forces. CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to many parts of the country by international journalists. How has the Assad regime reacted to other uprisings? There are fears from some in Syria of a repeat of the 1982 massacre by Syria's military -- acting under orders from Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad -- in which thousands of civilians are believed to have perished. The bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising took place in the western city of Hama. Estimates of the number of casualties vary from 3,000 to 40,000. A 1983 Amnesty International report put the death toll on both sides as between 10,000 and 25,000. Many activists are already comparing what is now in Hama under Hafez al-Assad's son -- but in slow motion rather than a single, devastating strike. The city has been at the epicenter of the anti-government movement roiling the country, prompting security forces to roll in with tanks in early August. Scores were killed. What attempts has Assad made to meet protesters' demands? He lifted the state of emergency that had been in place for nearly half a century. He also abolished a court set up to try people posing a threat to the regime. But, at the same time, arbitrary detentions have continued, as has the use of force against demonstrators. In July, the Syrian regime held a five-day ""national dialogue"" conference in Damascus, saying it was designed to solicit viewpoints not only of Assad's loyalists, but also those wanting real change. But many opposition activists boycotted the meeting and called its stated mission a farce, given claims that the government has violently targeted hundreds who have openly called for change. Who are Assad's allies? Russia and China are key players, particularly when it comes to exerting influence in the United Nations. Turkey is an important trading partner, but its relationship with Syria appears to have cooled. In early August, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah condemned the crackdown on anti-government protesters, saying there was ""no justification for the bloodshed."" While it is noteworthy that Saudi Arabia has openly criticized Syria, it is not surprising. Saudi Arabia is wary of Iran's influence in the region -- and Syria is Iran's closest ally there. Can the United Nations take military action? The Security Council tends to build its approach on an incremental basis when faced with a country or issue that splits opinion. Due to history, location, politics and power, Syria has more allies than Libya and is unlikely to face similar U.N.-mandated action. A Security Council resolution authorized the use of force to protect civilians in Libya. But the ensuing NATO's military campaign over Libya has drawn some criticism, which might play a role in holding off on similar action in Syria. Russia and China usually feel it is not the Security Council's role to get involved in what they say is a matter for the internal affairs of U.N. member countries. Syria's key role in the Middle East peace process has also made military attacks extremely unlikely. What role is social media playing in the uprising? If Egypt was the ""Facebook revolution,"" Syria is the YouTube revolution. If not for activists posting videos to YouTube, the outside world would not have a window into what is happening in Syria. Why is there no likelihood of U.N. sanctions or military action against Syria? The Security Council tends to build its approach on an incremental basis when faced with a country or issue that splits opinion. Due to history, location, politics and power, Syria has more allies than Libya is unlikely to face similar U.N.-mandated action. A Security Council resolution authorized the use of force to protect civilians in Libya.

Russia and China usually feel that it is not the Security Council's role to get involved in what they say is a matter for the internal affairs of U.N. member countries. That said, they may eventually budge to at least join other members of the Council in expressing concern or condemnation of what is happening in Syria. But it will take more displays of Syrian brutality for Russia and China to go along with sanctions. Syria's key role in the Middle East peace process has also made military attacks extremely unlikely. Is social media still playing a part in the uprising? Is it likely to have a decisive role in the final outcome? It's huge. It's not the same as we saw in Egypt, which has been labeled a Facebook revolution because of the role of social networking sites. Syria is the YouTube revolution. If activists weren't posting videos to YouTube, we would have almost no window into what appears to be happening in Syria. Will it be decisive? Yes, absolutely. The reason why people have been able to have such a strong debate about crimes against humanity, about abuses, about the atrocities allegedly committed is because we've had these images on hand.

"(CNN) -- A candidate for the Republican National Committee chairmanship said Friday the CD he sent committee members for Christmas -- which included a song titled ""Barack the Magic Negro"" -- was clearly intended as a joke. The title of the song about President-elect Barack Obama was drawn from a Los Angeles Times column. ""I think most people recognize political satire when they see it,"" Tennessee Republican Chip Saltsman told CNN. ""I think RNC members understand that."" The song, set to the tune of ""Puff the Magic Dragon,"" was first played on conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh's radio show in 2007. Its title was drawn from a Los Angeles Times column that suggested President-elect Barack Obama appealed to those who feel guilty about the nation's history of mistreatment of African-Americans.

"(CNN) -- The same blue food dye found in M&Ms and Gatorade could be used to reduce damage caused by spine injuries, offering a better chance of recovery, according to new research. Rats injected with BBG not only regained their mobility but temporarily turned blue. Researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center found that when they injected the compound Brilliant Blue G (BBG) into rats suffering spinal cord injuries, the rodents were able to walk again, albeit with a limp. The only side effect was that the treated mice temporarily turned blue. The results of the study, published in the ""Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,"" build on research conducted by the same center five years ago. In August 2004, scientists revealed how Adenosine triphosphate, which is known as ATP and described as the ""energy currency of life,"" surges to the spinal cord soon after injury occurs. Researchers found that the sudden influx of ATP killed off healthy cells, making the initial injury far worse. But when they injected oxidized ATP into the injury, it was found to block the effect of ATP, allowing the injured rats to recover and walk again. ""While we achieved great results when oxidized ATP was injected directly into the spinal cord, this method would not be practical for use with spinal cord-injured patients,"" said lead researcher Maiken Nedergaard, professor of Neurosurgery and director of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""First, no one wants to put a needle into a spinal cord that has just been severely injured, so we knew we needed to find another way to quickly deliver an agent that would stop ATP from killing healthy motor neurons. Second, the compound we initially used, oxidized ATP, cannot be injected into the bloodstream because of its dangerous side effects."" Back in 2004, Nedergaard's team discovered that the spinal cord was rich in a molecule called P2X7, which is also known as ""the death receptor"" for its ability to allow ATP to latch onto motor neurons and send the signals which eventually kill them. Nedergaard knew that BBG could thwart the function of P2X7, and its similarity to a blue food dye approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982 gave her the confidence to test it intravenously. It worked. The rats given BBG immediately after their injury could walk again with a limp. Those that didn't receive a dose never regained their mobility. Nedergaard told CNN that there is currently no standard treatment for patients with spinal injury when they reach the hospital emergency room. ""Right now we only treat 15 percent of the patients we receive with steroids and many hospitals question if that even works for that 15 percent; it's a very moderate benefit to only a subset of patients. So right now 85 percent of patients are untreated,"" she said. Nedergaard said the research team isn't claiming that BBG can cure spinal injuries, instead that it offers a potential improvement in patients' condition. ""Even a moderate improvement in functional performance of the patient is a big, big event for these patients,"" she said. ""They can control their bladder. If they can just take small steps instead of sitting in a wheelchair all the time, it's a tremendous benefit for these patients,"" she added. The dose must be administered immediately after the injury, before additional tissue dies as a result of the initial injury. Researchers are currently pulling together an application to be lodged with the FDA to stage the first clinical trials of BBG on human patients. ""Our hope is that this work will lead to a practical, safe agent that can be given to patients shortly after injury, for the purpose of decreasing the secondary damage that we have to otherwise expect,"" said Steven Goldman, Chair of the University of Rochester Department of Neurology.","Researchers find way to reduce secondary damage caused by spinal injuries .

"A barrage of rape and death threats on Twitter aimed at feminist Caroline Criado-Perez, who petitioned to have women displayed on British banknotes -- has sparked outrage in the global media and among the Twitterati. Following a day-long onslaught, in which Criado-Perez received around 50 sexually-abusive tweets an hour, police finally arrested a 21-year-old man in Manchester on Sunday. The feminist champion, whose campaign resulted in the Bank of England agreeing to picture Pride and Prejudice author Jane Austen on every £10 bill, tweeted throughout the abuse: ""I actually can't keep up with the screen-capping & reporting -- rape threats thick and fast now. If anyone wants to report the tweets to Twitter."" Twitter UK's General Manager Tony Wang said the social-networking company takes online abuse very seriously, offering to suspend accounts, and called on people to report any ""violation of Twitter rules."" World media . But the story has ignited a backlash against the site from users and the media alike with more than 50,000 people signing on online petition urging Twitter to tackle Internet trolls. UK Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper wrote to Wang on Sunday criticising Twitter's ""inadequate"" response. In her letter, Cooper wrote: ""Despite the scale and seriousness of these threats, the official response from Twitter continues to be extremely weak -- simply directing Caroline away from Twitter towards the police, and, belatedly, directing users to abuse-reporting forms on Twitter."" Writing in The Guardian, columnist Tanya Gold called on ""misogynists"" to be shamed rather than criticized, describing the Internet trolls as ""lonely, fearful and dumb,"" adding that the emergence of social media ""has given the vicious a voice."" Read more: Internet trolls: What to do about the scourge of the Web? Criado-Perez had her own take on the debate being played out her Twitter account. Writing in the Independent on Saturday, she said: ""If we stand firm, and shout back as one, we will win."" The BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones argues that Twitter now faces a ""tricky dilemma"" of protecting free speech while under pressure to ""make the network a safer and more polite place."" Cellan-Jones believes Twitter would prefer to see threatening Tweets referred to the police, rather than introduce a ""report abuse"" button on every post, which would require significant manpower to monitor. Twitter has already introduced a ""report tweet"" function for the iPhone and is currently developing the option for the web and Android. But The Telegraph's chief technology blogger Mic Wright said a report function would allow ""any armchair activist to make a vague stand without putting in any time, effort or thought."" Wright recognizes that comment sections on user-generated websites such as YouTube are the ""post-apocalyptic badlands of the web... a resting place for the misspelled dribblings of the chronically hard-of-thinking."" But he argues the Twitter conundrum is a societal problem not a technology-based one. The debacle has led to a campaign for a Twitter boycott on August 4 -- International Friendship Day -- and an e-petition for a ""report abuse"" button on Tweets. Author of 'How To Be a Woman' and columnist for The Times, Caitlin Moran, proposed a ""Trolliday"" where Twitter users would tweet the holding message: ""Waiting for troll solution."" Columnist Suzanne Moore also called for a celebrity shun of the social-networking site. On Saturday, she posted: ""Spread the word. Prominent guys with many followers join in please. It's a gesture maybe but we can try a big Twitter flounce and see?""","Criado-Perez successfully campaigned to have women pictured on UK banknotes .

"(CNN)  -- It's one thing to lose your luggage while flying. It's another when your dog goes missing. Josiah Allen says his dog, Paco, didn't make it home when he flew recently from Mexico to his home in Seaforth, Canada. Delta Air Lines says the dog escaped from a carrier on the tarmac. ""I am hopeful that Delta will be able ... to locate and retrieve Paco and that he can come to my home and be loved and cared for,"" Allen said. A Delta spokeswoman, Susan Elliot, said Paco broke out of a dog carrier at the airport in Mexico City, Mexico, on May 3. ""Our staff have conducted exhaustive searches to locate the dog,"" she said. They have not found Paco. Delta has offered its ""sincere apologies that we have been unable to recover the dog,"" Elliot said. The airline has compensated Paco's owner and offered to reimburse all expenses associated with the dog, she said. A Delta representative at the Mexico City airport told Allen that Paco's dog carrier was too small, Allen said. He said Delta asked him to sign a waiver saying the airline would not be liable for any injuries that Paco might suffer as a result of the carrier's size. Allen said he signed the waiver because Paco had slept in the crate for three nights with no problems. ""He could both turn around and stand comfortably,"" he said. Yet when his plane landed in Detroit, Michigan, Allen said, the dog was gone. The story of Paco's disappearance unfolded not long afterward on a blog called The Consumerist, which says it ""empowers consumers by informing and entertaining them about the top consumer issues of the day."" Elliot said she couldn't recall another instance when a dog got lost while its owners were in transit. ""This is extremely rare,"" she said.

"Before 14-year-old Philip Chism allegedly killed his algebra teacher, the pair had at least one more encounter as student and teacher, a witness said. Chism had been doodling and listening to music during Colleen Ritzer's algebra I class during the school's final period, classmate Cambria Cloutier told CNN. Creating such drawings was unusual for Chism, and when the final bell sounded at 1:55 p.m. Tuesday, Ritzer asked him to stay after class. Cloutier sat two desks over from Chism, who rarely participated in class discussion but was ""a really good student,"" she said. While shuttling between two after-school meetings, Cloutier said, she looked into the same classroom and saw Ritzer standing by her computer and Chism sitting in a chair about 5 to 10 feet away. The teacher smiled at her, Cloutier recalled. At some point that afternoon, Ritzer went to a student girls' bathroom on Danvers High's second floor, as someone was in the locked faculty bathroom, a source close to the investigation said. Chism allegedly followed her in. The school reopened its doors Friday, as the first answers began to surface. How was Ritzer killed? With a box cutter the suspect, Chism, had brought into school, a source close to the investigation says. What happened to her body afterward? It was stashed in a recycling bin, rolled outside, then dumped about 20 feet into woods behind the northeastern Massachusetts high school's athletic fields, adds another source. It was left there -- not buried, not even covered. And where did the alleged killer go afterward? After changing his clothes, he went to a Wendy's fast-food restaurant and a movie, sources say, before police in a neighboring town saw him walking on a busy road under the pitch-dark sky early Wednesday. Yet the question of why this happened -- why a popular young educator who always wore a smile and went the extra mile was killed allegedly by a teenager who friends, family and co-workers described as reserved and well-behaved -- continues to loom large. Caring, compassionate teacher was 'brilliant ray of light' Chism, who had moved to the Boston suburb of Danvers before the start of the school year, remains jailed without bond. A grand jury will play a big part in deciding his next step: If they indict him for first- or second-degree murder, he -- like any juvenile age 14 or older -- would be tried as an adult, based on Massachusetts law. Meanwhile, the tight-knit North Shore community is still trying to make sense of what he allegedly did and of life without a teacher who so many appreciated, learned from and loved. ""It's just surreal how quickly someone can go, and how much we take for granted every day,"" said Danvers High student Chris Weimert. Ritzer was ""the nicest teacher you could ever have. I can't believe it."" There will be a wake for Ritzer at St. Augustine Church in Andover on Sunday, and her funeral will take place there Monday. A member of the Ritzer family, who declined to be named, said the family is ""doing as well as can be expected."" Two missing-persons reports come together . Students and colleagues described the 24-year-old Ritzer as someone who gave everything for her students -- be it a pat on the back, a sensible explanation to a tricky concept, or the time, effort and heart to work through problems, math or otherwise, with them. One of those students was Chism, a freshman. Sometime after Ritzer held him back after class, she was killed in the bathroom. There, Ritzer was punched a few times before being killed with a box cutter around 3:30 p.m., said a source. Her body went into a recycling bin, then outside the school where it was tossed. Authorities eventually found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment about 100 feet away from Ritzer's body, a source said. Before police found her -- before they even knew she was missing -- they'd started looking for Chism. This was in the early evening, with Danvers Police tweeting to residents that he hadn't returned home and was last seen around the Hollywood Hits movie theater in the town about 20 miles northeast of Boston. Scott Przybycien, the theater's manager, told CNN that Chism arrived around 4:15 p.m. Tuesday and caught the start of the Woody Allen film, ""Blue Jasmine,"" about 15 minutes later. Surveillance video, which was turned over to police, confirmed that Chism was there until the movie let out around 6:15 p.m., he said. ""He fit right in like a normal, everyday person,"" Przybycien said Friday, noting that teen paid cash for his ticket and had on clean clothes. While they were looking for him, police got a call around 11:20 p.m. Tuesday about another missing person: Ritzer. She wasn't home either, nor had she answered her phones. The stories started coming together about an hour later, when police officers in nearby Topsfield found Chism walking along Route 1. Whatever he told detectives in his subsequent interviews, whatever they saw in surveillance footage from the school, led to Chism's arrest for murder. It also led them to Ritzer's body in the woods. Read the complaint . A quiet and normal student . Chism is a quiet young man, those who know him said. He excelled at soccer and made a harmless impression. ""He ... seemed quiet and reserved, but he just seemed normal,"" said Ariana Edwards, who was in Chism's English class. Chism didn't drink or do drugs, and he came from a good family, one of his closest friends said. He described Chism as a good athlete who was shy at first but eventually warmed up to people, adding that he hadn't been acting strangely lately. Friends got their first hint that something was awry when Chism didn't show up for soccer practice Tuesday. The team set out to look for him after seeing texts that he was missing. He was a newcomer to Danvers, a town of about 26,000 people. His family had bounced around, and he had lived in different cities in Tennessee and Florida since he was in fourth grade, authorities in those states said. Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying . A teacher who went the extra mile . Meanwhile, many were at a loss in Danvers to explain the death of Ritzer -- a woman who inspired many, whether it be in the classroom or online, with her heart, intellect and positive spirit. ""She was talking on Saturday about this year was a good year. She was teaching freshmen for the first time. She was happy,"" said Jen Berger, Ritzer's best friend. ""I don't even know what the world is like without her. It's a scary thought."" Sympathy spread through the region, making its way into the baseball World Series. Bleachers full of fans who had assembled to watch the Boston Red Sox take on the St. Louis Cardinals observed a moment of silence in Ritzer's honor before Game 1 began Wednesday night at Boston's Fenway Park. Ritzer, a 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working toward a master's degree at Salem State University, seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike, said Charlotte Dzerkacz, who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school. ""She was energetic, she was compassionate,"" Dzerkacz said. ""You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend."" Salem State issued a statement lamenting Ritzer's death. ""She believed children have much to offer and often do not realize how special they are as individuals,"" the university said. ""In her application to Salem State she said she was dedicated to 'helping students in times of need.' "" Ritzer was known to take to Twitter to dole out homework assignments and wisdom to her students. ""No matter what happens in life, be good to people,"" she wrote in August.

"(CNN)It was a lawsuit pitting two larger-than-life personalities against each other -- former pro wrestler-turned-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and ex-Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle. On Tuesday, Ventura was victorious as a federal jury in Minnesota awarded him more than $1.8 million, deciding that Kyle's 2012 best-selling autobiography, ""American Sniper"" defamed Ventura. ""I don't feel great. I mean I feel good over the fact that I've been vindicated, that now they know the story was not true. It was fabricated from Day One,"" Ventura told CNN affiliate WCCO. The suit centered on a passage in which Kyle, who was slain in 2013, described fighting with a man in a California bar in 2006 during the wake for SEAL Mikey Monsoor, who was killed in Iraq in 2006. Kyle wrote that he hit the man after he said that the SEALs ""deserve to lose a few,"" according to numerous media reports, including CNN affiliate KARE.  In later interviews, Kyle said he was referring to Ventura. In the suit, Ventura denied making the statements in the book. Ventura filed the suit before Kyle's death, according to the New York Times. At his deposition in 2012, Kyle continued to insist his book accurately described his clash with Ventura. ""He was complaining about the war, that we shouldn't be there,"" Kyle testified. ""Complaining about Bush, that, you know, Bush was a war criminal. How we were killing innocent men and women and children overseas."" Taya Kyle, Chris Kyle's widow, is listed on the jury verdict paperwork because she is the executor of his estate. She provided a written statement to the WCCO: ""When it comes to my family, honor and standing up for what is right, I am never out of the fight."" The station said her attorney told reporters they might appeal the verdict. Some are blasting Ventura on social media because they feel Ventura's actions are tantamount to suing a slain service member's widow. Several are posting unflattering photo-shopped images of Ventura and calling him names. On Wednesday, HarperCollins spokeswoman Sharyn Rosenblum told CNN that the publisher is removing passages which refer to Ventura. Kyle's killing in 2013 . In 2013, a Marine veteran was accused of shooting and killing Kyle, 38, and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield at a Texas gun range near Fort Worth. Ex-Navy sniper, another military vet, killed at range . CNN reported at the time that Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said the ex-Marine suspect, 25-year-old Eddie Ray Routh, admitted to his sister that he shot the men. Routh didn't explain to her why he did it, Bryant said. At the time of the shooting, Bryant said that Routh's mother, a longtime schoolteacher, ""may have reached out to Mr. Kyle to try and help her son."" Kyle had established the nonprofit FITCO Cares Foundation to help veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder obtain exercise equipment. Littlefield was Kyle's friend and also worked to help people with PTSD, said FITCO Director Travis Cox. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported in December 2013 that Kyle and Littlefield had taken Routh to the gun range believing it would help Routh deal with PTSD. Routh was scheduled for trial in October but it has been postponed, according to the newspaper, which said that defense attorneys were examining thousands of documents. On April 30, the Stephenville Empire-Tribune reported that the trial was again postponed in order to conduct DNA testing. Routh is being held at the Erath County Jail on a $3 million bond for capital murder, according to the newspaper. He has not entered a plea, said Erath District Court Clerk Wanda Pringle. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran.

"Massachusetts' highest court ruled Friday that the Pledge of Allegiance does not discriminate against atheists, saying that the words ""under God"" represent a patriotic, not a religious, exercise. All previous attempts to eliminate the mention of God in the pledge recited in classrooms across the country have failed, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts considered arguments seeking removal of the reference based on discrimination. The case was brought by an unidentified family of a student at a school in suburban Boston, whose lawyers argued that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the state Constitution. It was the first such case at the state level. Roy Speckhardt, the executive director of the American Humanist Association, an atheist group that provided legal services for the plaintiffs, called the decision a setback. But he said the group felt confident about a similar case filed in New Jersey last week that  seeks to show that the pledge engendered a climate of discrimination. In its ruling, the Massachusetts court said the pledge was voluntary and a ""fundamentally patriotic exercise, not a religious one."" The decision said the plaintiffs failed to prove that reciting the pledge resulted in negative treatment. ""The plaintiffs here did not successfully allege that their children receive negative treatment because they opt not to recite the words 'under God,' or that the inclusion of that phrase in the pledge has occasioned 'the creation of second-class citizens,' "" the decision said. But the ruling said that ""should future plaintiffs demonstrate that the distinction created by the pledge as currently written has engendered bullying or differential treatment,"" the court ""would leave open the possibility that the equal rights amendment might provide a remedy."" Speckhardt said that the recitation of the pledge resulted in some children being ""ostracized"" for being atheists and that the government was complicit in bullying and prejudice against those children. In 1954, Congress amended the pledge to include the words ""under God"" during the escalation of the Cold War. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has high-profile and precedent-setting experience deciding cases hinging on the Equal Rights Amendment of the Massachusetts Constitution. In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage with the Supreme Judicial Court's landmark Goodridge decision.","Phrase ""under God"" represents a ""patriotic exercise, not a religious one,"" court rules .

"The family of a third-grader in Connecticut has filed a lawsuit against Milford Public Schools, saying their daughter was banned from school for 21 days amid Ebola fears when she returned from a trip to Lagos, Nigeria, for a family wedding. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday, alleges that Ikeoluwa Opayemi was not allowed to return to Meadowside Elementary School in Milford ""based on fears"" of the deadly Ebola outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Most of the more than 13,700 confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola have been diagnosed in those three countries, according to the World Health Organization. The United Nations' health authority projected that deaths from the virus have exceeded 5,000. ""I think it's outrageous how this child was treated,"" said Gary Phelan, the attorney for the girl's family. ""At some point, making a medical decision has to be based on medical information, not fear."" In a statement Wednesday, Milford Schools Superintendent Elizabeth Feser denied that the school's response was improper. ""In addressing this situation, at all times, my staff and I proceeded in good faith to respond to this public health issue,"" the statement said. ""We acted in the best interest of all of our students and staff."" Phelan said the decision to keep Ikeoluwa out of school came after complaints from parents of her classmates. The girl's father, Stephen Opayemi, was told by city officials that if he tried to bring his daughter to school, police would remove her, the lawyer said. Ikeoluwa has not been diagnosed with Ebola and has not exhibited symptoms, the lawsuit said. In addition, the city of Milford refused her father's offer to have himself and his daughter tested for Ebola. State of Maine, nurse at odds over Ebola quarantine . 'Severe emotional distress' alleged . On October 20, the World Health Organization declared that Nigeria, which is several hundred miles from the epicenter of the outbreak, had contained Ebola after 19 cases, including seven deaths. The declaration came after 42 days with no new Ebola cases reported. The WHO credited an aggressive response by Nigeria's government and effective contact tracing. The lawsuit said a local health official told Ikeoluwa's father that the decision to ""quarantine"" his daughter at home was ""due to the rumors, panic and climate at Meadowside Elementary School."" Ikeoluwa ""suffered severe emotional distress"" from the decision, the lawsuit claims. The girl traveled to Nigeria with her father from October 2 to October 13 to participate in a family wedding. When she returned to the United States, school officials ordered that she remain home for 21 days, until November 3, according to the lawsuit. The suit was filed under the Americans With Disabilities Act. New York incident . Fears about Ebola affected a group of boys at a school in New York on Friday. A group of students attacked two of their peers at I.S. 318 in the Bronx while yelling ""Ebola"" at the brothers, who had recently returned from Senegal, the boys' father told ""CNN Newsroom"" on Tuesday. The New York Department of Education confirms that the incident occurred, saying the boys were pushed and shoved. Ousmane Drame, the boys' father, said his sons felt so upset by their experience, they want to go back to Africa. ""They were made fun of by the children (who) started yelling, 'Ebola. Ebola. Ebola. Africa. Africa,' "" Drame said his sons told him. Charles Cooper of the African Advisory Council, a local advocacy group, said that at lunch, one of the boys was jumped by the students who had been calling him ""Ebola."" When his older brother intervened, the brother also was assaulted. Drame said classmates refused to play with his sons in gym. ""We're done playing with you. You have Ebola,"" he said one of the bullies told his sons. ""You sit down. ... They don't want to play with them. Nobody is close to them."" Last week, amid heightened concerns about the spread of the virus, New Jersey and New York started requiring anyone who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa to be quarantined for 21 days. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said there is little risk of contracting Ebola, outside of close contact with a person who has it and is symptomatic.

"Apollo Nida, husband of ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" co-star Phaedra Parks, is headed to prison for eight years on fraud charges. Nida, who appears on the reality TV series with Parks, was arrested in January and pleaded guilty in May to charges in a fraud scheme that federal prosecutors say stole millions of dollars from at least 50 people over four years. A hearing on July 17 will determine how much restitution Nida must pay to his victims. Nida, 35, must serve five years under parole supervision after he completes his eight years in a federal prison, U.S. District Court Judge Charles A. Pannell, Jr. ordered during sentencing Tuesday. It will be the second prison stint for Nida, who previously served five years in a federal prison for auto title fraud before marrying Parks in 2009. Nida created two fake collection companies to gather personal information used to steal victims' identities, U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said after his sentencing in Atlanta.   He used the information to get fraudulent auto loans in the names of his victims, according to the criminal complaint. He was busted after a year-long investigation by the U.S. Secret Service. ""Today's sentencing exemplifies impartial justice regardless of economic class or perceived celebrity status,"" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent Reginald Moore said.  ""Nida's sentence should be an eye-opener for other like-minded criminals who scheme to steal victims' identities, defraud them and ignore the consequences of their actions."" The break in the case came in September, when federal investigators arrested Gayla St. Julein, a woman who ""described herself as Nida's 'right hand b****' in executing the legwork of his fraud schemes,"" the complaint said. St. Julien, who previously served prison time for identity theft, told agents that Nida ""only paid her 'scraps'"" for her work, compared to the amount of money he made from the fraud schemes,"" the filing said. She turned on him and agreed to let agents record their phone calls, it said. Nida ""knowingly and willfully (did) execute and attempt to execute a scheme to defraud federally insured financial institutions by depositing stolen and fraudulently obtained checks and fraudulently obtained auto loan proceeds into bank accounts opened in the stolen identities of real persons, and conspire with others to do so, and knowingly convert to his use and the use of others stolen and fraudulently obtained United States Treasury Checks,"" Special Agent Alexandre Herrera said in a sworn affidavit. Nida's fake companies fraudulently signed up with ""LexisNexis, Equifax, and Mircrobilt databases"" to steal personal information on people. Along with the fraudulent auto loan checks, Nida stole U.S. Treasury checks, ""retirement checks issued to Delta Airlines employees, and checks in the names of real people that were owed unclaimed property from various state and federal government agencies,"" the complaint said. Agents recorded phone calls St. Julien made to Nida during which he discussed details of pending fraudulent auto loans and ""details of future auto loan checks that he was expecting to receive any day now from in the mail,"" the affidavit said.

"(CNN) -- Today's selection of Boeing and SpaceX as the providers of a U.S.-based capability to take humans to the International Space Station (ISS) is a major milestone in the almost six-decade history of space exploration. It is just the latest sign that the old paradigm of government-only space travel is being replaced by something else -- a new business ecosystem composed of novel relationships among NASA and the aerospace industry. No longer will NASA own the ISS ""trucking company"" -- specifying every nut and bolt. Instead, NASA is buying services from U.S. industry. To be sure, the new announcement made it clear that NASA will be carefully examining the safety aspects of each design. But the designs will still be those of Boeing and SpaceX and vetted by NASA. I believe this new approach is America's ""secret weapon"" in what some have described as a space race with China. And, as far as I can tell, while the rest of the world is still stuck in a nearly government-only mode, NASA, with the support of the Obama administration, is letting loose the creativity of American know-how. Beginning with the NASA Commercial Orbital Transportation Services competition, continuing with the Commercial Resupply Services (cargo) and now the Commercial Crew selection, NASA ""bet the farm"" on commercial companies filling the gap left by the retirement of the space shuttle, with the Commercial Crew companies (SpaceX and Boeing) replacing the Russians in bringing NASA astronauts to the ISS. This will allow NASA to invest the savings in deep space capabilities such as SLS and Orion. I believe it is critical that both commercial cargo and crew succeed for at least two reasons: First, NASA's proper role can be summed up in three words: ""Explore Deep Space."" It is time for NASA to turn over the low Earth orbit work to industry while NASA focuses on getting humanity to Mars, following in the tracks of robotic rovers Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity. Second, history teaches us that without a trailing edge of commercial exploitation and profitability, exploration as large scale, routine human endeavor will not succeed. As an aerospace professional and former NASA executive, I have encountered over the decades many concepts for private space exploration. Until a few years ago, none of these ideas met the sniff test for what I call the ""practical visionary,"" that is, someone capable of seeing a new future, yet solidly grounded in lessons learned. Something was always missing in these early ventures -- either the technical approach required some ""unobtanium"" technology to be invented, the advocate had good ideas but no money or the ""build it and they will come"" philosophy showed total naivetÃ© in business and marketing. Today's selection points us in a different direction. As with the early 20th century airmail routes that helped stimulate aviation, NASA's commercial programs are now the anchor tenants in the government transfer of space services to the private sector. This in turn will enable a robust new business enterprise and allow NASA to focus on Mars -- the ultimate target for exploration.","Scott Hubbard says recent moves by NASA will allow it to focus on deep space .

"(CNN) -- Leslie Nielsen, whose longtime career as a square-jawed dramatic actor took a sudden turn into comedy with gut-busting spoofs like ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun,"" has died at age 84, his family said Sunday. The Canadian-born Nielsen's career reached back into the early days of television, when he made frequent appearances on live drama series like ""Goodyear Playhouse."" He played the earnest starship captain in the 1956 science-fiction classic ""Forbidden Planet"" and made regular appearances on a wide range of TV dramas into the 1970s, including ""Hawaii Five-O."" He also played the captain of an overturned ocean liner in the 1972 disaster movie, ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Much of that changed in 1980, when he was cast as a doctor aboard an endangered jetliner in the gag-a-minute disaster-movie parody ""Airplane!"" Nielsen's deadpan response to the question ""Surely, you can't be serious?"" with ""I am serious -- and don't call me Shirley"" helped launch a second career. The film's producers went on to cast him in their short-lived television series ""Police Squad!"" He reprised that show's bumbling lead character, Lt. Frank Drebin, a decade later in three ""Naked Gun"" movies, in which he shared the screen with O.J. Simpson and Priscilla Presley. Nielsen appeared in several similar but less-acclaimed spoofs following those films. Nielsen was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2003. The medal is awarded to ""Canadian citizens for outstanding achievement and service to the country or to humanity at large."" iReport: Share your favorite quotes, memories .

"Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai has said 40 girls in Pakistan will be the first to benefit from a fund set up in her name after she was shot in the head by the Taliban for her efforts to promote girls' education. She announced the $45,000 grant for education in the Swat Valley -- the Taliban stronghold where she's from -- in a video played at the Women in the World summit in New York City on Thursday. ""We are going to educate 40 girls, and I invite all of you to support the Malala Fund,"" she said. ""Let us turn the education of 40 girls into 40 million girls."" Actress and U.N. special envoy Angelina Jolie spoke movingly of Malala's courage in the face of the Taliban's attempt to silence her, saying there was ""always something special"" about her. ""They shot her at point-blank range in the head and made her stronger,"" she said. Gordon Brown: 32 million girls not at school, we must push for change . ""In a brutal attempt to silence her voice, it grew louder, and she more resolute in calling on the entire world, not just Pakistan, to ensure the right for every girl and boy to an education."" Jolie also paid tribute to Malala's reluctance to be in the limelight for her own sake, despite her new influence as a campaigner and role model. ""She is powerful, but she is also a sweet, creative, loving little girl who wants to help others and work for others,"" Jolie said. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid . ""She doesn't want to be center of attention -- her goal is progress, not notoriety."" Jolie will donate $200,000 to the Malala Fund, which was set up to support the education of girls in Pakistan, Women in the World said. The fund was established on Malala's behalf by the Vital Voices Global Partnership, a non-governmental organization founded in 1997 by former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Malala spoke via Skype on Friday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who said he was ""deeply impressed"" with her. ""When we work together we can achieve our goal, and our goal is simple: peace and happiness in this world,"" she told Ban. ""The way to see peace is through education. It is an honor for me to be associated with the U.N. I want to tell the world how important education is."" Ban said, ""The U.N. will always be with you and the many people like you."" ""If we educate a woman, we educate a family, a community and a country,"" he said. Earlier this week in Washington, Malala was presented with Vital Voices' Global Trailblazer Award, in ""recognition of her courage, conviction, and vision for the future."" Previous recipients of the award include Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. READ MORE: Malala's journey from near death to recovery . Malala, now 15, rose to global fame after the attack which almost claimed her life last October.

"Mattias' baby picture sits prominently on the Mosquera family's mantel in their home in Teaneck, New Jersey, his tiny hand wrapped around his mom's index finger. The first moments of a baby's life are always filled with photographic milestones. From the cutting of the umbilical cord to the first mother-child portrait to bringing a little one home, there's typically a camera close by to document every step. On most mantels, those framed memories would grow: from the first day of school to high school prom, to cap and gown and beyond. But for Mattias, it's just the one. At just 7 hours old on July 9, 2014, Mattias passed away surrounded by his parents, grandparents, 4-year-old sister and Domenica Comfort, one of many photographers who have taken it upon themselves to document stillborn and terminal babies' precious moments after birth. ""She took the time to photograph his little hands, his little feet, his hair, his ears, everything about him,"" Maria Cecilia Mosquera, Mattias' mother, said of Comfort. ""...All his beautiful little features, which in the seven hours he lived, I didn't have time to fully appreciate."" It's a sad fact that tens of thousands of families in the United States each year mourn an infant whose life was measured in hours, or less. Approximately 26,000 babies in the United States each year are stillborn, according to the National Institutes of Health. Another 11,300 babies in the United States, on average, die each year on the day they're born, according to a report from Save the Children. And that's not counting a pregnancy miscarriage rate of 15% to 20%. When Maria Cecilia was about 20 weeks pregnant, she and her family found out Mattias had Trisomy 18, a chromosomal condition with which fewer than 10% of newborns survive to their first birthdays. Mosquera stumbled upon the idea of remembrance, or bereavement, photography on an online support group for moms carrying babies with poor prognoses. From there, she was connected to Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep, a national organization that connects parents who are losing or have just lost a baby to photographers, free of charge. ""I treasure each and every photo as the seven hours we had with him, we can never get back -- except through these photos,"" Mosquera said. 'Beauty and blessings' Photographer Sandy Puc' co-founded Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep with Cheryl Haggard after Haggard and her husband called Puc' in February 2005 to take black-and-white portraits of them cradling their dying 6-day old son. ""That night was the worst night of my life,"" Haggard said, in a statement published on the site. ""But when I look at the images, I am not reminded of my worst night. I'm reminded of the beauty and blessings he brought."" The two women realized that other families in that situation may want tangible, photographic portraits of their babies as part of the bereavement process -- and to reference years down the road. Now, their organization is in 40 countries with approximately 11,000 photographers. ""The bottom line is you know you're giving the family something priceless: a tool to use to heal,"" Puc' said. ""It's anything but macabre; it's very beautiful and moving."" Todd Hochberg of Evanston, Illinois, has been photographing perinatal loss for 17 years and is considered a pioneer in the field. His work helped set the tone for organizations like Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep. ""It literally changed my life in 45 minutes,"" Hochberg said of his first session. He started as a medical photographer in the hospital to capture surgeries for educational publications and corporate communications, but soon was drawn to the human stories of the NICU. ""I meet families at the most difficult time,"" Hochberg said. ""It is not a portrait of a dead child, but rather this incredible unfolding story of love and loss."" Hochberg says it's important to note that these images aren't intended to frighten but to inform and validate an experience that is often upsetting for the parents and their family. ""The most difficult picture often becomes the most important one for them. And it doesn't mean it's pleasant,"" he said. Facing grief . With any mode of grief, what works for one family might not work for another. Hochberg said he hopes his photos help destigmatize miscarriage and infant loss and challenge the assumption that the parents' grief must be less because they didn't have much time to get to know their child. He also wants to encourage grieving families to talk about their loss and not sweep it under the rug because of dated societal constraints. Rana Limbo, who helped found the bereavement organization Resolve Through Sharing, says this is important to note for any family or friend of someone who is going through this situation. ""Some people incorrectly equate length of life with level of relationship with a child,"" she said. Limbo said that women who experience a miscarriage form relationships with their babies at the very earliest stages of pregnancy. But they are often reluctant to talk about them. ""Because they presume that others will not understand these deeply felt emotions, they choose to keep the loss to themselves,"" she said. So if you know someone who has miscarried or lost a very young child, how do you talk to them about it? Limbo suggests calling their baby by name if one was chosen and to use the term, ""I remember"" in sharing one's memories of the baby. Also, she said, never try to find the silver lining with ""at least"" phrases like ""at least you know you can get pregnant."" An open ear opens the door for as little or as much conversation as the parents' want to share at that time, Limbo said. ""You can open the door with, 'Tell me more' or 'I think about you all the time.' 'Tell me how you are,'"" she said. How to help . Limbo said that if you know a friend or family member going through this, do NOT: . • Try to explain or rationalize what happened: ""God must have needed another angel in heaven,"" or ""It was nature's way."" • Start any sentence with ""At least."" • Not mention the baby. • Use the parents' story as a springboard for your own: ""Well, when my sister had a miscarriage, she..."" Or ""When I was pregnant..."" • Talk more than you listen. • Be silent.","Remembrance photography is offered to families to help cope with the grief of a lost baby .

"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" It's both a daunting and a promising question that children field from the time they can comprehend the concept of a future. For newborns in the neonatal intensive care unit of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, that tiny query is even more poignant. A new photo series imagines bright futures in store for the hospital's monitor-strapped preemies. Whimsical doodles are superimposed on pictures of the babies, depicting them in professions such as astronauts, Olympians, ballerinas and chefs. ""From the NICU to the Moon"" is part of the organization's Safe Sleep Campaign, which hopes to connect parents and caregivers with safe sleeping tips in order for their babies' sweet dreams -- amid the steady beep-beep of NICU monitors -- to become a reality. The photographs were taken by an employee of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and designers at Matchstic, a branding agency in Atlanta, handled the imaginative doodles. All of the little dreamers were born between 25 and 37 weeks of gestation, according to Jessica Wright, a nurse educator. ""We wanted the photos to help educate parents about the need for babies to sleep alone, on their backs and in a crib,"" Wright said, adding that babies can be unintentionally harmed by blankets and stuffed animals in the crib, sharing an adult bed or sleeping on his or her stomach. According to the CDC, approximately 4,000 infants between 1 month and 1 year of age die suddenly and unexpectedly each year -- and the leading cause of those deaths is accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed. More than that, the campaign is about looking to the next chapter after the NICU, Wright says, and a safe sleeping environment  is a big part of it. ""We also wanted the photo series to show that our NICU babies are poised to make a big impact on the world,"" Wright said.","""From the NICU to the Moon"" envisions prenatal babies in future professions .

"They were ready to land in Australia, at the end of a 14-hour international flight, when the 270 passengers of an Air Canada flight were suddenly thrown into a high-seas search-and-rescue operation. Flight AC033 diverted after pilot Andrew Robertson got a call from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority on Tuesday to help search for a yachtsman who had sailed from Sydney two weeks earlier. ""If we have the fuel, could we investigate an emergency beacon that had just gone off,"" came the question from maritime officials, Robertson told CNN Canadian affiliate CBC News. Down below, Glenn Ey of Queensland, Australia, was being tossed about in his crippled 36-foot yacht -- out of fuel and with a broken mast after a storm. ""I thought I had a very good chance of getting back to Sydney without assistance,"" Ey said after nine days adrift.  ""I couldn't see any evidence of Sydney, and I had no idea of my exact position, and it was at that point I set off the emergency position indicator radio beacon."" The search began as the Boeing 777, on its way from Vancouver, dropped from 37,000 feet to 4,000 feet. Robertson asked the passengers and crew to train their eyes on the choppy waters below. ""I think everyone's heart started beating a little bit faster,"" said Jill Barber, a Canadian singer, who was making the trip to Sydney for a concert.  ""They said ... we'd really appreciate it if everyone could look out their windows, and if anyone has any binoculars that could help us identify this yacht, that would be really helpful."" It didn't take too long to find Ey as passengers and crew scanned the waters below. ""We're doing this big sweeping right turn and almost immediately they said, 'Oh, we see something,' "" Robertson said. ""We were totally ecstatic."" Total from time from activation of the emergency beacon until he was found by the Air Canada flight: about 25 minutes.

"In 1995, South Africa seemed united beyond expectation, having rallied around an unlikely ambassador for racial change in a highly-fractured country. The Springboks' triumph at that year's Rugby World Cup seemed to herald the birth of the Rainbow Nation, with white team captain Francois Pienaar accepting the Webb Ellis Cup from Nelson Mandela, the first post-apartheid president. We seemed invincible, or at least it felt that way at the time. I remember every game of that tournament -- every scrum, every try, every drop-goal. I also remember how the crowd at our local watering hole -- the place to be to watch the matches - changed. What started off as a predominately white audience soon changed until we were shoulder to shoulder with people of all races. When we drove the streets of Cape Town after winning the final, honking our horns and singing ""shoshaloza"" -- which means ""go forward"" -- we weren't white or black, we were South Africans. Springboks overpower Namibia in 12-try romp at World Cup . It was the first time I can remember really feeling that way, and everyone was hopeful that it would last. Given the drama of that tournament, and the publicity that followed, it was only natural that rugby became more popular among races other than white. Chester Williams became the face of what South African rugby could be, and soon there were a number of talented black players getting Test caps. But it wasn't all smooth sailing. For a while there was a quota system -- for white-dominated sports such as rugby and cricket there had to be a certain number of players of color on the squad. My reaction to the requirement was similar to most of those around me: we were outraged. Holders South Africa scrape past Wales in 2011 opener . It seemed like a no-win situation: players of color were bound to be treated as second-rate or lacking, regardless of their ability to play. The ones that would have made the squad despite the quota system were hurt the most. Thankfully the practice was done away with, and South Africa Rugby Union (SARU) focused more on developing school-age players of color so coaches would have a more representative base from which to select. SARU President Oregan Hoskins points out that the organization sets aside 20 million rand ($2.75 million) each year with the specific goal of transforming the future of South African rugby to include more players of color. Clinics have been set up in disadvantaged areas and rugby is more prominent in schools that typically have been soccer-crazy. It has, for the most part, worked -- there are more players of color moving up the ranks from schoolboy rugby to professional levels. What doesn't make sense is that only three players of color made the squad for this World Cup, two of whom also played in South Africa's victorious 2007 campaign. Hoskins argues that South African rugby is still suffering from the effects of apartheid. ""This is a multifaceted challenge,"" he told CNN. ""We're still plagued by the effects of the past, we still live in predominately separate residential areas. There is change, but it's not quick enough and these issues are something we have to face as a society."" Hoskins believes that club rugby remains a problem. He maintains that there would be more change if the advantaged clubs opened their doors to players of color. The same can be said for provincial rugby. Hoskins said provincial teams are completely autonomous from the ruling body. They have their own constitutions which SARU cannot interfere with. If provincial teams don't include players of color in their squads, then the national side is almost forced to do the same because the selection depth just isn't there. It's not that there aren't any good players of color who want to play Springbok rugby, it's that there's a drop-off between school and provincial rugby selection, and the club situation doesn't help either. More needs to be done to move players up through the ranks and onto the national squad. Local media recently picked up on a report which said teams could soon be forced to include a certain number of players of color in their team, or face penalties including docked points and/or fines. This measure, however, is unlikely to be implemented as the teams themselves would have to vote on it. Hoskins doubts it would pass, but recognizes that SARU needs the provincial teams to transform faster than they presently are. It seems that the racial make-up of the national side is routinely brought into question right before a big tournament, such as the World Cup. Former SARU media adviser and rugby commentator Mark Keohane believes South Africans have been ""blinkered by success."" When the team does well, it's as if rugby in South Africa, and the country in general, has changed. When the team is doing poorly, everyone's an analyst and we're back to 1993. Keohane doesn't believe that there's enough consistency in the transformation effort. He criticizes Hoskins for failing to achieve SARU's stated goal of seven colored players being included in the squad for this year's tournament. Hoskins has asked for more time to work on the issue, saying society needs to change before the squad will reflect the new South Africa. Keohane is frustrated with the lack of accountability within SARU. He accuses the body of playing politics and avoiding making unpopular decisions. Hoskins maintains his hands are tied -- he needs more cooperation from the lower-level teams. It seems we're just running in circles. Both Keohane and Hoskins agree that South Africa is still racially divided. Keohane notes that, as a nation, South Africa hasn't learned how to deal with life post-apartheid. It's still the white elephant in the room. It's not just the players on the field who are mostly white, it's the spectators too -- match tickets are priced so high that typically only wealthy, usually white, South Africans can afford to attend. Hoskins doesn't believe it's an issue of money, he says it's a question of trying to get people to mix racially and accept each other. To help, SARU has announced that next year it will be holding a Test match in Soweto, the country's largest township. Moves like that are in the right direction, but it will take time before we have another ""Invictus"" moment for Hollywood to recreate. To me, a South African now living in the United States, it seems that South African rugby is in a better state than it was pre-World Cup 1995, but not where it could be. We can be proud of the fact that we're one of only two countries to lift the Webb Ellis Cup twice, and that we're still considered a rugby powerhouse. But perhaps indicative of how far South Africa still has to go, popular rugby commentator Darren Scott recently resigned from his job at a local radio station after hurling a racial slur at a co-worker, during a team-building retreat, over an unpaid loan. Scott has apologized profusely but the incident prompted Supersport, a leading sport channel for whom he was a freelancer, to drop him from the team sent to New Zealand to cover the World Cup. It might be that South Africans need to come together more before the boys on the pitch reflect the make-up of the country, but I'd like to think that rugby has the ability to be a game-changer off the field. It could serve as the example others would follow. We don't need to wait for the rest of society to catch up, we can show them how it's done and get closer to once again being South African first -- and black or white second.","South Africa seeking to retain Rugby World Cup title in New Zealand .

"Jumping out of buildings, running through barbed wire, flying makeshift planes and digging secret tunnels -- all desperate measures used by people to flee East Berlin after the wall went up. Those images and memories flooded back into Germany's collective conscious on Sunday, as the nation celebrated 25 years since the Berlin Wall came tumbling down. On November 9, 1989, tens of thousands of Germans literally tore it down by hand -- using their fists, pickaxes, sledgehammers and shovels. Then East Germany's communist government helped, heaving away chunks of it by crane, as its citizens streamed into the West and its one-party oligarchy collapsed. Freedom and ultimately a united Germany emerged from the bitter Cold War that had separated Berlin since the first concrete barrier went up in 1961. How 'The Tiger' fought the East German Stasi .

Berlin now shines as a crown jewel of central Europe. It's a far cry from the city and the country that were bombed to ruins during World War II. And Germany is now the world's fourth largest economy and the driving market in the European Union. On Sunday, thousands of Berliners, dignitaries and visitors from around the world gathered around the city's iconic Brandenburg Gate to remember the moment that many thought would never come. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the fall of the Berlin Wall sends ""a message of hope and that dreams can come true, nothing has to stay as it is, even if it's difficult."" People are also visiting the East Side Gallery, the longest part of the wall still standing -- measuring 2.2 kilometers or 1.6 miles. Most of the Wall was dismantled in the immediate aftermath and much of it was sent to other countries. There are parts of the Wall at the United Nations headquarters in New York as well as U.S. embassies and presidential libraries. 25 things you love about Berlin . Grandiose work of art . A grandiose performance art celebration on Sunday is to symbolize the disappearance of the wall. The ""Lichtgrenze"" (Border of Light) was placed along the former path of the Berlin Wall. It comprises thousands of illuminated white helium balloons -- to be released into the sky after a performance by the Staatskapelle Berlin orchestra. In a more somber ceremony, candles will burn at the National Memorial for the Victims of the Berlin Wall. Two hundred people were killed while trying to escape, many of them shot by border guards, others succumbing to accidents. Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit says he hopes the ceremonies will spread hope to people around the world. ""When the wall came down it was a signal to the world that freedom is possible,"" he said. ""There are many other walls in the world and people who do not live free.

"One of the actresses in ""Innocence of Muslims"" -- the anti-Islam film that ignited a firestorm in the Muslim world -- is suing the producer of the film, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, claiming she is a victim of fraud, invasion of privacy and misappropriation of her likeness. In a 17-page complaint filed Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, the lawsuit from Cindy Lee Garcia also names YouTube LLC, the video-sharing website on which the video is posted, and its parent company, Google Inc., as causing irreparable harm to Ms. Garcia for refusing to remove the content from their site. """"The lawsuit is not an attack on the First Amendment or the right of Americans to say what they think,"" but it demands the content be pulled off because ""Ms. Garcia in no way consented to the use of her performance, image or likeness in such an offensive and vile film,"" Garcia's attorney, M. Cris Armenta, said in a statement. In an interview with CNN, Garcia said she spoke with the producer after the unrest began.

The producers' representations that he ""intended to make an 'adventure film' and that plaintiff would be depicted as a concerned mother, were false,"" the suit claims. ""Defendant ... made an anti-Islam propaganda film, in which plaintiff is falsely made to appear to accuse the founder of the Islamic religion of being a sexual deviant and child molester,"" the suit says. On Wednesday, 79 cast and crew members released a statement saying they were ""extremely upset and feel taken advantage of by the producer."" They said they were ""shocked by the drastic rewrites of the script and lies that were told to all involved. We are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have occurred."" The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages against Nakoula for invasion of privacy, fraud, negligence, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. ""Ms. Garcia has lost her job, her privacy, and has suffered extreme distress over Nakoula's acts,"" according to the lawsuit. According to the complaint, YouTube privately informed Ms. Garcia that it will not voluntarily remove the content of the video. Attorney Armenta said that on Thursday, she will seek an emergency temporary restraining order against Nakoula and YouTube, asking that the content be removed permanently. No let-up in protests over anti-Islam film . Garcia claims since the film's backlash, she has received death threats and unable to visit her grandchildren out of fear that they will be harmed.

"A man walks into a supermarket, hands over a beer can and receives money back. This may seem contrary to the natural order -- but it's all part of brewer Carlsberg's sustainability drive. Central to this is Carlsberg's use of Denmark's reverse vending machines, run by Dansk Retursystem. There are 3,000 of these futuristic reverse vending machines dotted around Denmark, through which 3 million items are deposited every day. You put a can or bottle into the machine and it gives you a voucher or money back for your efforts. The number of packages returning through the system is astonishing: 90% of cans designed for single use are recycled, and nearly 100% of refillable bottles find their way back to Carlsberg. The brewing giant's bottles and cans themselves are designed to be as sustainable as possible. To make packaging more environmentally friendly, ""the most obvious thing we can do is reduce the weight,"" said Simon Hoffmeyer Boas, CSR manager. Lighter products can lessen energy needed in the manufacturing process, and ""within the last 20 years the average weight of a glass bottle has been reduced by approximately 30%,"" Hoffmeyer Boas said. The innovation makes the bottles cheaper to manufacture, alongside being better for the environment. ""For us sustainability, or CSR, is business, it's not something that is detached,"" he said. From the barley to the bottle, every part of the process is scrutinized by the company's research and development department to ensure it meets or beats sustainable targets. In the Carlsberg laboratory, where the pH scale was developed, new types of barley are developed. In 2010 the company introduced the Null Lox variety. Brigitte Skadhuge, director of applied research, told CNN that type of barley ""helps beer to stay fresh for a longer time than traditional beer."" That gives beer a longer shelf life, reducing waste. The by-product of the spent grain also helps power the plant. The husk, the outer covering of the barley grain, is placed in a bi-fermentor which transforms the cellulose into methane gas.  This gas provides 90% of the thermal energy needed at the plant. Even the waste from the waste is put to good use -- the waste from the bio-fermentor is used as a natural fertiliser in the barley fields.","There are 3000 of reverse vending machines dotted around Denmark .

"The Internet got its Christmas wish to #SaveBela. Bela is now being sent to live at a Utah animal sanctuary. The Indiana German shepherd tugged at collective heartstrings last week when it was revealed he could be euthanized due to a stipulation in his late owner's will. But Bela will go to Best Friends Animal Society, the group revealed on its blog Tuesday. ""We are thrilled to announce that Bela has been released to Best Friends Animal Society and we are currently arranging his transport to our sanctuary in Kanab, Utah,"" wrote Francis Battista, vice chair of Best Friends. People across the country learned of 9-year-old Bela's story through media reports last week that emphasized a provision in the will of his owner, Connie Ley, that said the dog should be put to sleep and his ashes placed with Ley's ashes if a suitable home couldn't be found for Bela. The social media hashtag #SaveBela was born after the public expressed outrage at Ley's request to put down a healthy dog. ""Add me to the list of people who would gladly adopt Bela and give her a happy home. Please #SaveBela from her dead owner's stupidity,"" one woman wrote. However Doug Denmure, Ley's attorney, said outsiders didn't know the whole story. Before her death on November 25, Ley worried that Bela's aggressive behavior could pose a danger to other people. ""He could cause damage and inflict bodily harm on strangers, in particular, children,"" Denmure told CNN affiliate WCPO-TV in Cincinnati. ""When (Ley) died, she died at her home and the dog was in there. No one could enter the house because they were concerned the dog would attack."" The dog was housed in a special kennel at PAWS of Dearborn County Humane Center in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, until a decision could be made. Ley's will left the option to send Bela to the Utah animal sanctuary or to put him to sleep up to a close friend. Ley stated that if it was cost prohibitive or otherwise impossible to send the dog to the shelter, he should be put down and laid to rest with her, according to her attorney. ""Denmure and her designated friend, charged to decide what was best for Bela, were unaware of Best Friends experience in providing appropriate care for dogs like Bela,"" Eric Rayvid, a shelter representative, told WCPO after it was revealed that the dog would be saved. Before the decision was reached, Denmure maintained that everything about Ley's request was legal. ""The dog was being owned by my client and now it's part of her estate,"" he told WCPO. ""And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don't have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client's will and impose what they want."" The case has raised ethical questions about how much control the deceased should have over the lives of their pets. ""On the whole, we don't allow people to euthanize healthy pets,"" said Edward Queen, a professor of ethics at Emory University. On the other hand, he said, it's not uncommon for unwanted pets to be euthanized. ""As a matter of policy, do we really want people to control the life of a healthy pet on a whim?"" he pondered. ""Assuming the dog is healthy and will be cared for, I'm not sure we want to encourage this."" Best Friends Animal Society said in its blog post that it's time for a new hashtag: #BelaIsSafe -- but he isn't out of the woods yet. ""Of all those party to the unfolding events following Connie Ley's passing, Bela has experienced the trauma of losing his life-long companion and his home. Our first priority is to do everything we can to make Bela's life whole once again in keeping with Connie Ley's wishes for her beloved dog.""","#SaveBela started after the public learned a healthy Indiana dog might be euthanized .

"(CNN)Two Sydney men have been charged with terror offenses, with one accused of possessing documents designed to facilitate a terror attack on Australian soil. Sulayman Khalid, 20, from Regent's Park in western Sydney, appeared in Parramatta Local Court Wednesday, after having been arrested at his home the previous day, police said. He was refused bail, and is scheduled to reappear in court on February 18, court staff said. The maximum sentence he faces is 15 years, police said. A second man, a 21-year-old from the Sydney suburb of Marsfield, was also charged by counter-terrorism police with breaching a control order. A person can be subject to a control order if it substantially helps prevent a terrorist attack, or the person has trained with a listed terrorist organization or been convicted of terror offenses, according to the Australian Attorney General Department. The charge carries a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. 'Overt action' Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan told reporters that the arrests related to ""activity that has been going for a while now."" ""This group has had ongoing conversations and activity for the last year,"" he said, adding that ""particularly overt action"" had been taken on 18 September and again last week, prompting the authorities to obtain search warrants. A ""significant amount of material"" had been seized, he said. While there was no specific threat of an imminent attack, he told reporters: ""There was enough there that gave concern to us that something was being planned."" ""The documents talked a little bit about potential government targets."" 'Heightened' threat . The arrests came the same day that Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned of a ""heightened level of terror chatter"" following the Martin Place siege in Sydney, in which two people, along with hostage-taker Man Haron Monis, were killed. ""The terror threat remains high ... and at this level an attack is likely,"" Abbott told reporters Tuesday. ""We don't know when and how an attack may come, but we do know that there are people with the intent and the capability to carry out further attacks."" The arrests were made as part of Operation Appleby, an ongoing investigation into Islamist extremists, which led to sweeping pre-dawn counter-terror raids in Sydney in September. Eleven people have been arrested in relation to the operation so far, police said. Phelan said Operation Appleby was focused on a group of 15 to 20 people in the Sydney region who sympathized with ISIS ideology, and who had been actively monitored for some time. A police spokeswoman would not comment on claims in Australian media that the target allegedly mentioned in the documents was an Australian Federal Police building, or that the documents described a plan to conduct guerrilla warfare in New South Wales' Blue Mountains. Following his arrest, footage appeared in Australian media of Khalid, dressed in a jacket bearing the ISIS flag, storming off the set of an Australian current affairs show in August in which guests had been discussing local support for Islamic extremism.

"(CNN)A woman believed to be the world's oldest Facebook user has died at the age of 114, her family said. Anna Stoehr of Plainview, Minnesota, gained widespread attention in October when she said she'd had to lie about her age to sign up for the social network. Facebook responded by celebrating her impressive longevity on her birthday. ""She turned 114 in October of this year and received a huge bouquet of 114 flowers from Facebook after they learned that she was not able to sign up without putting in a fake age of 90 or 95,"" Harlan Stoehr, her 84-year-old eldest son, told CNN on Tuesday. He told CNN that his mother -- who leaves 5 children, 27 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren -- died Sunday. No phone, no car, no electricity . She was born in 1900, the year before the assassination of President William McKinley and the death of Queen Victoria. Her family had no telephone, car or electricity at the time. Facebook isn't set up to accommodate such venerable users. The network's sign-up page only allows people to put dates of birth going back to 1905. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had attempted to reach Anna Stoehr after his company sent an apology about the age restriction, according to her daughter-in-law Marlene Stoehr. ""She was not available when he had his assistant call to get hold of her because of a medical appointment, and then Mark Zuckerberg was out of the country so it never happened,"" she said. ""But it was an exciting time for everyone with all the attention."" The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Lived on a farm until she was 112 . Facebook isn't the only area where Anna Stoehr stood out -- she was also the oldest person in Minnesota. She even threw out the first pitch at a Minnesota Twins game (via a video-taped throw) at the age of 113, according to her son. ""They asked her if she would pitch it overhand or underhand, and she said, 'Overhand, of course, it's baseball,'"" he said. Harlan Stoehr said his mother was always very active and had lived on a farm near Elgin, Minnesota, from 1936 until 2013. She was left alone there after the death of her husband in 1998. At the age of 112, she moved to an apartment in a retirement community in Plainview. ""She loved gardening and always had huge flower gardens and strawberries,"" her son said. ""She grew all kinds of things, and when an apple tree on her farm blew down, she planted another one. She was 105 years old at the time."" Signed up for Facebook at 113 . Her interest in getting onto Facebook at the age of 113 grew out of a friendship with a Verizon salesman. Joseph Ramireza was selling an iPhone to Stoehr's 85-year-old son, who started talking about his mother. Ramireza said he had to meet her. ""She's become something of a kindred spirit,"" Ramireza told CNN affiliate KARE-TV in October. He helped her use FaceTime to video chat with friends on an iPad and has been teaching her to use email and Google search. When Facebook didn't have her birth year as an option, Ramireza helped Stoehr write a letter to Zuckerberg -- on a typewriter. ""I'm still here,"" she said in the letter.","Anna Stoehr of Plainview, Minnesota, lied about her age to get on Facebook .

"President Barack Obama didn't know of problems with the Affordable Care Act's website -- despite insurance companies' complaints and the site's crashing during a test run -- until after its now well-documented abysmal launch, the nation's health chief told CNN on Tuesday. Rough Obamacare rollout: 4 reasons why . In an exclusive interview with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta asked when the President first learned about the considerable issues with the Obamacare website.  Sebelius responded that it was in ""the first couple of days"" after the site went live October 1. ""But not before that?"" Gupta followed up. To which Sebelius replied, ""No, sir."" Sebelius admitted that there is concern in her department and the White House over the technical debacle surrounding the website rollout, saying ""no one could be more frustrated than I am and the president."" The site was supposed to make it simple for people to search and sign-up for new health care policies starting on October 1, but instead it's been clunky and, at times, inoperable. ""We're not at all satisfied with the workings of the website,"" Sebelius said. ""We want it to be smooth and easy and let consumers compare plans."" Obama: No 'sugarcoating' problems with website . She noted how a team of high-tech experts from within the government and from Silicon Valley, and led by Jeff Zients -- a former CEO and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who will oversee the process for the next few months -- is coming to help address the issues. Their arrival was announced earlier Tuesday. Why weren't they brought in before the website launched October 1? ""We (had) hoped that they had their 'A-Team' on the table"" from the start, Sebelius said of the contractors and agencies responsible for the project. As to now, ""We want new eyes and ears. We want to make sure that we get all the questions on the table, that we get all the answers and accelerator the fix as quickly as possible."" The secretary attributed some of the problems to ""extremely high"" volume, claiming nearly 20 million people came to the Obamacare website in the first three weeks after its launched. Yet only a fraction of those have signed up for new health care policies; Sebelius said Tuesday that 500,000 accounts had been created, but that doesn't mean all those people enrolled in a plan. Obamacare applications near half million . It's not like no one saw this coming. A number of insurance companies complained of problems ahead of the October 1 launch, and the website crashed during a test run although just a few hundred users were on it. Despite the issues, the Obama administration went forward with the website. Report: Site failed ahead of rollout . ""There are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families,"" said Sebelius, explaining why the launch wasn't pushed back. ""...So waiting is not really an option."" Opinion: Obamacare a disaster that needs fixing . Republicans -- who, even before the website's launch, had made targeting the program a centerpiece of their agenda, even initially insisting they wouldn't vote to fund the entire government unless Obamacare was defunded or delayed -- have been vociferous critics. They claim that the website's woes show that Obama's administration and the federal government generally aren't capable of executing what the GOP says was an ill-advised program from the get-go. ""God only knows how much money they've spent, and it's a failure,"" Sen. Mitch McConnell, the leading Republican in the Senate, said Sunday on CBS. ""The government isn't going to be able to get this job done correctly."" On the other side, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire sent a letter to Obama asking that the open enrollment period be extended past March 31, 2014, and that he consider delaying assessment of a penalty to individuals who don't sign up for any health insurance before the so-called ""individual mandate"" kicks in. ""As you continue to fix problems with the website and the enrollment process, it is critical that the administration be open to modifications that provide greater flexibility for the American people seeking to access health insurance,"" Shaheen wrote. Even the man whose name is forever tied to the health care reform has been critical, insisting Monday there's ""no excuse for the problems"" while at the same time insisting these should not equate to blanket condemnation of the Affordable Care Act as a whole. ""Nobody's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should,"" Obama said, ""which means it's going to get fixed."" Several top Republicans -- including 2012 vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan -- have called on Sebelius herself to step down due to the program's problems. The secretary skirted questions Tuesday about whether she'd step down, saying only that she works ""at the pleasure of the president"" and is committed to her job. ""I think my job is to get this fully implemented and to get the website working right,"" Sebelius told Gupta. ""And that's really what I'm focused on."" While refusing to give a timetable Tuesday as to when the website will be fully operational, Sebelius insisted ""it's improving every day, and more people are getting through."" ""More people are having an easier time,"" she said, ""and we intend to stay at this until we open the door's wide open."" Rubio calls for delay of Obamacare sign-up deadline . And it's too early to call the rollout a failure, the health secretary argued. There's a long way to go for people to take advantage in person, by calling or by using the website during the open-enrollment period. When that six-month stretch is over, Sebelius said, people can make more valid judgments as to whether this part of Obamacare is a success or failure. CNN Fact Check: Obamacare . Sebelius, rather than being disheartened by the website criticisms, says that what's happened so far leaves her optimistic. ""What we're seeing in not only the states that are run by the federal website, but states around the country, is that interest is huge,"" she said. ""People are eager to have this affordable product, and that product is there.""","Democratic senator urges Obama to extend enrollment, delay ""mandate"" penalty .

"A new video released by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula confirms the group's senior leaders were closely involved in the plot to blow up a U.S. airliner over Detroit five years ago and that American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was among them. The video, released by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's official media arm, shows a short clip of the ""underwear"" bomber, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, together with both the group's leader, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, and al-Awlaki. CNN is unable to confirm the authenticity of the clip, which is in slow motion and lasts barely five seconds. But Laith Alkhouri of Flashpoint Partners, which monitors jihadist media releases, says it appears to be genuine. A previous al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula video released in June showed AbdulMutallab embracing al-Wuhayshi, who is now deputy to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. AbdulMutallab's communications and meetings with al-Awlaki were previously known. But this video underlines the extent to which  al-Awlaki was by the fall of 2009 closely involved with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's leadership. AbdulMutallab, a Nigerian student, boarded a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 with a device hidden in his underpants. He was unable to detonate it as the airliner descended to its destination. The video -- some 30 minutes long -- is a compilation celebrating an important clan in central Yemen, the Dahab, and specifically three brothers, Nabil, Qa'id and Tariq. They had become prominent supporters of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and formed a friendship with  al-Awlaki, who married their sister. One of the brothers, Qa'id Al Dahab, recruited AbdulMutallab in the Yemeni capital and brought him to the attention of the al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leadership in autumn 2009, according to Alkhouri. During AbdulMutallab's brief trial (which ended abruptly when he changed his plea to guilty), it was disclosed that the Nigerian had told the FBI he had been introduced in Sana'a to an al Qaeda operative named Abu Tarak, who became his principal handler. It seems Abu Tarak may in fact have been one of the Al Dahab brothers. In late November 2009, Abu Tarak enlisted AbdulMutallab in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's plan to attack an American airliner. In releasing the video now, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is drawing attention to the role of Dahab family members in its ongoing battles against Houthi militia in Bayda, and trying to rally support in what has become a draining war of attrition. Battles between al Qaeda fighters and Houthi militia across a wide swath of central Yemen are an almost daily occurrence. Bomb attacks in Ra'da last week killed more than 20 people, including 15 girls on a bus. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was quick to blame the Houthi for the girls' deaths. The Houthi, a Shia minority in Yemen, seized control of Sana'a in September and have since pushed into central Yemen.  They also control Yemen's second port, Hodeidah, on the Red Sea. The video includes a quote from  al-Awlaki, who says ""The host for this jihad is the clan. In Afghanistan the clan, in Iraq the clan and in Somalia the clan."" Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula needs the support of the tribes in its fight against the Houthis, and has tried to cast the struggle as one between the Sunni tribes and ""heretical"" Shia for the soul of Islam. As for the Dahabs, Qa'id was killed last year, purportedly in a drone strike. Tariq brought Sharia law to the town of Ra'da in Bayda in 2012, but was then killed by his half-brother Hizzam, who had objected to al Qaeda's presence in Ra'da. The al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula video claims Hizzam killed Tariq ""with the support of the Yemeni regime and their masters the Americans.""","Video shows bomber with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leaders .

"(CNN) -- Miles Craigwell is a 21st-century warrior. The armor has come off, the helmet lays on the side of the field. Gone are his gridiron days -- this is rugby sevens and it's as fast as it is brutal. ""We're modern-day gladiators,"" the 27-year-old told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. ""We are out there fighting, we are brotherhood, together, we're teammates. We hit each other for one another and we have each others' backs, so I think that sums it up very much."" Craigwell knows all about being in a battle -- after an impressive college career at Brown University, he was tipped for big things when he was drafted by the Miami Dolphins. But after failing to make the grade and with his life at a crossroads, he moved back to Boston where a chance glance at a television changed everything. ""I just happened to be in a diner and I saw the rugby on TV,"" he said. ""And then, right then and there I called my agent and told him, this is the sport I want to do. ""Football wasn't working out at the time and I didn't want to go into the corporate 9-5 just yet. ""I felt like I still had athletic bones in me. So I saw it and I was like, you know, it involves a lot of things that football does; running, tackling, hitting. Just using your speed and physicality. ""So I called up my agent, told him to get in touch with the USA coach, and then from there I was welcomed to try out with his summer club team, and then from the club team I went to nationals, and then from there got invited to the USA camp."" Since making the switch in 2010, Craigwell has not looked back, becoming an integral part of the U.S. team -- which is seeking to break into the sport's top-10 rankings -- despite his late entry into the game. But while some of the skills he gained in gridiron have helped him adapt, Craigwell still can't get over how different the game is from the one he witnessed in the comfort of that Boston diner. ""It was definitely appealing on TV but in real life it was more than I expected,"" he explained. ""The fitness levels necessary was beyond my imagination. I ran track and played football in college at the collegiate level, and coming off of the rugby pitch you're more drained and more tired than any other sport I've participated in. ""I'd say football has the hardest hit because you wear a helmet and shoulder pads -- people think they're invincible. ""But it's going to hurt on the rugby pitch as well because you don't have any padding. It's flesh to flesh, so whatever you work out and whatever you have, whatever God's given to you and whatever you make in the gym is going to help you out on the pitch. ""So it's imperative that you work out, you lift and go out there with your best birthday suit on."" One of the biggest differences Craigwell encountered was the speed of the game and the levels of concentration. Sevens is a non-stop sport, with games divided into seven-minute halves -- a world away from the stop-start nature of the NFL. ""In football it's really just three or four seconds of concentration,"" he said. ""But in rugby it's the full seven minutes so you're hitting someone here, then you have to get up, then you might have to hit the next person who has the ball -- it's just continual play. ""Whereas in football you have water breaks, you have timeouts, TV timeouts and then you go from offense to defense and vice versa. ""You have to be skilled in both attack and defense in rugby, which is pretty different from football, where you might just focus on offense or you might just focus on defense."" While his friends and family might not have caught up yet with all the new rules and changes, Craigwell says he has been given a huge amount of support following his decision. With the sevens circuit set to arrive in Las Vegas on January 24, the winger is hoping the tournament will capture the imagination of the locals -- although he's already looking forward to a night out in ""Sin City."" ""The Vegas tournament is great,"" he said. ""I mean it's Vegas -- what more do you need? ""What better attraction do you need to get out there and go? ""We have a great following in the States and everybody loves to go to Vegas, so it's a really good tournament. It's one of my best.""","Miles Craigwell plays rugby sevens for the United States .

"Some call Makoko the ""Venice of Africa"". But while the intricate waterways may replicate the layout of the picturesque Italian city, living conditions could hardly be more contrasting. Makeshift houses with corrugated iron roofs balance precariously atop stilts. Down below, narrow wooden boats act as a form of aquatic taxi ferrying goods and people around the bustling community. Nobody knows the exact population of this slum district of Lagos but it is estimated to be as high as 100,000. What's sure is that few tourists will come here to take a romantic gondola trip beneath the night sky, moonlight bouncing off the water onto informal shacks. There is little by the way of a sewer system meaning all sorts of pungent smells are sure to puncture the nostrils. On top of that, law enforcement agencies rarely enter the slum with security left to groups of young men known locally as the ""Area Boys."" A lens on home . For photographer Sulayman Afose, however, the muddy waters of Makoko have always been home. The aspiring 24-year-old was born, raised and continues to live in this chaotic floating district.  As such, it is one of the subjects he feels most comfortable turning his ever more popular lens on. ""I started my photography here in Makoko,"" Afose told CNN when we meet at the plush surrounds of the 2014 Lagos Photo Festival. ""It's really inspiring .... I've been able to get a lot of inspiration in terms of seeing a lot of things in my community,"" he added. Afose's career has really begun to take off in recent years. After learning his craft in workshops put on by the African Artists Foundation he went on to study photojournalism at the Nigerian Institute of Journalism. He's since had photos exhibited at various national arts and photography festivals as well as appearing in numerous international magazines and publications. International collaboration . Afose has even worked alongside the respected Spanish photographer Cristina De Middel. ""(I am) happy to see some of my work published,"" he said. ""And to see the fact of my name written on the pictures is something very great."" Yet despite the international recognition, its the daily hustle and bustle of Makoko that continues to inspire Afose. He explains that his knowledge of the local customs, attitudes and the people who live there gives him an edge over those who may come from outside to document life in the community. ""To tell the story with this (holding up a camera), you have to know who this guy is (pointing to a man in a photograph)."" Just by looking at him, ""is he happy or is he not happy? You have to try to know what it is all about. ""You can't just pick up your camera and start shooting,"" he said. Here and now . Then there's the skill vital for any photojournalist to develop, the handy knack of being in the right place at the right time. Afose was rapidly on the spot when a fire that tore through part of Makoko in 2013. The scenes were horrific but the images Afose captured told the story and brought some of  the harsh realities of life in the slum to the outside world. They appeared in numerous publications in print and online. ""The fire was caused by a generator and it burned a lot of houses in the community,"" Afose explained. ""I had the opportunity to get there at the right time and try document what the scene was all about, what caused the scene (and) what caused the fire outbreak,"" he added. It is likely the Makoko fire wouldn't have garnered as much attention in the national and international press without Afose's timely and grabbing images. The experience has made him even more aware of the importance of having local people tell the story of the community there. So much so that it has inspired him on to his next challenge. ""I want to go further, I want to know more,"" he said. When pushed on what this means, he added, ""you know, maybe having a university degree (so I can) come back to the community and teach people ... to become what I am today."" Maybe then the outside world will be able to appreciate even more of life in Makoko through the sharp-shooting eyes of its residents.","Photographer Sulayman Afose specializes in capturing life in the Makoko neighborhood of Lagos .

"U.N. weapons inspectors returned ""overwhelming and indisputable"" evidence of the use of nerve gas in Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday, calling the findings ""beyond doubt and beyond the pale."" The inspectors' 38-page report was released after Ban briefed Security Council members on its contents. The team found what it called ""clear and convincing evidence"" that the nerve agent sarin was delivered by surface-to-surface rockets ""on a relatively large scale"" in the suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus on August 21. ""It is the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988, and the worst use of weapons of mass destruction in the 21st century,"" Ban said. ""The international community has a responsibility to ensure that chemical weapons never re-emerge as an instrument of warfare,"" he said. Ban called the attack ""a war crime"" and a violation of treaties banning the use of chemical weapons that date back to 1925. But the inspectors' mandate did not include assigning blame for the attack, and Ban would not speculate on who launched the attack. The team did identify two types or rockets it said were used to deliver the gas and their trajectories, and international observers have said those weapons are not known to be in the hands of rebels battling the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Australian U.N. Ambassador Gary Quinlan, who is currently serving as president of the Security Council, said the report bolsters his country's stance.  It ""confirms, in our view, that there is no remaining doubt that it was the regime that used chemical weapons."" Read the report . And Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador, said a preliminary review of the report points toward forces loyal to al-Assad. ""The regime possesses sarin, and we have no evidence that the opposition possesses sarin,"" Power said. ""It defies logic"" to think members of the opposition would have infiltrated a regime-controlled area to fire on opposition-controlled areas. Britain, France, and NATO have also said al-Assad's regime was behind the attack. But Russia is Syria's leading ally, and Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin maintained Moscow's stance that Syrian rebels might be to blame. Such suggestions ""cannot be simply shrugged off,"" Churkin said, and statements insisting that the opposition could not have launched the attack ""are not as scientific and grounded in reality as the actual situation could be."" He questioned why rebel forces didn't report major losses in the August 21 chemical attack, which the United States says may have killed more than 1,400, including hundreds of civilians. Samples examined . The August 21 attack led to U.S. calls for military action against Syria, which denies its forces unleashed chemical weapons and blamed rebel fighters for the deaths. Syria has since agreed to join the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and hand over its chemical arsenal to international inspectors, with the United States and Russia laying out a fast-paced framework for Damascus to follow. Monday's report presents a stark picture of the damage that can be inflicted by a nerve agent like sarin, one of three types of poison gas Syria is believed to have stockpiled. ""Survivors reported that following an attack with shelling, they quickly experienced a range of symptoms, including shortness of breath, disorientation, eye irritation, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting and general weakness,"" Ban said. ""Many eventually lost consciousness. First responders described seeing a large number of individuals lying on the ground, many of them dead or unconscious."" The weather made things worse.  Falling temperatures at the time of the attack meant the downward movement of air, allowing the gas ""to easily penetrate the basements and lower levels of buildings and other structures where many people were seeking shelter,"" Ban said. Inspectors interviewed survivors and first responders, collected hair, urine and blood samples and took soil and environmental samples from the sites where the rockets fell. The secretary-general said the team ""adhered to the most stringent protocols available for such an investigation, including to ensure the chain of custody for all samples."" More than 100,000 people had already been killed in Syria before August 21, according to the United Nations. Another 2 million have fled the country, most of them taking refuge in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq. It was not immediately clear how the report would affect events on the ground. The opposition Syrian National Coalition said the findings ""demand a unified and decisive response by the international community."" ""If the world does not act now, this war will continue, and thousands more will die,"" Najib Ghadbian, the coalition's representative to the United Nations, said in a written statement. ""The people of Syria look to the U.N. Security Council to do everything in its power to stop this conflict and hold the Syrian regime responsible for its criminal actions."" In Washington, the White House announced that President Barack Obama would waive restrictions on exporting chemical protective gear to provide that equipment to the opposition and train ""select, vetted members"" in its use. American equipment will also be provided to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the international body that monitors compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention. It will be OPCW inspectors who are likely to carry out Syria's promised disarmament. Syria: There's a chemical weapons agreement. Now what? Also Monday, Turkish fighter jets downed a Syrian helicopter near the border between the two countries Monday, Turkey's semiofficial Anatolia News Agency reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc. Syria's state news agency SANA said the helicopter was watching for ""terrorists"" crossing the border and erroneously strayed into Turkish airspace, but was on its way back across the border when shot down. Russia slams U.S. remarks on agreement . Even as the world awaited the U.N. inspectors' report Monday, Russia openly bickered with the United States about the agreement they struck in Geneva over the weekend. The framework they laid out calls for a U.N. resolution demanding that Syria's chemical weapons be placed under international control. Security Council powers are now trying to put that framework into a resolution. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Monday accused U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry ""and his Western allies"" of misunderstanding the deal, according to Russia's state-run Itar-Tass news agency. Lavrov said the deal does not say the U.N. resolution will be under Chapter VII of the U.N. charter, which potentially authorizes the use of force -- and comments by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry that the any resolution will need to include the possibility of force ""show unwillingness to read the document"" that Russia and the United States endorsed. The agreement states that if there is noncompliance ""or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, the U.N. Security Council should impose measures under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter."" But it does not specifically state that the resolution being sought now will be under that chapter. Russia holds veto power on the council. But Kerry told reporters Monday that ""Should diplomacy fail, the military option is still on the table."" ""If the Assad regime believes that this is not enforceable, then they will play games,"" he said. Framework for eliminating Syrian chemical weapons . According to the plan, Syria must submit a full list of its chemical weapons stockpile within a week. International inspectors must be on the ground in the country by November, and all production equipment must be destroyed by the end of November. By the middle of next year, all chemical weapons material must be destroyed, according to the agreement. But the process of securing and destroying Syria's cache of chemical weapons -- in the middle of a civil war -- may be a logistical nightmare.","Syria findings ""beyond doubt and beyond the pale,"" Ban says .

"Censorship is a part of daily life in China. News articles are erased from online search engines, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are banned, and CNN is routinely blacked out for Chinese viewers. Instagram was a huge hit in China -- until the government banned it during the Hong Kong protests. ""All good things must end,"" one young Chinese woman told me -- seemingly resigned to the fact that she can no longer post photos on Instagram. While such restrictions would likely incite mass outrage in many Western countries, citizens in China often have no choice but to relinquish some personal freedom as the government keeps a firm grip on certain aspects of life in this booming society. China's Communist Party will do whatever it takes to stay in power. Censorship is just one tool -- along with quickly quelling civil disobedience. Of course, China feels like a utopia of liberty when compared with the repressive North Korean regime. I distinctly remember feeling a sense of freedom and relief when landing in Beijing after a recent visit to Pyongyang. In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the average citizen has never heard of the Internet or social media. Contact with the outside world is forbidden for all but the most elite members of this reclusive society. Propaganda rules the television airwaves and fills the pages of state-run newspapers. Censorship in China . The Sony hack story has received limited news coverage in China. Stories have appeared on CCTV's newscasts and in newspapers like China Daily, though with far less prominence than some other international news outlets. In Shenyang on Tuesday, an Internet search for ""North Korea"" on China's leading (and government-controlled) search engine Baidu.com revealed a list of mostly positive articles about the DPRK. A Baidu search for ""North Korea hack"" in English revealed just one nearly two-week-old article naming the DPRK as ""one of several suspects"" in the Sony hacking investigation. An identical search on unrestricted Google on Wednesday found more than 36 million articles. When questioned by foreign reporters on Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying shied away from directly addressing the issue on the Sony hacking probe. ""We need sufficient evidence before drawing any conclusion,"" she said at a news conference, adding that the United States and North Korea should communicate. Of course, any substantive communication is unlikely given the two countries have no diplomatic ties. The Great Firewall of China . Censorship is the reality of life behind the so-called Great Firewall of China. The Ministry of Public Security has been heavily censoring content for more than a decade. The Chinese government acknowledges that the Internet is a vital tool to support the country's rapid economic growth. Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba transactions totaled nearly $250 million last year, more than Amazon and eBay combined. Alibaba's overall revenue soared 54% to over $2.7 billion in 2014. China e-commerce transactions are expected to skyrocket to more than $700 billion by 2017. But with the Internet comes the risk of sharing information that, the Chinese government worries, could destabilize the country. In China, any threat to the Communist Party's tightly clenched grip must be controlled. It's why you're likely to find very little mention of North Korea's bureau 121 in this nation suspected of having its own shadowy People's Liberation Army unit 61398 -- believed to be responsible for cyberespionage. Incidentally, the Chinese military has also denounced the United States for having its own massive cyberspying program. As all of this continues to unfold, one thing is certain: International news organizations such as CNN will continue with extensive coverage. And, thanks to heavy-handed government censors, most citizens of China will continue get only the news deemed appropriate by the government.","News on Sony hack is censored in China, with just a few stories that get little play .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)2014 has been another amazing year for startups in Africa. More and more entrepreneurs turned their attention to building businesses that can solve the continent's problems and provide services it has long awaited. Enterprises emerged to fix problems in payments, traffic and talent, while more entrepreneurs raised more money from investors than ever before. Here, in no particular order are 10 of the most exciting young companies of the year. The list includes the startups I consider to have the most potential, to be the most viable -- not necessarily the most popular or hyped. Sendy . Where: Kenya . In a nutshell: Uber-style motorbike delivery service. What's unique: Africa has delivery services and courier services but never before Uber-style so you can track exactly where the deliver rider is via your phone app. Sending packages is usually expensive and difficult in big, congested African cities like Nairobi and Lagos. Many people use motorbikes to get to work to avoid getting stuck in traffic, so using motorbikes for deliveries is a smart, cheap, local solution. Future moves: Sendy is in a very strong position because e-commerce is growing and at some point those kinds of sites could integrate with companies like Sendy. It could also potentially be acquired by a foreign company, perhaps Amazon, if they decide to expand to Kenya or South Africa and want to invest in a delivery service that understands the terrain. Angani . Where: Kenya, East Africa region . In a nutshell: Pay-as-you-go cloud computing . What's unique: This is nothing new internationally, but the cloud computing space in Kenya is nascent. Angani are coming into the market trying to make prices affordable. What makes it cool is that you pay for what you use. You choose a plan and go. Future moves: It may be difficult for Angani to scale in a short time, given that all of their competitors in this new and growing market are established players. It remains to be seen whether their tactic of driving competition with low prices will attract enough customers. Irofit . Where: Nigeria . In a nutshell: Mobile payments without internet . What's unique: Their offering -- mobile payments over mobile networks -- is unique. It's something that hasn't been done before. Making mobile payments over the internet can often be an issue in Africa, so Irofit are leveraging more widespread mobile networks. Future moves: They launched very recently, and no one has used the app yet. But Irofit raised $600,000 in just six months earlier this year, showing that there are big players who think the startup has real potential. Wyzetalk . Where: South Africa . In a nutshell: Invite-only social platform for business . What's unique: A business platform for companies to help their employees to more effectively communicate. Staff can use the platform to collaborate on projects, set up meetings, instant message, share files and more. Future moves: Wyzetalk has been around since 2011, but they have built the company steadily, winning round after round of funding, which shows they must be doing something right. It is currently used by companies from a variety of industries including travel and tourism, tech and food and drink. They have a very solid model and are likely to keep growing. Gamsole . Where: Nigeria, Global . In a nutshell: Gaming company . What's unique: Celebrated as the biggest success story of any African game developers, this startup has been developing games in the Windows phone market for a couple of years. Gamsole was incubated in the 88mph accelerator and since then their games have seen 9 million downloads globally. Future moves: Gamsole recently received an innovation grant from Microsoft and are looking for new talent with a recently launched competition for illustrators and designers that offers $4,000 to the winner. They are also yet to launch a global smash hit game. Snapscan . Where: South Africa . In a nutshell: Make payments via your mobile phone . What's unique: A service, not dissimilar to Apple Pay, which allows people to make payments with their mobile phone by simply taking a photo of a QR code and punching in the amount they want to pay. Future moves: Less than a year after launch, the system was being used by 12,000 small businesses. There is huge potential for this service: There is an appetite for convenience in payments and there is an opportunity to leverage on Africa being mobile first. They have the potential to expand into other markets and maybe even compete with Apple Pay and Google Wallet. Delivery Science . Where: Nigeria . In a nutshell: Delivering smarter using big data . What's unique: This startup is all about using big data and analytics to help companies in Africa's emerging e-commerce sector manage inventory and deliver more efficiently. Delivery Science offer to completely manage a company's logistics from what's in the warehouse to innovative ideas like verification codes for deliveries to ensure the right person gets a package. Future moves: The company was started this year by a team who have successfully launched other startups and who are knowledgeable in delivery and logistics. They have the right idea and the knowledge to serve the market in Nigeria. Paysail . Where: Ghana . In a nutshell: Out-of-the-box payroll management application. What's unique: Right now, many companies in Ghana still use spreadsheets to organize employee pay. Paysail offers an all-in-one service that comes with Ghanian tax codes programmed in to make company accountants' jobs easier. Future moves: It's a new idea. It's different. Most of the companies -- like this one -- that are incubated in the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology in Ghana try to reach other markets. Right now, no one is doing anything like this in next-door Nigeria, which means the Paysail application has opportunity to offer an incredible change. Andela . Where: Nigeria, pan-Africa . In a nutshell: Training graduates as developers, matching them with employers . What's unique: Andela is focused on helping employers from all over the world find talent from Africa. They take it a step further by identifying raw talent and paying them to learn to become developers, then matching them with global employers looking for talent. The company currently has a local office in Nigeria and a company in the United States. Future moves: This company's approach is very smart. In Africa there is a desperate need for talent -- we don't have enough developers, let alone quality developers, because universities don't qualify graduates in technologies for the future. There is also a huge market globally, so this company has a massive opportunity. BRCK . Where: Kenya, all of Africa. In a nutshell: A self-powered, mobile WiFi device. What's unique: BRCK is a blackbox described by its makers as ""a backup generator for the internet,"" with the aim of solving Africa's connectivity issues. In Africa, there are power outages on a daily basis so getting online and staying online anywhere and anytime in these parts as well as other parts of the world requires a device that can seamlessly switch between multiple networks to provide access, even in remote areas. That's where BRCK comes in. Future moves: This product is quite ingenious. The potential impact and scale of this company is the reason it closed a $1.2 million seed funding round, after initially raising $172,000 in a Kickstarter campaign last year. BRCK has the potential to provide internet connectivity to rural areas across the world, where Internet access can be unstable.","This year, African entrepreneurs built businesses that can solve the continent's problems .

"(CNN) -- It was a frustrating day for many holiday fliers as almost 3,000 flights were postponed due to rain and poor visibility. Chicago, Dallas and Philadelphia all were hubs of harried travelers anxiously waiting for announcements that it was time to go. At some points, those didn't come for up to two hours. At Reagan National Airport in Washington, traveler Gregory Simpson had to wait an extra hour for his flight to Toronto. ""If you want to see family, you gotta do what you have to do,"" he said, taking the weather delay in stride. ""It's unfortunate that this tends to happen this time of year, but there's not a whole lot you can do about it."" One man at LaGuardia International Airport in New York took advantage of the extra time. He hit the airport shops to do some last minute gift buying. ""Anywhere and everywhere I can,"" he told CNN affiliate WCBS with a wry smile. At least one holiday flight doesn't have to worry about such annoyances. Santa's aircraft, Candy Cane One, was cleared by the FAA for gift deliveries. There were more than 2,800 delays because of weather and other reasons for flights with U.S. points of departure and/or arrivals, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.com. More than 380 were canceled. White Christmas for some . There was good news for snowplow drivers in Chicago as a storm system that was forecast to bring snow ended up to the east of the city. It was also weaker than expected, the National Weather Service office in Chicago said. The folks that clear the roads Thursday in the Rockies won't be as lucky. A storm system that is moving eastward will drop snow on the mountains and the High Plains, the NWS says. Snow totals in some areas of Idaho, Montana, Utah, South Dakota and Wyoming could be significant. The sun should return to a broad section of the southern and central United States on Thursday. AAA projects that 98.6 million Americans will travel 50 or more miles this holiday season, a 4% increase from last year. Those traveling by car can take advantage of plummeting gas prices -- which, averaging $2.25 nationwide, are down 69 cents a gallon from a year ago. Storms kill four in Mississippi . People grieved Wednesday and cleared rubble in southern Mississippi, where a tornado system killed four people Tuesday night and packed an emergency room with dozens of injured. That storm tore to pieces a mobile home in the countryside of Jones County, Mississippi, killing two people, Sheriff Alex Hodge said. ""There were other brick and mortar homes that had major damage, but we have no other injuries reported,"" he said. The storm also wrecked a church. A few dozen miles to the southwest, two more people died in storms in Marion County, police said. The hospital overflowed with injured people. ""Fifty patients were seen in the ER today because of the storm,"" said Marion General Hospital spokeswoman Millie Swan. ""We are operating on generator power. Columbia is completely out of power."" At least 6,300 households lost power and roads were cut off. Emergency operators have heard of people injured and trapped. Swan expects more injured patients to come into the hospital in coming days, once they can make it in. State of emergency . Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant issued a state of emergency for Marion and Jones counties. On a highway in between the two counties, the storm damaged a children's day care center, but spared the children inside. Unharmed, they were moved to a nearby bank building. In Louisiana, not far from the town of Amite, authorities said a windstorm damaged 15 homes. Civil defense sirens howl from the distance on a video posted to YouTube on Tuesday purportedly of a tornado in Mississippi that day. ""See it spinning?"" a woman asks another. Something on the grainy image seems to be circling in a mass of dark gray clouds on the nearby horizon. Tornadoes are not unusual this time of year in the Deep South, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. ""Actually, this is a secondary peak for tornado activity. The first is during the spring months."" CNN's Ben Brumfield, Devon Sayers, Tony Marco, Monica Garrett, Mayra Cuevas, Rene Marsh and Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","NEW: More than 2,800 flights delayed on Wednesday .

"(CNN)After days of caving, counter-caving, threats, U-turns, investigations and pontifications, it's hard to know which way's up anymore with Sony, ""The Interview"" and North Korea. So, now people will go to the movie when it opens Christmas Day in the U.S. and then perhaps everyone can judge the merits of this massive incident, but let's take a moment to speak for the only subgroup not represented in the viral debate. The film is about journalists, yes? OK, let's see what this might do for/to journalists, then. Sony Chairman Michael Lynton (a friend) said this about the film to CNN: . ""First of all, we made the movie because it was -- because we thought it was a funny comedy.  Secondly, there is a long history of political satire in film. And this clearly falls into that realm."" OK. And Michael -- who had run Penguin Books after the 1980's Salman Rushdie affair, when Iranian Ayatollahs condemned Rushdie to death for writing ""The Satanic Verses"" -- admitted that Sony's originally pulling ""The Interview"" from theaters was a blow to freedom of expression, which is uniquely dear and protected under the U.S. Constitution. OK. And after declaring Pyongyang was in fact behind the massive attack, President Barack Obama weighed in about setting a dangerous precedent: ""We cannot have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,"" Obama said. ""Imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like."" Absolutely right. And that's where we journalists come in. Because after all the Sturm und Drang about process, corporate profits, legal liabilities, constitutional rights, letting terrorists set the agenda --  let's talk a little about content. Let's in fact spare a thought for our subset diligently working away out there in the United States and around the world. What's the message? David Carr, media writer for The New York Times, said this about the film's content: . ""...while I am all for bold creative choices, was it really important that the head being blown up in a comedy about bungling assassins be that of an actual sitting ruler of a sovereign state? If you want to satirize a lawless leader, there are plenty of ways to skin that cat, as Charlie Chaplin demonstrated with ""The Great Dictator,"" which skewered Hitler in everything but name."" Yes, and...? What about those bungling assassins. They're journalists, right? Or meant to be? And what message will that send to every whacked-out dictator from another planet, paranoid, control freak thug posing as president? Not to mention crazy extremist throat-slitting militant terrorists? I don't want to spoil the discussion-party about satire, comedy, freedom of expression, etc., but I can tell you from personal experience the above-mentioned already think we are velvet revolutionaries at best, or CIA agents, military spies ... and yes, would-be assassins! One of the most appalling acts of ""journo murder"" was the killing of legendary Afghan freedom fighter Ahmad Shah Massoud, just days before 9/11. Imagine, two terrorists posing as journalist and cameraman get The Interview. They are in fact wired-up suicide bombers. No one thought to check them and the rest is history. In Iran, 35 journalists are in jail on specious charges, including Iranian-American Jason Rezaian of the Washington Post. His mother told me the family has heard that a closed ""trial"" condemned him on ""espionage-related"" charges.  It's nonsense, of course, but this is what journalists have to endure. The Iranian government seems to believe all these people are regime-change agents, through cultural subversion. They are terrified of a so-called Velvet Revolution and Color Revolutions ever since they put down the Green Movement after the disputed 2009 elections. Journalists were swept up in a dragnet, forced to ""confess"" on Iranian state TV before being ""tried"" and  sentenced to the infamous Evin Prison. Check out Jon Stewart's excellent debut movie, ""Rosewater,"" on the case of British-Iranian journalist Maziar Bahari. It's a sobering saga of the ridiculous, Kafkaesque dark reality of what it takes to be a journalist in Iran and other countries. In Russia, offending journalists -- not to mention anyone who vaguely looks sideways at Putin -- can feel the wrath of the system. Some are arrested, some worse. Anyone remember reporter Anna Politkovskaya, shot point blank in her Moscow apartment building in 2006? A staunch critic of the Kremlin and author of ""Putin's Russia,"" she was working on a series of reports about human rights abuses in Chechnya at the time of her death. And by the way, Facebook this week caved in to the Russian government's demand that a site for opposition politician Alexei Navalny be taken down. He's under house arrest. Huh? I didn't hear a peep of ""Sony-rage"" about this serious damage to freedom of expression. Terrible year for journalists in the Middle East . Over the years, in these and many other countries, the number of journalists killed, injured, arrested and just plain shut up, has soared and continues its horrible upward trajectory. Finally, this year, spare a thought for the victims of the madmen of today's Middle East: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, aid workers Alan Henning and Peter Kassig, were trussed up in Guantanamo colors, and forced to kneel before their throats were slit so wide their heads came off. Before their execution, they were forced to denigrate their families and their flags. They were forced to admit to false charges of spying and plotting. They were forced to give up their very dignity before they were forced to give up their lives. As I say, ""The Interview"" might be very funny. I just wish it weren't yet more fodder for the deluded who see all journalists as their mortal enemy. We haven't mentioned what North Korea does to offending journalists. Their own prisoners get labor camps, torture and starvation rations, if they're not executed. Foreigners get traded for a whole load of publicity and who knows what else. But I bet journalist Lisa Ling is probably pleased her sister's prison ordeal there began and ended (in 2009) before this film was released. And furthermore I can assure you, our colleagues who have been so brutally killed and imprisoned, this year and every year, were certainly not the ""easily distracted members of the American press who choose gossip"" type that ""West Wing"" and ""Newsroom"" creator Aaron Sorkin railed against in his Sony-rage last week. ""The wishes of the terrorists were fulfilled in part by easily distracted members of the American press who chose gossip and schadenfreude-fueled reporting over a story with immeasurable consequences for the public -- a story that was developing right in front of their eyes,"" Sorkin said in a statement. No, the ones we lost this year were brilliant, brave and full of heart, daring to keep doing the dangerous job of bringing you the truth. May they rest in peace. ---- .

"""As we approach the end of our first year in prison, I cannot help but feel proud and strengthened by all that has been achieved so far,"" said journalist Peter Greste in a letter from a Cairo jail cell. In the letter, released just a few days before Christmas, the Al Jazeera journalist praises his supporters fighting not just for his release, but also for the freedom of the press worldwide. ""We have galvanized an incredible coalition of political, diplomatic and media figures, as well as a vast army of social media supporters to fight for that most basic of rights: the right to know,"" the former BBC correspondent wrote. Last June, an Egyptian court sentenced Greste and his colleagues Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed to seven years in prison on charges of disseminating false news and supporting a terrorist organization. The three men have steadfastly denied the charges and the Qatari-owned Al Jazeera network has said ""they were just doing their job covering and challenging all sides of the story in Egypt."" But this week Qatar shut down an Al Jazeera-run affiliate accused by the Cairo government of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, a group now considered a terror organization by Egypt. Some experts have suggested that the move signals a cooling of tensions between Qatar and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al Sisi, who overthrew the Muslim Brotherhood and imprisoned much of its leadership last year. This may bode well for the imprisoned journalists, they say. ""We haven't won this fight yet -- we are still behind bars after all -- but we have made our cause abundantly and unequivocally clear,"" the letter reads. ""And for that reason, it really is a very good Christmas.""","Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste releases letter from Cairo jail .

"Joy Ross says it was love at first touch.  Ross, who is now blind, likes to tease that she met her husband, George, on a blind date.  At the end of the night, he took her hands in his. She had little sight then and none now, but her journey into darkness started more than 30 years ago, long before she met her husband. As a small child, she developed arthritis that also attacked her eyes, eventually robbing her of her sight. When she was about 3 years old, Ross says her mother noticed she was bumping into things as she'd play. After going from doctor to doctor, Ross was diagnosed with juvenile arthritis and a rare eye disease called uveitis. The same inflammation that caused swollen painful joints had spread to her eyes. What it's like to be a blind parent . ""The best I remember seeing, even as a child, was the big E on an eye chart with my left eye,"" says Ross. Her right eye saw far less, glimpsing only peripheral shadows. Her eye disease, uveitis, means inflammation or swelling in the middle part of the eye called the uvea. Doctors only diagnose about 2,250 cases each year in children younger than 16. Most young people with uveitis also have juvenile arthritis. But only about one out of 10 children with arthritis also develop the disease in their eyes.  If not treated early, uveitis can damage vision and in some cases lead to blindness, according to the Arthritis Foundation. ""In children who typically get uveitis, it starts so gradually, so insidiously, that the eye never becomes red and they never experience pain and they don't know that they're losing vision. In fact, a common way to pick it up is to be screened with your vision when you're starting school,"" says Ross' physician, Dr. James Rosenbaum, chief of rheumatology at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, and chief of ophthalmology at Legacy Devers Eye Clinic. Because 80% of childhood uveitis occurs in children with juvenile arthritis, Rosenbaum suggests parents should immediately take their children in for a checkup as if they would take them in for a complaints about an ankle or knee. Ross got steroid eye drops to reduce swelling; that's the standard first line treatment for uveitis. But because her case was severe and the medications limited, she developed cataracts and needed eye surgery. In high school, she tried methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug, to treat both her eyes and her painful arthritis.  But Ross didn't respond well to the treatment and had to stop. 15 diseases doctors often get wrong . In 2002, a couple of years after getting married and moving to Portland, she discovered a new drug called Enbrel that brought relief to her aching joints. She also discovered she was pregnant with her first daughter, Isabella.  A little over two years later, she gave birth to Georgiana. And then after a family vacation in January of 2008, Ross' eyesight started to change, her vision literally disappearing. ""I remember looking in the mirror and thinking, I'm fading away. It was like a white fog, like in the shower when it gets fogged up.  It was thickening and thickening, and I was struggling to see,"" says Ross. And in the months after her world went dark forever, her oldest Isabella who was about 5, started limping around on her ankle. ""We noticed that her foot was very swollen and very feverish to the touch and it was really severe,"" says Ross. They thought it was badly sprained, but it turned out to be juvenile arthritis. And shortly afterward, 3-year-old Georgiana went with her dad for a routine eye exam. Invisible chronic illness . ""My husband called me after the appointment that day, and he was quiet.  He was crying, and he said that Georgiana was diagnosed with uveitis,"" says Ross.  They were devastated. But the family tried to turn the bad situation into something fun.  Friday night in their house was shot night -- not your typical bar shots for a Friday of celebrating -- but injections.  George gave all three girls shots.  At that time, Isabella and Joy got medicine to suppress their immune systems to fight inflammation and Georgiana got methotrexate.  Afterward, they piled in the car to go get ice cream. And now more than five years later, Georgiana is in remission and her eyesight has not been affected. Thanks to early diagnosis and treatment with biologic drugs such as Enbrel, which control swelling, she is doing well. These new medicines put the brakes on the misbehaving parts of the immune system that fuels inflammation. These were not available when Joy was a young child. Their doctor says Georgiana has a good chance of retaining her sight throughout her life. New smartphone app promises easy eye testing worldwide . Isabella's arthritis still does flare up from time to time, making it hard to go up and down stairs or participate in PE at school. Both girls do tend to get sick more than other kids because their medicines leave their immune system less able to fight infections. But their doctors don't think either sister will develop the other's illness. And though Joy knows there are more struggles ahead for all of them, she says, ""Find joy in everything if you can. Joy, I say, is a choice. It's more than just my name; it's a choice our family has had to choose."" And when she wants to visualize her world, she returns to one of her best tools, touch.  As she cuddles with her girls, she takes their faces in her hands. ""I feel them grow, and their faces change. I feel their smiles,"" says Ross.","Most young people with uveitis, a rare disease, also have juvenile arthritis .
Only about one out of 10 kids with arthritis also develop the disease in their eyes .
If not treated early, uveitis can damage vision and in some cases lead to blindness .

"It's going to be a big year for travelers who love cruising. Not only will 2015 see the launch of a number of spectacular new cruise ships, but the opening of new routes will make some of the world's most remote places significantly more accessible. We asked some of the travel world's top cruise experts to share their picks for the hottest cruise itineraries of 2015 and the ships that will be sailing them. Alaskan Dream Cruises . In 2015, cruise ships will be pushing deeper into the wilderness than ever before, and this particular sailing offers some great wildlife-spotting opportunities on a smaller boat. ""This Alaskan Dream Cruises sailing includes complimentary shore excursions designed to showcase true Alaskan adventures and the native heritage,"" says Annie Scrivanich, senior vice president of Cruise Specialists. ""Departures coincide with seasonal changes and animal migrations for the best weather and animal viewing opportunities. If you're only going to visit Alaska once, this itinerary is your best bet."" Alaskan Dream Cruises: Baranof Dream, +1 855 747 8100, from $4,399 per person . Windstar Cruises: Star Breeze . The latest addition to Windstar Cruises' fleet, Star Breeze has fans of European cruises particularly jazzed. Among the top picks is the 10-day Sicilian Splendors cruise, which takes in Rome, Catania, Valletta, Gozo, Trapani, Sorrento and Capri. ""We're all very excited about the new Windstar Star Breeze,"" says Scrivanich. ""This new power yacht holds a maximum of 212 guests and provides new opportunities for those looking for a European cruise on a smaller ship."" Windstar Cruises: Star Breeze, +1 206 733 3005, from $4,449 per person . Viking Cruises: Viking Star . This Viking Cruises tour takes in the best of Europe's northern cities, including Bergen, Stockholm, St. Petersburg, Helsinki, Tallinn, Gdansk, Berlin, Copenhagen and Stavanger. But it's the boat that experts are most excited about, as it will be Viking Cruises' first ocean-going ship. The 47,800 gross tonne ship will have 464 cabins and accommodate 928 guests . ""I'm really looking forward to Viking Cruises' Viking Star, which sets sail in 2015,"" says cruise journalist and Telegraph Travel cruise specialist Jane Archer. ""It's a brand new ship and the mockups look amazing."" Other itineraries available on the Viking Star include Mediterranean and western European tours. Viking Cruises: Viking Star, 0800 298 9700, from $4,703 per person . Princess Cruises: Japan Getaway . Fancy checking out Japan but short on time? Then consider stepping aboard one of the many cruise ships heading there in 2015. ""Japan is one to watch for 2015 and into 2016,"" predicts cruise journalist Archer. ""A lot of people want to visit but are nervous because of the language, food and very different culture. ""Having a cruise ship for a base helps to give confidence and means they can visit several ports on one holiday."" Princess Cruises' Diamond Princess ship has two Japan Getaway itineraries on offer in 2015. There's a 16-day Grand Japan and Taiwan tour setting sail in May, followed by an 11-day tour of Japan, China and Southeast Asia that hits the seas in September. Princess Cruises: Diamond Princess,  +1 852 2952 8088, from $861 per person . Royal Caribbean: Quantum of the Seas . Next year, some of the biggest cruise operators will be making an extra effort to entice Asian passengers onto their ships. This includes Royal Caribbean, which is sending its newest and most hi-tech ship, Quantum of the Seas, to China. ""Asia continues to grow as an emerging market cruise lines want to invest in, especially in 2015,"" says Michelle Fee, chief executive of Cruise Planners. ""The new Quantum of the Seas will be based in Shanghai, as part of an effort to introduce the Asian traveler to cruising."" The ship's five-night Fukuoka and Busan cruise departs Shanghai on August 3, 2015, and takes in Fukuoka, Japan and Busan, South Korea before heading pack to its starting port. Royal Caribbean: Quantum of the Seas, +1 305 341 0204, from $2,548 per person . Compagnie du Ponant: Le Lyrial . This exciting cruise itinerary makes the cut in part because the mode of transport is so fantastic. ""Compagnie du Ponant is introducing its newest luxury expedition ship, Le Lyrial, in spring 2015,"" reveals Richard West, founder of Explorcruises.com. ""It's exciting because it's a truly luxurious expedition-style small ship"". The Athens to Dubrovnik itinerary is a seven-night cruise that sets sail in August, taking in the highlights of the Croatian coast before heading to Greece. Compagnie du Ponant: Le Lyrial, +33 4 88 66 64 00, from $4,160 per person . Uniworld River Cruise: Splendors of Egypt and the Nile . Cruise companies pulled out of Egypt en masse due to the recent turmoil, but in 2015, it will be possible to cruise the Nile once again. ""Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection has re-launched a sailing along Egypt's great Nile River on board the elegant, all-suite River Tosca, with cruises starting in October 2015,"" says Fee of Cruise Planners. ""Egypt is an awe-inspiring destination and travelers can experience its culture on a 12-day program with luxury accommodation."" Uniworld River Cruise: River Tosca, +1 818 382 7820, from $5,136 per person . P&O Britannia . Here's one for those who consider themselves a bit of a foodie. P & O's Cookery Club, on its new Britannia ship, allows guests to hone their culinary skills alongside some of the world's top chefs. ""P&O Cruises' culinary offerings on-board their new ship Britannia are particularly exciting,"" says Adam Coulter, editor of Cruise Critic. ""The line has enlisted the help of a number of celebrity chefs to create the first cookery school on-board a British ship."" Chefs leading workshops will include Marco Pierre White, Atul Kochar and wine guru Olly Smith. The vessel will spend its first year touring waters around the Caribbean, Baltic and Mediterranean. Pocruises.com, prices TBA . Wendy Wu Tours: Irrawaddy Voyager . ""In 2015 we'll see more luxury ships are moving into Burma [Myanmar],"" says Peter Lynch, editor of website Cruise Passenger. ""It's a country filled with wonderful people and astonishing historic sites."" One such cruise is Wendy Wu's 12-day Irrawaddy Voyager sailing, which takes in Kyauk Myaung, where traditional Myanmar 50 gallon water pots can be seen, the magnificent wooden Bagaya Monastery and the U Bein Bridge (the world's longest teak wood bridge) as well as Bagan, where there are 2,000 Buddhist structures scattered across a vast plain. Wendy Wu Tours: Irrawaddy Voyager, +44 207 939 1200, from $3,654 per person . Norwegian Cruise Lines: Norwegian Escape . ""Norwegian Cruise Lines are launching the Norwegian Escape in 2015, which was named by consumers via a Facebook contest, so travelers are already invested in it,"" says Cruise Planners' Fee. ""The Norwegian Escape will be the largest ship in the Norwegian Cruise Lines fleet and features The Haven, which is almost like a separate ship, with luxury suites, private dining and more."" One of the most popular cruise routes is predicted to be its Eastern Caribbean itinerary, which sails out of Miami. Norwegian Cruise Line: Norwegian Escape, +44 845 201 8900, from $782 per person . CroisiEurope: Loire cruise . Cruise fans have been eagerly awaiting this particular outing because the boat will use paddle wheel technology to allow it to navigate the shallow waters of the Loire, and overnight cruises along the river haven't been possible until now. ""I'm especially excited about the new Loire cruises because it's a river which has yet to be explored,"" says Cruise Passenger's Lynch. ""Paddle ships will allow this to be done for the first time in 2015."" CroisiEurope: Loire Princesse,  +33 388 762 199, from $1,570 per person . Crystal Cruises: Best of the Baltic . Proving that cruises are no longer just about eating a lot of food and not doing very much, Crystal Cruises is just one operator offering passengers the chance to work off those calories -- in this case, with a 90-minute run around St. Petersburg during its ""Best of the Baltic"" cruise from Stockholm to Copenhagen. ""There is a growing focus on fitness and wellness, both through facilities on board and excursions ashore, such as Crystal Cruises' excursions for runners,"" says Edwina Lonsdale, chief executive of Mundy Cruising. Crystal Cruises: Crystal Symphony, +1 310 785 9300, from $3,845 per person . Azamara Club Cruises: Bali & Great Barrier Reef . The introduction of this new 14-night cruise of Bali and the Great Barrier Reef is another indicator of a cruise trend we'll see in 2015. ""Australia and New Zealand cruises are becoming more popular,"" says Sean Keddy, cruise expert at travel agency Love Holidays. ""I suspect this is mainly due to an increased interest from the local markets, but this does allow passengers from Europe and the U.S. more choice and competitive pricing."" Azamara Club Cruises: Azamara Quest, +1 305 341 0206, from $4,277 per person . Crystal Cruises: Northwest Passage . Sometimes tropical destinations just don't do it for would-be cruisers. For those who have some cash to splash, there's Crystal Cruises' new 32-day Northwest Passage cruise, which will set sail in 2016. It starts in Alaska and finishes in New York, getting there via Nunavut, Greenland and Maine. ""For those interested in a genuine Alaska cruise experience, this itinerary offers a great blend of scenic highlights, wildlife viewing opportunities, off-the-beaten-track excursions and unique ports of call,"" says Scrivanich of Cruise Specialists. Crystal Cruises: Crystal Serenity, +1 310 785 9300, from $22,865 per person .","CroisiEurope's Loire Princesse will be the first overnight cruise on the Loire River .

"Tuesday is Veterans Day, and there will be speeches and parades. ""Thank you for your service,"" the phrase that's come to define how America expresses gratitude for its men and women in uniform, will be said, a lot. But what does a holiday -- a single day -- really mean to the 19.6 million veterans it's meant to honor? CNN asked a few of them. Their answer: Go beyond the holiday. They encouraged a constant, creative and sensitive focus on veterans' needs, like improving access to jobs and health care, particularly at Veterans' Affairs facilities. On Monday the Department of Veterans Affairs' new secretary announced massive restructuring at the scandal-plagued agency. But the most productive thing anyone outside the military can do is actually very simple and easy, they say: . Strike up a conversation with a veteran. Get to know one of them in a meaningful way. There is a wide cultural gap between Americans who have no relationship with the Armed Forces and those who've served their country. Closing that gap is as necessary as it is long overdue. Here are five ways to connect with veterans all year round. Check your assumptions . ""Veterans are very often stereotyped into two stock characters: the crying wounded or the guy who jumps the White House fence to get to the President,"" said Paul Rieckhoff, the executive director of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, a national nonprofit with more than 200,000 members. ""Don't treat us like victims,"" said Rieckhoff, an Amherst College graduate and former Wall Street investment analyst who led an Army platoon in Iraq in 2003 and 2004. ""We're not broken. We've been through a lot, but we're rising out of it."" While national discussion and media coverage of post-traumatic stress disorder has chipped away at some of the generations-old entrenched stigma associated with mental illness, many of these stories involving PTSD make headlines because they involve violence, Rieckhoff said. It's critical for everyone to remember that having PTSD doesn't mean a person will be violent, and not every veteran has PTSD. Each veteran has a unique story. Their military service has probably shaped them in profound ways, but they are not the sum total of that time. Take the time get to know one of them. They have a lot of lessons to share. Five things you may not know about post-traumatic stress disorder . Invest in veterans -- it's good business . One of the biggest hurdles service members face after leaving the military is finding a job. About 77% of veterans have struggled through unemployment and more than a quarter have searched for more than a year for a job, according to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. But there's reason for hope, judging by recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate for post 9/11 veterans peaked in January 2011 at 15.2%, CNNMoney reported. In October 2013, there was 10% unemployment. Last month, the job picture for veterans improved as unemployment hovered around 7%. (The national unemployment rate is 5.8%.) Many corporations have launched new hiring initiatives for veterans. In April 2013, Walmart pledged to give 100,000 veterans jobs within five years. In November 2013, Starbucks launched a nationwide initiative to hire 10,000 veterans and spouses by the end of 2018. Uber is driving programs to hire veterans. Want to hire a veteran? The Returning Heroes Tax Credit should provide a financial incentive. For veterans who need jobs, the veterans job bank and resources on the VA website might help. Trouble traveling? The Veterans Recruiting Service will host a virtual career fair on Tuesday. Thanks for your service, vets! Now trying finding a job . Help veterans' families, too . While it's well known that 22 veterans a day kill themselves, a CNN investigation revealed that many military family members also have attempted or contemplated suicide. ""The Uncounted"" examined how war's trauma can wrack entire families. Family members have endured unprecedented multiple deployments during two wars, in Afghanistan and Iraq, lasting more than a decade. That means financial and emotional stress for relatives. If a family member returns from war, it's often the relatives who must care for them. ""If we can't figure out a way to provide better support for families, the public will pay one way or another,"" said Kristina Kaufmann, executive director of Code of Support Foundation, which tries to bridge the gap between military and civilian communities. Kaufmann: I was a military spouse who knew wives who killed themselves . Every family member interviewed for ""The Uncounted"" expressed the same need to be understood by those whose lives had nothing to do with the military. They didn't want to be thought of as ""the other."" ""Don't be afraid to approach us. This heartache I have -- it makes other people uncomfortable. It hits them in a place that scares them,"" said New Jersey parent Bill Koch, whose son Steven died in Afghanistan in 2008. His daughter committed suicide two years later, an act her parents believe was inextricably tied to losing Steven. ""It can hurt so much more when we feel like we're making other people uncomfortable by talking about our kids,"" Koch said. ""Don't push military family members away because you're afraid you'll say the wrong thing. Just asking us means you care, and that means everything."" Volunteer with veterans' programs . Whether it's a simple conversation with a veteran or their family member or volunteering, get involved. Figure out what you do best and offer that skill. If you're a mental health professional, donate your services to Give an Hour, which connects counselors to service members, veterans and their families. Reach out to TAPS, Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, which connects family members who have lost service members and veterans in similar ways. For instance, if someone's brother died of an IED attack in Iraq, TAPS links that person with a peer who has lost a sibling in Iraq. The National Military Family Association and Blue Star Families also connects military families with leaders in the civilian community. ""The Uncounted"" highlighted an innovative New York clinic that broke from the traditional approach by linking the VA and a private hospital system so both could operate in a single shared office space. Patients, including one Iraq veteran and his wife, credit the clinic for saving their marriage. The RAND Corporation has recently secured funding for a yearlong study of the clinic's efficacy to see if the program should be replicated across the country, said senior adviser to the project Terri Tanielian, whose career has been focused on veterans issues. An overwhelming number of nonprofits and community groups have popped up over the past decade, making it harder to find a good one, she and others say. Tanielian recommended Welcome Back Veterans, which is intended to help people in the community link to veterans. The effort spans the country, and is based at medical and academic institutions in Boston, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Durham, North Carolina. Read an in-depth analysis of the program. Pressure the Department of Veterans Affairs . The VA is the second largest agency in the U.S. government, rivaled in size only by the Department of Defense. Since November 2013, CNN has been investigating and reporting about the department's failures to adequately treat veterans. Records of dead veterans were changed or physically altered in an effort to hide how many people died waiting for treatment at a Phoenix VA hospital, CNN reported. Investigators issued a scathing report that outlined 24 recommendations for change, including a firm determination of how soon a veteran should be treated and a total overhaul of the VA's appointment system. Part of the shake-up spelled the end of Vietnam veteran and former Army chief of staff Eric Shinseki's job as VA secretary. He was replaced by Robert McDonald, a West Point graduate who led Procter & Gamble to incredible success. McDonald told ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday that he plans to make it much simpler for veterans to get care; they'll have to search only one website, not dozens as they must now. Management will change and people who don't share the VA's core values won't work there anymore. Rieckhoff, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans' organization leader, told CNN that McDonald has shown himself to be far more active and aware of the VA's problems and has showed an eagerness to work with veterans to change the agency. But he also urged people to write their members of Congress to make sure addressing the VA's problems remains a priority. ""We feel like (McDonald) is different because he's actually taken the time to meet veterans and ask them what they need,"" said Rieckhoff. ""But there has to be much more. Everyone in this country -- beyond us, beyond veterans -- must make sure that the people who can fix the VA stick to their promises and make it happen.""","Do something to help veterans all days of the year, not just on Veterans Day .

"(CNN) -- Here we go again. Christmas is upon us, and that means some people are getting sensitive about holiday greetings. In modern-day Texas, however, residents are now statutorily permitted to use the greeting of their choice without fear of legal reprisal: ""Merry Christmas,"" ""Happy Hanukkah"" or ""Happy holidays"". State Rep. Dwayne Bohac helped last year to pass what is now known as the Merry Christmas law. He and the Texas Legislature wanted to ensure students could exchange traditional holiday greetings and display Christmas trees, menorahs and Nativity scenes at school, as long as more than one religion and a secular symbol are included. Constitutionally, this protective legislation is not really required, and teachers can wish holiday greetings without fear of liability. On the other hand, this law may allay any fears state employees have about exercising their rights to merrymake on government property. It feels like this sort of thing didn't happen 30 years ago. When I was a kid, holiday greetings were the least of our worries. As kids, my brothers and I had other worries about what we'd hear during the Christmas season. We worried about hearing the voice of that Duffy kid down the street: His holiday greetings consisted of bad words and 70 mph snowballs. We worried about hearing there were no presents this year because, according to Mom, ""Santa"" already spent all ""Santa's"" money on cartons of Virginia Slims. Comparatively then, we were not too worried about whether we heard ""Merry Christmas"" or ""Happy holidays"" at school. Maybe we've run out of problems. Maybe it's because things are so much better now that we focus on that which never bothered us before. Or maybe it's because of a growing chasm of distrust between parents and school lesson plans. After all, this Texas statute was conceived by a legislator who was dismayed to hear his kids report on a ""holiday tree"" at school instead of a ""Christmas tree."" Of course, the First Amendment probably already protects our nonsecular greetings anyway. The Texas ACLU's official position is direct, if not hyper-technical: ""I think it's stupid,"" said Terri Burke, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Texas. According to Burke, there is no ""war on Christmas"" and no real need for this law. She may be right -- legally, that is. The Supreme Court cases in this area have focused less on greetings and more on the public display of symbols of the holiday season and whether they are in violation of the Establishment Clause (Amendment 1) of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court recently observed that if a practice ""touches upon"" religion, it is impermissible under the Establishment Clause if it advances or inhibits religion in its principal or primary effect. The court has held for some time that the Establishment Clause, at minimum, prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief, or from making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the political community. With that, some might argue that ""Merry Christmas"" is ""taking a position""â€”specifically, an impermissibly Christian position on holiday greetings. But the Supreme Court reminds us what we've known for a while: Christmas celebrations can have a religious purpose, but they can also have a secular purpose. As long as the state has not impermissibly advanced religion or created an excessive entanglement between religion and government, there is no strict requirement for complete separation between Christmas and state. The Supreme Court notes that Christmas is a holiday recognized by Congress and national tradition. When the state depicts origins of that holiday, it can do so, and have a legitimate secular purpose. Legally, Christmas litigation always raises fascinating and important First Amendment issues. However, even this fan of constitutional law must concede that practically, perhaps we shouldn't be making federal cases out of whether kindergarten teachers can wear a Santa hat to class or hand out candy canes. As much as it may be a compelling academic question, we have to consider the argument that we are frittering away our valuable court resources on these yuletide issues. (Then again, maybe determining the limits of the Constitution is necessarily a worthwhile, albeit costly, investment.) Ultimately kids don't even care about ""holiday trees,"" secular greetings and excessive entanglement. It's the adults: parents, teachers and legislators. Kids care about one thing: presents. Especially my 6-year-old nephews. They don't care if the wrapping paper reads ""Happy Flag Day"" or ""Budweiser"" (way to go, Mom). As long as there's a robot inside. And that's what Christmas is really about. Wait a minute, that doesn't feel quite right either... Ah well. Happy holidays, all the same.","Texas passed a law allowing ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Happy holidays""

"(CNN)Andre Hartman struggles to walk. But every day he dreams of going back to the ocean. For decades, he made an impressive career out of freediving with great white sharks. The South African daredevil survived numerous encounters with these ocean predators. And when he needed to get closer to the animals, taking the cage out of cage diving was a risk the pioneering diver was willing to take. But a debilitating stroke three years ago tragically left the ex-fisherman unable to get close to the sharks he came to love. Today, the closest he can get is through the tours of a local shark diving firm, Supreme Sharks, where he provides his expert knowledge for eager tourists. ""It's been 11 years since I last swam with a shark, and I've love to get back into it again at a later stage,"" Hartman says. ""I'm not ready yet -- but I'm sure once I can swim properly, I'll be there again."" This passionate pioneer of the oceans has spent years studying what many believe is one of the most dangerous predators in the world. ""I'm just mesmerized by how they move and what they do, and that fascinates me. They're like an aeroplane -- they fly in the water. Those wings flex with the weight of the body."" Born in Bellville, Cape Town, Hartman has been a bit of thrillseeker ever since he was a child. By his teens, he could often be found with his friends trying to catch snakes with their bare hands. Following graduation, the young risk-taker drifted from various jobs. Finally after serving his mandatory national service in the army, Hartman found spearfishing. An accidental encounter . The ancient and rather arduous tradition of spearfishing has been used for millennia across the globe. It has also become a competitive sport and Hartman soon became one of the country's top spearfishers. Then one day in 1977 during a seemingly normal practice dive, Hartman would have a close encounter that would change his life forever. He'd been diving for a few hours and was reeling in his line when a sharp movement flicked past him. Thinking it was a shoal of fish, he tried to move around it and was confronted with a big, black eye. ""It was a white shark, my first white shark and I thought 'Wow, wait until I tell my friends,'"" he recalls. ""First white shark and it's huge. (It) looks like a house next to me."" Once the initial shock and awe of the situation wore off, Hartman started to tussle with the large predator, pushing back as the shark came in a little too close for comfort. ""When he bit down on the (spear) gun, I was paralyzed from shock. I didn't expect it. And then it reopened its mouth and I saw my hands go in. I thought 'uh oh' and I jumped back to life and jerked it out of his mouth. ""I put my fist on his eye meaning to gorge his eye out and he just spat the gun out and dived down and swam away."" After this dramatic confrontation, Hartman laid still for five minutes, recalling how he swore he would never dive again. But the decision didn't last too long. He adds: ""The next morning a buddy calls 'hey are we going to dive some cray fishes this afternoon?' I said, 'Yeah, that's a good idea.'"" 'I became the guy' In the late 80s, Hartman began to see business opportunities from the big, blue sea. Shark tourism was booming and cage diving was quickly becoming a popular way of getting up close with the great whites off the coast. By 1997, the savvy entrepreneur had started his own company taking eager adventurers to sea and lowering them gently beneath the waves to meet the sharks at close range. Within months, the business began to take off and filmmakers came knocking at his door. The budding entrepreneur had found his niche. ""I became the guy -- if you want to film sharks, go to Andre. Within two years they needed shots they couldn't get so I said jump in the water and we'll get it. Because when you're in the cage with a camera it shakes so I started taking people out of the cage."" Over the years, Hartman's reputation as one of South Africa's leading shark experts has brought big opportunities and even the chance to join a film shoot in Mexico. But then things took a turn for the worst. ""When I came back, I actually had a stroke on my right hand side which paralyzed me completely."" Refusing to let his stroke become a setback, he began to fight back recovering quickly. But then three years ago, Hartman suffered another stroke, this time it was too much and left him unable to swim with the sea creatures he loves. ""At the moment I'm just really starting to walk. But I still fall down every now and then. But I mean that happens,"" he says. ""I've just got to get stronger ... I'm walking short steps and it's going slowly. ""I mean the way I've lived my life, if I have to do it again, I'll do it exactly the same.""

"(CNN) -- It's known as the City of Light, but Paris has taken a dizzying step toward being the City of Fright after the Eiffel Tower unveiled a new glass floor. Offering dramatic views of the 57-meter (187-foot) drop from the 125-year-old landmark's first level, the transparent walkway has proved a hit with visitors lining up -- and lying down -- to take selfies. Paris's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, opened the new attraction, saying it would help bring back some magic to a city that's been criticized for disappointing foreign visitors. ""I hear that Paris has lost its shine and attractiveness,"" she said. ""It's not true."" The new floor, she added, proved Parisians could reinvent their city ""without ruining our history."" It's the latest in a series of glass floored walkways to open in prominent destinations around the world. These include Chicago's Willis Tower Skydeck and the Grand Canyon Skywalk. Paris admits it needs to be friendlier . Hidalgo celebrated the opening with a series of multilingual tweets inviting tourists to ""enjoy this breathtakingly high experience."" The glass floor is part of a $38.4 million renovation of the tower's first floor that also includes shops, restaurants and a museum. New outward-curving safety barriers also allow better views over the city. Until now, the tower's somewhat gloomy ""premier etage"" has been one of its least-visited areas, with most of its 7 million annual visitors heading straight to higher levels. Built by Gustave Eiffel, the Tower was completed in 1889 as part of a ""Universal Exposition"" celebrating the centenary of the French Revolution. At 312 meters, it was the tallest building in the world until New York's Chrysler building overtook it in 1930. It was originally designed as a temporary attraction, but the decision was made to keep it as a permanent attraction -- and the Tower has never looked back. Thanks to the glass floor though, it can now look down.

"South Korean prosecutors are seeking an arrest warrant for the former Korean Air executive Heather Cho who sparked outrage by kicking a flight attendant off a plane for serving macadamia nuts the wrong way. The warrant would cover charges of violating aviation safety rules, including a change in a flight plan, assault on a plane, coercion and interference in the execution of duty, the Seoul Western District Prosecutors' office said Wednesday. A decision will be taken on issuing of the warrant early next week after a review procedure, the prosecutors' office said. Cho, the 40-year-old daughter of Korean Air's chairman, resigned from her post as vice president at the company in the aftermath of the incident earlier this month on a flight from New York's JFK airport to South Korea's Incheon International Airport. She ordered that the plane turn back to the gate and that a flight attendant be removed because she was served nuts in a bag instead of on a plate in first class. Amid public anger over her behavior, she and her father both apologized for the incident. Cho, whose Korean name is Cho Hyun-ah, said she accepted ""full responsibility"" for what happened. She wasn't available for comment Wednesday. 'Violent language . Testimonies of crew members and passengers confirm that Cho used ""violent language in a loud voice,"" which may not be compliant with an aviation safety law that requires cooperation of passengers on a flight, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said last week. Although her role put her in charge of in-flight service, she was only a passenger on the flight and was not flying in an official capacity. Officials are also seeking an arrest warrant for another Korean Air executive, identified by his surname of Yeo, on charges of ordering employees to delete an initial report of the incident, the prosecutors' office said. Korean Air said Wednesday it was monitoring the situation, as an arrest warrant hadn't been issued yet. The office said that prosecutors had raided the office and residence of a government official at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport who was suspected of leaking information on the investigation into the case to Yeo. The captain of the plane has also faced criticism for obeying Cho's demands to turn back the plane and remove the flight attendant. Because of that, the airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight, the ministry said last week.","Heather Cho ordered a plane back to the gate after a flight attendant served nuts in a bag .

"(CNN) -- It was a mystery that Panama's president said his country was struggling to solve. What was the massive military equipment hidden under hundreds of thousands of sacks of brown sugar on a North Korean boat? Where did it come from? And where was it going before investigators seized the vessel near the Panama Canal? Hours after Panama said it would ask U.S. and British officials for help solving the puzzle, Cuba gave an answer Tuesday night. In addition to 10,000 tons of sugar, Cuba's Foreign Ministry said, the shipment contained ""240 metric tons of obsolete defensive weapons"" sent to North Korea ""to be repaired and returned to Cuba."" The equipment was manufactured in the mid-20th century and included two anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles in parts and spares, two MiG-21 jets and 15 motors for this type of airplane, the foreign ministry said. ""The agreements subscribed by Cuba in this field are supported by the need to maintain our defensive capacity in order to preserve national sovereignty,"" the statement said. ""The Republic of Cuba reiterates its firm and unwavering commitment with peace, disarmament, including nuclear disarmament, and respect for international law."" Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons. The Cuban government's revelation, read on state television, is the latest chapter in an international drama that has all the elements of a thriller: a violent confrontation on a detained ship, missiles hidden onboard, a heart attack and an attempted suicide. A glance at seizures of North Korea weapons shipments . Panamanian authorities spotted the shipment during an anti-drug inspection late Monday. Few details of the confrontation were available, but the ship's North Korean crew of 35 resisted inspection and arrest for days, said Panama's security minister, Jose Raul Mulino. He described it as ""violent,"" saying that the crew tried to sabotage the ship by cutting cables on the cranes that would be used to unload cargo. As it is, Mulino said, authorities now have to remove 255,000 sacks of brown sugar by hand. During the struggle with Panamanian authorities, the ship's captain suffered an apparent heart attack and then tried to kill himself, according to President Ricardo Martinelli. The crew also refused to raise the ship's anchor, Mulino said, forcing Panamanian authorities to cut the anchor loose to move the ship. Panama's public ministry ordered the crew's detention, and authorities have since spoken with crew members about their travel plans. Crew members said they had left Cuba and headed toward Panama, aiming to arrive in North Korea in 51 days. As authorities inspected the vessel, the situation was intriguing enough that Martinelli himself traveled to the ship to take a look -- with reporters in tow. Is it a missile? a reporter asked. ""Maybe,"" Martinelli said. ""I am not familiar with that, but it would be good if such things didn't pass through Panama, which is a country that loves peace and not war."" The president tweeted a photo of what he saw: a green octagon-shaped tube with a cone at its end and a similar-looking piece of equipment behind it. Late Tuesday night, Mulino said the Cuban government's detailed announcement describing the military equipment had caught Panamanian officials by surprise. Investigators have only combed through one of the ship's five compartments, he said. They are asking the United States and the United Kingdom to send teams to help them identify the weapons, and will invite a special commission from the United Nations to determine whether the shipment violates the organization's North Korea weapons ban. Even with many unanswered questions, Mulino said, the Cuban government's statement explains one thing. ""Now we clearly understand the suicidal attitude of the captain,"" he said, ""and the rebellion and the rioting of the crew."" U.N. official: 'We are following it closely' Earlier Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the U.N. secretary-general said Panama had not officially reported the incident to the United Nations. If that happens, a U.N. panel of experts would review the incident. ""If it is confirmed that the vessel was carrying arms or related materiel and that the shipment was part of a purchase or sale to or from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, then there would indeed be a breach of the U.N. sanctions regime relating to that country,"" spokeswoman Morana Song said. Members of the U.N.'s North Korea sanctions committee have seen media reports about the boat and are awaiting a formal notification with details from Panama. ""We are following it closely,"" said Jacques Flies, a spokesman for Luxembourg Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, who chairs the committee. Authorities seized the vessel and the undeclared haul in the Panamanian port of Manzanillo. U.S. officials say they tracked ship . Investigators spotted the boat going through the Panama Canal to Havana and then back toward the canal, according to two senior U.S. officials who said the United States had been tracking the ship along with the Panamanians for some time. A glance at seizures of North Korea weapons shipments . Another senior U.S. official said the United States had been tracking the ship for several days and knew that Panamanian authorities were going to stop it. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell declined to describe U.S. interactions with Panama concerning the ship, but noted that the vessel has a checkered past connected with drug smuggling. ""Public reports from 2010 and also a U.N. panel of experts report from 2012 cite this history,"" he said Tuesday. ""So this vessel has a well-known history in this regard."" Concerns over Cuba . Cuban state media reported late last month that North Korean army Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Kyok Sik visited the island and had high-level meetings, including one with Cuban leader Raul Castro. In the United States, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, described this week's incident as ""serious and alarming"" and a ""wake-up call"" for the Obama administration to avoid normalizing U.S. relations with Cuba. Some analysts described the situation as a troubling sign that North Korea could be supplying Cuba with weapons. ""This is a country which is just 90 miles away from American shores,"" Forbes.com columnist Gordon Chang told CNN's ""Erin Burnett: OutFront."" ""Now, if they can smuggle missile radar into Cuba, you know, God knows what else they can put there. We do not need a replay of the Cuban missile crisis, this time with the North Koreans' fingers on the triggers instead of the Soviets."" Chang, author of ""Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World,"" said the Panamanian president's dramatic description of how the ship's crew members handled the incident didn't surprise him. ""They do not want anybody on their ships,"" he said. ""Whether it's carrying melons or nuclear technology, the North Koreans would act pretty much the same way."" North and South Korea inch toward reopening joint complex . A history of weapons shipments . This isn't the first time North Korea has been linked to shipping suspected of transporting weapons materials. In 2011, the U.S. Navy tried -- and failed -- to gain permission to board a ship in the South China Sea suspected of carrying illicit weapons technology to Myanmar, the Pentagon said. The Belize-flagged MV Light was believed to have been manned by a North Korean crew, the Pentagon said. Under U.S. Navy surveillance, the vessel eventually turned around and headed to North Korea. In 2007, the Pentagon confirmed that several shipments of suspected weapons technology had left North Korea destined for Syria. The Pentagon said some of the material was believed to have been high-grade metals that could be used to build missiles or solid-fuel rockets. CNN reported in 2011 that an unpublished U.N. report claimed North Korea was trading banned weapons technology with several countries, including Iran. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet wrote this story in Atlanta. CNN's Patrick Oppmann reported from Cuba; journalist Castalia Pascual reported from Panama; CNN's Adam Levine, Elise Labott and Barbara Starr contributed from Washington; and CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Kevin Wang, David Simpson and Thom Patterson contributed to this report from Atlanta.","NEW: Panama is still investigating; seeks help from U.S., U.K., U.N.

"A suspected U.S. drone strike killed 20 people in North Waziristan, a region along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, a Pakistani intelligence official told CNN Friday. An officer from the political administration told CNN that six missiles struck a compound in Datakhel, an administrative division of North Waziristan. The region is known to be a hotbed for militancy and widely believed to be under little government control. Both officials requested not to be identified because they are not allowed to disclose information to the media. A military officer who requested anonimity for the same reason, told CNN that two drones were in the area, but only one of them fired. In the incident, which occurred shortly after 10 p.m., two missiles struck the compound in the residential area followed by another four missiles that were fired 10 minutes later, the officer said. The death toll rose from nine to 20 as people who had gathered at the site after the first strike were hit in the second, the officer said. It was not clear if any of the dead were civilians. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized this week for a coalition attack last November in which NATO fighter jets attacked a Pakistani checkpoint near the Afghanistan border, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. U.S.-Pakistan relations soured after the incident, which led Pakistan to close supply routes for NATO trucks carrying supplies to Afghanistan. After the apology, Pakistani leaders reopened the routes through Pakistan's western border. Islamist political parties expressed outrage at their reopening, accusing the government selling out to U.S. demands and disregarding the will of its own parliament. Pakistan's parliamentary committee on national security passed a resolution in April that set the cessation of drone strikes as a condition for the reopening of supply routes to Afghanistan. Pakistan will continue to press the U.S. administration to stop drone attacks, Qamar Zaman Kaira, Pakistan's minister for information and broadcasting, said after the Clinton apology. Pakistani government officials have been angered by suspected U.S. drone airstrikes in the country that have left many dead. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported drone strikes.","The strikes were the first since Pakistan agreed to reopen routes .

"A technician from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be monitored for three weeks after possibly being exposed to the Ebola virus at one of the agency's Atlanta labs, the CDC said Wednesday. The CDC said in a written statement that a small amount of material from an experiment was mistakenly transferred from one lab to another and it might have contained the live virus. The incident was discovered Tuesday. The technician has no symptoms of the illness, CDC Director of Public Relations Barbara Reynolds said in the statement. ""Others who entered the lab have been contacted and will be assessed for possible exposure by the CDC Occupational Health Clinic. As of this time we believe exposure requiring monitoring is limited to one individual,"" the CDC said. There is no possibility of exposure outside the lab and no risk to the public, the statement said. The center is investigating the incident, which CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden called troubling. He said the agency is taking ""all necessary measures."" That includes destroying the material, decontaminating and closing the lab, letting staff know about the incident and notifying the proper oversight agencies. This is not the first incident in which the transfer from one lab to another risked exposure to potentially deadly material. In early June, dozens of CDC workers were potentially exposed to anthrax after a lab failed to inactivate the dangerous bacteria before transferring it to another lab. An outside investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found dangerous biological materials stored in unlocked refrigerators and a general lack of lab workers following safety protocols. Investigators said the anthrax that was believed to be deactivated was transferred in Ziploc bags, which are not approved to carry such materials. Frieden, who took the CDC director job in 2009, acknowledged at a congressional hearing into that incident and others that he and other CDC managers failed to recognize a ""critical pattern.""

"(CNN) -- Kia Scherr couldn't reach her husband and daughter after the terror attacks in Mumbai, India, and didn't know if they were alive. Alan Scherr, 58, died in the attack on the Oberoi hotel in Mumbai, his wife, Kia, confirms. She learned on Friday that her husband, Alan Scherr, 58, and 13-year-old daughter, Naomi, were killed in the assault on the Oberoi hotel. Scherr told CNN that a U.S. consular official confirmed the deaths after members of the group they were traveling with identified the bodies.

Wonder -- blind since birth -- will promote U.N. ideals and activities with an emphasis on championing for people with disabilities, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said. When his installation announcement was briefly interrupted by a fire alarm in the U.N. Secretariat Building in New York on Thursday, Wonder broke the tension with a joke.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has tossed out a lower court ruling that nullified the death sentence for former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of gunning down a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, police officer more than 28 years ago. He has been an outspoken activist from behind bars, claiming there were procedural errors during his capital sentencing, and that too few blacks were on the jury. Pennsylvania officials were appealing a federal court ruling on the sentencing question that went in Abu-Jamal's favor in 2008. The justices made their announcement Monday, ordering a federal appeals court to revisit its earlier ruling granting a new sentencing hearing. The high court last year denied Abu-Jamal's separate petition for a new trial. The appeals court now has the option of reimposing the death sentence or ordering a new federal trial to hear other claims of injustice raised by Abu-Jamal. The case has attracted international attention, amid charges of prosecutorial misconduct and the inmate's outspoken personality. The onetime radio reporter and cab driver has been a divisive figure, with many prominent supporters arguing that racism pervaded his trial. Others countered Abu-Jamal is using his skin color to escape responsibility for his actions. They say he has provoked community unrest for years with his provocative writings and advocacy. He was convicted for the December 9, 1981, murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner, 25, in Philadelphia. Faulkner had pulled over Abu-Jamal's brother in a late-night traffic stop. Witnesses said Abu-Jamal, who was nearby, ran over and shot the policeman in the back and in the head. Abu-Jamal, once known as Wesley Cook, was wounded in the encounter and later confessed to the killing, according to other witness testimony. Incarcerated for nearly three decades, Abu-Jamal has been an active critic of the criminal justice system. On a Web site created by friends last year to promote the release of Abu-Jamal's latest book, he wrote: ""This is the story of law learned, not in the ivory towers of multibillion-dollar endowed universities but in the bowels of the slave ship, in the hidden, dank dungeons of America."" Chief defense attorney Robert Bryan had made jury selection a key component in the various appeals filed over the years. Ten whites and two blacks made up the original jury panel that sentenced Abu-Jamal to death. Faulkner's widow, Maureen, has written ""Murdered by Mumia: A Life Sentence of Loss, Pain and Injustice,"" a book in the slain officer's memory. In it she writes about her efforts to hold Abu-Jamal accountable for his crimes. A three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had kept the murder conviction in place, but ordered a new capital sentencing hearing. That court ultimately concluded the jury was improperly instructed on how to weigh ""mitigating factors"" offered by the defense that might have kept Abu-Jamal off death row. Pennsylvania law at the time said jurors did not have to unanimously agree on a mitigating circumstance, such as the fact that Abu-Jamal had no prior criminal record. Months before that ruling, oral arguments on the issue were contentious. Faulkner's widow and Abu-Jamal's brother attended, and demonstrations on both sides were held outside the courtroom in downtown Philadelphia. The justices in the order on Monday cited their ruling last week on a separate capital case on when capital defendants can cite an inadequate defense in later appeals. Many prominent groups and individuals, including singer Harry Belafonte, the NAACP and the European Parliament, are cited on his Web site as supporters. Prosecutors have insisted Abu-Jamal pay the ultimate price for his crime and have aggressively resisted efforts to take him off death row. ""This assassination has been made a circus by those people in the world and this city who believe falsely that Mumia Abu-Jamal is some kind of a folk hero,"" then-Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham said when the federal appeals court upheld the conviction. ""He is nothing short of an assassin."" Abraham retired from her post this month.","Ex-Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal sentenced to death for killing Philadelphia police officer .

"A dozen young children chatter and giggle around me, taking my pad and pen to write down their addresses very carefully. This way, they tell me, I'll know where to send help. But how do you tell a six-year-old an address no longer means anything -- houses and roads are gone and in too many cases, so are families. It was not just the young who could not comprehend how their world changed on December 26, 2004. In Hambantota on the south coast of Sri Lanka, a parent stumbled through mangled debris in the area they assumed their house had once stood, looking for lost children. Siblings, children, cousins, all looking for a sign of relatives they lost in a split second when the water came. Standing in the middle of what was once the marketplace of this seaside town, I looked around at a landscape that was almost flat. No buildings for miles, giving a clear view of the sea that was deceptively calm and serene. Only one temple was left standing, the one structure built from concrete. Homes were washed away with residents still inside, market stalls and thousands of shoppers didn't stand a chance against the sheer force of mother nature. It is impossible to capture the extent of the devastation on camera and only those who lived through that day know its true horror. But one overwhelming memory for those who arrived afterward is the look in survivors' eyes. I accompanied a U.S. doctor working for Americares, Jonathan Fine, who had volunteered to help and deliver desperately needed supplies. He told me he would never forget ""the victims, dead-eyed in their hospital beds, lying there, staring at us, wondering what their stories were, how they'll ever learn to cope with this, what they've seen, what they've lost."" And yet in the midst of the misery I witnessed in Sri Lanka was incredible generosity. Residents who had lost everything, who had seen horror beyond imagination, running up to us to offer a face mask to help cope with the unmistakeable stench of death, trying to give us a bottle of water. One man even apologized we were not seeing his country at its best, begging me to come back when it was all over so I could experience the true beauty and hospitality of the island and its people. He then resumed the search for his brother, sister and parents. The sheer scale of the disaster was difficult to overstate. One Hambantota hospital that could take 300 patients at a push saw 1,000 serious injuries in the first two days alone.  Basic drugs many of us take for granted ran out quickly and the bottleneck of relief, familiar in such disasters, took time to clear. And yet rarely did I see frustrations spill over. Residents helped each other and comforted each other. One textile factory had been badly damaged, some of the workers were dead or missing. But rather than wait for outside help to arrive, the workers cleared the building of mud, debris and bodies so they could go back to work. Many of the women were married to fishermen who had lost boats or were too scared to go back out on the water. Without the factory, their families had no income. Natural disasters are cruel and brutal. There is no one to blame and little comprehension. And yet they never fail to restore my faith in human nature. Strangers work together to pick themselves back up and rebuild their shattered lives. Many thinking of others rather than themselves. What I witnessed in Sri Lanka was both heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time.","CNN's Paula Hancocks was in Hambantota in 2004 when tsunami struck .

"A gunman shot and killed another man Tuesday inside Purdue University's electrical engineering building, spurring worried students to scramble into the bitter cold outside for safety. The Indiana school's police chief said that the suspect appeared to have had just one target in mind. He left the building right after the shooting, and a city police officer arrested him. ""This appears to be an isolated and intentional act,""  Purdue Police Chief John Cox said. ""...The victim appeared to have been targeted by the suspect, and it was no more and no less than that."" Cox identified the victim as Andrew Boldt, a 21-year-old senior from West Bend, Wisconsin, who also worked at the school as a teaching assistant. The suspect is Cody Cousins, a 23-year-old student in Purdue's college of engineering who now is ""booked on a preliminary charge of murder,"" according to the police chief. By 6 p.m. West Lafayette police had executed a search warrant on Cousins' home, with city police Chief Jason Dombkowski saying his officers had ""previous contact with the suspect (for what) I believe (was) an alcohol offense."" Authorities have not explained why Boldt might have been killed, nor have they detailed his relationship with the suspect, including whether he was a teaching assistant in one of Cousins' classes. Nor have they described the type of gun used in the crime. CNN first learned about the incident on Twitter. The noontime shooting rattled many people's nerves in and around the West Lafayette campus of Purdue, where about 30,000 undergraduates attend. ""You hear about school shootings all the time, but you never expect it to happen where you live,"" said CNN iReporter Jeff Ooms, who works a few blocks away from what's known as the EE Building and went to the scene. ""Everyone was just confused and shocked."" Cox said some on the scene claimed to hear ""four to five shots fired."" One of those inside the building was Ben Snyder, a Purdue senior from Fort Wayne.  According to video posted to IndyStar.com, he and others inside the engineering building believed they heard two gunshots and immediately knew something was up. ""We heard it immediately and everyone was like, 'OK, let's go."" He recalled ""officers coming in fast,"" including four on the building's second floor armed with what looked like assault rifles, and saw several people ""getting handcuffed"" and one man ""with blood on his hands."" In another video interview on the same website, sophomore Kirk Choquette said he first heard cries of ""get down, get down, get down"" after leaving a bathroom and didn't know what to make of it. After he returned to a large lecture hall, Choquette said, ""a cop came in and said, 'Get out, get out, everyone get out of the building.'"" David Hook had a similar experience. He didn't hear gunshots but heard shouting outside his lecture hall, which was in a building connected to the one where the bloodshed occurred. ""Originally, I just thought it was just people being loud,"" the 20-year-old Hook told CNN. ""When I heard (shouting) the second time, I thought something was probably going on."" Eventually, ""someone came in and yelled to evacuate the building and then an alarm went off,"" he added. ""I walked out,"" Hook said of the chilling scene outside -- and not just because the wind chill dipped below zero Tuesday outside -- ""and there were police cars everywhere."" Cox commended the quick response by officers, as well as West Lafayette police and school authorities, saying ""everyone did exactly what they should have done."" The police chief added: ""You train and plan, and train and plan for one of these incidents and hope it never happens. But unfortunately, it did."" The school sent text messages about the shooting to students, asking them to take shelter where they were. That request was lifted by 1:30 p.m., though the electrical engineering building still was closed so police could investigate, school spokeswoman Liz Evans said. Evans said then that ""the rest of campus is open"" and classes were under way. But a few hours later, Purdue Provost Tim Sands announced classes for the rest of Tuesday and all of Wednesday were canceled. A Tuesday night candlelight vigil took place on the heels of a shooting that unnerved many in what Cox called ""one of the safest communities in the Big Ten."" ""Violent crime, whenever and wherever it occurs, shocks our conscience and incites our rage,"" said Mitch Daniels, Purdue's president and a former governor of the state. ""When it happens in our home, to a family member -- and, as a Boilermaker, Andrew Boldt was family to us -- those emotions are more powerful still."" Sands said one key part of the vigil was to announce details about counseling to those grieving or trying to make sense of the violence. While authorities stressed they don't believe there is any continued threat to students, faculty or staff, the provost said that the Purdue community will need time to heal.

"The NFL's history of punishing players in domestic violence cases is as complicated as the legal cases themselves. Sometimes players were suspended for a game or two. Sometimes, charges were reduced, which also reduced the severity of the NFL punishment. Sometimes, charges were dropped and players' names were cleared. Domestic violence now seems to be the football league's No. 1 off-field issue. Last month, the NFL announced a new policy against it. Then, this week, running back Ray Rice was released by the Baltimore Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the National Football League on the same day a video showed him knocking out his future wife with a punch earlier this year. But the league hasn't always been so assertive about the matter, one expert said. Domestic violence accounts for 85 of the 713 arrests of NFL players since 2000 in a database compiled by USA Today. At a domestic violence summit in Florida about 15 years ago, ""the NFL actually sent a representative who argued, 'Are you kidding me? They're giving up two out of 16 paychecks for this issue. Isn't that a significant enough penalty?' And back then, they would take that (to the public). Today, it's a different story,"" said Don Yaeger, co-author of the 1998 book, ""Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL."" Here's how the NFL is handling or has handled punishment in some other cases: . Ray McDonald (San Francisco 49ers) Three days after Commissioner Roger Goodell created a new NFL policy against domestic violence on August 28, San Francisco 49ers defensive end Ray McDonald was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence. The new policy imposes a six-game unpaid ban for first-time offenders and up to a lifetime ban for second-time offenders. No charges have been filed in the incident involving McDonald, and the case was still being investigated Tuesday, said spokesman Sean Webby of the Santa Clara County, California, District Attorney's Office. McDonald was arrested by San Jose police at 2:45 a.m. at his house, where a party was being held for his approaching 30th birthday. McDonald allegedly became involved in an altercation with his fiancee, who was 10 weeks' pregnant, a police source told the Sacramento Bee newspaper. Several 49ers players attended the party, CNN affiliate KTVU said. The fiancee showed police minor bruises on her neck and arms, the newspaper said. After McDonald posted bail, he stated he couldn't say much about the case. ""The truth will come out,"" he told KTVU. ""Everybody knows what kind of person I am ... a good-hearted person."" On Tuesday, San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York said the team was awaiting the outcome of the criminal case against McDonald before determining whether to punish him. ""I think it's very important that we do let due process take its course,"" York told KNBR-AM. ""I think it's very important that we don't judge somebody before, whether charges are filed or whether anything else happens. We want to make sure that everybody is afforded the right that I think Americans are afforded."" Greg Hardy (Carolina Panthers) Defensive end Greg Hardy was convicted in a bench trial this summer of assaulting his former girlfriend and threatening to kill her, both misdemeanors. Hardy is appealing, and the Carolina Panthers team said last month it wouldn't discipline him until his appeals are completed, ESPN reported. The former girlfriend accused Hardy of throwing her on a pile of guns and said he ""bragged that all of those assault rifles were loaded,"" her motion for a protection order said earlier this year, according to The Charlotte Observer newspaper, which posted a copy of her request online. The woman said Hardy picked her up, threw her into the bathroom, dragged her into the bedroom, choked her, picked her up again and ""threw me onto a couch covered in assault rifles and/or shotguns,"" her protection order request said, according to the Observer. Hardy threatened to shoot her if she went to the media or reported the assault, the court papers said, according to the Observer. However, the NFL website cites an Associated Press account about 911 tapes revealing a different version of events. ""Hardy can be heard on a call saying: 'My assistant is trying to restrain her, and she's trying to break free and hit me with her heel. I'm literally running around the table right now.' Hardy also alleges that the accuser could be on drugs,"" NFL.com reported. Some sports analysts are urging Goodell to punish Hardy: ""With Hardy, as with Rice, Goodell needs to make a statement that the league has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to how men in his league treat women,"" ESPN commentator Ashley Fox wrote. When asked about the criminal case against him in July, Hardy said he disliked how it is a distraction. ""I hate that I have distracted my team,"" Hardy said, according to ESPN.  ""Other than that I can't answer that question."" A.J. Jefferson (Minnesota Vikings) In November 2013, Minnesota Vikings cornerback  A.J. Jefferson was arrested on a felony count of domestic assault by strangulation, CNN affiliate KARE reported. His 23-year-old girlfriend claimed to have been in an early morning domestic dispute with Jefferson, who yelled and grabbed her neck, CNN affiliate WCCO reported. On the day of his arrest, Jefferson was cut by the Minnesota Vikings, the NFL reported. Also, after the arrest, the NFL suspended Jefferson for four games, but Goodell lifted the suspension, the league said. The NFL website didn't say why. Jefferson finished last season with the Cleveland Browns before being placed on the injured reserve list because of an ankle problem, according to the National Football Post. In March, Jefferson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of domestic assault in the 2013 case, WCCO reported. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail, which was suspended to three days times served, The Seattle Times reported. In May, Jefferson was signed as a free agent by the Seattle Seahawks, which won the Super Bowl last season. Robert Reynolds (Tennessee Titans) A fifth-round draft pick in 2004 by the Tennessee Titans, linebacker Robert Reynolds made the team and played in all but three of its regular season games over his first two seasons. But 2006 was a different story. In October of that year, Ohio authorities issued a warrant for Reynolds' arrest on domestic violence and assault charges relating to his now ex-wife, according to The Tennessean newspaper. After the charges were filed, then-Titans coach Jeff Fisher asked Reynolds to leave the team facility and decided he wouldn't play that weekend -- at least. The Associated Press reported that Reynolds pleaded guilty later that month to criminal damaging (for smashing a cell phone and punching a hole in a wall) and disorderly conduct after lashing out during a visit to the home of his toddler son and ex-wife, who told police she didn't want to press charges. The former Ohio State player has not played an NFL game since, although his court case was not cited as the reason. The Titans waived Reynolds in July 2007 after previously placing him on injured reserve, and no other team picked him up. The Columbus Dispatch reported in 2008 that Reynolds had been suspended for one year for violating the league's substance abuse policy, with his agent adding then that Reynolds would likely retire. Dez Bryant (Dallas Cowboys) In July 2012, wide receiver Dez Bryant of the Dallas Cowboys was arrested on a misdemeanor domestic violence charge in DeSoto, Texas, CNN affiliate KDFW reported. Bryant's mother called DeSoto police, claiming she got into an argument with her son and that he had assaulted her. Bryant later turned himself in and was charged with Class A misdemeanor domestic violence. The charge was dismissed in November 2012 on the condition that Bryant undergo anger counseling and that he not be charged with a crime for the next year, ESPN said. Bryant denied any domestic violence. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Bryant said he would be ""a crazy man"" to put his hands on his mother, other than to defend himself, and that after she grabbed his arms, he used his hands to remove hers. The magazine, however, cited the police report, which said Bryant grabbed his mother by her T-shirt and hair, bruised her arms and ""hit her across her face with his ball cap."" The NFL didn't suspend Bryant. It imposed a strict set of conduct guidelines on him, which included a curfew, counseling twice a week and no alcohol, ESPN reported. In March 2013, Bryant made a surprise appearance at Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings' ""Men Against Abuse"" rally. ""I am done with domestic abuse,"" he said at the public gathering. Rod Smith (Denver Broncos) In 2000, Denver Broncos wide receiver Rod Smith was accused of beating his former live-in girlfriend by throwing her around, banging her head on the floor and choking her during an argument, the Denver Post reported. The girlfriend is also the mother of his two children. Smith pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of verbal harassment just days before he was to stand trial on third-degree assault and harassment charges, the newspaper reported. A judge sentenced Smith to two years of probation and ordered him to undergo 36 weeks of domestic violence counseling and pay $1,000 in court costs. The NFL didn't suspend Smith but did impose a $25,000 conditional fine against him, which he wouldn't have to pay if he adhered to his probation, the newspaper said. At the time, Smith denied hitting his former girlfriend, and even before the NFL imposed the conditional fine, he said the league wouldn't suspend him. ""It'd be different if I did what they originally said I did,"" he told the Denver Post, referring to the original charge of domestic violence. ""But all those charges were dropped. So I don't see how they can even take that into account when she said it didn't happen, under oath, and we have several documents stating that.""

"Chicago (CNN) -- Rahm Emanuel, the former chief of staff to President Barack Obama, won the Chicago mayoral election over five other challengers Tuesday, topping the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff vote, CNN projects. With almost 75% of the vote counted, Emanuel had almost 55% of the vote, far outdistancing his rivals. Former Chicago School Board head Gery Chico was in second place with 25%, while City Clerk Miguel del Valle had 9% and former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun had more than 8%. The other two candidates both had less than 2%. Speaking to supporters Tuesday night, a buoyant Emanuel praised outgoing Mayor Richard M. Daley, saying it would be ""a tough act to follow,"" then spoke to problems facing the nation's third-largest city, which is dealing with an unexpected $654 million city deficit, possible reforms to the city's pension system and rising crime. ""What makes this victory most gratifying is that it was built on votes from every corner of this city,"" he said, touching on an overall theme of unity. ""It's easy to find differences, but we can never allow them to become divisions."" Saying his administration will be dependent ""on the plural pronoun, 'we,'"" Emanuel said, ""We know that we face serious new challenges, and overcoming them will not be easy."" Emanuel also said he had spoken earlier in the evening to Obama, who extended his congratulations. During his campaign, Emanuel proposed a series of tax cuts, as well as increasing levies for luxury services, drawing the ire of some of his opponents, and he alluded to them again Tuesday night, when he said he would work toward a balanced budget ""and a playing field that is fair."" Tuesday's vote was a nonpartisan election, though the city is heavily Democratic, and the top job has long been so associated with the Daley family. Richard M. Daley has been mayor since 1989, and his father, Richard J. Daley, held the post from 1955 to his death in 1976, making them the two longest-serving mayors in the city's history. Emanuel, 51, previously served three terms as a congressman, was a key aide to President Bill Clinton and worked as Obama's chief of staff. He assembled a well-organized campaign operation, canvassing the city to deliver a series of high-profile campaign speeches as well as making 357 informal stops to meet voters -- 229 at various community locations, such as schools, grocery stories and churches and 110 at subway stations. Emanuel also hit the airwaves with a series of ads, buoyed by a large war chest, that touted his record and connections with Obama and Clinton while attacking his opponents. For much of the campaign, Emanuel fought off an accusation that he was not a legal resident of Chicago and therefore could not run. The accusation stemmed from the renting of his house when he joined Obama's White House in 2009. Emanuel maintained he never gave up his residency and defended himself at an election board hearing in December, which lasted almost 12 hours, even listing what possessions he had kept in the home: his wife's wedding dress, the family china, photo albums, a bed, a piano and a stereo, and was asked specifically where they were stored: in a storage area in the basement. After a series of conflicting rulings the state Supreme Court ruled unanimously Emanuel's name should be on the ballot. His opponents also accused Emanuel of being a Washington insider who avoided answering questions about some of his controversial moves. ""He is a pathological evader of the truth,"" Chico said Monday. For his part, Emanuel seemed to try to stay above the fray as the front-runner. ""They can say whatever they want,"" he said Monday. ""It doesn't matter what anybody says or what they say about me because if we don't turn this city around it is going to be harder for their kids. That has been my focus from day one."" Emanuel, well-known for his colorful personality and past demonstrations of anger, stayed low-key throughout the campaign. He exploited the popularity in Chicago of the presidents he served, having Clinton come to town and stand next to him at a high-profile event last month, and running television and radio ads using some of Obama's laudatory words during an event when Emanuel confirmed his resignation. Emanuel also used questions regarding statements from his opponents to tout some of the achievements he helped usher in while working in the White House: putting more police officers on the street, gun measures, the Wall Street reform bill and health care reform.","NEW: Rahm Emanuel pledges to tackle ""serious new challenges"" in Chicago .

"Forget that chair. Better yet, sit on it. Clint Eastwood is back doing what he's supposed to be doing in ""Trouble With the Curve,"" a sentimental baseball saga that is the inverse of ""Moneyball"" in almost every respect and shows the star's still got what it takes to carry a movie home. Film stars aren't always the best judge of when it to call it a day, and you might fear the worst as Eastwood grouses about his pee in the first scene. Surely this isn't the curve he's troubled about? But of course that's wrong: Eastwood knows best. Part of his longevity as a star comes from his readiness to probe his own weaknesses, and it should come as no surprise that he's candid -- and funny -- about the frailties of old age. His character, Gus, is a scout for the Braves, one of the best there ever was. But has he still got what it takes? Not only is he computer illiterate, but the guy still reads newspapers. That's not all: He's losing his eyesight, and though he's doing his best to hide it, it's getting harder to explain the rapid accumulation of dinks and dents in his convertible. Things come to a head the week before the draft. He's sent to North Carolina to check out the next big slugger. His buddy Pete (John Goodman) begs Gus' daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), to cover his back. A hotshot lawyer on the verge of making partner, she's got plenty of reasons to turn him down flat, including that her dad's a cranky and uncommunicative curmudgeon and always has been. In her childhood, he dragged her round ball fields or packed her off to boarding school without ever thinking to ask her preference, and she's been in therapy since college. She goes anyway. You won't need 20/20 vision to see what's coming next. Although it's directed by a proxy (Robert Lorenz was assistant director on ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Mystic River"" and ""Space Cowboys"" among others), ""Trouble With the Curve"" has all the hallmarks of an Eastwood movie in his folksiest mood. It's conservative with a small ""c""; interested in people -- not style or systems -- it's plain-spoken and heartfelt, a bit corny, a bit clichéd and not at all slick or quick. With Eastwood, when the script is strong and everything comes together, he's capable of producing wonderful movies. Other times you have to take the rough with the smooth. What works here is, first and foremost, Adams. It's a peach of a role (it hardly needs pointing out that Eastwood has a long history of putting himself up against strong, independent women), and Adams is charming as a smart, attractive, career-driven, pool shootin', baseball lovin', perpetually thwarted daddy's girl. Maybe she's a shade too attractive -- it's hard to take your eyes off her hair, so luscious it practically demands its own trailer -- but the contrast with flinty, brittle old Gus is effective, and Adams shows some grit too, easily bossing Justin Timberlake (game as the movie's token love interest). As for Eastwood, he could play his part with his eyes shut and still hit it out of the park. Randy Brown's screenplay is on shakier ground when it tries to get father and daughter to open up to each other. Not many filmmakers would risk the scenes where each separately break into ""You Are My Sunshine,"" and you will have to decide for yourself whether they belong on the cutting-room floor. But for all its occasional tin ear, ""Dr Phil"" dialogue, its contrivances and shortcuts, this remains a fundamentally sound and solid entertainment with a deep-rooted conviction that how we treat each other matters.","Clint Eastwood plays Gus, a scout for the Braves in the new film .

"A Chinese reporter who was arrested last week on suspicion of damaging a business' reputation has confessed to releasing fabricated stories about the company for money and fame, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday. ""I definitely hope the entire journalist industry could learn a lesson from me,"" New Express journalist Chen Yongzhou said while in custody in an interview distributed by Reuters. ""For myself, if I were given one more chance to be a journalist, I must follow the basic journalistic ethics that are impartial, real, objective and complete to report -- and would not be lured by self interest."" Chen released more than 10 unverified reports -- from September 29, 2012, until August 8, 2013 -- that centered on ""financial problems"" experienced by the engineering company Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology and resulted in losses for the company, Xinhua reported, citing police. Chen, who is based in the southern city of Guangzhou, apologized to the company, to its investors and to his family, police told Xinhua. He was taken into custody October 18 in Guangzhou by police from Changsha in Hunan Province, where Zoomlion is based, months after the newspaper ran stories under his byline that said Zoomlion had falsified its sales numbers. The state-run company, which did not respond to a call for comment, makes construction equipment. The 27-year-old reporter has worked for New Express since he graduated in 2009. According to police, ""other people"" paid Chen for the stories, Xinhua said. ""Chen confessed that only 'one and a half' of his more than 10 reports about Zoomlion were done after gathering information himself, while the rest were made based on provided articles,"" Xinhua said. ""He even published some of the supplied articles on the New Express without reading them first."" The announcement came two days after the New Express pleaded on its front page, ""Please set him free."" The move garnered sympathy online and China's media regulator vowed to protect ""lawful reporting rights,"" according to the state-run China Press and Publishing Media group. The paper said Wednesday that it had checked all of Chen's stories about Zoomlion and found only one discrepancy: He wrote the company spent 513 million yuan on advertisements, when that money had been spent on ""advertisements and entertainment."" ""If Brother Policeman can find any evidence of shabby reporting on our part, please make notice of it and we will gladly doff our hat,"" the newspaper said, according to a translation published by the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project. ""Because we still believe that -- some day, at least -- you will have the same full respect for the law that we have.""","""The entire journalist industry could learn a lesson from me,"" Chen says .

"So, maybe some of you new parents have seen this show, ""Game of Thrones?"" When the Social Security Administration released its annual list of the most popular names on Thursday, all the usual winners were there: Jacob and Sophia are tops. Again. But the fastest riser for girls in 2012 was Arya, shooting to 413 from 711 in 2011 and 942 in 2010. It's the name of a beloved character in the ""Game of Thrones"" series on HBO. The youngest daughter of the Stark family, Arya (played by Maisie Williams) is a fan favorite -- a defiant tomboy with a stubborn, independent streak -- and the polar opposite of her proper sister, Sansa. Arya is happier firing arrows on the archery range or secretly attending ""dance lessons"" with Syrio, a trained killer who teaches her to wield her sword, Needle. Based on ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" the epic fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin, ""Game of Thrones"" has been a breakout hit for HBO. (HBO and CNN are units of Time Warner.) Now in its third season, the show initially delighted genre fans, but quickly built a much larger audience with its blend of action, intrigue and ample doses of sex and violence. (For the record, Sansa, Syrio and Needle are nowhere in the top 1,000.) The fastest riser for boys in 2012 -- Major, coming in at 483 -- is harder to peg. The Social Security Administration helpfully points out that it could be ""in tribute to the brave members of the U.S. military,"" or perhaps because Major is the name of the youngest son of designers Cortney and Robert Novogratz on the HGTV show ""Home by Novogratz."" Parents submit children's names when applying for Social Security numbers when they're born. Popular names sometimes reflect characters in pop culture, style icons or plain old demographic changes.The names Gael and Perla also rose fast in 2012, the Social Security Administration said, noting that both are popular among Spanish speakers. Rounding out the top 10 for boys in 2012 were Mason, Ethan, Noah, William, Liam, Jayden, Michael, Alexander and Aiden. Jacob has dominated the top spot since 1999. Liam made its debut in the top 10 in 2012, booting Daniel. For girls, other top names were Emma, Isabella, Olivia, Ava, Emily, Abigail, Mia, Madison and Elizabeth. It's not Elizabeth's first trip to the top, but it did replace Chloe on the list in 2012. CNN's Doug Gross contributed to this report.","Jacob and Sophia were top baby names in 2012, Social Security Administration says .

"(CNN) -- If I had to pick the most important moves of 2014, I would put Russian President Vladimir Putin's flouting of international law and European security norms near the top. His swift annexation of Crimea -- despite a 1994 treaty signed by Russia and Western allies to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity -- as well as his military intervention and support for pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine have destabilized the continent. But Putin's moves on the European chessboard are now checkmating Russia, too. The year ended with the country in financial chaos, because of Western sanctions over Ukraine, the falling price of oil and Central Bank missteps. The slavish pro-Putin propaganda and the stifling of an independent press had brought nationalist fervor to fever pitch and put the majority of Russians behind him, but when their ruble and their living standards started to collapse by year's end, the grumbling also started. How much political trouble will this spell for Putin? Will he double down and seek more diversionary foreign (mis)adventures, or will he try to address Russia's isolation, abide by the ceasefire he signed recently for eastern Ukraine, start getting sanctions unraveled and his economy back on track? 2015 is a year to watch for Russia's next moves. Similarly, Russia could also change tactics and play a constructive role in the horrendous disaster that is Syria. Over nearly four years of war, Russia has given Bashar al-Assad political cover, while Iran has provided most of the Syrian leader's military muscle. More than 200,000 people have now been killed, while the United Nations says there are now more than 3.2 million registered refugees. And this year, there was the horrible evidence of al-Assad's torture and death squads, as reported on my show. After years of the United States and its allies refusing to intervene in Syria, the big winner of 2014 in that region has been the brutal Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. The rise of ISIS was largely ignored until it swept into Mosul in Iraq and started the gruesome public beadings of journalist colleagues in the summer. The brutal executions of James Foley, Steven Sotloff and aid workers Alan Henning and Peter Kassig did serve to increase airstrikes and efforts that have somewhat halted the momentum of ISIS. And by the end of 2014, a new government in Iraq, trying to be more inclusive, had taken encouraging first steps. But the challenge for 2015 remains that few believe ISIS will be stopped, that Iraq will be saved, or that the Syrian war will end until al-Assad leaves power, as President Barack Obama demanded back in 2011. At the end of yet another year of war there, Valerie Amos, the U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told me the lack of a political resolution and the continuing carnage is a stain on the international community. In his own hemisphere, Obama took bold executive action and formally declared America's isolation of Cuba to be a bankrupt policy that just hasn't worked. After a half-century of trying to overthrow the Castros with things like the Bay of Pigs fiasco, exploding cigars and even an attempt to infiltrate Cuba's hip-hop scene, Obama threw up America's hands the week before Christmas and announced the United States would be changing tack. It would now engage with Cuba, like allies in Latin America, Canada and Europe. The President said the two countries would restore diplomatic ties as well as major increases in trade and travel. President Raul Castro, for his part, thanked Pope Francis for his help in pushing the two sides together. However, 2015 will likely be marked by a furious backlash inside Congress, where Republican opponents can be expected to use their new majority to try to block any new U.S. ambassador to Cuba, refuse funding and especially refuse to lift the embargo. Yet the question remains how much a new generation of Cuban-Americans will appreciate this? After all, demographics have changed, and they are much more eager to engage than their parents, grandparents and the remaining hard-liners in Congress.","Christiane Amanpour picks her big three global news stories for 2014 .

"American traveler Stacey Addison says she was detained for months in East Timor because she unwittingly shared a taxi with a stranger carrying methamphetamine. Now she's out of jail -- and a guest of a former East Timor leader. Addison, 41, of Oregon, was released from an East Timor prison Thursday, nearly four months after her initial arrest in the small Southeast Asian nation in a drug case in which she says she's innocent. Addison appeared before reporters Thursday at the home of former East Timorese President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jose Ramos-Horta, who says he'll host her temporarily at his home. Details on the reasons and conditions for her release, or when she would be able to leave the country, weren't available. She couldn't leave immediately Thursday, because her passport -- seized during the investigation -- had not been returned. The U.S. State Department welcomed the decision, according to department spokesperson Jen Psaki, but confirmed that Addison remains in Timor-Leste where the government still retains her passport. Both she and Ramos-Horta said they would not discuss details of the case. Addison was asked what she would do when she is able to obtain a passport. Her answer: ""Go home."" ""I don't think my mom would ever forgive me if I didn't come home immediately and stay for a while,"" she said. Addison's arrest in September was an unexpected bump in what had been a multi-year trip around the world. She said she had been traveling solo since January 2013, having quit her job as a veterinarian to explore the globe. On September 5, she was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to the East Timor capital of Dili. On the way, a fellow passenger asked to stop to pick up a package at a DHL office, her mother, Bernadette Kero of Oregon, has told CNN. After the man picked up the package, police surrounded the car and arrested the occupants, according to Kero. The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison has said. She initially was held for four nights, and a judge released her -- but prevented her from leaving the country while the case was still being investigated -- after the man testified that he didn't know her, Kero said. In late October, during a court appearance where she thought she'd retrieve her passport, a judge ordered her arrest again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili. Paul Remedios, a lawyer representing Addison, said at the time that the court detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest, and that the reason for the warrant was unclear. Addison said Thursday that she had petitioned for her release earlier this month, but didn't expect to be released on Thursday. ""I had kind of thought it wouldn't happen because it's Christmas -- that everything would be closed,"" she said. ""I knew there was a petition pending, but it had been three weeks and I had heard nothing."" Kero told CNN last month that the case was a ""nightmare."" On Thursday, she said her daughter's release was ""the best Christmas present I could imagine."" ""The past four months have been an extremely stressful time for all of us,"" Kero wrote in an email Thursday.  ""Of course we are now hoping that her passport will be returned and she will be able to return home to Oregon very soon. ""Her lawyer will work on getting her passport released.  I just want to be able to see her and give her a big hug.""","Stacey Addison was detained by police in September during a taxi journey .

"I can clearly remember that first moment I felt like a foot soldier in the ""mommy wars."" Six years ago, in between news assignments, I raced to catch my then-2-year-old daughter's gymnastics class. It was Parents' Day, which meant all of us moms and a few dads gathered to ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" at what our future Olympians had learned so far. But then class was over and I had an interview I had to dash off to, something not many toddlers would easily accept. My daughter cried her eyes out and clung to my body. As I had to gently pry her arms off me and make my exit, I noticed all the moms staring at me -- or rather glaring. Their eyes said it all. ""How could you leave your daughter?"" ""I would never do that to my child."" As the tears began to flow on my way back to the office, I felt guilty, but also angry. ""Why all the judgment?"" I thought to myself, but I knew I was guilty of some of that same judgment from time to time. It's not something to be proud of -- those moments, for instance, when you see what a mom is feeding her child and think, ""I would never give that to my daughters."" Mommy. Wars. Just writing those words makes me cringe, but they're real to some extent, and they stem from, I believe, deep insecurities that all moms feel, especially when we compare ourselves to moms around us. Can't we all just get along? That's the thinking behind a fabulous photo spread aptly titled ""End the Mommy Wars"" on the site Connecticut Working Moms, which first went viral last year, and continues to pop up. Women hold signs with messages such as ""Let's love more & judge less."" Hear hear to that! ""The message really resonates with people because ... nobody likes to feel judged,"" said Michelle Noehren, 32, the site's founder and manager. ""They're tired of this negativity."" The site made waves in 2012 with a photo spread celebrating women and their post-baby bodies, which got national attention on television. As a follow-up, the site launched its  Campaign for Judgment-Free Motherhood, with photos highlighting issues sometimes used to ""pit moms against each other,"" said Noehren, mom to a 3-year-old daughter in Glastonbury, Connecticut. ""I work outside the home,"" says one woman via a sign. Next to her, another woman declares, ""I'm a stay-at-home mom."" In another, one mom touts she practices ""peaceful parenting,"" while another mom admits to sometimes yelling at her child. ""We wanted to take those (topics) and say, 'Hey, we're all people. We're all equals, and no one is better than someone else and we don't know why other people make the decisions that they do, so what's the point in judging that?"" Noehren said. Judgment-free motherhood is a wonderful concept, but I can hear the skeptics now saying it's about as likely to happen as losing weight by eating daily hot fudge sundaes. ""It's a journey for everyone. It's a journey for me. I still find myself judging other mothers,"" said Noehren, ""but I think the difference is that now when I realize I'm judging somebody, I realize it and I'm like, 'Ooh, I don't like the thought I'm having. I'm going to just not follow that thought and go down a negative mental spiral and instead just remember that every mom is doing the best that (she) can.' "" Noehren has written about the practical steps moms can take to stop the reflexive judging that we're all so used to in today's society. ""The only thing that we can control is our own mind,"" she said. ""We can't control what other people are doing in their life so we can choose to let go of those negative thoughts when we have them and that's really, I think, the key to becoming a less judgmental person."" Another way? Listening to other women's stories and realizing we all have our challenges -- whether we stay at home or work outside the home, breastfeed or formula feed, buy fast food or organic, choose home school or public school or private schools. After that disturbing incident at my daughter's gymnastics class six years ago, I was really helped by an anthology of essays from women from different perspectives, Leslie Morgan Steiner's highly regarded ""Mommy Wars"". But I have a lot more work to do to truly live judgment-free. I'm inspired to try to do a better job. Are you? What do you think is the best way to end the 'mommy wars'?

"Alcohol-fueled hostility ended with a famous professional wrestler pinning his son down at their Florida home early Christmas Eve, sheriff's deputies said. Former ring star Kevin Nash, alias Diesel, and his teenage son Tristen were booked on battery and later released without bond, according to arrest records from the Volusia County Sheriff's Office. When the teen came home drunk, insult and quarrel filled the air, according to the report, which included the Nash family members' accounts. Their stories about what happened next diverge. Tristen Nash, 18, says his pro wrestler father, who is 55, chided him over being drunk and about his relationship with his girlfriend, then threw him down by the neck and lay across his chest. He couldn't breathe and briefly blacked out, the son told a deputy. Nash, a giant . His father has an imposing physique.

Kevin Nash told the deputy a different story. His son started the fight, spitting on him and striking him with his shoulder and elbow, he said. Nash admitted to wrestling him to the ground, but said he did so to protect his wife from his son. The elder Nash was taken in and booked, his face marked by scratches on his mug shot. His son admitted to grabbing Nash's face while trying to break his grip. Roughness continued . Kevin Nash's wife, Tamara, initially told police she had been upstairs and not seen the fight. But she changed her story when authorities charged the wrestler with domestic battery, the arrest report said. Her son had been the attacker, she then told a deputy. A short time after booking Kevin Nash, deputies were called back to the family's home to arrest his son, after his uncle called 911. Tristen Nash's mother and uncle told a deputy that the teen had tussled with them after deputies left with Kevin Nash. The family's lawyer also placed blame on the son in a statement. ""The kid was out of control, and the father was defending his wife. I'm pretty confident we will have a resolution in the next couple of months,"" lawyer Michael J. Politis told The Daytona Beach News-Journal. The WWE distanced itself from the incident. ""Kevin Nash has not regularly performed for WWE since January 2004,"" it said in a statement.

"NBC was wary of ""The Cosby Show."" Sure, Bill Cosby was a successful advertising pitchman and in-demand comedian. But for all his success, he hadn't had a hit prime-time television show since ""I Spy"" in the '60s. Little did they know. ""The Cosby Show,"" starring Cosby as doctor and family man Cliff Huxtable, premiered 30 years ago this week, on Thursday, September 20, 1984. It was expected to be a strong second to CBS' hit ""Magnum, P.I."" Instead, it became a phenomenon: the No. 1 show in television five years running, the program that turned Bill Cosby into Bill Cosby. Its effects weren't limited to its star. Thursdays became TV's biggest night, with ""Cosby"" leading a murderers' row of NBC shows including ""Cheers,"" ""Night Court"" and ""L.A. Law"" -- and eventually ""Seinfeld,"" ""Frasier,"" ""Friends"" and ""ER."" NBC, after spending the late '70s and early '80s as television's lowest-rated network, vaulted into the No. 1 spot and held it, on and off, for two decades. The sitcom genre, which had fallen on hard times, was recharged. You can draw a direct line from ""The Cosby Show"" to ""Roseanne,"" ""Home Improvement"" and ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" And some observers have even credited the show, with its upscale, photogenic black family, with smoothing the way for another African-American family to rise -- all the way to the White House. ""Before Obama, There Was Bill Cosby,"" headlined a story in The New York Times in describing the ""Cosby Effect."" But Bill Cosby was a trailblazer long before ""The Cosby Show"" came along. As ""Cosby: His Life and Times,"" a new biography by Mark Whitaker -- a former Newsweek editor and CNN executive -- points out, the man has been a cultural influence since the early 1960s. ""One of the things that I wanted to do in this book is remind people of all the different ways in which he was a pioneer,"" Whitaker said in a phone interview. ""Because 'The Cosby Show' was such an overwhelming success, there are people who forget that he was a pioneer in so many ways before 'The Cosby Show.' "" Indeed, the man contains multitudes: comedian, actor, philanthropist, activist. He is more than he seems, his rise and success paralleling decades in the life of America. Call it ""The Seven Ages of Cosby."" 'Cosby Show': Our 10 favorite moments . 1. The standup comedian . In some ways, much of Cosby's persona was fully formed from the first moment he took the stage in New York's Greenwich Village in the summer of 1962. The poor kid from North Philadelphia grew up listening to his grandfather tell Bible stories and his mother share the tales of Mark Twain. Cosby, also informed by a love of jazz, became a champion storyteller, focusing not on the rat-a-tat-tat of jokemeisters but on the deeply American rhythms of tale spinners. ""I don't think it was an accident that the first routine he really became famous for was about the Bible -- the 'Noah' routine,"" says Whitaker. 2. The multimedia superstar . For all of Cosby's early success as a comedian, he entered a whole new realm of stardom when he was selected as one of the stars of an NBC espionage drama, ""I Spy."" He was the first black actor to star in a dramatic role on a network TV show, becoming ""television's Jackie Robinson,"" in Variety's words. ""I Spy"" was no sure thing. Cosby had help from producer Sheldon Leonard, who stood up for his raw star when NBC got nervous, and co-star Robert Culp, who refused to make an issue of race. In an era when there were few crossover stars, Cosby was a phenomenon. He won three Emmys for his performances in ""I Spy."" His comedy albums, including ""Wonderfulness"" and ""To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With,"" were best-sellers. He had plans for improving educational outreach (a personal passion) and he established a model for black stars to come. 3. Dr. William H. Cosby, Inc. Cosby had many achievements after ""I Spy"" ended its run. On the personal side, he went back to school and earned a doctorate in education from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. (The subject of his dissertation: the role of another Cosby TV series, ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids,"" as a teaching aid.) He also became TV's foremost advertising pitchman, making commercials for Jell-O pudding and Coca-Cola. ""The three most believable personalities are God, Walter Cronkite and Bill Cosby,"" said a Coke executive. 4. Everybody's dad . Cosby's popularity as an advertiser helped lay the groundwork for his return to network television, but first he had to remake himself as a comedian. His '60s routines often revolved around childhood, but by the early '80s Cosby was a 40-something father of five. His new routines looked at family relationships from a parent's point of view. If this made him seem out of touch to comedians who preferred the brashness of Richard Pryor -- Eddie Murphy did a wicked Cosby parody on ""Saturday Night Live"" -- a concert film, ""Bill Cosby: Himself,"" showed he still had the touch. Though it failed in theaters, endless runs on HBO earned Cosby a whole new group of admirers. ""As good as 'Richard Pryor: Live in Concert' is, the Cosby thing, as a piece of standup, I think, is even better,"" comedian and producer Larry Wilmore told GQ in 2013. ""I don't think there was a better one before it, and I don't think there's been a better one since."" 5. Cosbymania! And then came ""The Cosby Show."" Aside from the boost it gave both Cosby and NBC, the sitcom was notable in other ways. It took advantage of its hit status to showcase a number of notable black entertainers, including Sammy Davis Jr., Lena Horne and Stevie Wonder. In fact, the Wonder episode, which featured the keyboardist using a synthesizer to record and manipulate audio, later inspired hip-hop artists to make sampling a part of their mix. The Huxtable home in Brooklyn Heights also featured paintings by black artists -- an extension of a love of art by Cosby and his wife, Camille -- and even made colorful sweaters a thing. (Yes, Cosby was well aware that not all the sweaters were attractive.) 30 years later, the Cosby sweater still rules . The show was sometimes criticized for presenting a sanitized view of the black family -- one that seemed oblivious to the issues of being black in America -- but Whitaker says that, too, was deliberate. ""Cosby was very aware of the power of television,"" says Whitaker. ""(When) coming into your living room to 35 and 40 million people a week, presenting a positive image -- not only to white viewers but to black viewers -- was deeply powerful and healthy."" 6. Touched by tragedy . ""The Cosby Show"" went off the air in 1992. Cosby's devotion to education paid particular dividends in the post-""Cosby"" age. A ""Cosby"" spinoff, ""A Different World,"" ""created an explosion in applications, enrollment and graduation rates at black colleges,"" wrote HBCUDigest.com's Jarrett L. Carter. Cosby himself donated to many schools, most notably a $20 million bequest to Atlanta's Spelman College. But the '90s also gave Cosby some of his most difficult challenges. A woman named Autumn Jackson claimed that she was his daughter and demanded $40 million. He admitted an affair with Jackson's mother, but denied paternity and Jackson later served time for extortion. Cosby also suffered the loss of his son, Ennis, who was killed in an attempted robbery.  The actor coped with the loss of his son by establishing a scholarship in Ennis' name and routinely wearing a sweatshirt with ""Hello Friend"" -- Ennis' greeting -- at concerts. 7. The wise elder . In the 21st century, Cosby has attracted more attention for his statements about the need for African-Americans to take responsibility for their lives. For that, he was depicted as a curmudgeon and a conservative, taking heat from such black writers as Michael Eric Dyson and Ta-Nehisi Coates, though Coates, in particular, later changed his view. But Whitaker says that Cosby is simply stressing a philosophy he's had all along, one that emphasizes education, social organizations and personal responsibility. The writer believes that in the time that he has left, Cosby is trying to be a positive role model, donating money to schools, meeting with children, and showing up at churches. ""You may disagree with his message, but he puts his money and his time where his mouth is,"" Whitaker says. And Cosby hasn't slowed. At 77, he maintains a steady concert schedule and he has a new TV series in the works. But 30 years after ""The Cosby Show"" premiered, Cosby's legacy, says the author, will be his ability to bring people together. ""He was the entertainer who helped black people and white people -- but beyond that, all people -- see that they had more in common than they had differences,"" says Whitaker. ""He got them all to laugh together, and it's really hard to be angry at people when you're in the same room all laughing at the same thing.""","Bill Cosby's career not defined by ""The Cosby Show""

"(CNN) -- Air guitar players, bus stop drummers and office desk virtuosos, rejoice: being a slave to the rhythm has just become a lot more fun. Mogees is a new technology that turns any object into a musical instrument, by converting the vibrations you make when you touch it into sound. Here's how it works: you stick a small sensor to the surface you want to play with, be it a tree or a fruit bowl or your bathtub, and then connect it to your smartphone. An app running on it detects and analyzes the vibrations, transforming them into musical notes. The sound can then be amplified by hooking up the smartphone to headphones or speakers. ""The sound you hear is really coming from the object, it's not a virtual reconstruction,"" says Bruno Zamborlin, the 30-year-old music technology researcher who invented the device. ""It's a principle called physically inspired sound system. When you play a real instrument, like a guitar, the sound is created by the combination of an exciter and a resonator. The exciter is the plectrum in your hand that hits the strings, and the resonator is the combination of the strings and the body of the guitar. Mogees works in a similar way: everything that is picked up by the sensor -- your gestures, the object itself -- is the exciter, and the resonator is emulated through the software. We just modify the signal to respect musical rules. We augment it."" The name of the device is a geeky reference to its functionality: it stands for ""Modal Gestural Surface."" Nothing is random: if you make the same gesture twice, you get the same sound. Through the app, you can select the musical notes and timbres that you want it to associate to your gestures. Sounds complicated? ""Mogees is designed to be immediately pleasant and fun to play for anyone,"" Zamborlin told CNN, ""but at the same time it leaves room for improvement and virtuosity."" The default setting for the system is the ""Free mode"": you select a musical scale and the frequency of the vibrations that you create is mapped to one specific note on that scale. Alternatively, you can use ""Song mode"", which entails uploading a song in the form of a MIDI file onto your phone: each time you touch your designated object, you play a note from your song. Mogees had a successful Kickstarter earlier this year, and subsequently secured additional private funding to the tune of Â£1 million. The first units have already been delivered to backers. And Zamborlin has racked up some field tests with pre-production prototypes: . ""In New Delhi I met a sword swallower who stuck it on top of his sword and proceeded to play it with the piercing on his tongue: it produced a really high frequency, eerie sound. A French researcher emailed me saying he was going to the Amazon forest for a month and wanted a couple of Mogees to show to the local tribes. Dancers play it with their feet. And I've seen people just attach it to a ping pong table to 'sonify' their game. I like being surprised."" A musical enthusiast himself -- he pauses mid-sentence to marvel at the sound of a nearby Mogees playing a song by Kraftwerk, the German pioneers of electronic music -- Zamborlin has performed publicly several times with the device, most recently playing alongside British electronic duo Plaid at London's Roundhouse, a venue that has hosted the likes of The Doors and Jimi Hendrix. On stage, he had surrounded himself with items reminiscent of a playground: a slide, a tree, a metal fence, and some scaffolding arranged to spell the word ""play"". At one point he used a wooden chair, gently caressing it as if trying to convince it to produce the perfect note. ""I'm trying to add some visual and performative aspect to electronic music. I want it to go back to the real world and be physically performed, with the advantages of digital technology coupled with the gestures of acoustic instruments. We're witnessing a spring of augmented reality and embedded technology, and this concept can be applied to music as well: I wish to inspire people to see objects in a novel way."" Other musicians are using or plan to use the device. Among them, French electronic composer Jean Michel Jarre, the Mexican acoustic duo Rodrigo y Gabriela, and English songwriter Imogen Heap. But Zamborlin is also eager to see how regular users will employ it, and he plans to update the software accordingly, while keeping an open stance: . ""This project is about not telling people what to do,"" he says, ""There are no rules with this technology. I want people to just look around and find their own inspiration. All I'm going to do is try to make their experience better."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: . Can levitating appliances take off? The Chairless Chair, an invisible chair that you can wear .

"As a mother, I would understand completely if Lindsey Rogers-Seitz, a mother from Ridgefield, Connecticut, never wanted to get out of bed in the morning. If she didn't want to stop crying. If she couldn't muster up the energy to do anything. Those would be expected responses to what she is coping with -- the ""unimaginable"" is one word she uses to describe it -- but instead she's on a mission. ""I guess what motivates me is Ben and what he would want me to do,"" she said. Ben was the name of her 15-month-old son. On July 7, Rogers-Seitz's husband, Kyle, was supposed to drop Ben off at day care. The drop-off never occurred. Her husband drove to work and at the end of the day went to day care to pick Ben up, she said during an interview. When Ben wasn't there, he asked the day care providers if his wife had picked him up earlier. When they told him no, he went to the car, found Ben and rushed him to the hospital, she said. Their little boy had died. Forty-four children died of heat stroke in cars in 2013, and more than 500 have died in hot cars since 2000, according to the child advocacy group KidsAndCars.org. The investigation into Benjamin Seitz's death is still ongoing, according to the Ridgefield police and prosecutor. Last month, the Connecticut medical examiner determined the cause of death was hyperthermia because of environmental exposure and ruled the death a homicide. CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan said the use of the word ""homicide"" in the autopsy report does not necessarily mean that criminal charges will be filed in the case. ""In legal parlance, the term means that death was caused by another human being rather than by strictly natural causes,"" said Callan. Rogers-Seitz has said she won't comment further on what happened that day, citing the ongoing investigation, but decided to go public to bring attention to National Heatstroke Prevention Day, Thursday, July 31. ""Right now there's a hole and it's like a missing space where he used to be,"" she said. ""And so I kind of feel like since he's not here, a way that I can have that happiness again is to continue to live through him with what I think he would want me to do for other people and for ourselves, because this is healing for us, too."" Just three weeks after her son's death, Rogers-Seitz, who also has two daughters, ages 5 and 8, has created a blog called ""The Gift of Ben,"" which she is using to bring attention to the number of children who die of heatstroke in cars and to press for action to save lives. We need to do more, she says, beyond public awareness campaigns. ""I just feel like public awareness has been around for years, and honestly I never paid any attention to it. I mean, we're the all-American family, and we never in our lives understood how this happens."" She and her husband never understood how someone could actually forget their child was in the back seat of a car, much less that they themselves could do it, she said. ""I've gone back in my head over and over a million times of that day, of what if?"" she said. What if she had contacted her husband and asked about drop-off? What if she had done X, Y or Z? Rogers-Seitz started reading anything she could get her hands on about child heatstroke in cars. She talked to nonprofit advocacy groups such as KidsAndCars.org, read what experts such as David Diamond, a psychology professor at the University of South Florida, have written about a phenomenon known as Forgotten Baby Syndrome, and studied the legislative stops and starts to try and save lives. ""And then I just started thinking, 'Wait a minute. You mean this has been around for over 10 years,'"" she said, referring to the problem of children dying in hot cars. She then learned about failed attempts to include a provision in previous legislation back in 2007, which would require that cars include some way to remind drivers about passengers in the back when the car is turned off and the driver leaves the vehicle. She wondered why there isn't a law like that on the books now. Rogers-Seitz, who's a lawyer, talked with her husband about making their family's new mission the push for action against child vehicular heat stroke. OPINION: I, too, left my child in a hot car . ""He's an engineer, so we would sit together and he has his notepad, and he's like drawing out ideas for devices of things that could be developed, and I'm sitting here looking at the legal stuff. And we just kind of came together and said, you know, together as a family we'd like to do this,"" she said. She has since even drafted a bill, which she calls Benjamin's Bill, and is using it as she reaches out to U.S. senators and representatives about options to consider. (She has so far talked with one U.S. senator and Senate and House staffers.) Her bill includes ideas such as having the Department of Transportation convene roundtable discussions with everyone from the automobile and car seat industries, to child safety advocates and victims, to academic and medical professionals. She also wants to see more funding for research and development for technology that would detect a child in the rear seat when the driver leaves the car. She's backing a petition drive by KidsAndCars.org to urge the White House to authorize the Department of Transportation to provide funding for that research and development. (The group, which has more than 7,500 signatures, needed 100,000 by August 13.) The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration reviewed the technology that was available in 2012, which included sensors that would detect the weight of a toddler in a car seat or restraint, when the ignition is off and a driver leaves the vehicle, and activate an alarm or alert. The agency determined sensors and other technology available at the time were not reliable enough. The technology ""just doesn't seem to be there yet,"" David Friedman, the agency's acting administrator, told me in an interview in July. ""'Yet' is an important word there,"" he added. Rogers-Seitz believes the ideal technology would be devices such as sensors that detect the presence of the child in the car seat when the driver leaves the car, which she says should be installed in cars and car seats before you buy them -- not as voluntary accessories. She admits she probably wouldn't have purchased such a device, again because she never expected her family to experience this type of tragedy. But had there been technology already in her car or on their son's car seat before both were purchased, Rogers-Seitz said, Benjamin would be with her today. ""Absolutely -- it would have saved his life."" Rogers-Seitz looks forward to a time, which she hopes will be soon, when the police investigation is wrapped up, and her husband is free of any possible charges and can speak out freely. ""He wants to tell the public how this happens so that people can think about it and be aware of it, and show why we need devices out there to help people. Because if you describe the mental state of how it happens to people very eloquently and clearly, it's easier, I think, for them to understand."" It is still something that is ""beyond words,"" she said, referring to the moment she saw her husband in the emergency room on that dreadful night. ""I've never witnessed anything like that before. Nobody should ever witness that."" The family is trying to tune out the critics and harsh comments, including calls by some for Kyle Seitz to be charged, and is gaining strength from the support of family, friends and their daughters. Rogers-Seitz remembers how her youngest girl, whom she calls her ""sidekick,"" comforted her with wise words in the days after Ben's death: ""You know, we can't change what happened, but we can just move forward and live,"" she said. As for Ben, she describes him as ""the happiest human being"" she ever met, a boy who smiled and laughed every day and with his entire face, a boy people used to say was ""too pretty"" to be a boy. The day before Ben was buried, Rogers-Seitz knew she was not ready to say goodbye. She wanted to find something permanent that she could carry with her -- a way to ""have him with me,"" she said as she started to tear up. She headed to the mall and found a locket. She wears the half inscribed ""Son"" around her neck, and Ben has the other half, inscribed ""Mom."" ""I realized that his heart is in my heart ... and that I always wanted to keep it with me,"" she said holding back tears. ""Then I said I want him to have part of me too."" And now, she plans to keep his memory alive by helping others. ""He taught me, during the 15 months that he was here, the value of life and the potential that there is in life to do things meaningful.""","Benjamin Seitz is one of at least 19 children who've died in hot cars in 2014 .

An arrest was made at Bullock's house. Police said they later searched Corbett's Montrose, California, house and found ""an arsenal of weapons"" that included a half-dozen illegal machine guns. The finding of the weapons led to 19 felony counts, including seven counts of possession of a machine gun, two counts of possession of an assault weapon and 10 counts of possession of a destructive device, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office told CNN last month. Corbett pleaded not guilty after the initial charges were filed. After the added counts, his bail was increased from $185,000 to $2.2 million.

"(CNN)The latest  ISIS-appointed governor of Mosul was killed in coalition airstrikes on Thursday, according to Iraqi police. Hassan Saeed Al-Jabouri, also known as Abu Taluut,  was killed 18 miles south of Mosul in the village of Qayyara,  according to Maj. Gen. Watheq Al-Hamdani, a senior regional Iraqi police commander who is leading the government's efforts to retake Mosul from ISIS. Jabouri is the second ISIS-appointed governor of Mosul killed by airstrikes and had been in office for less than 25 days. Earlier this month, U.S. airstrikes killed one of his predecessors, Radwan Taleb Al-Hamdouni, according to U.S. security officials. Mosul is a key stronghold for ISIS fighters and was taken from Iraqi forces earlier this year.  The Pentagon said that it has a strategy to retake the city beginning in January. Meanwhile, more than 100 people were injured or killed in six airstrikes by Syrian forces on the ISIS held city of al-Bab and the town of Qbasin in the northeast of Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In the village of Abo Qassayed, 30 ISIS militants were killed Tuesday as Syrian Kurdish forces captured that town held by ISIS, according to the observatory.

Young said while Capa drew acclaim for his action photos, those he took at the Battle of the Bulge are of a different nature. ""The images of dead soldiers, a farmer burying a dead horse in the snow and German prisoners corralled with their hands raised attest to the bleakness of this deadly campaign,"" Young said. Capa, who Young describes as ""decidedly anti-fascist,"" was not an impartial observer of the war, but rather an official Allied photographer. ""He photographed for the American and English press to inform readers of the war in the hope that his photographs would help garner Allied support,"" Young said. You'll see several photos of German prisoners in the accompanying gallery. Young said that Capa would only photograph German soldiers if they were prisoners. Despite Capa's  Allied status, he cast anything but a military appearance, according to Kenneth Koyen, a U.S. Army public relations officer who assisted Capa during the Battle of the Bulge. Writing in the History of Photography (reprinted online on evesmag.com), Koyen relates how that appearance almost cost Capa his freedom when Koyen escorted Capa into a U.S. Army intelligence headquarters where an intelligence officer, Lt. Col. Harry Brown, was working on a wall-mounted map of battle positions. ""'Arrest that man! Get him out of here!'"" Brown shouted as he tried to conceal the map from Capa, who was wearing a pilfered German fur coat, according to Koyen's account. Koyen was able to convince the colonel of Capa's allegiance, but the photographer's appearance almost cost him again later in the battle, when U.S. soldiers began shooting at Capa, Koyen wrote. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Koyen stepped in and waved the GIs off, he wrote. And then: ""Capa and I exchanged a long glance. Without a word, he took off the fur coat and stowed it in the (jeep)."" Those GIs were among the 1 million soldiers who fought in the Battle of the Bulge. More than 100,000 Germans and 67,000 Americans were casualties, according to the National WW II Museum. The battle was considered finished on January 28, 1945, when German forces were pushed back to positions they occupied when their offensive began six weeks earlier.

"Eight days after the invasion of Iraq on March 19 2003, Paul Wolfowitz, then deputy defence secretary and a leading proponent of the war, told a Congressional committee: ""We are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction, and relatively soon."" A decade later, that assessment could hardly have turned out to be more wrong. The US has overwhelmingly borne the brunt of both the military and reconstruction costs, spending at least $138bn on private security, logistics and reconstruction contractors, who have supplied everything from diplomatic security to power plants and toilet paper. An analysis by the Financial Times reveals the extent to which both American and foreign companies have profited from the conflict -- with the top 10 contractors securing business worth at least $72bn between them. None has benefited more than KBR, once known as Kellogg Brown and Root. The controversial former subsidiary of Halliburton, which was once run by Dick Cheney, vice-president to George W. Bush, was awarded at least $39.5bn in federal contracts related to the Iraq war over the past decade. Two Kuwaiti companies -- Agility Logistics and the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation -- are the second and third-biggest winners, securing contracts worth $7.2bn and $6.3bn respectively. The US hired more private companies in Iraq than in any previous war, and at times there were more contractors than military personnel on the ground. ""These numbers are staggering,"" said Claire McCaskill, the Democratic senator who has led the charge to tighten contracting controls. ""In the last decade, we've seen billions in taxpayer money spent on services and projects that did little -- sometimes nothing -- to further our military mission,"" she said. But companies on the top 10 list defended their record. KBR ""performed with honour and sacrifice in a hostile, complex, ambiguous and unpredictable environment"", said Marianne Gooch, a company spokeswoman. She noted that KBR had prepared and served more than 1bn meals and produced more than 25bn gallons of drinkable water and 265 tons of ice. Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for the International Oil Trading Co, a Florida-based company that secured contracts worth $2.1bn to transport fuel from Jordan to US forces in Iraq, said: ""We are proud to have effectively supplied jet and convoy fuel in a war zone to the US military."" The business environment for these contractors may be changing, with the war in Iraq over and the conflict in Afghanistan winding down, but these private companies remain. There are still 14,000 contractors, including 5,500 security guards, in Iraq even though the last troops left in December 2011. ""Contractors are here to stay as real players,"" says Stuart Bowen, the special inspector general of Iraq reconstruction. ""The opportunities in this field are shaped by the unpredictable rhythm of when a fragile state will fail."" The FT's list of the top earners over the past decade is based on all federal government contracts awarded for performance in Iraq and neighbouring Kuwait since the invasion was planned. Compiling such a list is tricky because some contractors operate under a variety of names to avoid scrutiny. That makes these figures conservative. The list includes companies working in supplying support services, security, reconstruction and the oil industry. ""This is not my grandfather's military industrial complex,"" said Dan Goure, vice-president of the Lexington Institute, a national security think-tank partly funded by defence contractors. ""There's not a single munitions producer in this list."" Instead, the US had created a fifth branch of the military, he said. ""It's called the private sector."" The extensive use of contractors in both Iraq and in Afghanistan has been steeped in controversy. A 2011 report from the commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan estimated that defence contractors had wasted or lost to fraud as much as $60bn -- or $12m a day -- since 2001. Private contractors have been involved in some of the most shocking events of the Iraq conflict -- from the Nisour Square shootings in 2007 in which Blackwater security guards killed 17 Iraqis, to the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. While the era of easy money may have ended for these contractors, that does not mean the boom times are over. In 2011, the state department estimated that it would pay $3bn over the next five years on its private security contracts to protect its massive embassy complex in Baghdad alone. Meanwhile, contractors are winning new business as oil companies ramp up their operations, especially around areas such as Basra in the south. ""It's not like these companies have shut up shop and are going home,"" says Stephanie Sanok of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""We are still sinking a lot of money into this and we are still trying to get our oil dividend."" That means that companies that branch out into other areas could have an even better decade ahead. Given the controversies that have surrounded the use of contractors in Iraq, many analysts say that there is little evidence that the defence department has learnt about how to best use them. ""While DOD is much better at using contractors than they were 10 years ago, they are still not sufficiently prepared to use contractors in future large-scale military operations,"" says Moshe Schwartz, an analyst at the Congressional Research Service. After a six-year wrangle, the Senate in December passed the National Defense Authorization Act, a sweeping overhaul of wartime contracting aimed at improving oversight and cracking down on waste and fraud. It was pioneered by Ms McCaskill, who says she has ""spent years shining a light on the massive waste, fraud and abuse in military contracting"". Mr Bowen and the Commission on Wartime Contracting have also made specific recommendations for improvements. But a Government Accountability Office report last year found that the Pentagon had taken or planned actions based on only half the CWC recommendations, while the state department and USAID had acted on only one-third of the recommendations relating to them. ""The reality is that the US is not well structured to carry out stabilisation and reconstruction operations on an integrated, inter-agency basis,"" said Mr Bowen, the special inspector-general. ""That is the most serious and continuing problem. We must ensure we do not repeat the errors and weaknesses seen in Iraq.""","U.S. spent at least $138 billion on security, logistics and reconstruction since the war .

"(CNN) -- South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu announced Thursday he will retire from public life in October, when he turns 79 years old. ""Instead of growing old gracefully, at home with my family -- reading and writing and praying and thinking -- too much of my time has been spent at airports and in hotels,"" the Nobel laureate said in a statement. ""The time has now come to slow down, to sip Rooibos tea with my beloved wife in the afternoons, to watch cricket, to travel to visit my children and grandchildren, rather than to conferences and conventions and university campuses,"" he said. Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, formally retired as Archbishop of Cape Town in 1996. But by then he was already chairing South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, a public inquiry into the crimes of the country's apartheid regime. He retired from that position in 1998. Since then, Tutu has continued to travel the world, lecturing and advocating for various causes. He's also been chairing The Elders, a group of statesmen and women including Nelson Mandela, Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan and Mary Robinson. The Elders try to help resolve conflicts around the world, including those in Cyrpus and Sudan, campaign against nuclear arms, and work for women's and girls' rights.","Nobel Peace Prize winner wants to spend more time with his family .

"(CNN) -- The main thrust of a raging storm that dumped snow in parts of the Midwest over the weekend moved north of the border Monday, but the United States will still feel some of its effects in the form of rain, snow or frigid temperatures. The low pressure system that brought snow the Midwest and below freezing temperatures deep into the South was centered in Canada north of Maine late Monday. The Northeast could expect rain for most of the night, but some snow in New York and Vermont. The Great Lakes area could see up to two feet more of lake-effect snow -- on top of what fell there last week -- through Tuesday morning. And the cold in the east isn't going away anytime soon. The storm clogged up travel over the weekend, stranding motorists and delaying flights -- and even forcing the delay of an NFL game when the inflatable roof of Minnesota's Metrodome collapsed under 16 inches of snow. In northwest Indiana, at least two counties declared a state of emergency and urged drivers to stay off the roads. Police and highway crews struggled to dig out some stranded motorists and clear roads covered with blowing and drifting snow. LaPorte County Sheriff's Deputy Patrick Drangmeister said several motorists remained stranded Monday in various locations throughout the county. He said every available deputy was out trying to help. Motorists were urged to avoid all but highly essential travel. At the Indiana State Police post in Lowell, which covers LaPorte and Porter County, which is also under a state of emergency, Sgt. Chad Woody said as many as 75 vehicles had been stranded Sunday night along a stretch of Indiana Route 2 near I-65 that has since been cleared. ""Our primary concerns are the secondary roads,"" he said. ""The interstates seem to be in pretty good shape at this time."" The problem, particularly in LaPorte and Porter counties, was a double whammy from lake-effect snow and high wind that was blowing snow back onto roadways as soon as it's cleared, said Indiana Department of Transportation spokesman Jim Pinkerton in LaPorte. Fort Wayne, Indiana, resident David Volmerding was among those caught in the storm while trying to make it home from Chicago with his wife, Donna. ""You literally could not see the road at all,""  he said. ""You just had to come to a stop and wait for a chance to see something."" The weather forced them to stop in Wanatah, Indiana, where they sought refuge in the local Burger King. When weather forced the restaurant to close, they moved to the fire station. They were spending Monday at the city's town hall, watching a forecast that could force them to spend another night in Watanah. The road they were traveling, U.S. 30, was one of two in northwest Indiana closed due to weather. The other was U.S. 6 south of LaPorte. The National Weather Service posted winter weather notices Monday for portions of Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, New York and the New England states as the storm moved eastward. High wind warnings accompanied chilly temperatures as far south as Alabama, Georgia and Florida, forcing NASA to delay a scheduled test of the space shuttle Discovery's damaged external fuel tank at the Kennedy Space Center. Temperatures in the South weren't expected to rise above freezing. In the Midwest, temperatures weren't forecast to rise above the teens. Although airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration was reporting no weather-related delays at airports around the country as of mid-day Monday. United Airlines reported it had canceled 12 flights at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. Continental Airlines said it had pulled the plug on 96 flights at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, where forecasters say as much as a foot of snow could fall by the end of the week. In Ohio, Kent State University student Katy Brown said she was spending the day relaxing and watching TV after getting a text message from the school saying that afternoon exams were canceled after a foot of snow. ""They finally got some common sense,"" she said. Parts of Tennessee saw as much as 8 inches of snow. The snow was lighter in Nashville, but state troopers still responded to 164 crashes, spokesman Mike Browning said. In Minneapolis, workers began trying to repair the roof of the Metrodome, where the Minnesota Vikings play. The roof collapsed under the weight of snow, forcing the NFL to delay Sunday's scheduled Vikings game against the New York Giants until Monday night and to move it to Detroit. Meanwhile, school children there got a day off. Minneapolis Public Schools called off classes for Monday as a result of heavy snows and dangerously cold temperatures. CNN iReporter Jack Paar of St. Paul, Minnesota, said this was the worst blizzard he has seen in the six years he has lived there. He captured footage of a person cross-country skiing down a street. ""That's the best way to get around -- cross-country skis,"" Paar said amid cars immobilized by snow. The snow caused the roof of the 64,000-seat Metrodome in Minneapolis to collapse Sunday morning, Minnesota State Patrol spokesman Lt. Eric Roeske said. Workers wielding shovels could be seen clearing the roof of the heavy white stuff, while photos from inside the darkened stadium showed much of the field covered with snow that fell from a gaping hole in the dome. Roy Terwilliger, chairman of the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission -- the group that oversees the Metrodome -- said that the heavy snow and cold, plus high winds were ""too much pressure on the dome, and several panels on the Teflon roof were caused to rip."" By late Sunday night, sheets of ice, many large ice chunks and snow remained frozen on the field. Steve Maki, facilities director at the facilities commission, said this was the fourth collapse of the Metrodome due to snow. ""It looks worse than what it is, in some respects, because the repair, as I understand it, will be basically to unclamp the old fabric and clamp new fabric in its place and then blow the roof back up,"" Maki said Sunday night.

"Five Al-Shabaab militants are dead after they attacked an African Union military base in Somalia on Thursday, AU officials said. The militants attacked the Halane military base in Mogadishu, Somalia's largest base for African Union troops, according to the African Union Mission in Somalia. Two militants detonated themselves inside the Halane base and three were shot dead by AU troops during the raid, AMISOM spokesman Ali Aden Houmed said. Three AU soldiers and a civilian died in the attack, AMISOM said on its website. The AMISOM statement said other personnel at Halane are ""safe and secure."" Some of the attackers wore Somali military uniforms during the lunchtime raid on the facility located close to Mogadishu International Airport, the AU said. A spokesman for the al Qaeda-linked terror group described the attack on the heavily fortified base -- which also houses several U.N. and international agencies -- on Radio Andalus, a pro-Al-Shabaab broadcaster. ""Our Mujahedeen forces detonated a car bomb at the entrance of the Halane compound ... then managed to enter the facility,"" Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab said.  A firefight then broke out with troops, he said. Maman S. Sidikou, special representative of the AU Commission chairperson (SRCC) for Somalia and head of AMISOM, offered his condolences to the families of the victims and ""applauded the quick response and bravery of the ... troops in quelling this reprehensible attack,"" according to AMISOM.

"Joran van der Sloot's wife says her husband was ""seriously injured"" in a stabbing at the Peruvian prison where he is serving time for murder, but a top prison official is calling her account an outright lie, according to reports. Leidy Figueroa, the Dutch convict's wife, told RTL, a newsgroup in the Netherlands that is also a CNN affiliate, that van der Sloot was stabbed twice. She further claimed that after visiting him Sunday at Challapalca prison in Puno Province, near the Bolivian border, where he is serving a 28-year sentence, she smuggled his bloody polo shirt out of the facility, RTL reported. Van der Sloot was stabbed in the shoulder and in the waist, and both wounds were about 2 centimeters (three-quarters of an inch) deep, she told RTL. Jose Perez Guadalupe, director of Peru's National Penitentiary Institute, which oversees the country's prisons, told a 24-hour television station that Figueroa's assertions were untrue and further labeled her a ""compulsive liar."" He continued with an assault on her character, telling Peru's Channel N, ""For starters, no woman in her right mind goes to a maximum-security prison and marries the biggest killer there."" Van der Sloot was convicted in 2012 of robbing and killing Stephany Flores. He has been linked to the disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway, who vanished in Aruba in 2005. Earlier this year, he married Figueroa at the notorious Miguel Castro Castro Prison in Lima where he was an inmate before being transferred to Challapalca. Van der Sloot is expected to become a father in September when the Peruvian woman gives birth to their child, lawyer Maximo Altez told CNN in July. Once van der Sloot is eligible for release he's expected to be extradited to the United States to face charges related to the Holloway case. The Alabama 18-year-old was last seen leaving an Aruba nightclub in 2005 with van der Sloot and two other men.

"(CNN) -- Reigning Tour de France champion Alberto Contador has rejected the findings of a positive dope test taken while the cyclist was competing in this year's race, blaming it on bad meat. Contador was provisionally suspended from competitive cycling by the sport's governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), on Thursday following the results of the test. The Spanish rider, a three-time winner of cycling's showpiece event, had traces of the banned substance clenbuterol in a test sample he gave on July 21 -- which was a rest day. However, in a press conference held in the 27-year-old's home town of Pinto in Spain, which CNN attended, Contador said he was innocent. Tour of Spain runner-up fails doping test . ""It is a food contamination case of which I am the victim."" He added that the test result was due to bad meat he and several other riders had eaten the day before the test. ""When they confirmed to me what had happened the first thing I did was ask the UCI which of my fellow riders had passed the test. ""They said the only one who passed the control ... was Alexandre Vinokourov. [He was the only one of the riders] who did not eat the meat on that day."" He concluded that truth was on his side. Contador now faces a fight to clear his name after the UCI released a statement saying: ""The UCI confirmed today that Spanish rider Alberto Contador returned an adverse analytical finding for clenbuterol. ""The rider, who had already put an end to his cycling season before the result was known, was nevertheless formally and provisionally suspended as is prescribed by the World Anti-Doping Code. ""This result was reported by the WADA accredited laboratory in Cologne to UCI and WADA simultaneously."" The UCI went on to explain the amounts of the prohibited stimulant found in the sample were low, so a second sample was also tested. ""In view of this very small concentration and in consultation with WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency), the UCI immediately had the proper results management proceedings conducted including the analysis of B sample that confirmed the first result."" Further analysis of the results will now be carried out by UCI and WADA, with no further comment being made until it has been concluded. ""The UCI continues working with the scientific support of WADA to analyze all the elements that are relevant to the case. ""In order to protect the integrity of the proceedings and in accordance with the World Anti-Doping Code, the UCI will refrain from making any further comments until the management of this adverse analytical finding has been completed."" Andy Schleck, who finished runner-up to Contador in this year's Tour De France, said he hoped the Spaniard would prove his innocence. ""I hope he is innocent and I think he deserves the right to defend himself now,"" Schleck wrote on the micro-blogging site Twitter. ""What a crazy day in cycling with the news about Contador. I only heard about it in the press."" Cadel Evans, who finished second to Contador in the 2007 edition, said he wanted to find out the facts of the case before passing judgment. ''I just read some little things in the paper, I don't really know what the situation is. [But] if people are cheating and getting caught, that's a good thing. If people want to exaggerate the stories and ... claim cycling is a filthy sport, that's not such a good thing. ""I don't know exactly what the situation is, they're still waiting on further analysis. I'd like to see what facts come about Contador before I make an opinion.'' Daniel Friebe, features editor of Pro Cycling magazine, believes it is possible the Spaniard could have received the substance in food, and this case is not comparable to other doping scandals in cycling. Friebe told CNN: ""This really does sound like a legitimate excuse. ""It's well known that clenbuterol is used on cattle. This is an alibi that's been used before and it's been verified before. It doesn't sound impossible to me."" He said that people familiar with other incidents of doping in the sport will recognize that Contador has been unlucky. ""Most people who are au fait with how doping within cycling works will be fairly sure that this is quite different to other cases,"" he said. Friebe also explained how taking clenbuterol would not make sense for Contador and it could possibly have a negative effect on his performance. ""He is well known for his climbing ability. This substance is a steroid, which will boost muscle mass and make him heavier. It's not really the kind of substance you would expect a rider like him to take."" Contador, who has just signed a contract with the Saxo Bank team, successfully defended his Tour title while riding for the Kazakhstan-based Astana team. The Spaniard won his first Tour in 2007 and joined Astana in 2008 -- although he was prevented from defending his title that year as the team had been banned by race organizers for previous doping violations. In 2006, Contador was linked to a Spain-based blood-doping ring known as ""Operation Puerto"" but was cleared of any wrongdoing. The only previous winner of the Tour de France to be stripped of his title after being found guilty of using a banned substance was Floyd Landis. The American was found to have taken testosterone while winning the 2006 race.","NEW Tour de France runner-up Andy Schleck hopes Contador can prove his innocence .

"(CNN) -- Indian Relay might just be America's best-kept sporting secret. Little-known outside the tribes of the Rocky Mountains in the northwest, it's a ""magical"" mix of horse racing, track-and-field relay and the all-action adrenalin of rodeo. Each race is battled out by up to six jockeys over three laps of a track -- and the riders have to change horses every lap. With handlers for each horse, it creates a melee of 18 horses and 24 people. It is pure, unadulterated and unpredictable chaos. To add a further twist, they don't use saddles or helmets, and the danger element adds to the ""rock star"" esteem in which the jockeys are held by their communities. Kendall Old Horn has been involved in the sport for 37 years -- first as a rider back in 1978 and now as a team owner after returning after 21 years away, following a five-year stint in the Marine Corps. ""I don't know how to sell the sport but what I do know is that it's a fast-paced, high-action sport,"" he explains. ""The adrenalin rush is the biggest buzz you can imagine. ""You can't beat that feeling, there's nothing like it. It's better than any high that you can experience, if you'd done anything like that. For me, it's America's best-kept secret as a sport."" Horses are a way of life for the Native American tribes of Montana, where Old Horn is based. ""I've been around horses from the day I hit the ground,"" he says. Horses are very therapeutic. They take away the everyday stresses of life. ""I was away from Indian Relay for 21 years but I was never away from horses. They're a part of me."" The Blackfoot Nation is a Native American territory in Montana. Tribal elder Carol Murray admits Indian Relay is little known nationwide but describes the sport as ""magical."" ""It's the spirit of the animals and the spirit of the people coming together. But what amazes me is the effect it has on the spectators as well,"" explains Murray, whose son used to race and whose grandson is now entering the sport as a rider. ""You see the faces of the families watching and it's understandable how excited they are supporting their family members or their teams. But you look across the crowds at races and everyone's just so involved. It's a magical sport."" Murray has helped it gain slightly wider acclaim after being introduced to American filmmaker Charles Dye, who last year released a documentary called ""Indian Relay."" It takes an in-depth look at the sport and the characters within it, including Murray and Old Horn. The project was a labor of love for Dye, who spent the first of the four years it took to complete trying to gain the trust of the communities -- no mean feat when there is a mistrust of outsiders. But gradually Dye managed to get a true insight into the lives of those who eat, sleep and breathe the sport, in communities which are often very poor and where adult unemployment can be as high as 80%. ""Some of these are super-duper poor communities and in some cases without Indian Relay some of the young kids would fall into trouble,"" he says. Dye had some prior knowledge of Indian Relay but admits his project became less about the sport and more about the people, the tribes and the communities it touches. ""You feel like you're falling off the edge of the world,"" says Dye, who followed teams from the Shoshone-Bannock Nation in Idaho and the Crow and Blackfoot Nations. ""You're in the wild west with no real connection to the rest of the world. It's quite magical. My film was not so much about horse racing, I guess, as the rural west."" However, the film does capture the madness of the racing and the horse exchanges -- which occur with rider and animal moving at full pelt. ""These are top horses often at the ends of their career,"" Dye explains. ""So they're obviously going at some speed. ""There's dangers but not as many people get hurt as you might think. I think the whole time I was there I saw one hospitalization and the guy was fine in the end."" Old Horn admits that ""nobody went into this sport and didn't get hurt"" but points out the injuries are relatively low because of the expertise of those involved. ""You need to have an incredibly high level of horsemanship both by the riders and those on the ground,"" he says. ""We don't wear helmets and saddles as we're considered some of the best horse people on the face of the earth. ""If we wore those, we'd be a laughing stock. That's our pride and we take great pride in it."" Indian Relay is immersed in the middle of its season, with races virtually every weekend. Prize money is on offer but the amounts are relatively small, particularly given how far funds have to stretch among the team setup. But Old Horn says it is not about the money: ""It's about the pride, about the bragging rights when you win over the other tribes."" Murray echoes the overriding element of pride, but admits that watching her family members race at breakneck speed can be a harsh experience. Her faith in their horse-handling, however, makes it easier viewing. ""It is nerve wracking,"" she says. ""I remember seeing my son Little Plume ride for the first time. He really wanted to ride but had to wait to get picked. I was in the stands and suddenly my friend was like, 'That's your son racing.' ""I thought no-one would pick him and so it was like, 'Oh my God.' So from there it's no turning back, I can't stop him. Horses have always been in my family -- it's part of my life, an extension of me. ""And it's so good. I remember how hard my son worked feeding, exercising the horses, doing everything that was required. It's a special thing."" Riders like Little Plume are ""treated like rock stars,"" says Dye, but only to a local audience. ""The funny thing is that in the next-door town some people won't have even heard of it,"" he adds. It truly is America's best-kept sporting secret.","Indian Relay is a fast-paced, high action sport reserved to the Rocky Mountain West .

"If you're uneasy at the idea of riding in a vehicle that drives itself, just wait till you see Google's new car. It has no gas pedal, no brake and no steering wheel. Google has been demonstrating its driverless technology for several years by retrofitting Toyotas, Lexuses and other cars with cameras and sensors. But now, for the first time, the company has unveiled a prototype of its own: a cute little car that looks like a cross between a VW Beetle and a golf cart. ""They won't have a steering wheel, accelerator pedal, or brake pedal ... because they don't need them,"" Google said Tuesday in a blog post introducing the unnamed electric vehicles. ""Our software and sensors do all the work."" Unlike previous models, these cars won't have human drivers monitoring them at all times. Google said the cars can detect objects up to 200 yards away in all directions and adjust their speed, turns and braking accordingly. The cars' speed for now has been capped at 25 mph, allowing engineers to minimize the risk of crashes during testing. Inside, the spartan cars have few dashboard controls, no glove box and no stereo. ""We've designed for learning, not luxury, so we're light on creature comforts,"" Google said. ""But we'll have two seats (with seatbelts), a space for passengers' belongings, buttons to start and stop, and a screen that shows the route -- and that's about it."" Google did not explain how the car navigates, although passengers would presumably punch in a destination on the dashboard screen and let the computers do the rest. The company plans to build about 100 prototype vehicles and begin testing them later this summer. If everything goes well, Google then will run a small pilot program in California over the next few years. The cars represent another step into hardware for Google, which in recent years has introduced its Glass connected headset and bought Nest, a startup that makes ""smart"" thermostats and smoke detectors. Google said it eventually hopes to partner with an automaker to produce the self-driving vehicles instead of building them itself. The bubblelike Google cars arrive as the U.S. is struggling to accept a sci-fi future of robotic vehicles and other technological advancements. A recent Pew survey found that half of Americans would not ride in a self-driving car. Four states -- California, Nevada, Florida and Michigan -- now allow self-driving vehicles on their roads as long as a human driver is behind the wheel at all times. Most major automakers are also developing vehicles that drive autonomously. Google posted a video Tuesday featuring testimonials from people who had ridden in the new cars. ""The human feeling of it is very well engineered, and it is very smooth,"" said an older man identified only as Nick. ""There's nothing that makes you feel the least bit threatened.""","Google has unveiled its first prototype of a self-driving car .

"Thursday is judgment day for the Affordable Care Act, with the U.S. Supreme Court expected to release its long awaited ruling on the constitutionality of the law. Whichever way the Court rules, the decision will be instantly framed in the political context. Its potential impact on the presidential race, on the upcoming Congressional elections and on the trajectory of the political parties will be the subject of endless analysis and debate. The electoral handicapping will regrettably overlook the decision's real-world impact on those whom the law is intended to help. At stake in the opinions of nine justices is the well-being of millions of Americans living with chronic diseases such as cancer. They wake up every day knowing that if they lose their job, if their employer decides to drop their health coverage, or if their insurance company raises premiums, they may be unable to get the lifesaving care they need. The debate over health care has been epically divisive. But it is almost universally accepted that the existing health care system is badly in need of repair. People with cancer and other life-threatening chronic diseases have long been routinely denied coverage outright, charged exorbitant costs for care and forced to spend their savings to get the care they need, simply because they have a pre-existing condition. The law addresses this national moral failing with numerous provisions that help to expand access to quality, affordable health care, including those that prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, charging patients higher premiums because of their health status and suddenly revoking coverage when a person falls ill with a disease such as cancer. The law also empowers consumers to make informed choices about their health coverage, requiring insurance companies to issue brief and simple explanations of what their plans cover and creating online marketplaces, or ""exchanges,"" where people can compare plans and choose the one that is best for them. These provisions, which have received broad bipartisan support, hang in the balance before the court. So, too, do popular provisions that are currently enabling students and young workers to remain on their parent's health plan until age 26, ensuring coverage for children with pre-existing conditions and eliminating arbitrary dollar limits. The court's decision will determine whether the 60,000 people with pre-existing conditions who enrolled in the law's new high-risk plan after going six months or more without insurance will continue to receive coverage. It will either continue or end the new requirement that people receive proven preventive screenings, such as mammograms and colonoscopies, at no cost to them. It will decide whether millions of low-income and disabled people with cancer or at risk for cancer will be eligible for quality health coverage under Medicaid. The pundits will have ample opportunity to pontificate about the ruling's political implications. But no one should lose sight of the impact on those who are most in need of quality care. For people and families battling cancer or another serious chronic disease, the upcoming ruling is about much more than politics. It could mean the difference between life and death.","John Seffrin: Court decision on health reform must be viewed in terms of impact on the sick .

"The kids have spoken. Winners of the Children's and Teen Choice Book Awards were announced Wednesday night at the seventh Children's Book Week Gala in New York, part of the the 95th Children's Book Week. Rush Limbaugh won author of the year for ""Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims: Time-Travel Adventures with Exceptional Americans,"" while Grace Lee won illustrator of the year for ""Sofia the First: The Floating Palace."" These are the only awards chosen by children and teens in support of their favorite books, according to the Children's Book Council. Each year, about 13,000 children across the United States read newly published children and young adult books within their classes through the International Reading Association, in partnership with the Children's Book Council. Kids voted for their favorites online with the help of their parents and teachers, or educators submitted group ballots after polling their students. The teen finalists were chosen through a joint program with Teenreads.com, part of The Book Report Network. The top author and illustrator finalists were determined by the bestseller lists. Voters were also allowed to write in finalists that weren't listed. The Children's Book Council's vetting process ensures that voting is done by children and teens, or submitted from classroom ballot boxes, they said. ""The idea was born out of the understanding that when kids are given a voice and agency in their reading choices, they tend to be a lot more excited about reading,"" said Nicole Deming of the Children's Book Council. ""It's so important to get those gateway titles to them that will lead them to a lifelong investment in the written word."" Founded by the Children's Book Council and in support of the nonprofit Every Child a Reader, the event was hosted by Kate DiCamillo, author of ""Flora and Ulysses: The Illuminated Adventures"" and National Ambassador for Young People's Literature.

"With a long-held ethos of non-interference in other countries' affairs, risk-averse China is perhaps an unlikely ally in President Barack Obama's pledge to ""degrade"" and ""destroy"" ISIS in Iraq and Syria. But with Beijing's growing unease about terrorist threats by Islamist extremists at home, analysts say China -- a U.N. Security Council permanent member - is unlikely to oppose plans to build a ""broad coalition"" to go after ISIS. ""I think China in principle will quietly support this idea to curb ISIS,"" says Chen Dingding, an assistant professor of government at the University of Macau. ""ISIS has openly listed China as a major threat to them and if they gain more influence, it's likely they will target Xinjiang and even other parts of China,"" he added. Earlier this month, Iraqi news reports showed pictures of what they said was a captured Chinese national fighting for ISIS. China's foreign ministry said it could not confirm the reports. Many domestic observers assumed the man was Uyghur, a mainly Muslim minority group that lives in Xinjiang, an ethnically divided region in China's north west. It remains unclear whether the captured man was actually Uyghur, but Xie Tao, a professor of political science at Beijing Foreign Studies University, says that there is ""deep concern"" among security analysts and commentators. ""If these groups have cells in Xinjiang, if it can be confirmed that ISIS members were recruited from China, if we are already becoming a ground for recruitment for these people then China has a stake in keeping ISIS away from its borders,"" said Xie. While China, along with Russia, has blocked U.N. Security Council action on Syria during the three-year civil war, both Chen and Xie said that China would likely support a generic resolution that condemns terrorist atrocities and authorizes an international force to target ISIS. ""This is not going to be a resolution that China will veto. This is not about sovereignty or (Syrian President) Assad,"" said Xie. In response to a reporter's question on whether China would join U.S. efforts to combat terrorism, Hua Chunying, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, said that China hoped that ""with joint efforts of the international community, the countries involved will soon restore stability and order, achieve reconciliation, peace and development."" ""Abiding by the principles of mutual respect and equal cooperation, China is willing to enhance anti-terrorism communication and cooperation with the international community so as to safeguard international security and stability,"" she added. Criticism . The United States has been critical of China's reluctance to get involved in international security issues given its expanding global interests. In August, Obama called China a ""free rider"" for its reluctance to contribute to international security while importing oil and other resources from places like Iraq. China has sent a special envoy to the Middle East to help facilitate dialogue between Israel and Palestine but changes to its traditional non-interventionist foreign policy have been limited in scale. Last week, National Security Adviser Susan Rice made her first visit to China, reportedly conveying hopes that China might join an international coalition to collectively combat terrorism. But its support is likely to symbolic rather than substantive, says Xie with scant chance of Chinese combat troops on the ground. ""We're not really ready to take that leap.""","China has a long-held policy of non-interference in other countries affairs .

"North Korea will pay a fine of more than half a million dollars next week for the release of a ship that last year tried to cross the Panama Canal with weapons smuggled aboard, Panamanian authorities said. Panama stopped the North Korean cargo ship, the Chong Chon Gang, in July and found undeclared weaponry from Cuba -- including MiG fighter jets, anti-aircraft systems and explosives -- buried under thousands of bags of sugar. The Cuban government said the shipment consisted of ""obsolete"" weapons being sent to North Korea for repairs before being returned to Cuba. But Panama said they violated United Nations arms sanctions on North Korea. Panamanian authorities had originally imposed a $1 million fine on North Korea over the shipment, which they said violated the security of the canal, a key waterway linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. That fine has now been reduced by a third to $666,666, and the North Korean government has pledged to pay it next week, Panama's Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday. Panamanian Foreign Minister Fernando Nunez Fabrega said 32 of the ship's 35 detained crew members would also be allowed to leave the country. The three remaining crew members face charges of threatening collective security, he said. Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons.","Panama says it found fighter jets, explosives aboard North Korean ship last year .

"A month after Panamanian authorities intercepted a North Korean ship with military equipment hidden on board, U.N. inspectors were ready to take a look. The inspectors, who arrived at Panama's Manzanillo port early Tuesday, came at the request of the Panamanian government. The ship set sail from Cuba, and the Cubans have admitted owning the military equipment it carries, claiming it was being sent to North Korea to be repaired and returned. Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons. For this reason, the Panamanian government invited the inspectors and said it would let the United Nations decide how to respond to the incident. Panama's Security Ministry said that the U.N. inspectors would not make any public comments before or during their inspection. A report will be issued at a later date. The inspection is expected to conclude next Friday. The ship was intercepted on July 15, and authorities met with resistance from the crew. The crew members even cut cables to cranes that slowed the process of searching the ship. The ship's captain attempted to commit suicide during the search. The equipment, manufactured in the mid-20th century, included two anti-aircraft missile systems, nine missiles in parts and spares, two MiG-21 jets and 15 motors for this type of airplane, the Cuban Foreign Ministry said. The captain and 35 North Korean crew members are charged with illegal possession of weapons and international arms trafficking, Panamanian officials said.","U.N. personnel will inspect the military equipment carried by a North Korean ship .

"""The letter stated that, as I ran through the tunnel, they were going to throw acid in my face. I was petrified and I probably never moved so much and so fast on a soccer field in my life."" Clyde Best is one of football's pioneers -- the first black player of the modern era to establish himself in England's top division. The reaction he faced from fans on the terraces more than 40 years ago was extreme, mirroring the strong resistance to immigrants landing on Britain's shores back then. Recent incidents have shown that racism is still a big problem in these more multicultural times. World football's president, Sepp Blatter, infamously claimed last year that racism is not an issue on the pitch, but he has been proved sadly wrong. England, in particular, is dealing with the fallout of two high-profile player on player controversies. Fans, meanwhile, have been arrested for racially abusing players at stadiums and on the Internet. Racial tension started growing in the UK after World War Two, when immigrants began pouring into the country from the British Empire's colonies around the world -- notably the West Indies. The number of non-whites in England climbed from just a few thousand in 1945 to about 1.45 million in 1970. Just two years before that, Conservative politician Enoch Powell warned of ""rivers of blood"" because of increasing immigration. Also in 1968, Best arrived from his native Bermuda to play for London club West Ham United. ""People weren't used to seeing people of color on the field in those days. I was always taught that you're not playing for yourself, you're playing for the people who are coming behind you, and that's what kept me going,"" Best told CNN. ""There were certain things that were said and done, but you've got to put them in them in the back of your mind and be strong and do what you have to do."" Defining a country . Best's persistence in coping with the hate mail and the fan abuse -- some of it from his own club's supporters -- helped paved the way for Viv Anderson, England's first black international. Back in the 1920s, London-born Jack Leslie was denied the chance to represent his country due to his Jamaican parentage. At the time English football was very much a sport for the working class, largely played by the working class, and had been since the sport's founding days in the 1860s. ""As the game became more popular it was the beginning of the industrial revolution in England,"" says English players' union chief executive Gordon Taylor. ""Workers were attracted to the big cities and as a result all of the heavy industries, with steel and ship building and coal mining for example. Workers had their Saturday afternoons off and it became their recreation."" Making history . On November 29, 1978, Nottingham-born Anderson stepped onto the hallowed turf of England's national stadium, Wembley, to represent his country against the former Czechoslovakia -- which, like its Eastern European neighbors, has also had problems with racist factions at football matches. The England manager was Ron Greenwood, who also brought Best to West Ham. ""To play for your country and for 100,000 people at home against the Czechs, who had a good reputation then, you don't want to let yourself down, let your parents down, let the people you know down,"" Anderson said. ""The black thing never came into my head one bit. It was about being a professional footballer."" Anderson won the European Cup twice with Nottingham Forest, but it was three men at another club, West Bromwich Albion, who really pushed black players into the spotlight in England. Raising the bar . Cyrille Regis, Brendon Batson and Laurie Cunningham were dubbed the ""Three Degrees"" by their manager Ron Atkinson after a visit to the club's ground by the U.S. female vocal group. ""To see three black players on one team was very radical,"" Regis recalls. ""West Brom fans were fantastic. They took to us fantastically, supported us, appreciated us. At the end of the day they want anybody out there to play football and to play football well."" Batson notes that Powell's political constituency was Wolverhampton and he delivered his infamous speech in Birmingham -- both cities being near neighbors to the trio's adopted Midlands town. ""People said to me that as black players come to the fore in the early '70s, that was almost an opportunity for those racist groups -- the BNP, the National Front -- to come out and vent their fury at black players,"" he told CNN. ""The football authorities did nothing about it, so for the black players coming through and particularly when I was at West Brom, we would seem to get the brunt of it because there were three of us and the volume was quite astonishing at times. ""It wasn't pleasant. What it did to you was almost galvanize us, to say, 'This is our profession, this is our career. We're not going to be driven away so we'll see you next week, next month, next year,' and that's it, we get on with it."" Targeting the trouble-makers . British hooliganism reached arguably its worst levels in 1985 with the Heysel Stadium disaster, which left 39 Juventus fans dead after fighting broke out before the European Cup final against Liverpool. English clubs were banned from European competition for five years. That heralded a major government crackdown on football violence, and subsequent laws have made racist behavior illegal at matches. ""The game was in danger of being written off,"" PFA chief Taylor says. ""The prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was thinking of insisting that people needed an ID card to even go to a game. That's how serious it was."" This season a Liverpool fan was arrested for racially abusing an opposing team's player in an FA Cup match, and clubs have resorted to increasingly sophisticated security measures to catch offenders. Trial by technology . With closed-circuit television footage and stewards wearing head-mounted cameras, it is now much more difficult for spectators to misbehave at games. ""They get football banning orders which are draconian, but they have a very strong effect,"" says Chris Baker, safety officer at second division club Brighton. ""A person could be banned for three years from entering any Football League ground, they also have to hand in their passport, they're not allowed to travel on the rail network when certain teams are playing, they're not allowed to travel out of the country when England is playing. ""It's a very strict measure, but it is spelling out to these people that it isn't tolerated by anyone in football. We have 75 cameras based around the ground and should any racist abuse be reported to us we could very quickly potentially get one, two, maybe three cameras onto an area."" The way ahead . England's Premier League is now one of the most multicultural divisions in the world, attracting players from far and wide. But while many people believe that the situation -- in England at least -- has improved, campaigners such as ant-racism Kick It Out group say there is still a lot of work to be done. ""We want football in this country to be played, managed, administered and watched by the cross section of England,"" says Kick it Out's Danny Lynch. ""We don't have that. We've got no openly gay players, we've got two black managers from 92 clubs (now three following the appointment this week of Keith Curle at lower league Notts County), very few Asian players and a lack of women at boardroom levels. ""So there's an imbalance there and I think the work we do with all of the clubs and all of the agencies is try to address that in some way."" Remembering what's most important . Liverpool's Luis Suarez has already served an eight-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra last October, while Chelsea's John Terry has been stripped of the England captaincy ahead of a July court case in which he faces charges of similarly denigrating a black opponent. Best, for one, hopes that the world's most popular sport can focus on living up to its name -- ""the beautiful game."" ""I think the most important thing to remember about soccer, with all of the foolishness that is going on with the racism and stuff like that, the minute a goal is scored, I can be as black as the ace of spades or I can be as white as a snow flake ... the minute a goal is scored, everybody hugs one another. ""The most important thing to remember is that the ball doesn't care what color you are.""","CNN investigates the problem of racism in soccer in a new documentary .

"Cuban weapons found in July aboard a North Korean ship trying to cross the Panama Canal violated United Nations weapons sanctions, Panamanian officials said, citing an unpublished U.N. report on the incident. Cuban officials said Thursday that they had no comment on the Panamanian allegations. In July, Cuba's foreign ministry issued a statement that said the undeclared shipment discovered aboard the ship consisted of obsolete weapons being sent to North Korea for repairs before being returned to Cuba. But Panamanian officials have said that under 10,000 tons of Cuban sugar, they found operational weaponry, including MiG fighter jets, anti-aircraft systems and explosives. ""The Cuban weapons on the North Korean ship undeniably violated the U.N. weapons embargo,"" said a statement issued Wednesday by Panama's Ministry of Public Security, citing a preliminary report by U.N. weapons inspectors who inspected the ship. Despite Cuba's assertions that the weapons were being sent for repairs, the shipment may have been intended to bolster North Korea's own defenses. ""North Korea is very interested in maintaining its MiG-21 fleet,"" said James Hardy, Asia-Pacific editor for Jane's Defence Weekly. ""It may be a 50-year-old plane, but it's very fast and capable in a dogfight."" Still, Hardy said, if the shipment was part of an illegal arms deal, it remains to be seen what further sanctions Cuba or North Korea could face. ""The U.N. sanctions are very strict,"" he said. ""But the consequences are not clear."" While authorities have not said what will become of the Cuban weapons, the North Korean crew may finally be heading home. Panamanian authorities met Wednesday with North Korean diplomats and said they agreed to begin the process of repatriating the 35-member North Korean crew, who have been held in Panama after initially trying to prevent authorities from searching the ship. That ship, the Chong Chon Gang, could also be returned to North Korea after repairs are made. According to the Panamanian statement, the crew rendered the ship inoperable during the struggle to keep customs authorities from boarding it. Although secret shipments of arms between North Korea and Cuba were not previously well-known, they apparently have taken place for decades. In July, former President Fidel Castro wrote that in the 1980s, North Korea sent Cuba 100,000 AK-47 rifles after the Soviet Union denied the island military aid that could be used to repel a feared U.S. invasion. ""They did not charge us a cent,"" Castro wrote of the North Korean shipments.","Panama says it found fighter jets, explosives aboard North Korean ship in July .

"China will have a major leadership change soon when the current leaders, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, bow out. In the post-Mao era, Chinese leadership change and power transition have become institutionalized and more predictable. That's until the somewhat unexpected Bo Xilai affair. Although the sacking of the Chongqing leader -- in the wake of a murder investigation that implicated him and his wife -- revealed the startling degree of widespread corruption and abuse of power among high-ranking leaders, it also exposed the intense struggle among various ideologies of China's leaders and intellectual elites. This is somewhat unprecedented.  After three decades of reforms, China's social economic landscape has been transformed. Short-term and long-term problems and challenges abound. While addressing such problems as inflation, the asset bubble, corruption and increasingly daring expressions of public discontent, China's leaders and intellectual elites are also searching for long-term legitimacy. The challenge has become more pressing, as Chinese society gets wealthier and more restless after three decades of rapid economic and social change. China is in urgent need of a soul, a set of dominant ideas, as the efficacy of the Chinese Communist Party's official ideology -- emphasizing ""harmonious society"" and ""scientific development"" -- diminishes. Despite the Party's calls to ""speak with one voice,"" dissenting ideas and differences are being voiced and heard. Unlike the simple dichotomy of reformers and conservatives during the 1980s and early 1990s, today's sets of views on China's problems and its future have become more sophisticated and complex. The increasingly intense debate now appears to have three strands: the neoliberal reformers who seek to liberalize the economic and political arenas and reverse the recent expansion of the state; the neo-Maoists who argue for strengthening the state and breaking what they see as a ""state capitalist"" alliance between the rich and the powerful; and the neo-Confucian traditionalists who bemoan the loss of a moral compass in a modernizing society and want to rekindle China's soft power in the world. Dominating the debates and ideological clashes are the neoliberals and the neo-Maoists who occupy the leadership, while neo-Confucians, popular as they may be among some common folk and patriotic youths, have yet to find their strong advocates among top leaders. Why you can't expect easy answers with new leadership . In a symbolic example of neo-Confucians' inability to gain ground, a giant Confucius statue was removed last year some 100 days after it was unveiled in front of the newly reopened National Museum of China in Tiananmen Square. The statue's appearance in such a prominent location caused an uproar among neoliberals, neo-Maoists and the intellectual elite. In the competition for dominant ideas, Confucius -- whose school of thought has been touted as a call for Pax Cina (""Chinese peace"") -- lost in the gigantic square that is bookended by Mao's iconic portrait and his mausoleum. (The statue now resides in the museum's sculpture garden, ostensibly for esthetic reconsiderations.) The implications of this ideological debate are enormous and will likely determine the future of China. The neo-liberals hold the free market and democracy to be universally applicable and deny the uniqueness of the Chinese experience. Their power base is Guangdong Province, where market reforms first served as a pilot test for the nation three decades ago. The provincial Party Secretary, Wang Yang, tipped for promotion to the Politburo Standing Committee, is widely regarded as a daring leader, willing to promote changes based on the market and open society principles. Pursuing the notion of ""fairness and justice,"" officials like Wang have won the backing of Beijing for emphasizing opportunities for the weak and underprivileged. Unlike leaders like Bo Xilai who used iron-fisted measures when dealing with social discontent, Wang has a reputation for listening to netizens, including their criticisms of the government. It is not surprising that some of the most liberal news media are based in his province. On the other hand, Bo, who had been a contender for the Standing Committee until his downfall, had been known for advocating Maoist tactics, including mass rallies and anticrime campaigns to counter problems like organized crime and corruption. His programs provided neo-Maoists, who oppose ""westernization"" and are critical of state-capitalist market reforms, with a rallying call for ""common wealth and equality"" at a time China is facing a widening wealth gap. In a subtle rejection of the ""fairness and justice"" advocated by neoliberals, the neo-Maoists see the state as a beneficial force and the market as an evil one. To them, China is unique and cannot be remade into the West; they reject the idea of a universal model of development.  Bo's ""Chongqing experiment"" provided China's neo-Maoists with a set of ideas that could compete against the neoliberals' advocacy of the market and democracy. Charming and media savvy, Bo had populist appeal that garnered local support, but a seeming return to the ""redness"" of the Maoist era caused a certain unease among Party officials, particularly liberal-bent elders. His downfall has put neo-Maoists on the retreat, but there are signs they are ready to become vocal, as the new leaders take over. Read about Bo being under criminal investigation . Behind the façade of unity that the Party has emphasized is a struggle not just for leadership positions but of ideas. This struggle will affect major policy decision making, including political reforms. It is still too early to predict who will get into the top governing body of the Communist Party. But ideological orientation will surely be one of the considerations in the jockeying for power. As Hu's 10-year term comes to an end, his cautious and above-the-fray approach to economic reforms and ideological debates may have come to an end as well. The question is, will any of these disparate sets of ideas be accepted by Hu's expected successor as Party chief, Xi Jinping? His ideological orientations remain unclear, and he may not have an easy time walking a middle path and continuing a mishmash ""mainstream"" ideology by not choosing sides. How he and other key leaders take up stands in this struggle for ideological dominance will be immensely important for China and its direction in the next decade.","Despite Party's calls to ""speak with one voice,"" dissenting ideas, differences being voiced .

"Haifaa Al Mansour has just directed one of the first feature films ever to be made in Saudi Arabia. But she won't be able to watch it at her local theater, because cinemas are banned in the kingdom. The film, called ""Wadjda,"" after its protagonist, is billed as the first to be filmed entirely in Saudi Arabia with an all-Saudi cast. It is currently in post-production and being touted for worldwide sales at the Cannes Film Festival. Al Mansour, 39, worked for an oil company until the age of 30, when she decided to give up her job to pursue her passion. ""When I turned 30, I really wanted to have a voice,"" said Al Mansour. ""People don't listen to women in Saudi, they just jump to the next man to speak. I loved films and just decided to become a filmmaker."" She studied film in Sydney, Australia, and has previously made three short films and a documentary. She is Saudi Arabia's first female film director, according to the production company. The film, written and directed by Al Mansour, tells the story of an 11-year-old girl growing up in traditional society in the suburbs of Riyadh and desperate for a bicycle, which she's not allowed. ""I have a niece, she is very bright and always wanted to do things, but her family is traditional and as she grew older wanted her to stay at home like everyone else,"" said Al Mansour. ""I based the story around her. ""Outdoor activities like riding a bicycle are not allowed for girls. It's not exactly against the law, but she would get into trouble."" Al Mansour hopes that Wadjda will help to change attitudes to both women and films in Saudi Arabia. ""I hope it will inspire many girls in Saudi to become filmmakers,"" she said. ""That makes me very proud. ""People have contacted me with death threats, but that doesn't matter to me. Everyone in the media business in Saudi receives death threats."" Also on Inside the Middle East: Saudi women: Pampered or oppressed? Al Mansour, a mother of two young children, was helped to achieve her dreams by her liberal upbringing. She said: ""My parents both come from provincial small towns, but they always believed in allowing their daughters to do what they wanted. There's a lot of pressure on fathers to stop their daughters doing things, but my father never listened to it."" It took Al Mansour three years to get the right backing for her film. It is a Saudi/German co-production, produced by the Berlin-based Razor Film Produktions with backing and support from Rotana Studios, launched by the Saudi Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal. Al Mansour was keen to work with a European production company to ensure the film would be seen worldwide. Ironically, it is unlikely to be seen in Saudi Arabia until its later television release. ""If people from Saudi want to see it in a theater, they will have to travel to Bahrain,"" said Al Mansour. ""It's sad they will have to travel abroad to watch a film that was shot and produced here."" While she is in Saudi, Al Mansour only watches movies rented from a DVD shop. She has to send her driver to the shop with a list of the titles she wants, because women are not allowed inside. She said: ""It never put me off watching films, but it made me want to show they can't treat us like that."" Al Mansour said she faced multiple challenges both casting and shooting in a country with such conservative attitudes. ""Casting a woman in Saudi is almost impossible. It's difficult to find women who are willing to challenge the norms and appear on camera,"" she said. Also on Inside the Middle East: Movie star convicted of 'insulting Islam' Eventually one of Saudi Arabia's best known television actresses, Reem Abdulla, was chosen for the adult lead role, and at the last minute a young girl was found to play Wadjda. ""Casting the girl took a long time,"" said Al Mansour. ""We couldn't advertise for auditions, so it had to be through word of mouth. We looked everywhere around the country and it wasn't until one week before filming that we found the right girl."" During filming too, the mixed Saudi and German crew faced resistance. ""Saudi is not the easiest place to work: in a lot of the locations people were hostile because people see the camera as something corrupt,"" said Al Mansour. ""We filmed in some conservative neighborhoods where people were angry that there was a camera."" Al Mansour said she is a judge in the Saudi Film Festival currently being held by Rotana Studios, but that the films are being shown on television because they are not allowed in movie theaters. Two years ago, the planned Jeddah Film Festival was canceled at the last minute on instructions from the interior ministry, according to Reuters. The involvement of Prince Al Waleed Bin Talal, described by Forbes as Saudi Arabia's richest capitalist and a nephew of King Abdullah, in Rotana Studios is seen as a sign that cinema will eventually become more widely acceptable in the kingdom. In 2006, Rotana produced a film called Keif al-Hal, then billed as the first Saudi Arabian feature film. However, it was actually filmed in Dubai. Al Manour said: ""It's good to have people like Rotana who are progressive and willing to push for it."" She added: ""There are a lot of kids who want to make films. There's a whole generation using cameras and mobile phones and they are not cut off from the world around them. ""Once films become a reality, movie theaters will become a reality.""

"(CNN)The Holy Land makes for inspiring, fascinating, confusing travel. To some, the chunk of territory between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is all Israel. To others, it's all Palestine. For most -- as is true so often in this region of shifting truths and manipulated historical narratives -- it's a bit of both. More on CNN: Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown Season 2 . 1. For beaches, it's Red, Med or Dead . Israel is hemmed in by sea. Eilat has snorkeling and beach activities on the Red Sea side. Rosh HaNikra has stunning cliffs on the Mediterranean Sea side. At the Dead Sea you can float away at Ein Bokek, where the salty waters of this inland lake effortlessly support your body. 2. Identity is complicated . Onlookers frequently cast the conflict here as simply between Jews and Arabs. Axe-grinders on both sides like to evoke an enduring death-struggle between Muslims and Jews. But for long stretches of history, no such struggle existed. In truth, the problems of the last century or so are both religious and political -- and it's worthwhile knowing who's who. Most Israelis (a political identity) are Jewish (a religious identity) -- and most take pride in their country's ethnic diversity. European Jews, Russian Jews, African Jews, American Jews, Arab Jews and many others mix more or less freely. There's a reason for that. If you can satisfy Israel's religious establishment that you're Jewish -- according to complicated rules of birth, ancestry or conversion -- you instantly become entitled to Israeli citizenship and state benefits. Palestinians (a political identity) -- most of whom are Arab (a cultural identity) -- are chiefly Muslim, but there are substantial minorities of Palestinian Christians and others. 3. The security barrier is worth seeing . Take a walking tour of East Jerusalem, such as those run by Green Olive Tours, or a pilgrimage to the Palestinian city of Bethlehem -- where Jesus was born -- and you'll run into Israel's infamous security barrier. Israel built this barrier to keep suicide bombers from getting to Israel. It's eight meters (26 feet) high in places and includes concrete barricades, gates, barbed wire and patrol roads. While it has reduced the number of bombing attempts, it has also kept Palestinians from moving freely between the West Bank and Israel proper. Most of the barrier runs inside West Bank territory, rather than on the boundary line. This fact prompted the International Court of Justice to rule that the construction of the barrier violated international law. With its armed guards, watchtowers and fortified gateways, for travelers it can be a stark symbol of Israel's military control over the territory. 4. Eco travelers will love the desert . Vast, scorching desert fills Israel's southern third -- known as the Negev in Hebrew or Naqab in Arabic. Despite the camels and the tents, few of the Negev's hippyish ecotours have much to do with some of the oldest inhabitants of this desert. Bedouin Hospitality -- a social enterprise founded by civil rights activists -- offers a chance to hear Bedouin stories in person, hosted among Bedouin tribes. 5. Jerusalem resonates with religious meaning . Few people forget their first visit to the Old City at Jerusalem's core, still encircled by the crenelated walls built by the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent in 1538. Within this tiny area, roughly one square kilometer, the Via Dolorosa -- walked by Jesus -- leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Christian tradition says Jesus was crucified and buried. Steps away, Jews pray at the Western Wall, the last structure remaining from the Jewish Temple, destroyed by the Romans. Nearby, the Al-aqsa mosque, mentioned in the Quran, stands alongside the golden Dome of the Rock shrine commemorating the Prophet Muhammad's mystical Night Journey. Al-aqsa and the Dome of the Rock stand on a hill known as the Noble Sanctuary, or the Temple Mount, considered holy by Muslims, Jews and Christians as the place where Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son. In terms of religious significance, that's quite a plateful. And among the holy sites, daily life roars on: souks crowd the narrow, stone-flagged alleyways, children go to school, libraries jostle with restaurants. Also on CNN: 10 of Israel's best museums . 6. Jerusalem has its own syndrome . For some, the city can be too much. Around 100 tourists each year succumb to Jerusalem Syndrome, a psychiatric condition linked to the city's atmosphere of intensity. Sufferers typically show signs of prolonged agitation and religious fervor, spending days -- often dressed in white robes (typically a hotel bed sheet) -- declaiming religious verses or preaching public sermons on moral purity. Most recover. 7. Tel Aviv feels like its own country . An hour away from Jerusalem, over on the coast, secular-minded Tel Aviv swings along amid beach parties, designer brands and hipster attitudes. During the Jewish Shabbat -- the day of rest, which runs from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset -- western Jerusalem remains quiet in prayerful contemplation, but Tel Aviv lives the high life, with seaside promenades, crowded stores and lounge bars packed. This hedonistic city, gazing west into the Mediterranean sunset, has also carved out a new identity as a gay capital, offering a uniquely accommodating welcome to LGBT visitors and residents. In a country where the Jewish religious establishment generally calls the shots, Tel Aviv embodies a bubble of liberality and easygoing apathy. 8. Countryside walks are fantastic . The West Bank is crisscrossed by walking trails. Many are devoted to nature, some -- such as Birzeit's Sufi Trails -- to culture. One of the best is the Abraham Path, linking the Palestinian cities of Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron in a two-week trek. It's also manageable in shorter day-stages, with overnight stops at homestays and rural guesthouses. Israelis have a long tradition of nature tourism, centered on national parks, wildlife reserves and forest walks, including the stunning Jesus Trail, which coils through the hills above the sparkling Sea of Galilee. Visitors can plug into Israel's network of ""zimmers"" -- rural B&Bs ranging from farm stays to exclusive country retreats. 9. When you visit Israel, you're also visiting biblical Palestine . When you visit as a tourist, you're visiting two distinct places. See only one, and you see only part of the whole picture. The sovereign state of Israel came into being -- apologies for the euphemism, and for glossing over the previous few millennia of history -- in 1948, on a sliver of land along the Mediterranean coast, in the northern hills and the southern deserts, adding the western districts of Jerusalem after an initial outbreak of fighting with its Arab neighbors. This is where Israeli culture and the Hebrew language thrive. The eastern parts of Jerusalem (including the ancient walled Old City), plus the kidney-shaped piece of West Bank that surrounds Jerusalem on three sides, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights did not form part of the modern state of Israel at its creation in 1948, but they came under Israel's control during the 1967 war. Since then, Israel has effectively annexed East Jerusalem, putting it and other adjacent areas in the West Bank under full Israeli government control, while greatly expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank. At the same time, it unilaterally pulled its military and settlers out of Gaza, but has maintained control over the area's borders (with the exception of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt). The international community deems Israel's presence in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as an illegal occupation. These areas are where Palestinian culture and the Arabic language are strongest. A Palestinian state, should one ever materialize alongside Israel, is likely to be centered on that kidney-shaped territory, known to most of the world as the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip along the Mediterranean. Pockets of Israeli culture thrive across the West Bank in ""settlements"" -- Jewish-only townships whose presence is widely seen as contravening international law. And pockets of Palestinian culture remain strong across Israel, from the urban clamor of Jaffa and Haifa to rural hamlets in the countryside and desert. 10. It's prickly outside, but sweet inside . Sabra is the Hebrew word for cactus fruit -- prickly on the outside, sweet in the middle. It's also how native-born Israelis proudly describe themselves. The metaphor is apt. Social graces aren't high on Israel's list of priorities, and service in shops and restaurants can be brusque. But if you peel away the prickly exterior, there's generally warmth and affability beneath. Maybe even a smile. Intriguingly, the same word in Arabic, saber, connotes patience and tenacity. Tough hedges of cactus are still used to mark land boundaries across the West Bank, and the idea is linked to a key concept in Palestinian self-identity -- sumud, meaning steadfastness or quiet resolve. One plant, two people, three interpretations. So typical. Editor's note: This story has been revised to fix some inaccuracies. Freelancer Matthew Teller contributed to this story.

"It's been a cruel irony for ancient mariners and any thirsty person who has ever gazed upon a sparkling blue ocean: Water, water everywhere, and not a drop to drink. But imagine a coastal city of the future, say in 2035. Along with basic infrastructure such as a port, roads, sewer lines and an electrical grid, it's increasingly likely this city by the sea will contain a newer feature. A desalination plant. Thanks to improved technology, turning ocean water into freshwater is becoming more economically feasible. And a looming global water crisis may make it crucial to the planet's future. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, two-thirds of the world's population will suffer water shortages, especially in the developing world and the parched Middle East. Scientists say climate change is making the problem worse. Even in the United States, demand for water in drought-ravaged California and the desert Southwest is outpacing supply. This is why a huge desalination plant is under construction in Carlsbad, California, some 30 miles north of San Diego. When completed in 2016, it will be the largest such facility in the Western Hemisphere and create 50 million gallons of freshwater a day. ""Whenever a drought exacerbates freshwater supplies in California, people tend to look toward the ocean for an answer,"" said Jennifer Bowles, executive director of the California-based Water Education Foundation. ""It is, after all, a seemingly inexhaustible supply."" A growing trend . Most desalination technology follows one of two methods: distillation through thermal energy or the use of membranes to filter salt from water. In the distillation process, saltwater is heated to produce water vapor, which is then condensed and collected as freshwater. The other method employs reverse osmosis to pump seawater through semi-permeable membranes -- paper-like filters with microscopic holes -- that trap the salt while allowing freshwater molecules to pass through. The remaining salty water is then pumped back into the ocean. Officials at the Carlsbad plant say they can covert two gallons of seawater into one gallon of freshwater by filtering out 99.9% of the salt. There are some 16,000 desalination plants on the planet, and their numbers are rising. The amount of desalted water produced around the world has more than tripled since 2000, according to the Center for Inland Desalination Systems at the University of Texas at El Paso. ""Desalination is growing in arid regions,"" said Tom Davis, director of the center. ""We are making progress in the USA, but the countries around the Persian Gulf are way ahead in the use of desalination, primarily because they have no alternative supplies of freshwater."" Israel, in an arid region with a coastline on the Mediterranean, meets half its freshwater needs through desalination. Australia, Algeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also rely heavily on the ocean for their municipal water. In the United States, desalination projects are concentrated in coastal states such as California, Florida and Texas. Some environmentalists are wary of desalination, which consumes large amounts of energy, produces greenhouse gases and kills vital marine organisms that are sucked into intake pipes. But proponents believe the technology offers a long-term, sustainable solution to the globe's water shortages. One entrepreneur has even built an experimental solar desalination plant in California's San Joaquin Valley. ""When other freshwater sources are depleted, desalination will be our best choice,"" said Davis, a UTEP professor of engineering. California dreaming . Within the United States, the water crisis is especially severe in California, which has been stricken by drought over the last three years. California's biggest source of freshwater is the snow that falls in the Sierras and other mountains, where it slowly melts into creeks and makes its way into aquifers and reservoirs. But if the planet continues to grow warmer, snow will increasingly fall as rain and will be harder to collect because it will swell creeks faster and create more flooding, said Bowles of the Water Education Foundation. Seventeen desalination plants are being built or planned along the state's 840-mile coastline. City officials in Santa Barbara recently voted to reactivate their desalination plant, which was built in 1991 but shut after heavy rains filled nearby reservoirs in the early 1990s. Another $200 million facility has been proposed for the Bay Area, although construction won't likely begin for several years. ""The key question with ocean desalination is how much are you willing to pay for it? The amount of energy required to desalt ocean water can be daunting,"" said Bowles, adding that operating costs at the Santa Barbara plant alone are estimated at $5 million per year. But advocates believe the price of desalination will continue to decrease as the process improves. This will be true of the massive Carlsbad plant, said Bob Yamada, water resources manager with the San Diego County Water Authority. ""The cost for this water will be about double what it costs us to import water into San Diego,"" Yamada said. ""However, over time we expect that the cost of desalinated water will equal, and be less than, the cost of imported water. That may take 15 or 20 years, but we expect that to occur."" Ultimately, experts say, municipalities will need to balance desalination projects with conservation and water from more traditional sources, such as rivers, reservoirs and recycled wastewater. ""You can't get all your water from one source and have that source be hundreds of miles away,"" said Peter MacLaggan, senior vice president at Poseidon Resources Corporation, which is leading development of the Carlsbad plant. ""When and if the drought does come, and you don't have enough snowpack in the Sierras -- after 12 dry years the Rockies are seeing the impact of that today -- you've got (water) sources here within the boundaries of San Diego County,"" he said. ""We have a $190 billion economy in this region. It's dependent on water to sustain that economy. So the question you need to consider, is 'What's the cost of not having enough water?'"" Drought-ravaged California turns to tech for help .","There are 16,000 desalination plants on the planet, and their numbers are rising .

"The National Football League Players Association is negotiating a deal with the league to award $100 million to Harvard University over 10 years to study and treat players' injuries and illnesses, according to a proposal obtained by CNN. In the last few years, the perception of a typical NFL player has undergone a subtle shift: from lithe titans performing formidable feats on the field to men who may end their careers broken down, their brains addled by a mysterious concussion-related brain disease. But the real picture of the typical NFL player is much more complex, and the health problems run much deeper than concussion. According to the proposal, the funding would be used to ""diagnose, treat and prevent"" players' injuries and illnesses. ""No one has ever studied these players before,"" said Dr. Lee Nadler, dean for clinical and translational research at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the proposed study.  ""There have been postmortem studies looking at the brains of previous players but not the players today."" Nadler said that what distinguishes this study is that it will look at the ""whole player across his whole life, not just the brain."" The NFL said it looked forward to learning more about the study and hopes ""it will play an important role in advancing medical science."" ""We have no higher priority than player health and safety at all levels of the game,"" it said in a statement. Seau had neurodegenerative brain disease, NIH finds . It is not just the brain that may be damaged after a long career on the playing field.  By the end of their careers, NFL players may emerge with all sorts of injuries -- chronic pain, arthritis, joints needing replacement, depression, diabetes, heart problems and concussion-related dementia, among others -- so many they have become a cohort ripe for study. ""Every player understands the risks associated with playing football,"" said Jason Witten, a tight end with the Dallas Cowboys, in a statement.  ""What we're trying to do as players through this research is to find ways to lead healthier lives. It's the most important thing we can do off the field."" The proposed research project will be announced at the NFLPA annual Super Bowl press conference on Thursday in New Orleans.  Members of the NFLPA say the proposed research is unprecedented in both scope and resources, at least as it relates to NFL player health. If the NFLPA successfully forges this agreement with the NFL, the funding would dwarf a $30 million donation made to the National Institutes of Health by the NFL last year. That study has a more specific focus on brain injury. ""We have seen the condition of our players five, 10, 15, 20 years after they play,"" said George Atallah, a spokesman for the NFLPA.  ""Given the scope of health issues that NFL players are subject to, we are committed to making sure that enough money is allocated to get answers."" Atallah added, ""If this was strictly a concussion research program, the right number might not have been $100 million. It would have been much less."" Scan may detect signs of NFL players' brain disease . The Harvard proposal focuses on studying a core group of 100 unhealthy players -- both current and retired -- and 100 healthy players. Those two groups will be drawn from an initial larger study group of 1,000 current and former players from across the United States.  They will have played diverse positions and will have experienced diverse health problems. The initial group of 1,000 will participate in a series of baseline studies including cardiac function, testing for joint abnormalities and psychosocial tests. The players will also submit exhaustive playing and injury histories, spanning their entire football careers. From those preliminary data will emerge the 100 healthiest and least healthy players, who will then continue testing at Harvard over several years.  Nadler said the focus will be on cross-institutional collaboration, with hundreds of scientists at Harvard potentially playing roles in the study. ""When you're talking about NFL players, you're talking about people in the 99.99% of unusual,"" said Nadler.  ""These are superathletes who have skills that very few people have, and when you put them in extremely emotional and physical situations, those psychosocial stresses and physical stresses integrate."" Questions linger about long-term impact of subtle hits to head . How those stresses coalesce and take shape over the course of long careers playing football is what Harvard researchers, and partners from other institutions, will be trying to pinpoint. ""Typically, when we do a test or medical study, we're taking a snapshot,"" said Dr. Herman Taylor, principal investigator of the Jackson Heart Study at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and one of the scientists enlisted from outside Harvard.  ""What we want to do is see the full-length movie of what happens to a player over time. ""How is it that two men that play the same position for the same number of years have vastly different lives after playing? Not everyone suffers from the same types of problems, and not everything can be explained by simple repetitive traumas."" Ideas floated for study include using advanced scanning techniques and genetics to fuel knowledge about who is most at risk for head injury, finding ways to regrow knee ligaments in a lab, identifying injury prevention strategies such as new drugs or new helmets, and addressing ethical issues surrounding player injuries. ""One of the broader aims of the research is conflicts of interest when you have a patient who will do anything to get back on the field and a doctor who works for and is paid by a club,"" said Sean Sansiveri, NFLPA staff counsel. The holistic focus of the research does not obviate the importance of concussion, said Sansiveri.  Work on concussion will be a major focus, ""but there are a lot of unique issues that our guys face within a unique context ... other ailments and diagnoses that are prevalent in the football population."" Funding for the study will come from the players' portion of league revenues, currently being negotiated between the NFL and the Players Association. The exact figure to be allocated for the study is still to be determined, according to Atallah, and most likely will not be finalized until after the Super Bowl. The absence of a finalized plan has not stopped the NFLPA from imagining what a successful study could mean, not just for NFL players but for athletes in other sports. ""If this $100 million of research would have caused a groundbreaking discovery in one critical area of a player's life or health, then we would have succeeded,"" said Atallah.  ""Whether it's an ACL issue or a mental health issue or a concussion issue, if we find one solution to any of those things we're studying, it would have been a success.""

"Off a main street in Kabul, standing outside a high walled compound is an old Afghan security guard, manning the front gate. Walking towards him is a group of well-dressed students in gray and maroon uniforms -- almost looking out of place in this dusty, garbage-littered, rundown city. Inside are large trees surrounding a deep rose-colored two-storey building, and all you can hear is music. This is the Afghanistan National Institute of Music (ANIM), which has been up and running for the past two and a half years. It has 141 students, of whom 41 are girls, and half the placements go to children who are street kids or orphans. Officials believe there are 70,000 street kids in Kabul and as many as 600,000 across the country. Three generations addicted to opium . In one of the dozen practice rooms on the ground floor is 15-year-old Negin Khpalwak. She lost both her parents several years ago and has been living in an orphanage ever since. She is now one of a handful of students learning to play the sarod -- a traditional Indian instrument that is making a revival in Afghanistan thanks to this school. ""Music is very important to me because it's my future. It saved me,"" she said. ""I want to teach other students, especially young girls. I know my country has a lot of problems but I hope for peace so girls in Afghanistan can do what they dream of doing."" Across the hall in another practice room is 16-year-old Wahidullah Amiri. He's playing the piano. With a look of determination and purpose he reads the music, his fingers moving across the keys. Listening to him, you would think this teenager had been playing for most of his life. In fact he'd never touched a piano until two years ago. ""I was working on the street selling plastic bags and chewing gum,"" he said. ""My family is very poor. Now I go to school and study music. Something I never thought I would do."" Skateboard school ramps up Afghan dreams . The man responsible for turning his life around is the founder of ANIM, Ahmad Samarst. The son of a famous Afghan composer, conductor and musician, Samarst wanted to change lives through the power of music. Though he was born and raised in Kabul, he has very close ties to Australia after seeking asylum there when he fled the Taliban. The Islamic militant movement seized power in 1996 following Afghanistan's long civil war. While in Australia, Samarst studied music -- receiving his PhD in music from Monash University in Melbourne. His wife and two children still live there. He returns every three months and will be heading back again at the end of the year for his daughter's wedding. But he says despite his family, his heart is in Afghanistan. When the Taliban fell in 2001 he felt a strong desire to return to his country and rebuild the nation's rich and vibrant musical culture. Under the Taliban it had virtually been wiped out with a nationwide ban. Music was considered blasphemous, musicians were persecuted and if you were caught playing an instrument, the punishment for this ""crime"" was having one of your hands cut off. The Taliban destroyed most instruments during their brutal five-year rule, often using the wood for heating. If the instruments were too big, like a piano, they would blow them up with a grenade so they could carry them out in pieces. A true believer in the healing power of music, Samarst explained his vision for ANIM. ""It was based on the strong belief of the power of music, as a powerful force, which can play a significant role in establishing a civil and just society in post-Taliban Afghanistan."" It took years of planning, lobbying and gathering financial support but finally Samarst had the beginnings of a national music school. After a $2 million donation from the World Bank, Samart was suddenly overwhelmed by international interest and funding from foreign ministries, embassies and music schools from Germany, Finland, Denmark, the United States, Britain and India. Samarst said many of the instruments were donated and described the storage rooms upstairs for these valuable pieces as  ""treasure troves."" He said they would be the ""envy of many music schools around the world."" As part of the program, he has hired nine international music teachers from the U.S., Europe, Mexico and India to not only teach the students but also train local Afghan teachers. William Harvey arrived in Kabul two and a half years ago from New York, feeling compelled to act after the September 11 attacks shook the core of his country. He said he had no idea what sort of adventure he was about to embark upon but felt strongly about helping to mend and rebuild a war-ravaged Afghanistan. He is now the conductor of ANIM's youth orchestra that has just been invited to perform in the U.S. at Washington's Kennedy Center and New York's Carnegie Hall in February next year. ""When the people of the world see there are Afghan girls and boys performing side by side that means to a certain extent that we've won, and that Afghanistan has won, because music is a historical and inalienable part of Afghan culture, and its return is tremendously exciting,"" he said. ANIM works very closely with Afghanistan's Ministry of Education, which is very proud of what the school is achieving. Sarmast believes his greatest achievement is co-education within the school. Boys and girls, side by side, in a country where in some towns, girls still don't have access to an education. The Taliban made it very clear during its rule that no girls were allowed to go to school -- a rule that is still applied in their heartland in southern Afghanistan. But at ANIM young girls smile and laugh with their male classmates, oblivious to the divisions deep with their society. ""This is a revolution for this country,"" he explained. ""These girls are serving as a mother for the entire nation. I'm very pleased our institute is a mother for the country."" One girl who is passionate about education and her country is 10-year-old Sapna Rehamati. Girls don't have to wear headscarves inside the school grounds though Sapna puts one on. But instead of wearing it traditionally over her head and wrapped around her shoulders, she ties it together behind her head, at the nape of her neck. With a mischievous grin she explained, ""This is my style."" Asked about the future of the country, this orphaned girl who wasn't even born when the Taliban fell from power, said emphatically, ""The Taliban is very bad. Every person has the right to learn. Every child, every human being should have the right to study music. Nobody should interfere in their lives."" Sitting next to her friend Azia on the piano stool, Sapna smiled warmly at her as the two girls hit the keys in time, their little fingers creating the nostalgic sounds of a traditional Afghan tune. When asked what she wants to do when she grows up and graduates from the school, she replied: ""I want to build my country and make Afghanistan a great place. If other people want to build our country I want to work beside them.""","Afghanistan National Institute of Music has been running for the past two and a half years .

"(CNN) -- The president of Liberia spoke Friday on the sexual assault of an 8-year-old Liberian refugee in Phoenix, Arizona, decrying reports that the parents believe their family has been shamed by the girl. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf says the girl, her family and the alleged rapists should receive counseling. ""This is not a question of shame on the family. It is the question of an assault on a young child. That cannot be tolerated,"" said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, speaking by telephone. Police have charged four boys, ages 9 to 14, in the case. The boys also are Liberian refugees. ""We are so saddened,"" Sirleaf said. ""We are deeply distressed at this behavior on the part of our young Liberians and very saddened at this 8-year-old child who has been so victimized."" Phoenix police say the boys used an offer of chewing gum to lure the girl to a storage shed at an apartment complex on July 16. There, they allege, the four boys restrained and sexually assaulted her. The 14-year-old was charged as an adult Thursday and will face two counts of sexual assault and one count of kidnapping. The other three boys were charged in juvenile court with sexual assault, and two of them also were charged with kidnapping, Thomas said. Speaking from Liberia, Sirleaf said the family's reaction to the incident is wrong. ""They should help that child who has been traumatized,"" she said. She suggested the family members ""need serious counseling because, clearly, they are doing something that is no longer acceptable in our society here."" She also called upon Phoenix authorities to counsel the alleged attackers. ""They have to pay the penalty, but we also want to make sure that they are counseled ... that they will have an opportunity to change and become useful citizens, not only in the United States but when they return home."" Detectives said the girl was placed in the custody of Phoenix child protective services after the attack because of her parents' attitude toward her. ""The parents felt that they had been shamed or embarrassed by their child,"" Phoenix police Sgt. Andy Hill said Thursday. Tony Weedor -- co-founder of the CenterPoint International Foundation, which aids Liberians in the United States and provides aid for those still in Liberia -- agreed with Hill. He said rape was not against the law in Liberia until 2006. ""The family [believes they] have been shamed by her ... and they're more concerned about that than the crime,"" he said. Sirleaf said the family should not be concerned about that. ""Let me say very clearly that rape is a problem in Liberia also. There is a strong law regarding that,"" she said. Milton Barnes, Liberia's ambassador to the United States, said he also will step in to help the victim. ""Our primary concern is this child,"" he said. ""We intend to work with the authorities and the family to make sure she is safe, protected and there is certain sensitivity exercised towards her."" Edwin Sele, the deputy ambassador, also responded to the incident. ""Having heard the story myself, I'm outraged,"" he said. ""In Liberia, the family and law enforcement officers would be embracing the victim. To hear that the family is not doing that, that should be an isolated case."" Hill said Thursday that protective services officers would ""determine what's going to happen [to the girl] in the days ahead.""","President Sirleaf speaks about Arizona sexual assault of refugee, 8 .

"The Wolf of Wall Street vividly remembers he was so stoned out of his mind at that mahogany-laden restaurant with the imposing edifice, while savoring a bottle of 1945 Chateau Lafite Rothschild, running up a $30,000 tab in one night. After all, it was just dinner. In the 1990s, Jordan Belfort was already the self-proclaimed king of the world, raking in nearly a million dollars a week, all the while fashioning himself an ultra-hip, white Ferrari Testarossa-driving Don Johnson from Miami Vice. Really. And then there were the women. The real 'Wolf of Wall Street' on Leo DiCaprio's portrayal . Throw in a steady stream of salaciousness with stunning strippers and call girls, ungodly quantities of Quaaludes, cocaine and assorted excesses that rivaled Sodom and Gomorrah and you have something close to describing Jordan Belfort's life. Or what was his life. ""Once I scuba dived on four Quaaludes and passed out at the bottom of the ocean, you know, 60 feet under, and somehow made it up alive,"" he recalled in a 2008 interview with a degree of both relish and self-loathing. These days, the hoopla is on land. The three-hour Martin Scorsese-directed epic based on Belfort's life and bestselling book, ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" premieres on December 25. If you are looking for a Christmas morality tale, this isn't it. The real king of the world, Leonardo DiCaprio, portrays Belfort. Photos: Hollywood takes on Wall Street . The film, which also stars Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey, portrays Belfort's world and the people who worked for him in what was a fraudulent stock enterprise. Belfort's then-wife Nadine, who he calls ""The Duchess"" in his book, is played by Margot Robbie. Belfort's millions were based on a huge lie, a massive ""pump and dump"" stock scheme at the firm he started called Stratton Oakmont. It wasn't on Wall Street, but in Lake Success on Long Island. Along the way, it was the firm's outrageous office antics and parties that would cement the legend of Jordan Belfort. In more than 2½ hours of home videos obtained by CNN from a 1991 party in the Hamptons and another on his yacht, Belfort appears downright giddy, reminiscent of one of his favorite movie characters, Gordon Gekko from the film ""Wall Street."" Addressing the throngs of Strattonites at the 1991 party, Belfort declares, ""And I make one more guarantee. Six months from now, what you're doing right now is going to be nothing again. OK, that's the bottom line. The guys who are doing 200, will be doing 400, the guys doing 400 will be doing 600. And they'll still be one guy that is going to break that million dollar for the month."" The real 'Wolf of Wall Street' sounds off on the film . Looking back on those parties, Belfort told us in 2008, ""On Wall Street, it's like boom. You just jump to the top of the heap and it's just mind-boggling, and that's what really turned me on. And then of  course, you know the thousand-dollar suits, the gold watches and the drinking at lunch, and the cocaine at the end of the day. ... It was almost like adult Disneyland for dysfunctional people."" In other words, instant gratification. ""Was sleeping with a hooker about the instant gratification of sex? No. I think for me it was probably more about power. And I think, it's more about status on Wall Street. ... I got very little enjoyment from that whole, you know, prostitution thing."" Greed as Belfort knew it, he says, is not good. ""The greed's good to a point until it reverses on you and makes you into a monster. You know, there were times I look back at the way I acted and some of the things I did -- I was a monster.""","Jordan Belfort was the self-proclaimed 'Wolf of Wall Street'

"(CNN) -- Police have executed a search warrant at the apartment complex where a missing Indiana University student lives, and authorities acknowledged Wednesday that they are becoming increasingly concerned about her safety. ""We believe that the chances are very great that there was foul play"" in the disappearance of 20-year-old Lauren Spierer, Bloomington Police Department Lt. Bill Parker said at a news conference Wednesday morning. Spierer was last seen around 4:30 a.m. Friday walking away from an apartment building at 11th and Morton streets in Bloomington, a few blocks from her home, after going to a bar with friends the night before. An acquaintance saw her walk toward the intersection of 11th Street and College Avenue, but police have said surveillance cameras at the Smallwood Plaza apartment complex, where she lives, do not show her arriving. Parker said officers were looking for copies of security camera footage from that night when they broke through the doors at Smallwood Plaza Tuesday. He did not know why they were initially denied access, but he added that Smallwood personnel have been cooperative since. He explained that they obtained the search warrant because private businesses commonly want official paperwork before turning over evidence, and that was ""perfectly normal."" In a statement provided to Bloomington's Herald-Times newspaper, a representative for the building's management said that nobody with a key was available on-site when police arrived to serve the warrant. According to the statement, ""Smallwood Plaza has and will continue to fully support and cooperate with this police investigation, and respects the decision to obtain these hard drives as quickly as possible."" Parker said police have video of Spierer entering the apartment complex around 2:40 a.m. on Friday with a friend and then exiting 10 minutes later, although she did not go into her own apartment while she was there. They believe she and the friend then walked to the building at 11th and Morton, where other friends live. Authorities are still examining the recordings, but Parker said, ""We did not see indications on that video that she was being forced."" Police have interviewed many people, including Spierer's boyfriend and the friends she went out with the night she disappeared. They are also working on conducting polygraph exams. Investigators have obtained some evidence of value, but Parker would not specify what has been collected. While anyone who was with Spierer on June 3 is considered a person of interest, Parker said, ""We don't have anybody that we can characterize as a suspect."" Police and volunteer searches continued Wednesday. Parker said that a representative from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children will assist in coordinating the searches. ""The entire city has been searched at least once"" at this point, according to Parker, and some areas, particularly those close to Spierer's apartment building, have been looked at multiple times. Police now want to expand the searches beyond the city limits, although they do not have specific information indicating that Spierer was taken out of the city. Spierer's father also spoke at Wednesday's news conference, again thanking the police and volunteers for all of their assistance. ""It's critical that we focus on finding Lauren,"" Robert Spierer said, noting that people from their hometown in Westchester County, New York, and others from around the country have come out to help with the searches. ""It's really hot out there. These people are incredible,"" he said of the volunteers. ROTC members in particular have been searching some difficult terrain, according to Spierer. He again urged anyone with information related to his daughter to contact authorities, insisting that ""nothing is too small, nothing is too insignificant."" Lauren Spierer is described as 4-foot-11 and approximately 95 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. When she disappeared, she was wearing black stretch pants, a tank top, a loose, light-colored shirt and no shoes. Robert Spierer provided two numbers that people can call with tips: the Bloomington Police Department at 812-339-4477 and a tip line set up by America's Most Wanted at 800-CRIME-TV. All information can be provided anonymously.","Authorities becoming increasingly concerned about Lauren Spierer's safety .

"The numbers are arresting. If Americans under correctional supervision counted as a city of their own, they would form the largest city in the United States after New York. The number of people in prison, on parole or on probation, 6.9 million Americans,  exceeds the populations of the second- and third-largest cities, Los Angeles and Chicago, combined. Or the size of the next four -- Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix and San Antonio -- put together. Thirty-eight U.S. states are home to fewer people than live under the corrections system in this country. There are about as many people behind bars as live in Chicago. That's one in every 108  Americans. One in 35 are under some form of correctional supervision. Among African Americans, the numbers are even more horrifying. According to the NAACP,  one in three black males born in the United States today is likely to spend time in prison at some point in his life. That's compared with one in six Hispanic males or one in 25 white males. It would be hard to overstate the scale of this tragedy. For a nation that loves freedom and cherishes our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, the situation should be intolerable. It is destroying lives and communities. Our corrections system is not correcting. Within three years of being released from prison, nearly half of prisoners are convicted of another crime with one out of every four ending up back in prison. When a typical bureaucracy does its job this badly, it wastes money, time and paper. The corrections bureaucracy, in failing to correct the large majority of inmates in its charge, not only wastes money but also wastes lives, families and entire cities. The current system is broken beyond repair. It's a human, social and financial disaster. We need a radical strategy of replacement of these huge bureaucracies that lack any meaningful oversight. A number of states, most recently Mississippi, have already begun to take important first steps by directing nonviolent offenders to community supervision and other forms of correction. These measures keep violent offenders off the streets and lesser offenders out of prison, where too often the only education they receive is how to become a more hardened criminal. In Hawaii, Judge Steven Alm has pioneered a model of probation enforcement that has dramatically reduced violations through consequences that are immediate, predictable and proportionate. New York City created a social impact bond to finance prisoner rehabilitation programs run by a nonprofit organization. They will pay out to investors based on savings from a decline in recidivism. There are no doubt countless similar reforms that would reduce rates of incarceration, and we should pursue them. But it is also time for more fundamental changes. We need to rethink prisons, parole and probation for the 21st century. At a time when high-quality education is increasingly digital and in many cases free, shouldn't we provide opportunities for prisoners to learn skills that will enable them to support themselves as upstanding citizens when they are released? We know that inmates who earn a GED while incarcerated are substantially less likely to return to prison. There are readily available online tools that our prisons could use extensively for a minimal cost to increase the number of inmates receiving valuable education and skills training. Khan Academy has replicated virtually the entire K-12 curriculum online for free. Udacity and other online education sites offer introductions to software programming for free. Our prisons should be using tools such as these extensively. They offer the opportunity to interrupt the cycle of poverty, a failing education system, crime and incarceration. At most prisons, however, inmates would never be allowed to spend eight hours a day working on educational courses and are instead forced to mill about their cells with little or nothing to occupy their time. Of course, there are significant barriers for convicted felons to get jobs even with education programs. But without some training, it's almost impossible for many. And with tight budgets and increasing prison populations, states have already been cutting back on the rehabilitation component. Technology should revolutionize more than just the prisons' rehabilitation programs. It should completely transform the corrections and criminal justice systems. Van is involved in a computer science education initiative for urban youth called #YesWeCode, which in February held a ""hackathon"" with students in Oakland, California. One of the hacks the kids came up with was an app to remind them of their court dates. It's sad, but in an age when the dentist's office calls automatically to remind us of appointments, shouldn't the court system do that as well if it prevents kids from spending time in jail? Similarly, technology should enable much more effective probation and community supervision, especially new options that could allow nonviolent offenders to remain with their families living productive lives under an appropriate level of restriction. Almost any activity to which we might sentence low-level offenders --apprenticeship programs, school, literacy or computer science boot camps, community service -- would be a better use of taxpayer dollars than sticking them idle in prison with hardened criminals. Unfortunately, the current corrections bureaucracy has embraced none of this innovation -- in part because it is captive to the prison guards' unions or the private prison lobby, and in part because it lacks any incentives or sufficient competition based on the right metrics. The incarceration industry has grown into a billion dollar industry, with corrections being among the most expensive budget items in many states, increasingly outpacing what they spend on higher education. Opinion: Justice system is failing young black men . Years ago, Van proposed that states give wardens a financial incentive to cut the rates of recidivism for inmates leaving their prisons. More than 65% of inmates in California return to prison within three years of their release, where they will again cost taxpayers an average of $47,000 each year. Surely it is worth giving wardens a substantial portion of the savings for every inmate that leaves their prison and does not re-offend. Such incentives would spark dramatically more innovation and investment in rehabilitation, job training and job placement programs for prisoners. That would be a revolutionary change from prison administrators' current incentives, which are often to keep as many people in custody as possible. Finally, we need real market competition that rewards success at every step of the process -- in probation and parole offices as well as prisons. That doesn't just mean privatizing prisons or rewarding probation services with the same failed metrics. We need competition of methods and ideas based on the right criteria: When we send prisoners home, do they have the skills to reintegrate in their communities as working, law-abiding citizens? Or do they end up coming back? With more than 2 million of our fellow citizens in prison and millions more in danger of returning, Americans on both the left and the right should be able to agree on the need to replace our broken corrections system and work together to do so. Through Rebuild the Dream's #Cut50 initiative, at CNN's ""Crossfire"" and elsewhere, we will be working together to explore ways to reduce the prison population substantially in the next decade. We should start by opening our prisons and probation offices to innovation to save money, achieve better outcomes for individuals and ensure better safety for us all.","A vast number of Americans are behind bars or under correctional supervision .

"Elliot Rodger left behind a 107,000-word ""story"" of what the shooting suspect called his ""twisted world.""  While he e-mailed it to his parents and a therapist the day he allegedly went on a terror rampage, investigators and journalists soon found it. The central theme of ""My Twisted World: The Story of Elliot Rodger"" is his intractable virginity, which he blamed on ""the cruelness of women."" Here are five revelations from this disturbing document: . 1. 'A bitter form of envy' Elliot Rodger grew up on the edges of Hollywood but was not quite a part of it. His father, Peter Rodger, aspired to make films, but he mostly directed commercials. His mother ""dated George Lucas for a short time"" and was a friend of Steven Spielberg's, he wrote. His stepmother, Soumaya Akaaboune, acted in a few movies and was a regular on the French version of ""Real Housewives,"" produced in Los Angeles. These connections got him into a few ""Star Wars"" premieres and the premiere on March 12, 2012, for the first installment of ""The Hunger Games,"" for which his father worked as a second-unit director. Rodger wrote that the movie was ""entertaining"" and the premiere ""was an extraordinary experience,"" but he said he ""felt very bitter that I wasn't able to bring a girl with me as a date. The majority of men at the event had a date with them, and I felt so pathetic for not having a date. If only a girl at my collage had been attracted to me; I would have gladly brought her to the premiere as my date."" He attended a private Katy Perry concert the night before, thanks to wealthy friends who gave the tickets to the Rodger family. Elliot wrote about how seeing how rich families enjoy life made him resent that his ""damnable mother"" had not ""married into wealth instead of being selfish."" ""I couldn't help but feel a bitter form of envy at all of the rich kids at the concert. They grew up in lavish mansions, indulged in excessive opulence, and will never have to worry about anything in their pleasurable, hedonistic lives. I would take great pleasure in watching all of those rich families burn alive. Looking at all of them really drilled in my mind the importance of wealth. Rodger's parents frantically searched for son during shooting . ""Wealth is one of the most important defining factors of self-worth and superiority. I hated and envied all of those kids for being born into wealth, while I had to struggle to find a way to claim wealth for myself. I had to be ruthless, and do whatever it takes to attain such wealth. After all, it was my only hope of ever being worthy of getting a girlfriend and living the life of gratification that I desire."" Rodger lamented being ""a kissless virgin."" 2. 'Love Potion #9' advice . Dale Launer, who wrote and directed several movies about relationships, tried to teach Rodger how to get a girlfriend, according to Rodger's writing. Launer, a friend of Rodger's father, wrote ""Blind Date,"" ""Love Potion #9"" and ""Ruthless People."" ""He wanted to help me overcome my troubles because he is a so-called expert with women. He even showed me pictures of all of the gorgeous women he has dated in his life, and there were a lot of them. This man truly lived. ""A few men who are successful with women have offered me help and advice about this in the past, but nothing ever came of it. I suppose they want to help because it would be a boost to their already big egos, and also because they feel sorry for me. People should feel sorry for me. My life is so pathetic, and I hate the world for forcing me to suffer it. I feel sorry for myself. ""In truth, there is nothing men like Dale can really do to help me attract girls and lose my virginity. They can't mind-control girls to be attracted to me. My brief friendship with Dale would, however, spark a few more interesting e-mail conversations where I confide to him about how cruel I think women are by nature. He would only be amused by this. Of course he would be amused. Women were never cruel to him. They gave him sex and love all his life."" CNN e-mailed Launer's rep for comment Sunday evening but has not heard back yet. 3. Winning a lottery: 'The only way out' Rodger became convinced that winning the Megamillions lottery was his destiny. He began obsessively playing it and even drove to Arizona from California four times to buy Powerball tickets. ""I saw winning the lottery as the only way out,"" he wrote. ""I knew I was always destined for great things. This must be it! I was destined to be the winner of the highest lottery jackpot in existence. I knew right then and there that this jackpot was meant for me. Who else deserved such a victory? I had been through so much rejection, suffering, and injustice in my life, and this was to be my salvation. With my whole body filled with feverish hope, I spent $700 dollars on lottery tickets for this drawing. As I spent this money, I imagined all the amazing sex I would have with a beautiful model girlfriend I would have once I become a man of wealth."" Grieving father after rampage: 'When will this insanity stop?' After repeatedly not winning the lottery, Rodger saw that his plan for his ""Day of Retribution"" against the world ""was more real than ever before."" ""Without the prospect of becoming wealthy at a young age, I had nothing to live for now. I was going to be a virgin outcast forever. I realized that I had to start planning and preparing for the Day of Retribution, even though I hadn't yet had any idea of what day that would be."" 4. Rodger's three guns . Rodger began practicing shooting at a gun range in Oxnard, California, after failing to win the $120 million Megamillions lottery in September 2012, according to his writing. ""I had the knowledge, in the back of my mind, that the Day of Retribution was very possible now. Going to the shooting range while I waited for my laptop gave me the perfect opportunity to gain some initial training in shooting guns, which will be the main weapons I use as vengeance against my enemies when the Day of Retribution ultimately comes to pass. ""I walked into the range, rented a handgun from the ugly old redneck cashier, and started to practice shooting at paper targets. As I fired my first few rounds, I felt so sick to the stomach. I questioned my whole life, and I looked at the gun in front of me and asked myself 'What am I doing here? How could things have led to this?' I couldn't believe my life was actually turning out this way. There I was, practicing shooting with real guns because I had a plan to carry out a massacre."" Rejection, jealousy and vow to kill 'beautiful girls' His first ""act of preparation"" for the massacre was the purchase of his first gun, he wrote. ""I had already done some research on handguns, and I decided to purchase the Glock 34 semiautomatic pistol, an efficient and highly accurate weapon. I signed all of the papers and was told that my pickup day was in mid-December. That fell in nicely, because that was when I was planning on staying in Santa Barbara till. After I picked up the handgun, I brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power. I was now armed."" He bought his second handgun in the spring of 2013, when he ""began to seriously think about planning the Day of Retribution,"" he wrote. He bought a third gun a year later.  ""I needed to buy a third handgun, just in case one of them jams. I needed two working handguns at the same time, as that was how I planned to commit suicide; with two simultaneous shots to the head. I also needed to buy magazine clips and ammunition, as well as knives and carrying cases for my equipment."" 5. Vengeance against men . Rodger wrote that the ""first phase"" of his massacre plan would be to stab his two male roommates to death. ""These were the biggest nerds I had ever seen, and they were both very ugly with annoying voices,"" he wrote. ""If they were pleasant to live with, I would regret having to kill them, but due to their behavior I now had no regrets about such a prospect.  In fact, I'd even enjoy stabbing them both to death while they slept."" ""After that, I will start luring people into my apartment, knock them out with a hammer, and slit their throats. I will torture some of the good looking people before I kill them, assuming that the good looking ones had the best sex lives. All of that pleasure they had in life, I will punish by bringing them pain and suffering. I have lived a life of pain and suffering, and it was time to bring that pain to people who actually deserve it."" The Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office identified the three men found dead in Rodger's apartment as Cheng Yuan Hong, 20; George Chen, 19; and Weihan Wang, 20.  Hong and Chen were his roommates, while Wang was visiting the apartment, the sheriff's office said.  The three students died from ""multiple stab wounds"" before the shooting rampage, the sheriff's office said. New details emerge about mass killer and victims .","Elliot Rodger blames his unhappiness on ""the cruelness of women""

"The four remaining GOP candidates played to their individual strengths on Thursday and tried to leave a lasting impression in a final, boisterous debate two days before South Carolina's pivotal primary. In a campaign cycle where debates have had direct consequences on the ebb and flow of the race, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich turned his contempt for the media into one of his strongest performances yet. When CNN Chief National Correspondent John King opened the debate with a question about open marriage, following an interview by Gingrich's ex-wife saying that he had sought one, the Republican chastised him. ""To take an ex-wife and make it two days before the primary a significant question in a presidential campaign is as close to despicable as anything I can imagine,"" Gingrich told King, the moderator of the debate. Gingrich's response elicited loud applause from the audience. The debate came at the end of a ground-shaking day that saw former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum being declared winner of the Iowa caucuses more than two weeks after his apparent second-place finish to former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropping out of the race and throwing his support to Gingrich. Texas Rep. Ron Paul was the fourth candidate in the debate. iReporters on debate: Fireworks, but little substance . An angry Gingrich chastised CNN for starting off with the question about his marriage. Hours before the debate, ABC News and The Washington Post released interviews with Marianne Gingrich in which she alleged Gingrich asked for an ""open marriage"" before their divorce. Marianne Gingrich told The Washington Post that a day after her husband told her about his affair with Callista Bisek in May 1999, the former House speaker delivered a speech titled ""The Demise of American Culture"" to a group of Republican women in Pennsylvania. ""How could he ask me for a divorce on Monday and within 48 hours give a speech on family values and talk about how people treat people?"" Marianne Gingrich said in her interview with the Post. Gingrich said the story was false. The three other presidential candidates on the stage passed on the chance to criticize Gingrich over the allegations by his ex-wife. Romney took the steady, cautious route that he has throughout the campaign, responding to his rivals only when attacked. Santorum presented himself as a more conservative option  to  Romney than Gingrich and as the candidate who could draw an effective contrast in the fall with President Barack Obama. As the debate was going on, Gingrich's campaign released his tax returns as he had promised to do earlier. Romney was asked if he would follow his father's lead in releasing 12 years of tax returns. Romney's father, George,  ran for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. ""Maybe,"" Romney said, before highlighting his business experience and his personal success. ""I didn't inherit money from my parents. What I have, I earned."" As he had earlier this week, Santorum said he filed his own returns and they were at home on his computer and he would release them once he returned home. Paul said he had no intention to release his returns, arguing that congressional financial statements are revealing enough. The issue of electability was hotly debated. Earlier this week, Gingrich called for both Perry and Santorum to drop out of the race and support his candidacy because they didn't have the experience for a large undertaking like a presidential campaign. With Perry gone, Santorum was left to respond. ""Grandiosity has never been a problem with Newt Gingrich,"" Santorum said, arguing that he's the steady choice and Republicans shouldn't pick a nominee who might surprise them. While Gingrich and Santorum debated their records in Washington and specifically who was more responsible for the Republican Revolution of the 1990s, Romney raised his hand to argue it's time for a Washington outsider. ""We need to send to Washington someone who has not lived in Washington, but someone who's lived in the real streets of America,"" Romney said. Every candidate onstage said they opposed the anti-Internet piracy bill roiling Congress, and criticized the proposal for being too intrusive. However, both Romney and Santorum said they could support a more narrow law that would help protect intellectual property rights online. Displaying the off-the-cuff wit he has used to great effect at a series of GOP debates, Gingrich joked he was none too sympathetic to movie and music producers who pushed for the legislation. ""You're asking a conservative about the economic interest of Hollywood,"" Gingrich said to laughter in the audience. ""And I'm weighing it, I'm weighing it. I'm not rushing in."" Meanwhile Paul touted his libertarian-leaning views, adding he had been an early detractor of the bill. He said as president he would be unique in his ability to work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to protect civil liberties. The former obstetrician and gynecologist  forced his way into the conversation on both health care and abortion, two issues he knows a lot about. ""I thought maybe you were prejudiced against doctors and a doctor that practiced medicine in the military or something,"" Paul told King after a section where the other three candidates answered a question on whether a full repeal of President Obama's health care reform was truly possible. After a lengthy debate among the other three candidates over the legitimacy of criticizing Romney's political conversion from pro-abortion rights to anti-abortion rights, the crowd  booed and chanted Paul's name when King moved on without letting Paul weigh in. ""John, once again, it's a medical subject and I'm a doctor,"" Paul said. Four polls over the last two days show Romney's long-held lead in South Carolina nearly evaporating into single digits by the time the four took the stage, while Gingrich has surged into a virtual tie. Gingrich on Thursday grabbed a major endorsement when Perry announced he was backing Gingrich as he suspended his campaign. Santorum's campaign got a boost on Thursday when the Iowa GOP released the final certified results from its January 3 caucuses, which reversed Romney's eight-vote victory and instead determined that Santorum had won by 34 votes.","Gingrich replies angrily to first question on ex-wife's allegations .

"Every once in a while, people get all crazy about the idea that some people might ""import"" drugs from Canada. Many pharmaceuticals are much cheaper in that country and many Americans, especially those who live on the border, are sometimes tempted to buy their drugs there. Inevitably, when this topic comes up for debate, someone questions the safety of those drugs. This concern is somewhat overblown. Canada isn't a banana republic, and it does a rather good job of ensuring the safety of its citizens without our help. Moreover, it's a concern that ignores that the vast, vast majority of drugs we buy here are not manufactured here. We import most of what we consume. For some reason, we don't seem to be as concerned about the safety of our drugs here are home. It turns out, though, that we might need to rethink that, according to a recent story in The New York Times. For some time, many people, including me, have been advocating for greater use of generic and over-the-counter drugs over bioequivalent name brand drugs because they would result in significantly decreased health care spending. Those arguments have resonated with the American people, and generic drug use has increased dramatically. In response, countries have massively increased their capacity to produce such drugs. For instance, about 40% of all over-the-counter and generic drugs used in the United States are produced in India. In response to this and other factors, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act was passed in July of 2012. Part of the law involved changes to generic drug user fees. Companies looking for approval now need to pay some extra money to allow for better inspection of production facilities. And in India, those inspections are bearing fruit. Last year, inspectors from the FDA looked at 160 drug plants there. What they found was often quite concerning. Drugs were sometimes adulterated or contaminated. Facilities were often filthy or infested with bugs. They also caught some executives lying to them, leading to felony charges. As you can imagine, this is leading many pharmaceutical companies to question whether India is a safe and reasonable place to manufacture their drugs. India's drug industry is in a panic. They should be. The World Health Organization has, for years, monitored the use of falsified or counterfeit medicines, and some of the problems have been in the United States. The New York Times documents many instances in many countries where improperly made or counterfeit drugs led to serious consequences, including deaths. Many people have legitimate concerns about how much regulation goes into the approval of drugs in the United States. Some believe the FDA is too cautious and makes it too difficult for people to get the medicines they want or need. But examples like this are a cautionary tale about how some regulation is necessary. Without proper oversight, people in the United States, not some Third World nation, are at risk for buying counterfeit drugs in their pharmacies. They are at risk not only for not getting the benefit they expect but also a negative consequence they didn't see coming. In many ways, you get what you pay for. Companies have been using India for production largely because they have been able to do it so cheaply. But it's becoming apparent that one of the reasons for those low costs may be because they were doing a much less-than-perfect job. Fixing the problem will likely mean that they will lose their competitive advantage. If pharmaceutical companies move out of India, they will likely decide to go to other countries that can also offer cheap services. One of those is likely China. But China, unlike India, has blocked U.S. efforts to send FDA inspectors.  We're in a similar situation to what we had in India before the increased oversight. This is far from over. We need to be vigilant. We also need to support the government in its efforts to protect us overseas. Fixing this problem, both now and in the future, will require resources and a firm stance. It may also require us to pay more for our drugs than we have in the past. That won't be popular, but sometimes good things cost money.","Aaron Carroll: Americans worry about safety of buying cheaper drugs in Canada .

"Even as a masked gunman kept firing a hailstorm of bullets in a Colorado movie theater, acts of selflessness and heroism sprouted from all across the room. Three of the 12 people killed died while shielding their girlfriends from the gunfire. And a young woman risked her life to aid her wounded friend, refusing to leave her side. Such valor, President Barack Obama said, represents ""what's best in us"" and assure the country ""that out of this darkness, a brighter day is going to come."" Remembering the Colorado shooting victims . Here are some of the tales of bravery: . Jonathan Blunk, 26 . Blunk, a Navy veteran, was killed trying to provide cover for his girlfriend, Jansen Young. ""He laid up against me and had the other side of my body against the concrete seating, and I was pretty much boxed in,"" Young said. ""He is a hero. And he was a hero before this, and before I met him. All he wanted to do was serve his country and help people in need,"" Young said. ""He used to say he was born to serve his country, and he just really is. He's a true hero."" Blunk is survived by two young children. Blunk's former wife, Chantel Blunk, said their 4-year-old daughter now takes comfort in calling her father's cell phone and hearing his voice on his voice mail message. One victim's account: What it was like in the theater . Stephanie Davies, 21, and Allie Young, 19 . ""When the gunman initially came in and threw the (incendiary) canisters, he threw them only a few feet away from Allie and Stephanie,"" Obama said in a speech in Aurora on Sunday, shortly after meeting with the two friends. ""Allie stood up, seeing that she might need to do something or at least warn the other people who were there, and she was immediately shot."" The bullet pierced a vein in Allie's neck, which immediately started spurting blood. Focusing on the victims, not the shooter . ""As she dropped down on the floor, Stephanie -- 21 years old -- had the presence of mind to drop down on the ground with her, pull her out of the aisle, place her fingers over where Allie had been wounded, and applied pressure the entire time, while the gunman was still shooting,"" the president said. ""Allie told Stephanie she needed to run."" But Stephanie refused to go, and instead used her other hand to call 911. When police arrived, Stephanie and several others carried Allie across two parking lots to a waiting ambulance. Allie is expected to recover. ""I don't know how many people, at any age, would have the presence of mind that Stephanie did, or the courage that Allie showed,"" Obama said. ""And so as tragic as the circumstances of what we've seen ... are, as heartbreaking as it is for the families, it's worth us spending most of our time reflecting on young Americans like Allie and Stephanie, because they represent what's best in us, and they assure us that out of this darkness, a brighter day is going to come."" Victims of Colorado massacre remembered with poignant stories . Matt McQuinn, 27 . McQuinn died shielding his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, during the shooting, family attorney Rob Scott said. Samantha Yowler was shot in the knee but is expected to make a full recovery, Scott said. Her brother Nick, who also was trying to protect her from the bullets, also survived. McQuinn and Samantha Yowler grew up in the Miami Valley region of Ohio, according to CNN affiliate WKEF. McQuinn's stepfather, David Jackson, told CNN affiliate WHIO that the young couple was planning to move back to Springfield, Ohio. ""I know he's a hero,"" Jackson said. ""He and Sam were very much in love and planning their life together. I am sure they were thinking very seriously of getting married soon."" 'Words are... inadequate,' Obama tells families of Colorado shooting victims . Alex Teves, 24 . Teves was killed while protecting his girlfriend, Amanda Lindgren. ""I wouldn't be here without him,"" Lindgren said. Teves graduated in June with a master's degree in counseling psychology from the University of Denver, where he met Lindgren. His best friend, Ryan Cooper, recalled Teves' kindness. ""We love going to football and basketball games together,"" Cooper said. ""As much as he loved that, he would take time and miss those games to mentor kids in the community who didn't have dads and were just really hurting.""

"(CNN) -- Riders of Philadelphia public transit were reminded on Christmas Day that the holiday celebrates a birth in the humblest of circumstances. The Christ child was born in a stable, the Nativity story in the Gospel of Luke says. On Thursday, a woman went into labor in the subway, and people in the train car watched as two transit police officers helped her give birth, police said. It brought Christmas joy to Sgt.

The baby was already on its way into the world. ""We just went right to work,"" Caban said. Cell phone images published to social media showed the officers holding the baby then later carrying it out of the subway wrapped in swaddling. Mother and child were taken to a hospital for a medical check. The officers' boss tweeted a shout out to them. ""Transit Police SGT and PO deliver baby on Market Frankford El train!!!! WOOHOO!!! Now that's a Christmas gift!!!"" posted SEPTA chief Thomas J. Nestel III. Caban told KYW he didn't mind that his wish for an uneventful Christmas was sunk.

"Fighting erupted Tuesday in an autonomous region of Tajikistan after central government forces moved in on a former opposition warlord believed to be behind the killing of a top security general. At least 12 soldiers and 30 opposition fighters were killed, said a statement from Tajikistan's security service. It said the military operation was continuing. Residents described continuous gunfire in Khorog, the capital of the Gorno-Badakshan region, which borders Afghanistan. They said they believed the number of casualties was higher than the official toll. Gorno-Badakshan was cut off Tuesday after communication lines, including cell phones and internet service, was severed. The violence stemmed from the death of Maj. Gen. Abdullo Nazarov, head of the regional branch of the State Committee on National Security, a successor to the Soviet KGB. Nazarov's car was stopped by a group of unidentified people, according to Ria-Novosti, a Russian state-run news service. Nazarov was pulled out of the car and stabbed several times. He died on the way to hospital, Ria-Novosti said. Police arrested two suspects but were still seeking Tolib Ayombekov, the suspected leader of a smuggling ring of tobacco, precious jewels, and drugs, said the Central Asian News Service. The news agency said Ayombekov refused to surrender to police and instigated the attack against government forces. Tajikistan gained independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but has been troubled ever since by bloody war, widespread corruption and poverty. Tensions remain high between the Tajik government in Dushanbe and the people of Gorno-Badakshan, who are of the Pamiri ethnic minority. The region was a stronghold of Islamist rebels during a five-year civil war in the 1990s that claimed thousand of lives. The war also divided people along ethnic and regional lines, and the Pamiris, by and large, sided with the opposition. A United Nations-brokered peace plan left President Emomali Rakhmon's secular government in place but gave some of his Islamist opponents official jobs. But Rakhmon, backed by Moscow, has sought to consolidate power and stamp out remnants of radical Islam. Khorog residents said they received no warning of Tuesday's fighting. People panicked as gunfire rang out. Journalist Mirzojalol Shohjamolov said a group of residents gathered in front of Khorog Square, near the government building, with signs that said: ""Stop military actions in Khorog.""","Government forces clashed with opposition fighters in Gorno-Badakshan region .

"More than two decades after the death of the systematic racial discrimination policy of apartheid, a community living southeast of South Africa's capital Pretoria is being accused of trying to keep its racist ideals alive. White men clad in military uniforms stamped with an old South African flag guard the gates of the controversial settlement known as Kleinfontein. All the signs within its boundaries are written in Afrikaans, the language that developed out of the Dutch dialect spoken by early colonizers and which is spoken by the town's 1,000 white inhabitants. A bust of Hendrick Verwoerd, the assassinated prime minister considered the architect of apartheid, greets visitors upon entry. ""Kleinfontein is a cultural community,"" explains its spokeswoman Marisa Haasbroek, ""if you are not an Afrikaaner you cannot live here."" Afrikaaners are white South Africans of mostly Dutch descent. The private settlement has made headlines in recent weeks after it was exposed by a local newspaper. Haasbroek defends its existence saying residents simply want to live among their own kind. The 50-year-old mother of two tells CNN she moved to Kleinfontein six years ago shortly after her car was stolen in the city center. ""I was just sick of crime,"" she says. ""My parents-in-law were already living here and they told us Kleinfontein is safe,"" Haasbroek, her engineer husband and their children packed their belongings and moved to the ""whites only"" enclave. The area has been in existence since the 1990s. It was formed on the eve of democratic elections at around the same time as its better-known sister settlement, Orania, in the Northern Cape. Most South Africans knew Orania but have only recently learned about Kleinfontein. Its residents are accused of using culture and heritage to discriminate against black people. There were even reports that the community has once refused to be assisted by black police officers. Read more: How S Africa avoided bloody war . ""That's simply not true,"" Haasbroek says. ""We do not discriminate, we differentiate."" South Africa's official opposition recently held a protest at Kleinfontein vowing to ""liberate"" residents from their ""apartheid mindsets."" The mayor of Tshwane -- the municipality Kleinfontein falls under -- has also conducted a site visit, saying he supported the residents' right to ""conserve their heritage but that it must be balanced with the freedom of others to reside anywhere in the republic."" Despite differing opinions on the matter their right to self-determination is protected by the constitution and the government has said they have the right to live this way. Race is still an emotional topic in South Africa and Haasbroek has been at pains to explain that residents are screened based on culture, language, religion, history - but not race. Read more: The cricketer who took on apartheid regime . ""We are trying to preserve our own identity,"" Haasbroek says. ""We are swamped by people who are not like us. We are a minority like the people of Tibet in China and like the Palestinians. But we don't want our own state. We respect the laws of South African and we want to remain here."" Orania and Kleinfontein represent about 2,000 people, a tiny minority of the overall Afrikaaner community in South Africa. Haasbroek says crime and affirmative action have left them feeling left out of the so-called ""Rainbow Nation."" ""We don't really feel welcomed in the new South Africa so we are saying, just give us a little bit of independence."" They already run their own school and they build their own infrastructure. They want to be recognized as a self-contained municipality -- something the local government has said will not happen.","The South African community of Kleinfontein is accused of keeping apartheid's ideals alive .

"On his sixth birthday, at the height of World War II, Albie Sachs received a congratulatory postcard from his father with a rather unusual wish inscribed on it: ""May you grow up to be a soldier in the fight for liberation,"" read the card. ""Looking back, it was a little bit heavy,"" remarks Sachs, now aged 78. But as burdensome as his father's message might have been, it instilled the young South African with a strong conviction about the value of justice, a belief Sachs has fervently advocated and fought for throughout his life. Sachs became one of South Africa's most eminent political activists and judges, famous for being amongst the leading legal minds behind the creation of the country's groundbreaking constitution after the first democratic elections in 1994. ""Getting the constitution, when everybody predicted a bloody racial war, was a triumph in itself,"" says Sachs proudly. ""And we did it ourselves; It wasn't forced on us -- we looked into each other's eyes, people who'd been trying to kill each other."" And Sachs, one of the most prominent white South African freedom fighters, knew all too well about the cruelty of years gone by. As a young lawyer defending victims of apartheid's repressive laws, he often faced the wrath of security police and was put in solitary confinement for nearly six months without trial. Read this: Apartheid photographer 'sick of taking pictures of dead' In April 1988, while living in exile in Mozambique, Sachs lost his right arm and the sight in one eye to a car bomb. After a long and painful recovery, he returned to South Africa, a country he had last seen 24 years earlier. Shortly thereafter, Nelson Mandela was released after more than 27 years in prison, and work began on the birth of a new South Africa, ending the horrors of the old regime and creating a new rule of law. Sachs was appointed to serve as one of 11 judges in the newly established Constitutional Court, where he helped write one of the most world's most progressive constitutions in 1996. ""How can we live together in one country? What can the basic rules be, the basic values that respect the dignity of everybody?"" says Sachs as he explains the thinking behind the constitution. ""Whoever you are, whoever your parents or grandparents happened to be, wherever you came from, whether you are exalted, whether you are humble, you're a person, you're a human being,"" he says. ""The constitution doesn't build houses, the constitution doesn't provide food, electricity, water, school text books, but it provides a framework in which people can claim these things, resolve their disputes and that's what we lacked before in South Africa. So if it hadn't been for the constitution, it would've been just total chaos, and most opportunistic grabs from power."" As someone who'd paid a big physical and psychological price for his fight for freedom, Sachs says the establishment of a just rule of law served to help a deeply wounded population put its troubled past behind it. ""It wasn't simply a healing of a fragmented, fractured, divided nation filled with enmities and fears and arrogance,"" he says. ""It was a healing for me, personally,"" he adds. ""The healing comes about through the achievement of the ideals for which we were fighting."" Read this: Why mixed-race comic was 'born a crime' But Sachs was not only one of the architects behind South Africa's post-apartheid constitution; he also helped design the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg, an impressive building created to visually represent the ideas expressed so clearly in the country's new rule of law. ""We decided we wanted a building -- a brand new court, a brand new constitution,"" says Sachs. ""Not one parachuted in from outer space, one that grew up from our history."" As a result, the Constitutional Court was chosen to be constructed right next to Johannesburg's Old Fort Prison, a notorious building whose walls had served to confine two of the best know civil rights figures of the previous century. ""We say with a dubious pride, we South Africans have the only prison in the world where both Mandela and [Mahatma] Gandhi were locked up -- nobody else can make that claim,"" says Sachs. ""And we wanted to show the transformation from negativity to positivity, why we have a constitution,"" he adds. ""Moving forward without forgetting the past and taking the terrible energy of hatred, division, pain of the past and using that force of that energy to create something positive and hopeful for the future."" A passionate art collector, Sachs has also donated several of his fine pieces to the Court. He is immensely proud of the building, where he spent five of the 15 years he was a Constitutional Court Judge, and never tires of visiting it. Now retired, Sachs lives in Clifton, Cape Town, with his family -- wife Vanessa and young son Oliver, aged six. Sachs says he would never be able to give Oliver the same burden his father placed on him when he was six. He even admits he can't speak to Oliver about the horrors of apartheid. ""I don't want to,"" he sighs. ""He'll find out. I can tell him that there were cruel people, put a bomb in my car, blew me up, wonderful doctor saved my life. I can tell him all that, that he can understand. ""I don't want to tell him that his mommy and his daddy, they wouldn't have been allowed to live together, to love, and to conceive him. I don't want to. It's like putting a burden on him, that we had to shoulder and deal with, and in a sense what we were fighting for was to be free of that lived reality and even the memory -- I'm happy to move on.""","Albie Sachs is one of the creators of South Africa's post-apartheid constitution .

"In a 55-minute long video, al Qaeda announced it will launch a new branch in the Indian subcontinent. Speaking in the video, al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri said the purpose is to ""wage jihad against its enemies, to liberate its land, to restore its sovereignty, and to revive its Caliphate."" Al-Zawahiri also said he seeks to gain support ""for the vulnerable"" in Myanmar and Bangladesh; in the Indian states of Assam and Gujarat; and in Kashmir, the disputed region between India and Pakistan. He called for ""rescue"" from ""injustice, oppression, persecution, and suffering"" in these areas. Some analysts view al Qaeda's announcement as an indication they're struggling for followers as ISIS gains support in the global Islamist movement. Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst called the video ""hyperventilation and posturing."" ""It's al-Zawahiri's obvious way of getting some of the limelight back,"" he said as ISIS has moved front and center. The Indian government is trying to confirm the video's authenticity, said Amarendra Tiwari, an official with India's Ministry of Home Affairs. The security alert has been issued in parts of India, although details were not given. The al Qaeda video is unlikely to win over constituents, said Bernard Haykel, professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, about the India announcement. ""They are losing a lot of constituents to the Islamic State,"" he said. ""They're trying to show their global reach as an organization, but I'm not sure of exactly what sign they are trying to send."" If ISIS undermines al Qaeda, ""it's going to affect funding,"" said Ajit Singh, senior fellow at South Asia Terrorism Portal in New Delhi. The radicalized Muslims are more likely to fund ISIS. ""That's why al Qaeda is trying to increase its influence,"" he said. Singh says it's not al Qaeda's first time trying to gain a foothold in India. India, a predominantly Hindu nation, has a 13% Muslim population, according to the country's census. Inter-religious relations have become tense before. In 2002, Gujarat was wracked with anti-Muslim violence, in which more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. Most of the world's Muslims live in Asia, with about 1 billion in Asia-Pacific and about 322 million in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the Pew Research Center. The style of al Qaeda's latest video also highlights a stylistic difference with ISIS, which are often shot in the light during daytime, noted Peter Bergen, CNN's national security analyst.

"(CNN) -- FIFA has been getting a kicking off the pitch in recent weeks -- now it's trying to resolve a turf war. World football's governing body is set to hold talks with team representatives over plans to hold the 2015 World Cup on artificial turf. Earlier this year a number of players -- including Brazilian star Marta, world player of the year Nadine Angerer and Team USA's all-time leading scorer Abby Wambach launched a court case against the Canadian Soccer Association (CSA) and FIFA with the Ontario Human Rights tribunal over the decision not to hold the tournament on grass pitches. The group claims that the CSA and FIFA are guilty of sexual discrimination -- a charge both organizations have flatly rejected. Players are also concerned artificial turf leads to a higher risk of injury and greater wear and tear on their bodies. Now Jerome Valcke, the secretary general of FIFA, is set to speak with players and coaches at the World Cup draw on December 6 in Ottawa about the matter. A FIFA spokesman told CNN: ""What we can confirm is that the FIFA General Secretary will meet with all the team representatives present during his stay on the occasion of the Official Draw in Ottawa."" U.S. lawyer Hampton Dellinger, who is representing the players, wrote to the general secretary last week outlining the position of his clients. ""The players and their representatives are prepared to discuss their proposal for funding and installing the highest quality temporary grass fields, much like the ones used in prior World Cups,"" said Dellinger in a letter sent to Valcke last week. ""We can also talk about the use of goal-line technology. Since men's World Cups now feature goal-line technology -- which FIFA describes as ""crucial...in supporting the match officials"" -- so too should the women's tournament. ""Regardless of whether FIFA's prior unwillingness to speak with the players resulted from its financial ties to the artificial turf industry or some other factor, we appreciate you now offering 'open channels of communication' and 'open dialogue' with the players. ""We hope you will keep your word by speaking with the players on or about December 6 so that together we can resolve the dispute and have a World Cup worthy of the amazing athletes who are the key to its success."" Dellinger told CNN on Monday that he was ""pleased"" Valcke would ""keep his word and begin an 'open dialogue with the players regarding competition conditions at the Women's World Cup. ""As he should know, a number of the leading women's players will be in Brazil on December 6th preparing for a tournament,"" Dellinger added. ""Others are participating for club teams around the world. The players will provide times when they are available to speak with Mr. Valcke by phone around the date of the official draw. We are hopeful that the Canadian Soccer Association and broadcasters such as Fox Sports will join the discussion."" Independent consultant Professor Eric Harrison, who traveled to Canada earlier this year to inspect the stadiums and training pitches for the World Cup, believes the harsh weather conditions in northern latitudes make ""preparing natural turf particularly challenging."" ""The majority of stadiums in Canada have accepted that only football turf is a credible surface to meet the demands of the weather and usage,"" Harrison told FIFA's website. Harrison also argues trying to lay natural turf on top of artificial pitches could prove difficult -- and potentially dangerous for the players. ""For the natural turf to be successful, the roots have to penetrate to form a stable surface,"" added Harrison. ""Where this has been attempted, the roots have not penetrated and the natural turf surface begins to slide on top of the artificial turf surface."" Mia Hamm, who scored 158 goals for Team USA and won the 1999 World Cup, told CNN that she believes the tournament should be played on grass. ""I've played on both and I prefer grass,"" she said. ""I don't think by any means this is the Canadian Federation looking to discriminate in any way. ""I understand why a lot of their fields are artificial surfaces based on the amount of play and the weather. ""These are the best players in the world playing in their biggest tournament, I just think it should be played on grass. I'm just hoping FIFA does the right thing. ""From a player that's played on both, I prefer playing on grass. There are certain aspects of the game that are just truer on grass."" Dellinger has invited television broadcast partners as well as sponsors to the talks, while the players have also agreed to using a mediator to ""facilitate discussion."" In an interview with his organization's own website in October, Valcke stressed that FIFA remains ""committed"" to producing the best possible tournament. He said that the CSA proposed that the tournament be played on artificial turf and insists it is of the highest quality. Valcke said: ""As has already been explained, this is not a question of money, or of differences between men's and women's events, but it is a matter of the natural conditions in Canada. ""We want to guarantee consistent top-level playing conditions for all 24 teams during the event, both in the official stadiums and at the training sites. This has been the sole reason behind the decision to play on artificial turf from day one."" The tournament, which will be held in Canada, involves 24 nations and takes place from June 6 to July 5.","Women's World Cup set to take place in Canada next year .

"In what his campaign billed as a ""major foreign policy speech"" Monday, lasting about 20 minutes, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney took on President Obama's handling of protests in Iran after disputed elections three years ago. Demonstrators were met with deadly violence by the government. ""When millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, 'Are you with us, or are you with them?' -- the American president was silent,"" Romney said. The facts: . Obama's initial response to the protests became a source of controversy at the time, and his political enemies have brought it back up at various times since. In the very first days of the Iran protests, the president did not weigh in publicly.  After more and more images of violence surfaced, he condemned the actions of the Iranian government, and later toughened his talk. Complete coverage: CNN Fact Check . The non-partisan Council on Foreign Relations describes it this way: ""While Obama initially opted for a muted response, the Iranian regime's violent crackdown of opposition supporters complicated his administration's attempt to balance outreach with its defense of human rights."" Assessing the accuracy of Romney's attack requires a look at the timeline. On June 13, 2009, Iran announced that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a landslide victory.  His main opponent, Mir Hossein Moussavi, had already alleged blatant violations.  After the announcement, angry crowds of Moussavi supporters took to the streets. The protests continued the next day as Ahmadinejad supporters turned out by the tens of thousands to hold counter-demonstrations.  CNN's Christiane Amanpour, on the streets of Tehran, reported on ""riot situations, lots of marches, people shouting 'Down with dictatorship.'"" Scores, or even hundreds, of riot police were deployed, and there were ""running battles between some of the street protesters and some of the riot police,"" Amanpour reported.  ""And we've seen people who have been hit with batons and taken refuge in people's homes along the march route to try to get out of the way of that."" By the next day, June 15, Moussavi supporters were holding the country's largest protests since the 1979 revolution. Romney calls for strong U.S. role in world affairs . That day, June 15, Obama gave remarks on the situation.  He said he was watching the news from Iran.  It is ""up to Iranians to make decisions about who Iran's leaders will be,"" he said, adding that ""we respect Iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the United States being the issue inside of Iran."" But, Obama said, ""I am deeply troubled by the violence that I've been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process -- free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values and need to be respected."" He said it was his understanding that ""that the Iranian government says that they are going to look into irregularities that have taken place,"" and emphasized that he would continue to seek diplomacy with the country. Just over a week later, on June 23, after more and more images of violence came to light and amid some calls for the president to take a tougher stance, he did just that. ""The United States and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats, beatings and imprisonments of the last few days,"" the president said, adding that he strongly condemns ""these unjust actions."" The undecided: What will sway them? Asked why he would not spell out potential consequences for Iran over its behavior, the president replied, ""Because I think that we don't know yet how this thing is going to play out. I know everybody here is on a 24-hour news cycle. I'm not."" An analysis for CNN.com said Obama was attempting to balance realism with idealism. Others have used similar terms as Romney to describe the president's initial handling of Iran. ""His silence validated the mullahs, despite the blood on their hands and the nuclear centrifuges in their tunnels,"" presidential hopeful Tim Pawlenty alleged last year in the race for the Republican nomination. Conclusion: . During the first couple of days of the protests and violence, Obama did not weigh in publicly, but by a few days in, he was not ""silent"" -- and a week later, took a tougher stance.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Most Americans are probably familiar with the T-Shirt slogan ""Keep Austin Weird."" Ever since Willie Nelson brought rednecks into an alliance with hippies back in the psychedelic '70s, Austin has milked its quirky libertarian spirit for a worldwide bonanza of free publicity. Both South by Southwest and ""Austin City Limits"" were born in the cradle of this stoner plea. But in recent years, the Texas capital has become corporatized, the weirdness factor replaced by Starbucks, Marriott and Chase Bank. Yet, on Christmas Day, at the downtown Alamo Drafthouse Cinema at the corner of East Sixth and Trinity, vintage Austin weirdness came roaring back courtesy of the banned-in-Pyongyang film comedy, ""The Interview,"" starring Seth Rogen and James Franco. The Merry Prankster of the 1 p.m. showing was Tim League, a 45-year-old Rice University graduate and CEO of the Alamo. Wearing a rented star-spangled body suit, looking like the poor man's Evel Knievel, a Santa Claus cap festooned to his head, League orchestrated a piece of guerrilla theatrics that would have made Ken Kesey proud. Striding onto the stage with James Brown's ""Living in America"" blaring from the speaker system, League introduced the bizarrely controversial ""The Interview"" with a stand-up comedy routine replete with unabashed patriotism, rank silliness, vaudeville shtick and Yippie absurdity. Since the mid-1990s, League, a smart businessman-cum-showman, has helped transform Austin from a cinema backwater to an outlaw Hollywood hub. Determined to put the weird back into Austin's civic spirit, League spoofed North Korea's damaging cyberattack against Sony with Comedy Central aplomb. Calling 13 audience members to the stage as pre-showtime chorus leaders, handing out free cans of Budweiser and candy, League, in tongue-and-cheek fashion, introduced a video of Lee Greenwood crooning ""God Bless the USA."" The holiday moviegoers joined into a Christmas carol-like singalong, collectively sounding like a patriotic Sousa band. He prodded the willing audience to wave little American flags, which were handed out as souvenirs. He also had them hold up Zippo lighters as if ""Free Bird"" were being played by Lynyrd Skynyrd. After this perverse round of karaoke, the main feature began, and League watched the controversial film from the aisle. There were no seats for him in the sold-out theater. ""The song is the most over-the-top patriotic song I know,"" League later told me. ""Lee Greenwood can wear that jacket and sing that song without a bit of irony. You gotta love that."" When history looks back on the whole Sony vs. North Korea tempest of recent weeks, the true heroes of the saga will be America's Independent cinema owners. League, a slacker unafraid of hackers, stepped up when Sony and mainstream theater chains pulled the funny, low-rent satire about bumbling journalists hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Essentially his message to the Sony suits was wrapped in First Amendment sentiment: Alamo theaters, of which he owns 19, would never be intimidated by a punk North Korean dictator. In the days before Christmas, League networked with fellow members of Art House Convergence, an association of independent theater owners. He co-signed a group petition, delivered to Sony last week, urging that ""The Interview"" be screened across America. ""I was disappointed that Sony stepped back,"" he admits, but was pleased the company ""regrouped"" in time for Christmas Day. His only mild regret is that the film became available in the United States on Google Play, YouTube Movies and to the customers of Microsoft's Xbox video before the Alamo got to premiere it. ""It made sense though,"" he admits, ""that Sony used digital outlets."" What impressed League about his stoked audience was the palpable unity of purpose. They came as patriots for a cause. All performances of ""The Interview"" sold out instantly in a community stance supporting freedom of expression in Austin. ""We now consider 'The Interview' an art-house film,"" he laughs, ""even though it's very far removed from typical art-house fare."" When I spoke with League he was beaming yuletide happiness, drinking a can of Four Loko (an energy-alcoholic beverage he calls the ""perfect Christmas drink""). We discussed his all seasons' heroes -- Kroger Babb and William Castle -- both razzle-dazzle movie promoters of a bygone era. By turning ""The Interview"" into a Happening, in '60s parlance, League was carrying forward the iconic Babb-Castle torch. ""I'm no stranger to wearing costumes or being patriotic,"" League says. ""And everybody who bought tickets today is a goddamn, super-duper, American hero."" Just before ""The Interview"" began, a Woodstock Nation nostalgia swelled in the old-style theater. Only instead of marijuana the smell of wings, popcorn and fried pickles filled the air. I wondered what a Pyongyang spy would have thought of the orgy of jingoistic cheer and roadhouse food. Here, in Austin, at a place called the Alamo, Americans were defending their right to popular culture in all its spooky and kitschy guises. Off-duty Austin police officers, full of holiday cheer, served as security for the showing. At one point, before the Greenwood video, an alarm went off. A firetruck rushed to the scene and determined it was an accident. That quick scare aside, the afternoon was a triumph of Christmas high jinks over the North Korean regime's grinch-like totalitarianism. In its own weird way, Austin did America proud.

"One of the biggest art heists in Los Angeles history began when a housekeeper left the home of an elderly bedridden couple. ""There was a small window of opportunity for the crime to have occurred,"" Los Angeles Police art theft detective Don Hrycyk said Friday. When the housekeeper returned, hooks appeared where paintings once hung. The elderly couple, Anton and Susan Roland, were too disabled to be aware of the daytime burglary in their home in Encino, California, authorities said. In all, 12 paintings were stolen, including a watercolor by Marc Chagall entitled ""Le Paysans"" and a water-based media on paper by Diego Rivera entitled ""Mexican Peasant."" It took six years for the FBI and Los Angeles investigators to receive a big break in the case in which a $200,000 reward was being offered: an overseas tipster gave information that ultimately led investigators to set up an undercover purchase of the paintings from a man in a West Los Angeles area hotel. Nine of the paintings were recovered in that operation in October, and those works are valued at up to $12 million, authorities told reporters Friday. The remaining three paintings are still being sought. ""This is the greatest value we've had in recent history,"" Hrycyk said of the $12 million art theft. $5 million bail . Raul Espinoza, 45, has been charged with receiving stolen property and has pleaded not guilty to the felony. He is being held on $5 million bail, said spokesman Ricardo Santiago of the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office. Espinoza's public defender wasn't immediately available for comment. Authorities are still investigating the case, the FBI's Bill Lewis said at Friday's press conference. Lewis is the assistant director in charge at the FBI in Los Angeles. The FBI and Los Angeles police believe other people were involved in the theft. The art was so valuable that the pieces would have been tough to fence, officials said. ""That's why these types of crimes don't make sense,"" Hrycyk said. ""Maybe a person has the ability to commit the crime ... but then to profit from it, it's going to be very difficult. As you can see, it's been six years since the crime occurred, and still the art was not sold. ""These things are one of a kind, irreplaceable and have historical and cultural value,"" he added. ""L.A. is the second largest area for the visual arts in this country, and we need to have the resources to pursue these types of crimes."" Mystery deepens . Investigators don't have good descriptions for the three other paintings, other than one was by Hungarian artist Endre Szasz. That's because the couple had a large amount of art in their home. The recovered paintings no longer have their frames. ""They are not in as good a shape as they were when they were taken, but luckily, for how they've been treated, they're not that bad,"" Hrycyk said. The Rolands died before the nine paintings were recovered. Anton Roland died four months after the theft and Susan Roland died earlier this year, authorities said. The art insurance company now owns the paintings after making a payout to the couple, but under typical policies, a family is allowed to buy back the art and regain title from the insurers, authorities said. In the meantime, a $25,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the conspirators, authorities said. ""The FBI and the LAPD will not give up on any investigation until we have been able to recover the artifacts and bring the people responsible to justice,"" the FBI's Lewis said. The paintings reclaimed . Here's a list of the recovered paintings: . ""Blue Bottle"" by Hans Hofmann, 1947, signed and dated lower right corner, 49 3/4"" x 62 1/8"" unframed.

"If Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016, Bill Clinton will be her closest political adviser and confidant. So when the former President laid out a detailed Democratic platform after being asked how he would advise a presidential candidate, the connection to Hillary Clinton's possible presidential run was not far from anyone's mind, including Bill Clinton's. ""Let's assume that you are advising a presidential candidate,"" Charlie Rose said in an interview that was taped Monday at the Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York. ""That's a heavy assumption,"" Bill Clinton said with a laugh. ""My advice has sometimes been welcome, sometimes not. Sometimes right and sometimes not."" Clinton said that in presidential campaigns, ""the past is relevant insofar as it's an indication of what might happen in the future,"" but he was clear to say that ""by and large, almost all elections are about the future."" Here are, according to Bill Clinton, the forward-looking policies a presidential candidate, and possibly a president, will have to focus on: . Economic growth: . ""Well first on the home front, we need a table plan that has the prospect of restoring more rapid growth that actually generates jobs and raises incomes and gives poor people a chance to work their way from poverty into the middle class. I think that's really important. The most likely way to do that is flowing investments into areas that we know will create a lot of jobs and that simultaneously will change the job mix."" Energy and infrastructure investment: . ""A much more vigorous orientation toward the future, that is making future-related investments like a modern electrical grid."" ""I think the most reasonable, easy, low-hanging fruit targets are a revived effort in the energy area and particularly in making all these buildings in America more efficient. And then other kinds of infrastructure."" Health care: . ""I think secondly, continuing to work on the health care system is important because the four-year hiatus we've had in health care inflation, we've got to keep it going. I don't care what anybody says; the federal health care law that expanded Medicaid to working people with low incomes and their kids was a big boon."" Education: . ""Then you've got to do, you've got to keep working on education and reform the student loan problem and figure out a way to deliver online or in person much more affordable higher education. And we have to erase, totally erase, the difference between technical and academic education."" Reforming the corporate tax rate: . ""We should bring the money home. The corporate money that's been lodged overseas can be brought home; the corporations have told us how to do it. Whether we like it or not, this inversion, this is their money. And we are going to have to have a more competitive corporate tax system.""","Bill Clinton lays out Democratic platform he would suggest for a presidential candidate .

"When you're a patient, you trust you're in good hands, but even the best doctor or nurse can make a mistake on you or someone you love. ""Mistakes are happening every day in every hospital in the country that we're just not catching,"" says Dr. Albert Wu, an internist at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Medical errors kill more than a quarter million people every year in the United States and injure millions. Add them all up and ""you have probably the third leading cause of death"" in the country, says Dr. Peter Pronovost, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital. The harm is often avoidable, and there are strategies you can use to help doctors and nurses get things right. Here's a list of 10 shocking medical mistakes and ways to not become a victim: . 1. Mistake: Treating the wrong patient      • Cause: Hospital staff fails to verify a patient's identity.     • Consequences: Patients with similar names are confused.     • Prevention: Before every procedure in the hospital, make sure the staff checks your entire name, date of birth and barcode on your wrist band.     • Example case: Kerry Higuera . 2. Mistake: Surgical souvenirs     • Cause: Surgical staff miscounts (or fails to count) equipment used inside a patient during an operation.     • Consequences: Tools get left inside the body.     • Prevention: If you have unexpected pain, fever or swelling after surgery, ask if you might have a surgical instrument inside you.     • Example case: Nelson Bailey . 3. Mistake: Lost patients     • Cause: Patients with dementia are sometimes prone to wandering.     • Consequences: Patients may become trapped while wandering and die from hypothermia or dehydration.     • Prevention: If your loved one sometimes wanders, consider a GPS tracking bracelet.     • Example case: Mary Cole . 4. Mistake: Fake doctors     • Cause: Con artists pretend to be doctors.     • Consequences: Medical treatments backfire. Instead of getting better, patients get sicker.     • Prevention: Confirm online that your physician is licensed.     • Example case: Sarafina Gerling . 5. Mistake: The ER waiting game     • Cause: Emergency rooms get backed up when overcrowded hospitals don't have enough beds.     • Consequences: Patients get sicker while waiting for care.     • Prevention: Doctors listen to other doctors, so on your way to the hospital call your physician and ask them to call the emergency room.     • Example case: Malyia Jeffers . 6. Mistake: Air bubbles in blood     • Cause: The hole in a patient's chest isn't sealed airtight after a chest tube is removed.     • Consequences: Air bubbles get sucked into the wound and cut off blood supply to the patient's lungs, heart, kidneys and brain. Left uncorrected the patient dies.     • Prevention: If you have a central line tube in you, ask how you should be positioned when the line comes out.     • Example case: Blake Fought7. Mistake: Operating on the wrong body part     • Cause: A patient's chart is incorrect, or a surgeon misreads it, or surgical draping obscures marks that denote the correct side of the operation.     • Consequences: The surgeon cuts into the wrong side of a patient's body.     • Prevention: Just before surgery, make sure you reaffirm with the nurse and the surgeon the correct body part and side of your operation.     • Example case: Jesse Matlock8. Mistake: Infection infestation     • Cause: Doctors and nurses don't wash their hands.     • Consequences: Patients can die from infections spread by hospital workers.     • Prevention: It may be uncomfortable to ask, but make sure doctors and nurses wash their hands before they touch you, even if they're wearing gloves.     • Example case: Josh Nahum . 9. Mistake: Lookalike tubes     • Cause: A chest tube and a feeding tube can look a lot alike.     • Consequences: Medicine meant for the stomach goes into the chest.     • Prevention: When you have tubes in you, ask the staff to trace every tube back to the point of origin so the right medicine goes to the right place.     • Example case: Alicia Coleman . 10. Mistake: Waking up during surgery     • Cause: An under-dose of anesthesia.     • Consequences: The brain stays awake while the muscles stay frozen. Most patients aren't in any pain but some feel every poke, prod and cut.     • Prevention: When you schedule surgery, ask your surgeon if you need to be put asleep or if a local anesthetic might work just as well.     • Example case: Erin Cook .

"The University of Arkansas has puts its head football coach, Bobby Petrino, on paid administrative leave after news that the passenger on the motorcycle he crashed this week was a 25-year-old female member of his staff. Petrino, 51, said Thursday that he had not initially divulged the presence of the passenger, Jessica Dorrell, in an effort to protect his family and avoid ""a previous inappropriate relationship from becoming public,"" according to a statement obtained by CNN affiliate KARK. The motorcycle crash took place Sunday, but the involvement of Dorrell -- a former Arkansas women's volleyball player who was recently named student athlete coordinator for the university's football team -- came to light after a police report was released. ""In hindsight, I showed a serious mistake in judgment when I chose not to be more specific about those details,"" Petrino said Thursday in the statement, as reported by KARK. Vice Chancellor and Director of Athletics Jeff Long said at a news conference Thursday that he had put Petrino on paid administrative leave while the university reviews the full extent of the motorcycle accident and those involved. Petrino apologized to his wife and four children, the university, his colleagues, students and ""the entire state of Arkansas."" He said he hoped to repair relationships with his family and the university and remain head coach of the Razorbacks. Petrino told the police that the sun and wind had caused him to lose control of the motorcycle and crash into a pile of dirt and tree limbs on the side of the road, according to the police report.","The University of Arkansas' head football coach crashed his motorcycle .

"(CNN) -- A small tribe of Indians in Paraguay who have had virtually no contact with the outside world won a legal battle this week when rights groups stopped a Brazilian company from continuing to bulldoze the forest to clear land for cattle ranches. About 2,000 members of the Ayoreo ethnic group live in 13 settlements in Bolivia and Paraguay. The Totobiegosode tribe, said to number no more than 300, is the last group of uncontacted Indians in South America outside the Amazon River basin, indigenous rights groups say. The Totobiegosode, who are part of the larger Ayoreo ethnic group, are nomadic Indians who hunt and fish, as well as gather fruit and honey and cultivate small temporary plots during the rainy season. They live communally, four to six families to a dwelling, in the dense forests of northwestern Paraguay. Two Brazilian companies have been rapidly clearing land the Totobiegosode live on, and the tribe has lost nearly 15,000 acres (about 6,000 hectares) this year, according to British-based Survival International, an advocacy organization for the rights of tribal people. A ruling Thursday by Paraguay's secretary of the environment canceled a special permit for one of the companies, Yaguarete Pora S.A., to clear the land. The legal battle is being waged by local groups such as GAT, an acronym in Spanish for People, Environment and Territory. The activist groups have undertaken the fight without the knowledge of the Totobiegosode. Indian rights proponents see Thursday's ruling as an important victory. ""This sends a very significant signal,"" said Jonathan Mazower, campaign coordinator for Survival International. ""Until now, the ranchers and the landowners have really had it all their own way. They are very politically powerful and well-funded. ... This may be a sign that the government is starting to get a grip on the situation."" As their territory has been gobbled up, some Totobiegosode have been spotted by other Indians retreating deeper into the vanishing jungle: a group of eight or nine men on one occasion, a smaller group several days earlier, Survival International reported in a release Friday. The problems for the larger Ayoreo ethnic group, who share a common language and culture and can be found in Bolivia and Paraguay, started about 50 years ago. Between 1959 and 1987, most Ayoreos were forced off their ancestral land, according to the World Rainforest Movement, which describes itself as international network of citizens' groups involved in efforts to defend the world's rainforests. About 2,000 Ayoreos live in 13 settlements: 10 in Bolivia and three in Paraguay, the rainforest group says. Only the Totobiegosode tribe still lives in the forest, without contact with other Ayoreos or foreigners, in an area known as Amotocodie. Although no one has any direct contact with the Totobiegosode still in the jungle, their presence can be seen by such signs as footprints and holes in trees that indicate they have been gathering honey, the rainforest group says. There also have been occasional sightings in the distance. Mazower said he interviewed a small group of Totobiegosode who made contact with the outside world in 2004 and who described what their life is like. ""We were always running,"" Mazower said one Indian told him. ""We would suddenly hear these bulldozers. We thought that it was a kind of monster that could smell us. We could see fire. We were very afraid, and we ran."" The bulldozers, Mazower said, are much larger than the commercial bulldozers seen at construction sites. Often, crews will string a chain between two bulldozers, which will move in tandem to cut down an increased number of trees. As a result, many groups of Totobiegosode are fragmented into isolated patches as they scatter, divided by areas with no forest and increasingly busy roads. Families can be separated, and their lives become increasingly difficult, Mazower said. By Survival International's reckoning, the forest where the Totobiegosode live is being destroyed at a faster rate than the Amazon jungle as a whole. Despite Thursday's ruling, some observers say the future of tribes still living in the jungle in Paraguay and elsewhere, particularly Brazil, does not bode well. ""It's almost impossible in some sense to protect these tribes,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based policy center. The reason, he said, is the same as it has been since the Western world started being colonized more than 500 years ago: ""There's a lot of money to be made.""","Totobiegosode tribe is among last uncontacted Indians in South America .
Ruling revokes permit for Brazilian company to clear forest .

"(CNN) -- The big draw to this year's ""Doctor Who"" Christmas special was the Doctor meeting Santa, but as usual, there ended up being a lot more to it than that. First thing's first, Nick Frost was brilliant casting in one of the best portrayals of Santa ever. And the story -- which involved dreams within dreams -- was classic ""Who,"" slyly acknowledging the fact that it was also paying tribute to ""Alien"" and ""The Thing From Another World."" (""There's a horror film called 'Alien'?"" the Doctor asked in shock. ""That's really offensive. No wonder everyone keeps invading you."") But the biggest question hanging over all was where things stood between the Doctor and Clara. As showrunner Steven Moffat put it in a recent call with the press, ""As (the last episode) ended, they parted forever, having lied to each other, and that is where we find them again. We don't just ignore it because it's Christmas."" Indeed, at one point, one of the parasitic aliens convinced Clara that her dead boyfriend Danny had been alive this whole time, and her encounter with the Doctor was the dream. Her final goodbye to a dream version of Danny was heartbreaking, but it still remained to be seen if she would ever travel with the Doctor. It certainly looked as though this was it -- following a terrific Christmas moment of the Doctor flying in Santa's sleigh -- when the Doctor saved Clara from an alien, only to find that she had aged many years. Clara fans had to have been overjoyed to see that this too was a dream, and Clara was ready to continue her journeys with the Doctor, all thanks to Santa and his signature tangerines. Fans on Twitter reacted on Christmas night in a mostly positive manner. ""That episode of Doctor Who actually made me cry!"" tweeted one fan while another tweeted ""#DoctorWhoChristmas restored my spirit and has me on the edge of my seat for season 9. All of time and space in a big blue box. Don't argue."" Some were less than enthused. ""Alright #doctorwhochristmas,"" tweeted one viewer. ""My thoughts: eh. Was I the only one hoping this would be the end for Clara? I just want a new companion for 12."" And yet another summed it all up with ""Recipe for #DoctorWhoChristmas: One part #Kafka, dash of #Kubrick 2 parts Ridley Scott & a side of #Capra."" .","Nick Frost makes a smashing Santa in ""Doctor Who"" special .

"(CNN) -- Moonshots are exciting, inspiring. But they are also expensive -- and not all of them work out like Apollo 11. So are they worth it? Should we focus time, money and energy on these kinds of ambitious scientific projects? The answer is yes. Think of it this way. Imagine that the Apollo moon landing had not succeeded. Would it still have been worth it? Almost certainly. After all, the challenge of getting to the moon and back meant coming up with all kinds of technological innovations and solutions that have then had almost miraculous commercial applications. For example, Apollo needed small computers for its trip. So NASA says it made a big purchase of a relatively new technology -- the integrated circuit, the technology behind what we now know as the microchip. The companies that pioneered this product -- firms such as Fairchild Semiconductor, whose alumni founded Intel -- partly had NASA to thank, the agency says, for the popularity of the technology that followed. The U.S. government, by buying the initial products, helped the computer revolution take off. And it's not just the microchip. GPS technology, which is now powering the next phase of the information revolution, was originally developed by the U.S. military. But it was only after the 1983 Soviet shooting down of a Korean Air Lines flight that the Reagan administration said it would share the technology so that civilian airplanes would not wander into restricted and dangerous territories. And it was only after the Cold War ended that the Clinton administration opened up the technology fully to commercial applications, which of course unleashed a flood of innovation that continues to this day.Â . Or consider the mapping of the human genome. According to the Battelle Memorial Institute, the federal government spent $3.8 billion on the massive project from 1990 to 2003, an amount few other entities could ever have afforded. But in leading the way, it encouraged others, and now a person's DNA can be sequenced for as little as $1,000. The impact on the economy of human genome sequencing from 1988 to 2010 was estimated by Battelle at almost $800 billion -- enough to support more than 310,000 jobs in 2010 alone. Reading all this, you might think the United States is on the right track. Alas, the problem is, it is not. Federal funding for research and development has barely been keeping up with inflation in recent years if you look at the numbers from the National Science Foundation. Since big entitlements such as Social Security are mandatory spending programs, it is discretionary spending, such as science, that often bears the brunt of the budget ax. Â And this cutting comes at a time when others around the world are moving fast. The United States has dominated the world of basic science for years, even decades. But recently, its share of global research and development has been falling -- from 37% of the total in 2001 to 30% in 2011, according to the National Science Foundation. As scientist Neal Lane points out, China is on course to surpass the United States in the percentage of its gross domestic product it spends on research and development in just a few years. It used to be that funding basic science was not a partisan issue. As Lane notes, a certain rock-ribbed Republican was a big proponent of basic research. Reagan said in a 1988 radio address: . ""The remarkable thing is that although basic research does not begin with a particular practical goal, when you look at the results over the years, it ends up being one of the most practical things government does. This is why I've urged Congress to devote more money to research. It is an indispensable investment in America's future."" Americans used to understand that moonshots inspire us, but that they also power America's future. Let's hope that today's politicians follow Reagan's advice and invest in science, research and development. Watch Fareed Zakaria GPS Sundays at 10am and 1pm ET.

"Yemeni women defiantly burned their traditional veils Wednesday in protest of President Ali Abdullah Saleh's brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrations. Thousands of women gathered in the capital, Sanaa, said witnesses. They carried banners that read: ""Saleh the butcher is killing women and is proud of it"" and ""Women have no value in the eyes in Ali Saleh."" They collected their veils and scarves in a huge pile and set it ablaze -- an act that is highly symbolic in the conservative Islamic nation, where women use their veils to cover their faces and bodies. It's the first time in the nine months of Yemen's uprising that such an event has occurred. Inspired by Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman's Nobel Peace Prize this month, more and more Yemeni women have taken to the streets and escalated their campaign for help from the international community. More than 60 women were attacked in October alone by the government, said protester Ruqaiah Nasser. Government forces are raiding homes and also killing children, she said. She said silence from tribal leaders on the matter is a ""disgrace."" ""We will not stay quiet and will defend ourselves if our men can't defend us,"" Nasser said. ""Tribes must understand they will not be respected by Yemeni women if they stay quiet while their women are being attacked by the Saleh regime. Tribes who ignore our calls are cowards and have no dignity."" ""Saleh is killing women and children and this is against tribal culture,"" she said. ""Where are their voices when we need them? It's a disgrace if they stay quiet."" The women's protests came after the Yemeni government announced a cease-fire Tuesday. But that did not appear to be holding. At least 10 people died and dozens were injured earlier Tuesday in clashes between Yemeni government security forces in the country's capital and the province of Taiz, medical officials reported. Yemen's government has said that opposition-supported militants are responsible for the violence. Saleh summoned the U.S. ambassador and reiterated a promise to sign an agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council in which he would step aside in exchange for immunity from prosecution, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. However, Saleh has repeatedly promised to sign the council-backed deal and not done so. The embattled leader has clung to power through the protracted protests.","The women gathered their veils and scarves in a pile and set it ablaze .

"(CNN) -- A rash of recent oil spills around the globe -- Bangladesh, Israel, Peru and New Zealand -- serve as reminders of the damage such spills can cause and of the important role responders can play in limiting such damage. Spill responders have several tools at their disposal, including chemical dispersants. However, the legacy of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico includes a public backlash against dispersants that stands to exacerbate environmental damage from future spills. Starting with Deepwater Horizon, dispersants seem to have become an environmental villain du jour, even creeping in to the popular vernacular. To control an oil spill that ultimately exceeded 40,000 square miles, responders released 1.8 million gallons of dispersant over 59 days -- an act that society has judged a bad idea. Even now when we talk about our research on this spill the loaded question inevitably surfaces: ""Just how bad was the dispersant?"" Many think the dispersants amplified damage and are continuing to harm marine life; some even believe that BP conspired with government responders to use them nefariously to conceal the most visible impacts of the spill. Based on our experience studying oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, that's a biased and incomplete understanding that may unduly influence decision-makers responsible for responding to future spills. Dispersants are not perfect, but they are certainly not new. Over six decades, they have evolved from highly toxic mixtures to safer formulations that have become a proven spill response tool. They work like dishwashing soap, by breaking apart oil into small droplets. When sprayed on an oil slick, the resulting microsize droplets freely mix into water, effectively breaking apart the gooey coating and diluting the oil over a greater volume. Both effects can be beneficial: Dilution of the oil reduces its overall toxicity, while breaking up the slick prevents oil from reaching coastlines, where oil is assumed to cause the greatest impact. But there are trade-offs. Dispersants contain hydrocarbons, emulsification agents and surfactants -- these could be harmful to marine life. Before the droplets get diluted to inconsequential levels, the dispersed oil can also be toxic. The chemical formulation of dispersants seems to elicit fear, but the reality is that most of these components are used for other common applications with minimal concern. For example, the principal active agent applied during Deepwater Horizon was dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, or DOSS, which has other uses in over-the-counter medicines. Nevertheless, accidental spraying of dispersant on people can also cause harm if it is inhaled or swallowed though it can be washed from the skin with soap and water. Dispersants are but one example of chemicals used when responding to environment crises. Flame retardants provide another example. Yet few blinked an eye when responders released 1.1 million gallons of flame retardant over several weeks to fight a 150-square-mile wildfire in California a few months ago. In responding to Deepwater Horizon, decision-makers had years of experience with dispersants. They knew the risks and benefits of their application to the surface of the ocean. They also had invaluable resources in the form of two comprehensive reports in 1989 and 2005 on dispersants' efficacy and effects, commissioned by the prestigious National Academy of Sciences and prepared by leaders from academia, industry, government and even a retired commercial fisherman. But neither report addressed the way dispersants were to be used in the Deepwater Horizon disaster. For 87 days after the Deepwater Horizon exploded, oil gushed from a damaged well 5,000 feet under the sea surface, an unprecedented scenario. It demanded unprecedented mitigation approaches. Weighing the potential risks and benefits, responders made the decision to inject dispersants at the ocean floor as a means to disperse the oil even before it reached the surface. Public concern over this decision grew as the amount released in this way ultimately reached 771,000 gallons (a little less than half of the total amount of dispersants released). In choosing to use subsea dispersants, decision-makers first evaluated their efficacy with a one-day test. Before-and-after photos showed that slicks near the well site diminished when the dispersant was injected and returned, as predicted, when the injections were stopped. As scientists, we hold to the repeatability of experimental results, but in this case the result produced immediate benefits in a crisis situation that trumped the value of conducting further experiments. The smaller slicks reduced toxic chemical levels in the air enough to allow personnel on about 100 response boats to work more safely. As a result, efforts to contain the spill could proceed at a faster pace with fewer negative health effects. The fact that we as independent scientists were granted safe access to within 1,500 feet of the well is partially attributable to the use of dispersants at the seafloor. What is lost on many people is that spill responders must decide quickly on whether to apply dispersants. Like those responding to forest fires, oil-spill responders are charged with reducing damages in the face of a crisis, and they don't have the luxury to conduct a real-time case study on dispersants' efficacy. Ultimately, usage is simply a question of net environmental benefit. Unfortunately, gauging the success or failure of dispersants, especially how toxic they make seawater, isn't easy. You cannot give the Gulf of Mexico a CT scan. Moreover, we have only sparse data to inform our understanding of dispersants' efficacy and chemical behavior in the deep ocean. In a recent study, our colleagues found traces of dispersant in oiled sand patties on beaches. But the proportion of dispersant in oil from the Gulf beaches was low compared with the proportion at which it was originally applied. That is, the dispersants were less likely to persist than the oil. It can be counterintuitive -- and frightening -- to add chemical dispersants to fight oil spills. But dispersants are tools that help stop a bad thing from getting worse -- not so different from dropping flame retardant on forest fires. Experience underpins the decision to use them, and research, so far, supports their use. Fear, ignorance and anger preclude an objective examination of dispersants. Let's have a rational discussion about the best course of action in a crisis -- before the next oil spill hits our shores and clouds our judgment.

"Disrupted PlayStation and Xbox networks frustrated gamers much of Friday, one day after going down on one of the busiest gaming days of the year. Neither Sony or Microsoft, which own PlayStation and Xbox, respectively, have had much to say about the outages that have kept millions of its gamers from playing one another online, but there were signs Friday evening that it may soon be resolved. At 2:16 a.m Friday, Microsoft's verified @XboxSupport account tweeted ""Some Xbox One users may currently be experiencing issues signing into Xbox Live,"" and directed users to its service website for the latest. Sony's official PlayStation support Twitter account posted at 2:30 a.m. ET, ""Our engineers are continuing to work hard to resolve the network issues users have experienced today. Thanks for your continued patience."" More than 14 hours later, at 5:10 p.m, it tweeted pretty much the same thing. ""Update: We are working to restore full network services for all platforms -- thanks, as always, for your patience! But based on the overall sentiment expressed in the comments posted to message boards and on Twitter, the collective patience among PlayStation users is offline as well. ""@AskPlayStation has been tweeting that for hours now since last night,"" user christopha710 posted on Sony's PlayStation 4 support forum. ""I'm getting rid of this piece of trash and going back too [sic] pc gaming"" ""Totally not cool,"" allenjaelee said late Friday morning. ""I've tried so many times and am unable to play."" Sony hacked again? Some users talked of a possible hack. ""This is so frustrating,"" wrote calin75. ""The hackers think they're hurting Sony, but the ones that really pay for this bull crap are the innocent users."" If it turns out that this was indeed a cyberattack, chances are it was done by Lizard Squad, a band of black-hat hackers who have claimed responsibility. CNN cannot confirm the identity or claims of the group, and PlayStation hasn't said anything beyond that it was working to fix the problem. For its part, Xbox spokesman Sean McCarthy told CNN that ""we don't share info on the root cause of specific issues."" But there is little reason to doubt their claims. In August, Lizard Squad said it took down the PlayStation Network by flooding it with illegitimate traffic, something called a distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) in the video game world, resulting in millions of gamers being unable to play together online. As CNNMoney reported at the time, when John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, tweeted about those ""large scale"" attacks, he became a target himself -- even at 30,000 feet. ""We have been receiving reports that @j_smedley's plane #362 from DFW to SAN has explosives on-board, please look into this,"" the group tweeted to American Airlines, resulting in the flight being diverted. Earlier this month, Sony was hit with a similar outage that Lizard Squad not only took credit for, but it  promised additional ""Christmas presents"" would soon be coming. ""Unlike Santa, we don't like giving all of our Christmas presents out on one day. This entire month will be entertaining,"" Lizard Squad tweeted. At 6:13 p.m. Friday, a Lizard Squad twitter handle tweeted, ""ALL ATTACKS ON PSN AND XBOX HAVE STOPPED."" When a CNN reporter hit refresh moments later on the Sony Entertainment Network website -- which had been down since Thursday evening -- it was back online. Microsoft's service page was still reporting 'limited service,' however. Stupid coincidence? The network downtime started just hours after Microsoft's Xbox video store started to stream the Seth Rogen comedy ""The Interview."" The movie was made by Sony Pictures, a sibling of Sony's PlayStation division. Sony was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late November that was widely believed to be motivated, at least in part, by North Korea's anger over ""The Interview,"" which depicts the assassination of the country's leader Kim Jong Un. But there was no indication that Thursday's problems were in any way connected to the movie's digital release. Other participating distributors of the movie, such as YouTube, were unaffected. And PlayStation is not participating in the release. A Sony Pictures spokesman deferred to PlayStation for comment about the outage.","PlayStation, Xbox had 'network issues' well into Friday .

"When exactly did once-lowly kale become an international locavore staple? Not sure, but let's call it 2011, when Gwyneth Paltow made kale chips on TV with Ellen DeGeneres. What's that got to do with a list of great veg eateries around the world? We're not sure -- we just know that, like the rest of the world, we've been spending more time lately eating plants we'd never heard of when we were kids and seeking out an evolving supply of incredible vegetarian options while traveling. From the world's only city with an all-vegan strip mall to those with large Hindu and Buddhist populations and a huge variety of options, the following vegetarian-friendly destinations have imaginative restaurants with cult-like followings. Some of the cities on this list are obvious choices, while others, like Glasgow, Scotland, have only recently forayed in any significant way into vegetarian cuisine. Here are our top 10 choices for herbivores who travel. Portland, Oregon . From vegetarian/vegan-friendly bed-and-breakfasts to the world's only all-vegan strip mall, compassionate choices rule many establishments in this city. We recommend: Natural Selection, the brainchild of California Culinary Academy graduate Aaron Woo. With European-style decor and fare derived from France, Italy and Spain, this excellent restaurant serves dishes such as chard and mushroom gnocchi and caramelized cauliflower with polenta, using local vegetables and fruits at their seasonal peak. The menu changes weekly. Natural Selection, 3033 N.E. Alberta St., Portland, Oregon; +1 503 288 5883 . New York . The chance of blindly stumbling into a vegetarian restaurant is probably higher in New York than in any other U.S. city. While there's seemingly no end of diversity, from raw restaurants like Pure Food & Wine to farm-to-table Candle Cafe, our latest favorite is the amazingly creative Dirt Candy. Yes, there's a wait to get a reservation -- the restaurant has only nine tables -- but we love the thoughtful, complex dishes and emphasis on a star ingredient per dish. Dirt Candy, 430 E. Ninth St., New York; +1 212 228 7732 . Chennai, India . As the ancient birthplace of vegetarianism, South India is largely vegetarian. The states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu offer extremely spicy rice-based dishes and curries, while tiffin items like dosas, tamarind and lemon rice are common. Vegetarian thalis (platters with a few curries, rice dishes and breads) cost less than a Starbucks latte. We recommend: Madras restaurant for delicious South Indian home-style cooking. Madras, Raintree Hotels, 636 Anna Salai, Teynampet, Chennai, India; +91 44 4393 9999 . Chiang Mai, Thailand . Thanks to a large Buddhist population, Chiang Mai has more than 80 vegetarian restaurants. Even those that aren't vegetarian-specific offer meatless tom yum soup, pad thai, salads and coconut-milk based curries. We recommend: Pun Pun, which sources organic vegetables from its own farm. Curries are served on banana leaves. Pun Pun has two locations in the city: Wat Suan Dok temple or Suthep Road near Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; +66 81 470 1461 . Glasgow, Scotland . It may come as a surprise to many that PETA named Glasgow the best city for vegans in the United Kingdom in 2013. The growing number of vegan restaurants is part of the city's effort to improve the health of its residents and the result of its vibrant youth culture. We recommend: Mono Cafe Bar in the Merchant City area. The bar brews its own beer and offers a home-style meatless menu including refried bean burritos. Music from folk singers, songwriters and the operatic crowd is a plus. Mono Cafe Bar,12 Kings Court, Glasgow, Scotland; +44 141 553 2400 . London . PETA ranked London the most vegetarian-friendly city in the world in 2009. It's still a top site for meat-free eaters. With more than 130 vegetarian-centric restaurants, spicy vegetarian curry houses are as plentiful as pubs offering fish and chips. Nowadays, even pubs are serving meatless cuisine and raw food -- notable newcomer Redemption is an example. We recommend: Arguably London's most well known vegetarian restaurant, Food for Thought in Covent Garden serves everything from Mexican to Indian dishes, cheese and dill scones to quiches. The carefully chosen menu is inexpensive and satisfying. Food for Thought, 31 Neal St., Covent Garden, London; +44 20 7836 0239 . Seoul, South Korea . While it's best to double check with the server if there's any meat in the bibimbap, vegetarian dishes are common on Korean menus. There's kimchi, of course, and a wide variety of veggie pancakes and side dishes, good news for any vegetarian visitor who may get dragged to a barbecue restaurant. We recommend: Traditional Korean vegetarian restaurant Hangwachae in Seoul serves house-made condiments from chili paste to soy bean paste. Even the rice is made with 20 different Asian herbs. Hangwachae, Gwanhun-dong Jongno-gu, Seoul 30-9,  Cheong-A Building, B/1; +82 2 720 2802 . Vancouver, British Columbia . In the last year or so, Vancouver has seen notable restaurants including the Heirloom, The Parker and The Acorn open to meet rising vegetarian demand. We recommend: The Acorn, which received a Top Ten Best New Restaurants mention in En Route Magazine, the first vegetarian restaurant ever to snag the honor. Vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free and raw junkies can sample a seasonal menu created with fruits and legumes from apples to Hen of the Woods. The artfully composed dishes look like they belong in a museum. The Acorn, 3995 Main St., Vancouver, British Columbia; +1 604 566 9001 . Jordan . It's so easy to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants in Jordan where mezze dishes such as tabouleh, hummus, falafel and gourmet Arabic flatbreads abound. From Beit Sitti (it means ""my grandmother's kitchen"" in Arabic), located in the heart of Amman, to Petra's Kitchen, there are good options at nearly every bend of the country. We recommend: Feynan, an ecolodge in the heart of the mountainous Dana Biosphere Reserve. In a candle-lit environment, visitors feast on flat breads baked by Bedouins, vegetarian stews, hibiscus juices, falafel, hummus and sticky knafeh for dessert. Feynan, Dana Biosphere Reserve (western edge), off Dead Sea-Aqaba Highway, Ma'an, Jordan; +962 6 464 5580 . Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . A melting pot of cultures from China to India, Kuala Lumpur has more than 86 vegetarian-specific restaurants according to online healthy eating guide HappyCow. Chinese, Malay and Indian cuisines are common. We recommend: The inexpensive Gopala Vegetarian Restaurant, which features a potpourri of cultural cuisines from Thai to Indian. The vegetarian satay and vegetarian fried rice earn raves. Gopala Vegetarian Restaurant, No. 59, Jalan Thambipillai, Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; +60 3 2274 1959 .","We picked our favorite vegetarian restaurant in vegetarian-friendly cities .

"(CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has penned a letter to President Obama, telling his American counterpart that Iran is Obama's only option for success, state-run media reported. ""Obama has only one way to remain in power and be successful. This way is Iran,"" Ahmadinejad said in a nationally televised speech Tuesday, according to the Iranian Republic News Agency (IRNA). ""Obama should start cooperation with Iran in practice,"" he said. ""I have written a letter to Obama which will be published soon."" Ahmadinejad spoke just days after the conclusion of a 47-nation nuclear summit convened by Obama to raise global awareness of the threat of nuclear terrorism. The White House has been pressing for a fourth round of United Nations sanctions on Iran for its nuclear ambitions. Iran says its nuclear programs are designed for civilian use. ""The time when they imagine that they can do any harm on Iran is over,"" Ahmadinejad said, according to IRNA. The Iranian leader urged cooperation between the Islamic republic and America. He said Iran was not the nation that was being isolated. Instead, he said, it was the United States that was in that position. ""We don't need you to do anything for us to come out of isolation, rather we want to help you come out of isolation,"" he said. ""Once [the United States was] at the height of glory,"" he said. ""Now they are collapsing. They have many economic and cultural problems. They have security problems in the world and their influence in Iraq and Afghanistan is vanishing."" He said the United States would like to dominate the Middle East but cannot do so without Iran. The nuclear issue, he said, veils America's real intentions. Obama, he said, was put in the White House for America to show a new face to the world. ""I sent him a message and told him that we welcome change, but we didn't see any genuine change. Superficial changes do not matter,"" Ahmadinejad said, referring to America's ties to Israel. In 2006, Ahmadinejad wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush in which he proposed ""new ways"" to end a standoff regarding Iran's nuclear program. That was the first publicly acknowledged correspondence between the leaders of the two countries since 1980, just after the Iranian revolution that ousted the shah.","Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad writes letter to President Obama .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)A 13-year-old Nigerian girl told reporters that her father handed her over to Islamist militants to become a suicide bomber, but she fled as two other girls detonated their explosives at a market earlier this month. The girl was presented before the media Wednesday to describe what she called her forced role in the deadly attack. Her father, she said, joined Boko Haram and took his wife and daughter to a village in the forest in Bauchi state in northern Nigeria. ""My father took us to the bush, which was surrounded by gunmen,"" she said, according to a CNN translation. ""I was asked if I wanted to go to heaven. When I answered, they said I have to go for a suicide mission and if I attempted to run they would kill me."" The girl and two others were taken by Boko Haram militants to Nigeria's second most populous city, Kano, and were dressed with explosives-laden devices. The other girls set off hidden bombs that day, killing four people, police said. ""One of the girls said one of us should enter the market first,"" the girl told reporters. ""She said we should separate when we entered the market."" The girl described how one attacker said the third girl would set off her bomb first, then the remaining two would detonate their explosives. ""I said no. I said I would not detonate,"" the girl said. She was wounded by one of the explosions. The teen escaped in a rickshaw that she took to a former home in Kano, the girl said. Neighbors saw her and made her go to a hospital. She left the explosive device in the cart, but the driver and hospital officials recognized the device and alerted authorities. The girl told police she was forced into being a part of the attack. What to know about Boko Haram . CNN has not independently verified the girl's story.  Police presented her to the media without her parents or a lawyer present. Officials wanted to make clear the attack was the work of Boko Haram. ""We want to disabuse the minds of members of the public. ... This is not a tribal war. It's a terrorism act like we have had in the past,"" Kano State Police Commissioner Adenerele Shinabad said. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. Violence has increased sharply in recent months, just ahead of Nigeria's February elections. Schoolgirl describes escape from Boko Haram . The group has targeted mainstream Islam, saying that it does not represent the interests of Nigeria's 80 million Muslims and that it perverts Islam. In April, Boko Haram militants drew international condemnation when they kidnapped more than 200 schoolgirls, many of whom they said they sold into slavery. At least 5,000 people have died at Boko Haram's hands, according to a U.S. Congressional Research Service report, making it one of the world's deadliest terrorist organizations. Why outrage alone will not defeat Boko Haram and #BringBackOurGirls . CNN's Aminu Abubakr reported from Kano and Steve Almasy wrote in Atlanta.

"(CNN)Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox Live gaming networks experienced widespread problems on Christmas Day as a hacker group claimed responsibility for what it said was an attack. Hundreds of users took to Twitter to report problems with the systems, which lasted much of the day. ""With the #Xbox hacking shutdown going on I'm watching my 15 year old nephew meltdown: 'I've got nothing else to do!!!!'"" Jim Crilley Jr. wrote on the social messaging site. The problem persisted for hours, but Thursday night Xbox Live briefly posted a message on its support website saying: ""Were you having a hard time signing in to Xbox Live? If so, we're glad to say we've reached a solution! You can once again sign in without any issues. Thanks for hanging in there while we worked. We appreciate it!"" But many PlayStation users were still having difficulty logging on to their network. Gamers were able to play games offline, but couldn't communicate with other players or make use of network functions. The hacker group Lizard Squad said earlier it was ""smacking"" the two systems, apparently one of several attacks in December. The group took responsibility for keeping each network down earlier this month on separate occasions. On Thursday, the group asked for retweets in exchange for ending the problem, which could be a distributed denial of service attack. That's when hackers flood networks with illegitimate traffic, overwhelming the ability of the servers. The problem might be exacerbated by video gamers who received new systems for Christmas and were adding to the potential traffic on one of the busiest gaming days of the year. The network downtime started just hours after Microsoft's Xbox video store started to stream the Seth Rogen comedy ""The Interview."" The movie was made by Sony Pictures, a sibling of Sony's PlayStation division. Sony was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late November that was widely believed to be motivated, at least in part, by North Korea's anger over ""The Interview,"" which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong Un. But there was no indication that Thursday's problems were in any way connected to the movie's digital release. Other participating distributors of the movie, such as YouTube, were unaffected. And PlayStation is not participating in the release. A Sony Pictures spokesman deferred to PlayStation for comment about the outage. CNN's Brian Stelter contributed to this report.","Some Xbox users finally able to log on to network .

"The nerds are all right. The technologists who built the Democratic Party's data-driven approach to campaigning are saddened by the results of the 2014 midterms, a political drubbing that not even even the sharpest get-out-the-vote operation could prevent. But they are taking heart in a durable truth: Even as Republicans made impressive strides in digital and data-driven campaigning in 2014, Democrats retain a culture of innovation and an army of campaign geeks that far outpaces their GOP foes. ""It goes back to the Obama campaign of 2008, but even before that,"" said Tom Bonier, CEO of the Democratic data firm TargetSmart. ""So many people came out of the woodwork in that campaign, people with PhDs, statisticians, programmers, developers, people who ran tech-start ups. A lot of them went back to their jobs, but so many of them stayed around. They created new companies, they worked on the 2012 campaign, they work at the party committees. They are everywhere."" Republicans have gloated about their advancements in campaign science since being infamously outclassed by President Barack Obama's voter turnout operation in 2012. After a much better year in 2014, they point with pride to new data programs that allowed GOP campaigns to better identify and persuade voters. ""Democrats were telling reporters all the way up to Election Day that their data would be the difference and they would keep the Senate,"" said Chuck DeFeo, the Republican National Committee's chief digital officer. ""As a Republican, I'm glad to hear that they still believe in their data advantage and look forward to 2016."" But even the GOP's top digital strategists continue look with envy at the technological ecosystem that Democrats and their allies have constructed over the course of a decade. ""They are a couple steps ahead in technology, but light years ahead in culture,"" said Wesley Donehue, the president of Push Digital, a Republican communications firm. ""Democrats put a larger emphasis on digital and data and technology, they put more money into it, they are better at sharing it. Republicans are much more guarded in sharing their resources."" Culture gap . The culture gap on vivid display this month at RootsCamp, a two-day ""un-conference"" — their phrase — of more than 2,500 progressive activists and campaign pros who gather yearly in Washington to drink, talk shop and swap lessons from the election season that was. There is nothing like it on the right. One fearful Republican blogger called it ""The Left's New Death Star."" The gathering — run by the New Organizing Institute, a progressive outfit that trains activists and operatives in the fields of data, digital and organizing — has blossomed since its heady inception in 2006. Back then, when ""netroots"" activists were demanding a seat at the Democratic Party table after John Kerry's presidential loss, the event was an amateurish meet-up of some 200 web-obsessed Democrats who convened in coffee shops and college classrooms in Washington, Brooklyn, and Denver to plot strategy. Today, RootsCamp feels like a Vegas tech expo for Democrats. Participants at the Washington Convention Center wandered through a job fair that showcased vendors, labor unions, data houses and political committees from across the progressive spectrum. AFSCME, SEIU, Emily's List, MoveOn.org, ActBlue, Civis Analytics, BlueState Digital, NGP VAN, Salsa Labs, Mobile Commons, the Analyst Institute, Catalist — all of them were eagerly swapping business cards with the next generation of Democratic whiz kids. Panels and training sessions starred political directors and digital gurus from the Democratic National Committee, Planned Parenthood, NextGen Climate, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee who walked audience members — many of them field organizers and young digital staffers from various midterm races — through the micro-tactics that worked in 2014 and the ones that didn't. One official from NextGen, the environmental group founded by Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, told a room that the group identified over 350,000 ""climate action"" voters with the help of five in-house data staffers and a rigorous field program. The organization ran 21 field experiments this cycle, testing whether black-and-white mail worked better than color, or if combining messages (""climate and choice"") in certain states made a bigger impact on voters than climate-messaging alone (it did). The unapologetically dorky breakout sessions had titles like ""OMG! SMS for GOTV"" and ""Simple tricks to up your A/B testing game."" One pink-clad speaker took to a podium to recruit female attendees to the free ""women-only"" coding classes she was running. In the hallways between panels, conversations could seem downright exotic to the untrained ear, as conference-goers joked about ""ROC curves"" and ""sucky U.I.s."" While Democrats on Capitol Hill were debating a controversial omnibus spending bill that threatened to keep Congress in town through Christmas, the Democrats at RootsCamp were still focused on the nitty-gritty of campaign life, trying to work out the bugs before 2016 and find the best ways to streamline the software platforms, user interfaces and voter data that campaigns now rely on. If anyone had hang-ups about revealing their hard-earned intel to potential competitors, they weren't talking. Information-sharing, the thinking at RootsCamp goes, isn't just good for Democrats at the ballot box — it's good for business. Annie Wang, a data scientist from Civis Analytics, a targeting firm born out of Obama's 2012 campaign, was one of dozens of presenters at the conference promoting products that make campaigning easier and more efficient. 'Democratize data science' ""We are trying to democratize data science, so that organizers throughout the progressive universe can have these data tools at their disposal,"" Wang told an eager crowd during a plenary session called ""Disrupt 2016."" Across town at DNC Headquarters, national party officials tapped the assembled brain power for a day-long post-mortem with over thirty digital directors and data scientists from state Democratic parties and some of the year's biggest Senate and gubernatorial campaigns, including those of Wendy Davis, Charlie Crist, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Michelle Nunn. The election results were chastening for the Democratic tech community, said Matt Compton, the DNC's digital director. ""It was a very strong reminder that even the best organizing in the world really only has an impact on the margins,"" he said. ""It's important to acknowledge that atmospheres still matter, and the American people will have their say regardless of technology you are going to produce."" But Compton said the party's geek squad won, in a sense, by losing. He gushed over the ability of Democrats to ""scale down"" the tactics of the 2012 presidential campaign to the statewide and congressional level without having the kind of big budget that Obama relied on. And importantly, Compton said, running from behind forces campaigns to re-think their strategies and test new tools and methods. ""If you are behind, you are willing to take more risks, to do things you were not willing to try before,"" Compton said.  ""If you are in a really tight race, that means that your budget constraints can be tighter and that sometimes forces you to bring more things in-house or to look for things that can be more efficient, or develop a tool that's going to help you save money."" He pointed specifically to the campaigns of Nunn in Georgia, which polished their online fundraising practices by matching their email list against Facebook and testing how potential donors responded to various messages, and the Crist campaign in Florida, which invented a new tool that helped Democrats sign up online to vote by mail. The Crist campaign tool would check a voter's submission on CharlieCrist.com against the voter file at the DNC to make sure their address matched their voter registration. If it did, an email was sent from the voter's email to address to the local supervisor of elections to request a ballot. ""No printing, no stamps, nada,"" said Amanda Litman, the campaign's digital director. In the end, nearly 20,000 Florida voters obtained ballots using the tool. Litman said their models showed most of them were sporadic voters. ""Democrats this cycle may have lost, but we raised the bar on what statewide and down-ballot races can accomplish online,"" Litman said. ""We worked together to innovate, test, share best practices, and build a stronger network and pipeline of talent."" Kassia DeVorsey, an MIT-educated analytics specialist who was one of the ""cave dwellers"" in the Obama campaign's dimly-lit Chicago data office, estimated that Democratic campaigns around the country had about 100 data scientists working on their races, with another 100 doing work on independent expenditures and issue campaigns. None of them were rookies. ""These are folks with rich experience with data tools,"" she said. But DeVorsey and others who came to Washington for RootsCamp stressed, over and over again, that nothing in campaign politics is static. Republicans continue to innovate, issues change, and the technology and data that campaigns rely on is always evolving — from Facebook's API to the information contained in the Democrats' national voter file. ""Our tools are only as good and useful as they can be used in practice,"" DeVorsey said. ""If we spend a lot of time creating the most the awesome Phillips head screwdriver and what organizers really need is a flat-head, then we have completely failed at our mission ... The ongoing commitment on the Democratic side to testing will really help optimize things going forward.""","GOP is making gains in technology .

"Army, paramilitary and police troops have intensified counter-insurgency operations in Assam in the wake of Tuesday's tribal militant raid, which left at least 72 people killed in India's remote tea-producing state, a defense spokesman said. ""The army is going out with full intensity,"" Lt. Col. Suneet Newton, an Indian military spokesman from Assam, told CNN Friday. Army-led joint operations have been scaled up in all troubled districts of the state, including Kokrahar and Sonitpur, where Bodo extremists carried out a series of deadly attacks on other tribal communities earlier this week, Newton said. Meantime, federal authorities have despatched 5,000 additional armed police to Assam, according to state Inspector General S.N. Singh. At least 72 people were killed in the assault by Bodo militants on Tuesday, Singh said. Separately, three people died when police fired at violent mobs trying to storm a police station in Sonitpur district on Wednesday, Singh told CNN. On Thursday, Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh termed the militant strike in Assam a ""massacre"" as he vowed to pursue what he called a ""time-bound action against terror."" He also ruled out talks with outfits indulging in ""cold-blooded murder,"" according to a home ministry statement. As part of anti-insurgent efforts in Assam, India said it was also reaching out to its eastern neighbors for assistance. India's seven northeastern states are wedged between China, Bhutan, Myanmar and Bangladesh, and reports have emerged that Bodo militants might be hiding out beyond Indian territory. Sushma Swaraj, India's external-affairs minister, already has contacted the Bhutanese leadership ""at the highest level,"" spokesman Syed Akbaruddin told reporters in New Delhi. ""We are also working on having contacts with others who could possibly help us in this matter. Once that is completed, I will share those details with you,"" Akbaruddin said. India's impoverished northeast region, where Assam is located, has a high concentration of extremist groups from different backgrounds with conflicting ethnic and political interests. Members of the Bodo tribe, an indigenous group, have fought for decades for political autonomy. They also have long-standing tensions with Muslim settlers in Assam. But on Tuesday they attacked members of non-Assamese tribal people who have lived in the state since before India got independence in 1947, Inspector General S.N. Singh said.","India reaching out to neighboring nations for assistance as it pursues militants .

"(CNN) -- The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced Friday that it has downgraded the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from its top rank of AAA. ""The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics,"" the agency said about the move, which was announced after the markets had closed. Rating agencies -- S&P, Moody's and Fitch -- analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower's ability to repay its loans. The safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where U.S. debt has stood for years. Moody's first assigned the United States a AAA rating in 1917. Fitch and Moody's, the other two main credit ratings agencies, maintained the AAA rating for the United States after this week's debt deal, though Moody's lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to ""negative."" A negative outlook indicates the possibility that Moody's could downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating within a year or two. John Chambers, the head of sovereign ratings at S&P, told CNN that the political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling proved to be a key issue, with ""the U.S. government getting to the last day before they had cash-management problems."" Few governments separate the budget process from the debt-authorization process as the United States does, he noted. And, though the budget deal that finally was reached will deliver at least $2.1 trillion in savings over the next decade, that will not suffice, he said. ""It's going to be difficult to get beyond that -- at least in the near term -- and you do need to get beyond that to get to a point where the debt-to-GDP ratio is going to stabilize."" Asked who was to blame, Chambers said, ""This is a problem that's been a long time in the making -- well over this administration, the prior administration."" Congress should shoulder some of the blame, he said. ""The first thing it could have done is to have raised the debt celining in a timely manner so that much of this debate had been avoided to begin with, as it had done 60 or 70 times since 1960 without that much debate."" Chambers added that his agency's decision is likely to have a long-term impact. ""Once you lose your AAA, it doesn't usually bounce back,"" he said. He pointed to the decision by Congress about whether to extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts as one crucial area. ""If you let them lapse for the high-income earners, that could give you another $950 billion,"" he said. U.S. Treasury officials received S&P's analysis Friday afternoon and alerted the agency to an error that inflated U.S. deficits by $2 trillion, said an administration official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. The agency acknowledged the mistake, but said it was sticking with its decision. The administration official called it ""a facts-be-damned decision ... Their analysis was way off, but they wouldn't budge."" But Chambers defended his agency's move. ""It doesn't make a material difference,"" he said. ""It doesn't change the fact that your debt-to-GDP ratio, under most plausible assumptions, will continue to rise over the next decade."" Rumors of a possible downgrade surfaced shortly after Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi announced in Rome that finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations may meet ""in a few days"" to discuss the sagging world economy. The G7 members are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. The announcement came on a day when financial anxiety gripped the globe. Stock markets worldwide saw intense volatility amid worries of a widening debt crisis in Europe and a stalled economic recovery in the United States. Stock market values fell across Asia and Europe on Friday. American markets were dramatically up and down a day after having their worst day since the 2008 financial crisis. Concerns about debt issues in Europe appeared to battle with optimism that a positive U.S. jobs report indicated the American economy is not headed into a new recession -- the dreaded ""double-dip."" ""The crisis in Europe is quickly becoming on par with the financial crisis of 2008,"" David Levy, portfolio manager at Kenjol Capital Management, told CNN Money. ""The jobs report shows that things aren't getting much worse in the U.S., but the focus is clearly on Europe at this point."" The Dow Jones index spiked 170 points in early trading on a better-than-expected jobs report, but then dropped by 200 points in mid-morning trading. It closed Friday up 60.93 points (0.54%). The Nasdaq closed down 23.98 points (0.94%). In London, the FTSE 100 closed off 146 points, or 2.7%, to close the week down nearly 10%. Germany's DAX fell 2.78% to finish the week down nearly 13%. And the French CAC 40 declined 1.26% to finish the week off 10.73%. ""We are going to get through this,"" Obama said prior to the downgrade at the Washington Navy Yard, where he announced a jobs program for veterans. ""Things will get better. And we're going to get there together."" Obama, who spoke Friday afternoon with France's Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel about the crisis, noted that July marked the 17th consecutive month of private-sector job growth in the U.S., but said much more work needs to be done.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's new defense minister said his country would respond with airstrikes if North Korea attacks it again, South Korean state media reported Friday. It is some of the strongest rhetoric since the conflict broke out late last month. ""We will definitely air raid North Korea,"" Kim Kwan-jin said at his confirmation hearing when asked how the South would respond if struck again, according to the official Yonhap News Agency. Kim was appointed defense minister last week amid growing tensions on the Korean peninsula following an exchange of gunfire between the two sides. His comments reflect a potential shift in South Korea's policy toward provocations from the North. Previously, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak warned of severe consequences if the North launched another attack, but declined to name specifics. ""If the North commits any additional provocations against the South, we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail,"" he said in a nationally televised address Monday. Han Park, an expert on North Korea who has visited the country more than 50 times, called Kim's comments ""an important development."" ""The use of airstrikes is quite significant,"" said Park, a professor at the University of Georgia and director of the school's Center for the Study of Global Issues. ""Just sending bullets from South Korea is one thing but sending aircraft over North Korea is something else."" However, he cautioned that the ramped-up rhetoric is ""almost entirely for domestic consumption"" as the South deals with criticism over what some have called a weak response to the North's November 23 shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island. The attack killed four South Koreans -- two civilians and two military personnel -- and the South returned fire. The country's defense minister at the time, Kim Tae-young, resigned last week after the exchange of fire. ""The climate is that the South Korean military did not respond strongly enough to the original attack, and that really led to the resignation of the defense minister,"" Park said. ""So the new candidate for the job is expected to show strong resolve and determination in the strongest terms possible."" Last month's attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting. The North accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's territorial waters along the region's tense maritime border in the Yellow Sea. Kim Kwan-jin criticized the South's response to the attack, saying Friday that military officials should have ordered immediate airstrikes after the shelling, according to Yonhap. He also said the military missed intelligence pointing to a possible attack by the North. Meanwhile Friday, the South made preparations to begin new live-fire drills along five islands in the Yellow Sea -- including Yeonpyeong -- in an effort to deter future provocations from the North, Yonhap reported. The move threatens to further stoke tensions with the North. The live fire drills are a routine monthly exercise aimed at securing the safety of ships in the area, the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff told CNN earlier this week. They were originally scheduled to begin Monday, but Yonhap reported that authorities have not determined the exact timing. One Joint Chiefs of Staff official was quoted by Yonhap as saying the South hopes to resume the drills ""as soon as possible."" North Korea previously warned that joint military drills between the United States and South Korea could lead to ""all-out war any time."" ""If the U.S. and the South Korean war-like forces fire even a shell into the inviolable land and territorial waters of the (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), they will have to pay dearly for this,"" the Korean Central News Agency reported. The joint drills ended Tuesday. CNN's Sarah Aarthun contributed to this report.","NEW: Expert says the threat is intended ""for domestic consumption""

"Al-Shabaab said it attacked an African Union military base in Somalia on Thursday in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike that killed their leader near Barawe in September. ""Al-Shabaab has carried out  the AU military base attack to revenge the killing of our leader, Ahmed Godane,"" the group's spokesman Ali Dheere said on Andalus radio,a pro-Al-Shabaab broadcaster, Friday. Seven Al-Shabaab militants are dead after they attacked  Somalia's largest base for African Union troops, according to the African Union Mission in Somalia. Two militants in a car detonated themselves inside the Halane Military base in Mogadishu, AMISOM spokesman Ali Aden Houmed said. Three AU soldiers from Uganda and a civilian died in the attack, AMISOM said on its website.  Seven Al-Shabab soldiers were killed, AU said.

"(CNN) -- Chilean authorities will launch an investigation into the 1973 death of writer Pablo Neruda, a judge ruled Thursday. Judge Mario Carroza ordered the investigation Thursday, noting that police, witness and medical records would be examined, Chile's judicial authority said in a statement. The Nobel Prize-winning poet's death certificate says he died of prostate cancer, CNN Chile reported. But officials with the country's Communist Party asked officials this week to probe his death. Neruda died on September 23, 1973, just 12 days after a right-wing military coup that overthrew the South American country's government. ""We are not accusing anybody, a priori. What we want is that the courts to fully clarify the situation,"" Communist Party President Guillermo Teillier told reporters Tuesday. But human rights lawyer Eduardo Contreras said that the circumstances surrounding Neruda's death reported in local media differed from descriptions on his death certificate. ""Without a doubt, Neruda in exile would have been something very difficult for the dictatorship,"" he told reporters. A biography of the poet on the website of the Neruda Foundation, which Neruda's widow founded to promote and preserve his legacy, notes the coup as a significant date in his life. ""The majority of Neruda's friends were made prisoners or had to hide or seek political asylum in other countries,"" it says. Neruda, a member of Chile's Communist Party, was also a lawmaker in the South American country and served as its ambassador to France. But internationally, he is most well-known for his poetry. Neruda received the Nobel Prize in Literature 1971 ""for a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent's destiny and dreams."" The investigation into his death comes as Chilean authorities probe the death of another high-profile figure in the nation's history: former Chilean President Salvador Allende. Last week forensic experts exhumed Allende's remains as part of an investigation into whether he killed himself or was assassinated during the 1973 coup. Official accounts ruled the leftist leader's death a suicide, saying that he shot himself -- with a gun that was reportedly a gift from Fidel Castro -- as Gen. Augusto Pinochet's troops closed in on the presidential palace. But some of Allende's supporters have long doubted that account. Carroza ordered the exhumation in April as part of a massive investigation of 726 reported human rights violations during Pinochet's rule, CNN Chile reported. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Lawyer: ""Neruda in exile would have been...difficult for the dictatorship""

"Despite concluding there was no foul play in the death of a Georgia teen nearly two years ago, a sheriff's office conducted additional interviews on the case as recently as this month. The parents of Kendrick Johnson, who was found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat at his school in Valdosta, Georgia, have been unwavering in their belief that their son was murdered, even after the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office ruled the death accidental and closed the case 18 months ago. The details of the recent interviews, conducted by the sheriff's office between November 24 and December 15, were provided to CNN in response to a public records request. The sheriff's office interviewed about two dozen current and former Lowndes High School students who were on the school's wrestling team on January 10, 2013, the day Johnson disappeared. His body was found the next day. The additional interviews appear to be related to a video released by attorneys for Johnson's family that challenged the whereabouts of one particular former student who was on the wrestling team. According to investigative records, the former student confronted Johnson and told him ""it ain't over"" regarding a confrontation Johnson had with the former student's younger brother. CNN is not naming the former student because he has not been called a suspect or been charged with a crime. The former student would have been at a wrestling match in another city at the time Johnson is believed to have died, but lawyers say the bus did not leave Lowndes High School until after Johnson's death. An attorney for the sheriff's office confirmed the recent interviews, but did not respond to a question about whether the case has been reopened. ""The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office initiated the interviews of the Lowndes High School wrestling team coach, the bus driver and wrestling team members in response to claims made known to the sheriff's office that the wrestling team was still on the school's campus when Kendrick Johnson was last known to have been alive,"" according to a statement provided by the department's attorney.  ""Investigators have tried unsuccessfully to contact some wrestling team members and will continue to attempt to reach those team members."" The statement added that the interviews so far have not changed the facts believed by the sheriff's office. ""The information gathered thus far indicates that the bus carrying the wrestling team had left the school's campus prior to the time that Kendrick Johnson was last known to have been alive,"" it said. Several of those interviewed said the former student was on a school bus en route to a state tournament in Macon, Georgia, the day Johnson disappeared.  Others could not say for sure. However, there are inconsistent accounts about when the bus left the school. Some of the current and former students told investigators the team left campus before 10 a.m. Other students said the team left just before noon. The bus driver told investigators the team left at 12:30 p.m., according to incident reports. According to a school bus schedule provided to CNN by an attorney for the school, the bus left for the tournament at 4 p.m., hours after Johnson was last seen alive around 1:30 p.m. The wrestling coach told investigators the school bus schedule was inaccurate, as it reflected a request made by him at the beginning of the wrestling season, and not the time the bus left on the actual day of the wrestling meet. Analysis of the coach's cell phone bill showed the last call that accessed a tower in the Valdosta area that day occurred at 11:28 a.m. At 1:53 p.m., the phone accessed a tower in Cordele, Georgia, nearly 90 miles outside of Valdosta. An employee at Candlewood Suites in Macon told investigators the coach checked in for the team at 4 p.m., according to incident reports. One student told investigators that the weigh-in for the team began at 4 p.m., according incident reports. According to a document included in the investigative file, the former student participated in the weigh-in on January 10, but when that weigh-in occurred is not indicated. Previously released documents showed that the former student and his brother were advised by their attorney in 2013 not to speak to investigators or provide them any statements. In August, the brothers' parents filed a $5 million libel lawsuit in federal court against the publishers of Ebony magazine and writer Frederic Rosen.  The suit claims stories written by Rosen and published in Ebony magazine and on Ebony.com imply that the brothers played a part in Johnson's death and their father was involved in a conspiracy to cover it up.  The claim that the brothers played any part in the death ""is completely untrue,"" according to the lawsuit. The interviews come more than 18 months after Lowndes County Sheriff's Office closed its investigation into Johnson's death. Sheriff's office investigators concluded Johnson got stuck while reaching for a shoe at the center of the rolled mat.  The state medical examiner determined Johnson died as the result of accidental ""positional asphyxia."" Johnson's parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, believe the story about the shoe is a cover-up and that their son was murdered.  A forensic pathologist hired by Johnson's family later found evidence of ""unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to the neck.  He concluded Johnson's death was the result of a homicide. A federal investigation into Johnson's death, launched more than a year ago, continues. The Department of Justice has taken possession of the gym mat where Johnson's body was found, according to the records released by the sheriff's office to CNN. Last month, the approximately 6-foot gym mat was rolled in brown paper and loaded into a vehicle driven by Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Sines and U.S. Attorney's Office Criminal Investigator Nelson Rhone Jr., according to the documents.

"Rafael Ramos was an unusual cop. He saw the streets of New York as his ministry. In fact, he was just hours away from becoming a lay chaplain and graduating from a community-crisis chaplaincy program before he and fellow New York police Officer Wenjian Liu were gunned down in their patrol car Saturday in Brooklyn. The gunman in the two officers' killing, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, was found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds at a subway station immediately after the slayings. Services for Liu are pending. On Friday, a police honor guard took Ramos' casket into Christ Tabernacle in Glendale, New York, where an afternoon wake was being held. The visitation will be followed by a memorial service at 7 p.m. ET and a funeral service Saturday morning. Some 25,000 police officers from around the country are expected to attend the funeral, according to the New York Police Department. JetBlue told CNN it has arranged for approximately 670 law enforcement officers to travel to New York for free. Charities offer help to families of slain officers . Speakers at the funeral will include Vice President Joe Biden, Mayor Bill De Blasio and NYPD Commissioner William Bratton. Ramos, 40, enjoyed the spiritual dimension to life and work. ""He told me that his job even with the NYPD, he felt he was doing God's work,"" the Rev. Marcos Miranda, president of the New York State Chaplain Task Force, told Arise America on YouTube. ""He felt that he was protecting and serving his community and that was a sort of a ministry for him. And I totally agreed with him,"" Marcos said. ""He said this type of ministry, the chaplaincy, he could see himself doing this in the future as a full-time ministry after he retired from the NYPD."" Marcos heads an organization that runs the 10-week course for lay chaplaincy, which Ramos completed, the minister said. Widow and two sons . Ramos always carried a smile, Marcos said. ""He had the kindest eyes you could see. They radiated kindness and compassion,"" Marcos said. Ramos leaves a wife, Maritza, whom he married in 1993, and two sons, Justin and Jaden, said the Rev. Adam Durso, executive pastor of Christ Tabernacle, which Ramos attended for nearly 14 years. To his close friends and even to his family, Ramos often went by Ralph, not Rafael. ""Ralph was definitely a family man. He always talked about his kids and how well they were doing athletically and academically,"" Durso said. A son's farewell . Ramos' son Jaden recounted on his Facebook page how ""I had to say bye to my father"" after the shooting. ""(H)e was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer. Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad,"" Jaden wrote. An usher to all . On his Facebook page, Ramos spoke of his faith and noted that he studied at Faith Evangelical College and Seminary in Tacoma, Washington, which also offers online courses. Ramos posted this quote as the cover photo at the top of his Facebook page: ""If your way isn't working, try God's way."" Ramos was active in his church. He served as an usher and as part of the church's marriage ministry and life group ministry, Durso said. ""When his team was scheduled to serve, we never worried about whether Ralph would be there with his team to help. He was a humble man and was willing to help at any capacity, helping people to their seats, moms with their baby carriages or the elderly in and out of our elevator,"" Durso said in a statement.","Police honor guard takes Ramos' casket into church .

"After Katy Perry posted a picture of her and Hillary Clinton, it only took Vice President Joe Biden a few days to one-up the former secretary of state. Perry had offered to write a ""theme"" song for Clinton's presidential campaign, should she decide to run in 2016, after the two met at a book signing in Los Angeles for Clinton's memoir ""Hard Choices."" Then Biden made his move: He invited the pop star to the White House, posed for a selfie with her and even got on the phone with her grandmother. ""What a Q-T,"" Perry captioned the Instagram photo of her and Biden, who is a fan, a White House official told CNN. Perry's fans seemed to agree and less than 24 hours after it was posted, the vice presidential selfie beat out Perry's photo with Clinton by several thousand likes. That's a BFD, as Biden might say. It's not the first time Biden has trumped Clinton news with a little ""news"" of his own as speculation simmers about whether they will run for the presidency in 2016. When Clinton said she hadn't driven a car in nearly 20 years, Biden was quick to profess his love of American sports cars and even suggested that not being able to drive the new Corvette could be the one reason he doesn't run for president. ""I'd like to get that Z06 from 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds,"" Biden said in February. And then Clinton tried to climb out of the hole she had dug by saying her family was in debt and ""dead broke"" after leaving the White House. Oh yeah? Dead broke? Well the vice president doesn't even have a savings account, Biden said just a day after Clinton reignited the controversy over her wealth. ""Don't hold it against me I don't own a single stock or bond,"" Biden continued. ""Don't hold it that I have no savings account."" While the Bidens' investments are listed in his wife's name, the vice president does in fact have several savings accounts. But that's not the point, jabbin' Joe would say. Remember instead that he was listed as one of the poorest members of Congress when he was a senator. And then there's their new BFF Katy Perry. Oh, Hillary -- you just met her and her posse? ""I've known them for like seven years ... so, just a little bit longer. I've just known them for a really long time ... so, longer. So, just better friends."" Wait -- that's not Biden. It's a quote from Penelope, the absurdly competitive Saturday Night Live character played by Kristen Wiig who has an overpowering urge to outshine everyone around her. The back and forth between Clinton and Biden even prompted Jon Stewart to call a ""Poor-Off"" to settle the would-be-rivals' competing claims. ""Don't hold it against me but my clothes are made of old curtains"" Stewart as Biden said. Stewart even nicknamed the veep, Joe ""I'm-allergic-to-money"" Biden. But the polls show Clinton is the clear frontrunner among Democrats for 2016, with Biden a distant second. While they're both considering their options, Biden's got to keep himself in the headlines. And apparently letting Clinton set up his punch lines has helped Biden flaunt his qualities and accomplishments. Like travel. Clinton has touted her travel credentials -- 112 countries and nearly 1 million miles -- during her whirlwind book tour. But the day Clinton's book was released, Biden brought up his own encounters with world leaders and the frequent flier miles he has racked up as vice president -- more than 900,000. Close enough.","Beyond the Katy Perry primary, Biden has apparently picked up on other Clinton comments .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. authorities were keeping a close watch on Libya's rapidly unfolding political crisis Monday, in part to see what possibilities might exist for meaningful reform, a senior Obama administration official said. Among other things, Washington was taking a close look at a speech delivered Sunday by Saif al-Islam Gadhafi -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's son -- which included warnings of a civil war if demonstrations in the North African country don't stop. In the same speech, Saif Gadhafi also acknowledged changing times regionally and proposed ""radical"" reforms -- like bolstering local governments, relaxing restrictive laws, raising salaries, extending loans, and drafting a constitution, which doesn't now exist. Obama officials continued to discuss with their Libyan counterparts the need to avoid violence against peaceful protesters, the official added. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation in Libya by his national security adviser, Tom Donilon, on Sunday night, the official also said. Despite the warning from Gadhafi's son, Libya's protesters are showing no sign of an intention to back down. After Gadhafi's government apparently lost control of the city of Benghazi, some angry protesters in Tripoli said they hoped for a similar turn of events in the nation's capital. Tripoli residents said state-run al-Shababiya TV was attacked Sunday evening by anti-government protesters. CNN, however, could not immediately confirm reports. The Libyan government maintains tight control on communications and has not responded to repeated requests from CNN for access to the country. CNN has interviewed numerous witnesses by phone. The current unrest, spurred largely by demands for freedom and angst over high unemployment, has left at least 233 people dead in Libya, according to Human Rights Watch, citing information from hospital sources. CNN's Alan Silverleib and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report .","American officials are exploring possibilities for reform in Libya .

"Boulder, Colorado (CNN) -- Authorities in Boulder, Colorado, warned some residents to prepare to evacuate Thursday as winds gusting as high as 50 mph threatened to drive a raging wildfire out of the hills and into city limits. The Fourmile Canyon fire already had charred nearly 6,400 acres of countryside and destroyed 169 homes west of Boulder by mid-morning Thursday. High winds that could whip the fire toward the city were expected to kick up Thursday evening and last throughout the night, forecasters predicted. About 8,000 people in the hills west of Boulder have already been forced to evacuate. No evacuations have been ordered for city residents yet, but Boulder municipal spokeswoman Sarah Huntley said they should ""think about the possibility of evacuating"" and have clothing, important documents and needed medication ready to go if necessary. ""We absolutely hope this won't be necessary, but this is a really good reminder that we live in a community that does potentially have a fire danger,"" Huntley told reporters. ""Obviously, some of our neighbors have found that out, and our hearts definitely go out to them. We're asking city residents to be on notice."" Huntley said people living on the northwestern edge of the picturesque university city should ""do what they can to help us protect their home"" by cutting grass short, removing combustible material from yards and moving propane tanks to the east side of their homes and making sure they're ""clearly visible"" to firefighters. Boulder is about 35 miles northwest of Denver, at the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains. The Fourmile Canyon fire was about 30 percent contained Thursay morning, and could be as much as 45 percent contained by the end of the day, said Winslow Robertson, operations chief for the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team. There have been no deaths or injuries, and four people who had been listed as unaccounted for have been contacted and are unhurt, Boulder County Sheriff's Cmdr. Rick Brough said. But while overcast skies and a bit of rain helped firefighters on Wednesday, the projected high winds raised new concerns Thursday. ""It takes one spark outside the line with the conditions tonight, and it's a new race,"" firefighter Rob Bozeman told reporters earlier Thursday. He said some portions of the blaze were ""as extreme a fire behavior as I've seen -- not a front a mile wide coming at me, but fingers coming up."" Bozeman said ""entire chains of trees"" were ablaze, running up the sides of the hills into subdivisions and setting houses on fire. ""The fire behavior was so intense that when that heat hits, the firefighters have to pull back,"" he said. If firefighters can get back into the area and start spraying water onto a home, ""You can save it. But if it's happening all over the place, you can't get to all of them,"" he said. The fire started Monday morning. Its cause was still under investigation, Brough said. Three subdivisions reopened briefly to residents Thursday morning, but authorities shut them off again after conditions worsened. About 550 firefighters were battling the blaze Thursday, with 160 others arriving for duty, said Laura McConnell, a spokeswoman for the Boulder County Incident Management Team. Aircraft were also being used, with more than 100,000 gallons of fire retardant dropped from the air Wednesday, authorities said. Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter declared a state of emergency this week, throwing $5 million into the battle to save homes and forests in the canyon. CNN's Jim Spellman contributed to this report.","NEW: Some Boulder residents should ""think about"" evacuating, city says .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korean officials confirmed seven additional cases of foot-and-mouth disease Sunday despite nationwide quarantine efforts, the Yonhap News Agency reported. Dairy, beef and pig farms were among the locations where investigators detected the disease Sunday. The government ordered the slaughter of more than 120 animals at those farms to stop the outbreak's spread, according to Yonhap. Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly communicable disease that affects cattle, swine, sheep, goats, deer and other animals, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is characterized by a fever and blister-like lesions and erosions on the animal. Investigators detected the latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the country on November 28 on a pig farm in the southern city of Andong. The disease has since spread to areas around Seoul in the northern part of the country. More than 662,647 livestock have been ordered culled -- or slaughtered -- so far across the country, Yonhap said, and at least 81 cases have been confirmed. The toll of affected livestock is at the country's highest level since 2002, when 160,000 were slaughtered, the Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries confirmed. Livestock markets have been closed across the country while the government oversees animal vaccinations. The ministers of public administration and agriculture issued a statement last week saying it was safe to continue eating meat, noting that foot-and-mouth disease does not spread to humans. CNN's Jiyeon Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: Dairy, beef and pig farms are among the locations of new cases .

"Former Vice President Dick Cheney called a Senate panel's report on U.S. interrogation tactics during George W. Bush's administration is ""deeply flawed"" and a ""terrible piece of work."" ""The report's full of crap,"" he said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday evening. Bush's Republican vice president insisted that the Central Intelligence Agency's rough tactics -- which the report said included mock executions, beatings, ""rectal rehydration"" and feeding, sleep deprivation and more -- helped the United States ""catch the bastards who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11."" ""It did in fact produce actionable intelligence that was vital in the success of keeping the country safe from further attacks,"" he said. Asked specifically about the rectal rehydration instance detailed in the report, Cheney said: ""I don't know anything about that specific instance -- I can't speak to that."" He also said he hadn't actually read the report. Its full 6,000 pages haven't been released, but a lengthy summary was issued Tuesday. Cheney said he'd ""seen parts of it. I read summaries of it."" Contrary to the report's conclusion that Bush didn't know the extent of the CIA's efforts, Cheney said the President was involved in discussions about the interrogation techniques, and that Bush even pointed out some of those conversations in a book he wrote after leaving office. He said he has no regrets about the tactics used after the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks. ""I think what needed to be done was done,"" Cheney said.

"(CNN) -- Bristol Palin says she's optimistic about her mother's chances if the former Alaska governor decides to run for president. ""I think she's so smart and I think she could debate anyone and do very well,"" Palin said in an interview with HLN's ""Dr. Drew"" that aired Thursday night. ""I think that people will be talking about my family and her and everyone else, no matter what we're doing,"" she added. When the show's host, Dr. Drew Pinsky, asked whether she liked the attention, Palin said she had mixed feelings. ""I don't know how to feel about it. I think there's awesome opportunities that come with it, but then I also think there's lots of drawbacks and lots of negatives towards it,"" she said. ""But I think whatever she (Sarah Palin) does will be right for our family and right for herself."" Palin's life changed dramatically when her mother, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, became John McCain's vice presidential running mate in 2008. Shortly afterward, the revelation that Bristol Palin was 17 and pregnant put a national spotlight on her personal life. In her new memoir, ""Not Afraid of Life: My Journey So Far,"" Bristol Palin -- now 20 --writes about lying to her parents so she could go on a camping trip with friends -- a night that ended with the teenager losing her virginity to her boyfriend, Levi Johnston, while getting drunk off wine coolers. Later in the book, Bristol walks readers through her unwanted pregnancy with Johnston, revealing details on their shaky relationship over the years. On Thursday, she told Pinsky that being a teen mom to her son, Trip, was tough. ""My life, my teenage years were cut completely short. I was on the fast track to adulthood just in an instant because of that one decision,"" she said. ""And Trip is just the love of my life. He is everything to me. But do I wish that he had a dad that was involved in his life? Absolutely. And do I wish that I had an education and a real career path? Absolutely."" Even after the 2008 election, Bristol didn't shy away from the spotlight. She competed on ""Dancing With the Stars"" last year, drawing support from fans but also sharp criticism; one man reportedly shot his television when she made it to another week of the competition. ""I just think that it's so strange that they could have so much hate over a dance show,"" she said. In July 2010, Bristol announced her engagement to Johnston on the front page of US Weekly magazine. That -- Bristol told Pinsky -- was ""the biggest regret of my life."" ""The day (the magazine) came out, he (Johnston) comes to me and he says, 'Hey this girl's pregnant and it might be my baby.' ... So then from that day forward I was like, I'm just done with that. Trip doesn't deserve this (from) his dad and I don't deserve that (from) a potential husband,"" she said. In Thursday's interview, Bristol also addressed a more recent controversy -- whether she had plastic surgery. She reiterated previous denials of that accusation, saying an oral surgeon operated on her jaw in December to correct a longstanding problem. ""I'm so sick of people talking about it and I'm so sick of appearance being an issue,"" she said. But despite the increased scrutiny, Bristol says she's grateful her celebrity has given her a chance to speak about important topics, like teen pregnancy prevention. ""With this book, I really do hope that other young girls will see all the foolish decisions ... and they can learn something from the mistakes that I made,"" she said. ""I'm just so passionate about it, just warning other girls that it's not an accessory on your hip,"" she added. CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","Bristol Palin says announcing her engagement in US Weekly is her ""biggest regret""

"(CNN) -- Western intelligence agencies were able to form a detailed picture of Osama bin Laden's movements in the years after 9/11, and came closer to capturing or killing him than has so far been acknowledged, a former European intelligence official has disclosed. The former official, who declined to be identified, told CNN that in 2003 and 2004 an informant in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region with close connections to al Qaeda's top leadership provided a stream of reliable information on bin Laden's movements. But the information was never quite fresh enough for Western intelligence agencies to target al Qaeda's leader. Nearly nine years ago, bin Laden and others in the al Qaeda leadership escaped as their haven among the caves and mountains of Tora Bora -- close to the Afghanistan border with Pakistan -- came under withering U.S. air attacks. Despite bin Laden being the world's most sought-after fugitive, to date very little has been reliably reported about his movements beyond a consensus that he is now likely hiding somewhere in the tribal areas of Pakistan. The former official said that in the period after bin Laden left Tora Bora, under pressure and on the run, he and his lieutenants were little able to communicate with each other. But gradually, al Qaeda restored its communications and was able to resume meetings. Bin Laden even met with 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed at some point before the latter's arrest in February 2003. Additionally, bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri were frequently in the same area and regularly in communication. During this time, Western intelligence agencies were able to draw up a detailed map tracing bin Laden's movements, according to the former intelligence official. In 2003-2004, bin Laden spent time in several areas -- amid the rugged mountains of Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal areas and in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, a more heavily populated area where Pakistan's security forces had a greater presence. But according to the former official, bin Laden shunned big cities, preferring to stay in rural areas. The intelligence stream indicated that al Qaeda's leader also made several trips across into Afghanistan during this period, despite the presence of tens of thousands of U.S. troops. In a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek, Western intelligence agencies were always playing catch-up as bin Laden moved from location to location. Tantalizingly at one point, according to the former official, information about his exact location was only one week old. But the intelligence stream on bin Laden's movements never resulted in what is known as ""actionable intelligence"" that could have led to his capture or assassination. After 2004 the intelligence stream dried up, according to the former official, who did not elaborate why. But he said that despite the setback, information on al Qaeda's leaders' movements never completely dried up; and recent intelligence suggested bin Laden and al-Zawahiri were still in close geographic proximity and able to communicate with each other. However, few al Qaeda followers get to meet them. European and American jihadists who joined up with al Qaeda in 2008 have subsequently told Western interrogators that for security reasons access for them to bin Laden was strictly off limits. Bin Laden is now mainly concentrating on providing ""strategic direction"" to the al Qaeda organization, rather than involving himself deeply in the daily running of the terrorist organization, the former official told CNN. Raw intelligence reports leaked in July on the Wikileaks website suggesting bin Laden took part in detailed planning of operations should be treated with skepticism, said the former official. U.S. intelligence officials play down the possibility that bin Laden might be captured soon. CIA Director Leon Panetta stated in June that very little hard information on bin Laden's movements had come to light in recent years. But on Friday, President Barack Obama said that pressure on the al Qaeda leadership meant that ""they have been holed up in ways that have made it harder for them to operate."" He added: ""Bin Laden has gone deep underground. Even Zawahiri, who is more often out there, has been much more cautious.""","A former European intelligence official offers details on bin Laden's movements after 9/11 .

"If you're planning to enjoy this spring or summer at a national park, you'd better leave your drone at home. On Friday, Yosemite National Park in California turned heads when it announced that drones, the unmanned aircraft increasingly making their way into private hands, aren't welcome in the park, famous for its picturesque valley of towering granite cliffs, waterfalls and Giant Sequoia groves. Apparently using drones to capture experiences at the park, on the western edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains, is becoming a trend. ""The park has experienced an increase in visitors using drones within park boundaries over the last few years,"" park  management said in a news release. ""Drones have been witnessed filming climbers ascending climbing routes, filming views above tree-tops, and filming aerial footage of the park."" And it's not just Yosemite. The buzzing aerial machines, which have become handy for everything from scaring off unwanted birds to delivering medicine and pizzas, aren't welcome at any of the 58 national parks. 15 ways drones will change your life . ""The ... regulations cited at Yosemite apply at all units of the National Park System,"" spokesman John Quincy said in an e-mail to CNN. The Code of Federal Regulations states that ""delivering or retrieving a person or object by parachute, helicopter, or other airborne means, except in emergencies involving public safety or serious property loss, or pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit"" is illegal. The parks system says that applies to drones, though privately owned, unmanned aircraft probably weren't on anyone's mind when it was written. Yosemite's news release cited a list of ways the aircraft can be harmful. Among them: Ruining the experience for visitors with their noise, interfering with rescue operations and endangering wildlife in the area -- particularly the peregrine falcons that nest in the park's cliff walls. A quick search on YouTube finds a host of of videos shot using drones at Yosemite and other national parks. Some merely show shaky video from beginners sending their craft into the sky for the first time, while others are more professional productions that provide breathtaking views of the park's mountains, trees and cyclists and hikers. In a bit of irony, firefighters used a drone to battle the Yosemite Rim blaze that raged in and around the park last August.","The U.S. National Park Service says drones are not welcome .

"(CNN) -- Life's a beach for some of South Africa's best horses. Trainer Justin Snaith says a day at Cape Town's Muizenberg Beach provides the perfect workout for his thoroughbreds before they tough it out on the turf. ""This is the ultimate exercise, for both their mind and body,"" Snaith told CNN's Winning Post show. ""You take them down to the beach and for the first few strides they do their normal routine, which is either to be difficult or pull, and next thing you just watch them take a breath and they just totally relax. ""They certainly get hypnotized by the motion of the water, because you actually find you feel they start leaning as the water starts either going forward or back. All of a sudden you have this horse that is just so relaxed and at the same time, he's getting the advantages of this lovely clear fresh seawater."" The formula clearly works. Since starting his career 14 years ago, Snaith has followed in the footsteps of his father Chris and become one of the country's most successful trainers. Last year, he trained 198 winners, smashing the previous South African annual record of 174. The tally included an unprecedented seven winners in a day at Fairview Racecourse in Port Elizabeth. With 40 kilometers (25 miles) of white sand stretching along Cape Town's Atlantic peninsula, Muizenberg is popular with surfers and the odd shark as well as its equine visitors. It's all part of a routine that helps the horses arrive at the track relaxed, ready to race and able to ""dig that little bit deeper,"" Snaith says. He has 38 runners lining up in 12 races at the J&B Met at Cape Town's famous Kenilworth Racecourse this Saturday, with Jet Explorer his contender in the main race. The six-year-old picked up a minor leg injury at an exhibition gallop recently, but a bit of ocean therapy has helped speed up his recovery. ""When horses pick up certain injuries, or even mentally need a break, the ocean is by far the most superior thing I've ever seen, and it just gives them that day to just get their heads together, or get a little bit of infection out of their leg,"" Snaith says. ""One walk in the ocean and you've got a healed horse."" It's all about giving the horses what they need, the 39-year-old says, whether it's splashing around in the waves or pottering around in paddocks with their mates. ""A happy horse is a good horse,"" he says. ""I only ask for one thing in return, that when those pens open and the starting gates open and those horses get running, that they give of their best, and as it stands now we seem to have a great agreement.""

"(Mental Floss) -- There's no need to page Doctor Doolittle for this case. Here are the amazing, true stories of four animals that could speak for themselves. 1. Hoover the Seal . In 1971, George and Alice Swallow found a baby seal just off the coast of Maine. The little guy appeared to be orphaned, so they took him home and kept him in their bathtub. For the first few days, they tried to feed him ground mackerel, but he refused to eat. Once he trusted his new parents, though, he began eating so voraciously they compared him to a Hoover vacuum cleaner and the name stuck. When he got too big for the tub, Hoover was moved to a small pond behind the Swallows' house. After only a few months, Hoover was eating more fish than his human caretakers were able to provide, so they contacted the New England Aquarium in Boston, hoping the facility had room for him. When introducing the seal to the aquarium, George mentioned that Hoover could talk. Of course no one believed him at the time. A few years later, though, researchers at the aquarium noticed that Hoover's guttural sounds really did seem to be forming words and phrases. He was often telling people to ""Get outta here!"" or asking, ""How are ya?"" He could say his name and a few other phrases, all with a thick Bostonian accent. Once the word got out that the Aquarium had a talking seal, he became a media sensation, making appearances in Reader's Digest, The New Yorker, National Public Radio, and even on Good Morning America. Sadly, Hoover died of natural causes in July 1985 at the ripe old age of 14. He was so admired that he received his own obituary in the Boston Globe. He left behind several offspring, but none possessed his unique gift for gab. 2. Blackie the Cat . Search YouTube for ""Talking Cat"" and you'll find thousands of videos of fluent felines. But in 1981, a talking cat was a bit harder to come by. So when Carl Miles of Augusta, Georgia, trained his cat Blackie to say, ""I love you"" and ""I want my mama,"" they took their act on the road. Throughout the early 1980s, Blackie made paid appearances on local TV and radio programs, and even hit the big time with a spot on the network TV show That's Incredible. However, as the novelty wore off, Carl and Blackie ended up performing on street corners, asking for donations from passersby. After some complaints from locals, police informed Carl that he would need to get a business license in order to keep up Blackie's street show. Carl paid the $50 fee for a license, but something about it rubbed him the wrong way. So Carl sued the city of Augusta, under the pretense that the city's business license code mentions many types of occupations that require a license, but a talking cat show was not one of them. But that wasn't the only issue Carl had --he also claimed the city was infringing on Blackie's First Amendment Right to Free Speech. Carl lost his case, but he appealed the ruling until it came before a federal court. The argument was finally closed when three presiding judges declared that the business license ordinance allowed for other, unspecified types of businesses to require a license, which would encompass a talking cat performer. As for the First Amendment violation, the courts said the law did not apply because Blackie was not human, and therefore not protected under the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, there seemed no good cause for Carl Miles to be the one to bring the suit in the first place. If Blackie felt his rights were being violated, as a talking cat, he should have been the one to say something. Mental Floss: Animals that were put on trial . 3. Alex the Parrot . Alex, an African gray parrot, was purchased from a Chicago pet store in 1977. Dr. Irene Pepperberg bought the one-year-old bird to see if she could teach a parrot to understand language in a similar manner to chimpanzees and gorillas that had been taught American Sign Language. At the time, it was believed that a large brain, like a primate's, was necessary to acquire language. By comparison, a parrot's brain is about the size of a walnut, so it was believed that mimicry was the best we could hope for. Instead, the work of Pepperberg and Alex (an acronym for Avian Learning EXperiment) before his sudden death in 2007, has changed the perceptions of many in the scientific community. According to Dr. Pepperberg's research, this avian Einstein could identify 50 different objects, knew seven colors and shapes, and many different kinds of materials like wool, paper, and wood. For example, hold up a blue block of wood and Alex could tell you the shape, the color, and even what it was made of. However, he also grasped more complex concepts that required a higher level of thought and understanding. Put a handful of red and yellow blocks on a tray and ask him how many were yellow, he could tell you the correct answer. If you then asked him how many of those same blocks were green, he would say ""none."" Furthermore, hold up two blocks of different colors and different sizes and he could tell you which was bigger. Maybe the term ""birdbrained"" isn't such an insult after all. Despite the loss of Alex, the Avian Learning Experiment goes on. Dr. Pepperberg's latest feathered pupil is Griffin, another African Gray, that was born in 1995. In 2007, Animal Planet tested Griffin against kids at a Boston preschool on the basics of object recognition, colors, and shapes. It was determined that Griffin was about as smart as a three-and-a-half year old human. Not bad for having a brain the size of a walnut. Mental Floss: 10 technologies we stole from animals . 4. Lucy the Chimp . When she was only two days old, Lucy, a chimpanzee, was purchased by the University of Oklahoma and sent to live with Dr. Maurice Temerlin, a noted psychologist, who, along with his wife, raised the little chimp as if she were their own human child. Lucy was taught how to eat normal meals at the table using silverware. She could dress herself, often choosing to wear skirts just like her ""mother"" did. She could even make tea for her ""parents"" and the team of researchers who trained and cared for her. Dr. Robert Fouts, one of the groundbreaking psychologists who taught American Sign Language (ASL) to Washoe the chimp in 1967, helped Lucy learn to communicate using around 250 ASL signs. Lucy could not only give the signs for objects like airplane, ball, and food, but she could also express her emotions with her hands, often ""saying"" when she was hungry, happy, or sad. Lucy had become so close to human in most every way that she only found human men, not male chimpanzees, sexually attractive. It was pretty clear that, in her mind anyway, she was the same as her parents. It's a sad fact that once a captive chimp has reached about four or five years old, their immense strength can become a danger to their human caretakers. Often they need to be placed in a zoo, a lab, or some other facility better equipped to handle primates. In this case, the Temerlins raised Lucy as their daughter until 1977, when she was almost 12 years old, before they finally felt like they had to find her a new home. After much deliberation, they decided upon a nature preserve in Gambia on the west coast of Africa. They, along with research assistant Janis Carter, flew with Lucy to her new home to help ease the chimp into the wild. However, it was not going to be as simple as they'd hoped. At the preserve, Lucy was put in a cage at night to protect her from predators. She had only ever slept in a bed inside a nice, quiet, suburban home, so the jungle was a completely new and frightening environment for her. She was also scared of the other chimps, strange creatures she had only encountered a few times before in her life, preferring to stay close to her parents and Janis whenever she could. She wasn't eating because her food had always been delivered to her on a plate; she didn't even understand the concept of foraging. When her parents suddenly became distant and weren't providing her with the life she had always known, Lucy became confused and sad. She would often use the sign for ""hurt."" And she lost much of her hair due to the stress of her new situation. Realizing that Lucy would never move on if they stayed, her parents left her behind after three weeks. Janis agreed to stay for a few weeks longer, but it was soon clear that Lucy couldn't change who she was. And so, Janis never left. Mental Floss: How do you transport a whale? Janis helped found a chimpanzee sanctuary on an abandoned island in the middle of the Gambia River. She took Lucy and other chimps that had been raised in captivity and lived with them on the island, teaching them skills they would need in the wild, like finding food and climbing trees. For most, the new lifestyle quickly became second nature. But for nearly eight years, Lucy refused to give up her human ways. She wanted human food, human interaction, and to be loved by, what she considered, one of her own kind. It wasn't until Janis stopped living on the island that Lucy was finally able to accept her new life and joined a troupe of chimps. Whenever Janis visited the island, Lucy was still affectionate, still used sign language, but thankfully, she always went back with the chimps into the forest. Sadly, Lucy's decomposed body was discovered in 1987. Her exact cause of death is unknown, though some believe she was killed by poachers. Others say it was probably something less spectacular, like an attack by a dominant male or an illness. There's one thing that no one who knew her wonders about, though, and that's the fact that Lucy never really believed she was anything less than human.

"(CNN) -- Severe thunderstorms moved through southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois Monday, bringing reports of tornado touchdowns and significant damage. At least three children in Caledonia, Illinois, about 15 miles northwest of Rockford, were injured when the bus in which they were riding rolled over, according to the National Weather Service. The extent of their injuries wasn't immediately known. The worst of the storm hit around 3 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), knocking down power lines along a country road and hitting the village of Caledonia especially hard, said Boone County, Illinois, emergency management director Sandra Rogers. Are you there? Share your photos and videos . Heavy winds destroyed the Caledonia town hall and one home, damaged another three homes and knocked out power to more than 500 residents, Rogers said. Power lines were down near Caledonia, and additionally one business was ""almost completely destroyed"" and a damaged grain silo was leaking grain, the weather service said. Heavy winds Monday afternoon also struck the Wisconsin town of Union Grove, about 30 miles south of Milwaukee. Some 36 residents of an assisted-living facility there had to be moved after heavy winds caused structural damage and forced the facility to rely on generator power, said Lt. Dan Klatt of the Racine County Sheriff's Office. The storm also blew the roof off a building onto a nearby residence and damaged Union Grove's sewage treatment plant, he said. The winds also peeled shingles from houses and downed power lines, according to Klatt, saying he expected power to start returning around 10 p.m. He said he could not confirm that a tornado had struck, while adding that the damage was largely confirned to a path near highways 11 and 45 in the county. ""We're surprised to by a storm of this magnitude: Typically, we don't see tornadoes in late November,"" Klatt said. ""We just want to get people back to their homes safely."" Union Grove firefighter Kris Nissila said heavy winds overturned several semi-trucks, caused ""numerous gas leaks,"" and ""we have multiple buildings that aren't there any more."" ""Right next to my house, there was a garage that was gone,"" he said. Additionally, at least two homes were also damaged by possible tornadoes near Walworth, Wisconsin, the National Weather Service said. That agency also reported another twister touched down in Lawrence, Illinois, like Rockford located northwest of Chicago. In addition to tornado-like winds, the storm at times produced hail up to 2 inches in diameter, wind gusts up to 75 mph and dangerous cloud-to-cloud lightning. The inclement weather wreaked havoc with travel: As of 8:30 p.m. Monday, delays at Chicago's O'Hare airport averaged an hour and 43 minutes. The worst of the storm appeared to have passed by 8 p.m. (9 p.m. ET), though thunderstorms prompted the service to warn of a ""severe weather threat"" for much of central Illinois. In addition, ""significant snow"" was forecast beginning Monday night and into Wednesday for much of north central and central Wisconsin. CNN's April Williams, Leslie Tripp and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Storm prompts evacuation of 36 residents from assisted-living facility .

"New York (CNN) -- An Egyptian cobra that drew thousands of Twitter fans has been found alive after it went missing for days from a New York City zoo. ""As you can imagine, we are delighted to report that the snake has been found alive and well,"" Bronx Zoo Director Jim Breheny said Thursday. Zoo officials conducted around-the-clock searches for the 3-ounce, 20-inch long reptile, he said. Breheny said the cobra had sought a secure hiding spot within the holding areas of the zoo's reptile house -- a complex environment with pumps, motors and other mechanical systems. But it was lured out after zoo officials sprinkled wood shavings from exhibit beds across areas where they guessed the cobra was hiding. ""It was the scent of rodents (on the wood clippings) that we hoped would bring her out,"" Breheny added. ""The key strategy here was patience,"" he said in a prepared statement. The snake went missing Saturday from an off-exhibit enclosure, prompting the zoo to close the reptile house. Officials had earlier cautioned that it might take days or even weeks before the snake was found, and urged the public not to panic, saying the cobra was likely contained within the building. While the mystery of the missing snake may have caused concern for zoo-goers, it also earned a cult following online. After launching on Monday, the anonymous @BronxZoosCobra Twitter feed had amassed nearly 200,000 followers by 6 p.m. Thursday. The feed had given the snake a hilarious shtick by toying a bit with the fears of skittish New Yorkers. ""City may not sleep, but I'm ready to. Ooh a chimney! I bet you bragged to your friends about having a working fireplace in NYC. Hi roomie,"" was posted on the site. ""A lot of people are asking how I can tweet with no access to a computer or fingers. Ever heard of an iPhone? Duh,"" says another tweet. ""Taking the Sex and the City Tour!!!  I'm totally a SSSamantha,"" the anonymous tweet added. ""Just FYI, I've had it with Samuel L. Jackson too."" Its Twitter profile listed the reptile as ""an Egyptian cobra out on the town."" The species' more common home, however, is North Africa. Its venom is so deadly that it can kill a full-grown elephant in three hours -- or a person in about 15 minutes, according to wildlife experts. The venom destroys nerve tissue and causes paralysis and death because of respiratory failure. Scholars believe the Egyptian cobra was known in ancient times as the asp. Legend has it that Cleopatra, the ancient Egyptian queen, used an asp to commit suicide. Breheny called the snake's absence ""a serious situation,"" but said he was heartened by what he described as an apparent confidence that zoo officials would find the cobra. The media ""wouldn't have spoofed the situation the way they did"" if they believed otherwise, he said. CNN's Gene Bloch contributed to this report .","An Egyptian cobra is found in the holding area of the reptile house .

"(CNN) -- The FAA has seen the light. And it wants to put an end to it. Federal Aviation Administration officials on Wednesday plan to announce they will impose civil penalties on people who point lasers into the cockpit of aircraft. The number of pilots reporting being targeted by lasers nearly doubled last year to 2,836, up from 1,527 the previous year, the FAA said. Officials say the increase is likely attributable to the increased availability of cheap and powerful laser pointers, to the introduction of green lasers which are more easily seen, and to increased reporting of laser events by pilots. ""Shining a laser into the cockpit of an aircraft is not a joke,"" FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt said in a statement. ""These lasers can temporarily blind a pilot and make it impossible to safely land the aircraft, jeopardizing the safety of the passengers and people on the ground."" To date, the government has dealt with the problem largely through a hodgepodge of state and local laws. But on Wednesday, the FAA planned to release a legal interpretation concluding that laser beams can interfere with a flight crew performing its duties while operating an aircraft, a violation of federal aviation regulations. In the past, the FAA has used the regulation against passengers on board aircraft who interfere with an aircraft's crew. The maximum civil penalty the FAA can impose for violating the regulation is $11,000 per violation. ""Our top priority is protecting the safety of the traveling public,"" Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a statement. ""We will not hesitate to take tough action against anyone who threatens the safety of our passengers, pilots and air transportation system."" A bill that would criminalize purposefully aiming a laser device at aircraft is currently pending in Congress. While the problem is compounded by the difficulty of tracking down offenders, several individuals have been caught in recent years, usually with the assistance of local police officials in helicopters and on the ground. Last year, Los Angeles International Airport recorded 102 laser events -- the highest number of laser events in the country for a single airport. Chicago O'Hare International Airport was a close second, with 98 reports, and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport tied for third with 80 each. So far this year, the Phoenix and Dallas-Fort Worth areas each have recorded more than 45 laser events, the FAA said. The Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Houston areas each have recorded more than 30 laser events. The FAA first began paying close attention to the issue in the mid-1990s. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates lasers, required outdoor laser light show operators to notify the FAA of proposed laser operations and resolve any objections that the FAA may have. In 2005, the FAA created a formal reporting system to collect information from pilots. During the first year in operation, nearly 300 reports were collected.","Last year, there were more than 2,800 laser incidents, FAA says .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama is showing ""arrogance"" in the aftermath of a mission that killed terror leader Osama bin Laden, said former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in an interview that aired on CNN Thursday night. Musharraf further called the May raid an ""act of war."" ""Certainly no country has a right to intrude into any other country,"" Musharraf told Piers Morgan. ""If technically or legally you see it, it's an act of war."" The American president said this week in an interview on British television that, if the opportunity arose, he would do the same thing again to take out al Qaeda terrorists. ""I think such arrogance should not be shown publicly to the world,"" Musharraf said. ""I think it is arrogance that: 'We don't care. We don't care for your national opinion. We don't care for your people. We will come in and do the same thing.' This is arrogance."" Musharraf conceded that it was a ""terrible mishap, a terrible failure"" that Pakistani intelligence didn't seem to know more about bin Laden's whereabouts, saying they should have know he was living in a compound in Abbottabad, a short distance from a Pakistan military academy. A Navy SEAL team killed the al Qaeda leader during a 40-minute assault on the compound in the early morning hours of May 2. Musharraf called bin Laden's death ""absolutely illegal."" Asked by Morgan if it was an unlawful assassination, he responded: ""I don't want to get involved in these legalities of the issue,"" but ""technically, theoretically, I'll agree.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. State Department on Thursday extended a travel warning that had been issued for Mexico because of the region's high level of drug and gang violence. The State Department warning also notes that the authorized departure of family members of U.S. government personnel from U.S. consulates in the northern Mexico border cities of Tijuana, Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey and Matamoros has been extended. The State Department issued similar warnings in March and April. The Mexican government said in April that more than 22,700 people have been killed in drug-related violence since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon declared war on narcotraffickers. ""While most victims of violence are Mexican citizens associated with criminal activity, the security situation poses serious risks for U.S. citizens, as well,"" the State Department warning says. Much of the recent violence has occurred in northern Mexico, where two drug cartels have been waging a bloody war since January. The area, which borders Texas, has seen ferocious fighting between the Zetas and Gulf cartels after a recent gangland slaying. Hours-long gun battles are common, and U.S. officials were forced earlier this year to temporarily close the consulate in Reynosa, a city in Tamaulipas state. Ciudad Juarez remains the most violent city in the nation, though. ""Since 2006, three times as many people have been murdered in Ciudad Juarez, in the state of Chihuahua, across from El Paso, Texas, than in any other city in Mexico,"" the State Department travel warning says. ""More than half of all Americans killed in Mexico in FY 2009 whose deaths were reported to the U.S. Embassy were killed in the border cities of Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana."" The State Department targets six Mexican states as particularly dangerous. ""Recent violent attacks and persistent security concerns have prompted the U.S. embassy to urge U.S. citizens to defer unnecessary travel to Michoacan and Tamaulipas, to parts of Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango and Coahuila and to advise U.S. citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution,"" the warning says. The latest trouble in Tamaulipas and neighboring Nuevo Leon state started January 18, when Gulf cartel members killed top Zeta lieutenant Victor Mendoza. The Zetas demanded that the Gulf cartel turn over the killers, but the narco group refused. The Zetas, composed mostly of former elite military troops, had been the armed enforcers for the Gulf cartel since 2001. They have become more independent in recent years, and authorities say the all-out war between the two cartels indicates the split is permanent.","U.S. State Department updates travel warning for people traveling to Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Mario Balotelli's knack of attracting the wrong type of headlines shows no sign of abating with the Italian international facing a possible English Football Association charge for racially stereotyping Jewish and black people in a social media post. The FA is looking into Balotelli's reposting of a Nintendo character Super Mario image that underneath had the words ""jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a jew."" Balotelli quickly deleted the Instagram image, before tweeting: ""My Mom is jewish so all of u shut up please,"" a reference to his foster mother, Silvia. He apologized Tuesday on Twitter explaining the post ""was meant to be anti-racist with humor."" He added: ""I now understand that out of context may have the opposite effect. Not all Mexicans have mustaches, not all black people jump high and not all Jewish people love money. ""I used a cartoon done by someone else because it has Super Mario and I thought it was funny and not offensive. Again, I'm sorry."" Liverpool said they plan to speak to Balotelli, who has missed the club's last three games due to a groin injury he picked up on international duty in November. ""We are aware of the posting which has since been promptly deleted by the player,"" said Liverpool in a statement. However, former FA executive Simon Johnson called on the FA to punish the 24-year-old Balotelli. ""We abhor all forms of racism, wherever it is found,"" Johnson, who is the current chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, told the Daily Telegraph. ""We call upon the FA to investigate this offensive social media post and to take action if appropriate if we are to succeed in kicking racism out of football."" Playing iIn Italy, Balotelli frequently faced racist abuse in stadiums, while in September Merseyside police investigated racist remarks on Twitter made to Balotelli after he posted a message during Manchester United's 5-3 defeat against Leicester City. Balotelli has yet to score a Premier League goal since joining Liverpool from AC Milan in the summer transfer window, though he did find the net against Ludogorets in the Champions League as well as against Swansea in the English League Cup. The minimum ban for race-related rule breaches is five games under the FA's social media guidelines.","Mario Balotelli under scrutiny for racially stereotyping Jewish and black people .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Joseph Horman already had seen the lock-picking videos on YouTube. But it was a different thing entirely for the 13-year-old puzzle-lover to get lessons in lock picking and computer hacking at an event sanctioned by adults. The world's largest gathering of computer hackers -- DEF CON, which is happening this weekend at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas -- held its first-ever hacking classes for kids this year, at an event appropriately called DEF CON Kids. Sessions in hacking were designed for kiddos ages 8 to 16. A common parent's reaction to something this might be: They're teaching them what?! But hear these hackers out. Their intentions are good. Take Horman's uncle, Adam Steed, a computer security professional in Salt Lake City, Utah, who brought his nephew to these training sessions because he already was fascinated with games and coding. (He actually has written his own computer game, called ""Blooks,"" in which players ""try to build as many buildings as you can while avoiding enemies,"" he said.) ""You can watch lock-picking videos on YouTube, but where do you hear the ethical side of this?"" said Steed, the uncle. ""Not on YouTube."" He added: ""I would rather someone learn in a controlled environment. They're going to learn it anyway."" Horman, the video game-writing nephew, sat attentively in the second row of a small classroom on Saturday, fiddling with a Rubik's Cube during sessions with titles like ""Secrets Revealed,"" ""Meet the Feds"" and ""Google Hacking."" That last class title is a bit misleading, since instructor-hacker Johnny Long focused more on non-technical hacking -- looking at people's laptops over their backs in airports; picking locks with toilet paper rolls and pen caps; and digging social security numbers out of corporate trash bins -- instead of actual search-engine hacking. Long went to great lengths to remind the kids in attendance that the point of the class was to teach them what bad guys might be doing -- and how to avoid breaches in their own security or privacy. ""Don't let me catch you guys stealing toilet paper and breaking locks,"" he said. ""If you do, it's not my fault."" Horman said he would only pick a lock if his family got locked out of their own house or car. That's happened before, he said, so that skill might be handy. ""Our family has had some trouble with locks,"" he said, smiling. ""Let's say the younger ones love playing with the key and slipping them under the door."" In the ""Meet the Feds"" session, representatives from NASA, the Department of Homeland Security, the National Security Agency and the Navy told the kids they were smart to pick up hacking skills early because the government needs employees who can hack. Several kids raised their hands to ask about hacking as a career path. Part of the potential confusion about DEF CON Kids comes from the very term ""hacker,"" which people here use to refer to anyone who has the skills needed to modify computer software and hardware. Some hackers extend the domain further, to locks and such. Those skills could be used for criminal activity, but quite a few DEF CON attendees are actually computer security professionals -- the ""good guys"" trying to make the Internet less vulnerable to attacks by computer criminals. Still, all this talk about malicious hacking made 10-year-old Dennis Mikhaylov a bit nervous. ""I'm getting a locker next year,"" he said after one of the class sessions. He's about to start middle school. ""I thought it was cool, but now I'm afraid someone might open it."" Mikhaylov said he'd deal with this by keeping any valuables, which he defined as anything with his address on it; textbooks; and his Nook e-reader, which he apparently carries around all the time, out of that school locker. The DEF CON Kids event also included a competition, where kids went around the hacker conference trying to break codes and solve puzzles. Isabel Holland, 10, made up one-half of a team called ""Sonic Death-Monkeys,"" a name she says is ""weird"" but went with because the boy who was her partner chose it. ""You have to, like, find people, and it's really hard because they're all over the place,"" she said of one piece of the challenge which required her to search out hackers. Her dad, Bo Holland, from Austin, Texas, said it's cool for kids to get a chance to see how the technology and video games they use all the time actually work. Ultimately, it will make the kids safer, he said, especially in this age of social networking, when the collective memory of the Internet has no expiration date. ""You're building up your reputation and it's not going to go away. If you do bad things, that's going to stick with you,"" he said. He added: ""You can say, 'Oh, we don't want to hear how this (hacking) stuff works and that's scary ... but it's really important kids know how to protect themselves.""","DEF CON is the world's largest gathering of computer hackers .

"CNN -- The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen last December was widely portrayed as a failure. But just how bad was the result? And is there cause for optimism? CNN spoke to climate change expert Mark Lynas who was in the room with world leaders as key decisions were debated. CNN: Would you describe the Copenhagen talks as 'a disaster'? And if so, how serious is this failure? Mark Lynas: I would describe them as a near disaster in the sense the worst outcome would have been no agreement at all, which was very nearly the situation, right up until the end... Overall, it isn't good, but it isn't the absolute end point either. CNN: China has been widely criticized for being un-cooperative. Do you think world leaders can move forward with a deal, despite China's attitude? Mark Lynas: China isn't the new Saudi Arabia, who wanted to block an agreement under all circumstances. The point is that the Chinese need to feel like they are under pressure and they need to feel that they will have to peak their emissions much earlier than they want to. I don't think that makes them unique, it just puts them in a similar situation to most other countries, including the United States. It was mainly China that tried to block the agreement in the form of the Copenhagen Accord, and I think people need to understand that so that [the Chinese] can be put under pressure in the months and years ahead. But I think the real point is this: over the last 15 years it has always been the Annex 1 countries, the rich countries, that have been the bad guys blocking agreements; countries like the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan have all been seen as obstacles to progress. But at Copenhagen it was a different situation, where the rest of the world was prepared to see serious long-term mitigation targets in any agreement and this was blocked by a country from the developing world. People need to recognize that the geopolitical realities have changed and campaigns need to change accordingly. CNN: How optimistic are you that global leaders will find their way to a multilateral deal before its too late? Mark Lynas: I don't think it's totally disastrous that we don't have an agreement now. The big emitting countries need to go back and do some thinking about all this, but they can't put off an agreement indefinitely. We also have to realize that this argument that because the rich countries have polluted, so the poor have a right to pollute, is flawed both morally and ecologically. This is the argument that has underlain everything so far, and that will need to change. If that's to happen it's going to mean a big change in how climate change politics is conceptualized and everyone from governments to NGOs to media organization have to understand this. CNN: What do you think will happen now? Mark Lynas: We have to think about what all this means and understand why progress has been so agonizingly slow. We need to work on some of the positive outcomes. Personally, I will continue to work with the Maldives to show that going carbon neutral and getting emissions down is not a huge sacrifice, but actually something that makes your life better, and puts you at the forefront with the economic winners. We need to try and change the language used to discuss climate change, from all about burden sharing, to opportunity sharing. That's a big mental shift, it's a big political shift and it's a big economic shift. I also think it's important to keep developing countries and small island states as low carbon emitters, and make sure that the low-emission path is one that brings them prosperity. We have all the technology to do that, but we don't have the political framework yet. So, we will need the right kind of funding and political will to take mitigation action. What do you think? Have your say in the Sound off box at the bottom of the page. CNN: What would you do if you were President of the USA? Mark Lynas: Obama is a smarter person than I am and I'm very reluctant to second guess him or make suggestions. Like all leaders he has to make a compromise with domestic pressures, which for him are largely very negative, certainly from the Republican right and make it almost impossible to get an international treaty through the Senate, particularly something to do with climate change. He has to balance that with his international responsibilities to keep the planet habitable. But I think he went to Copenhagen with a reasonable offer. OK, so it's only four percent below 1990 levels but you've got to deal with where we are now... The point is that all countries have to move towards peaking their emissions and the U.S. is at the table to do that and we need other countries to behave likewise. CNN: What action would you like to see ordinary concerned citizens take? Mark Lynas: It's a mixture of things. I think as individuals we have to be a bit less naive. It's really much more important what your electricity company does with its investments, than whether we all change our light bulbs or turn our heating down. This is a problem that will be solved by very large companies and countries. The hippy option of dropping out and having a different lifestyle is largely irrelevant. I want to see proper, free market-based solutions and I don't see any reason why they don't exist now. One of the reasons denial is so prevalent is that dealing with climate change is seen as a big government, taxation issue, so those on the right have nowhere to go but be in denial about the problem as a whole. I'd like to see a shift there, leaving the true Flat Earthers isolated by options that are much more market-based. Now, obviously the campaigning left will go crazy about that, but I don't mind. It's important that the debate shifts. CNN: Do you think emissions can be reduced enough to mitigate the worst effects of climate change without a global deal? Mark Lynas: I think it's unlikely we can solve this without a multilateral agreement... It is still cheaper and will probably remain cheaper to manufacture exports with coal than with renewables or nuclear or another cleaner option. So we do need an international agreement that agrees a price on carbon to shift production away from those fuels. Having countries that continue to use huge amounts of carbon to produce things cheaply and undercut their competitors would be a real problem. It is already an issue in the U.S., people say, 'If China isn't moving why should we?' You also get these kind of arguments in Europe. So I think we need a political mechanism that ensures the whole world is working together... we need a new game in town. CNN: How optimistic are you we can mitigate the worst impacts of climate change? Mark Lynas: I don't see why not. I think climate change is one of the easier ecological problems we've got to address. Tackling biodiversity loss is going to be much more difficult. Climate change should respond to a techno fix approach -- we just need to substitute our energy sources. But how are we going to save the tiger? Or the polar bears and the millions of other species under threat. I can't really see a market-based solution to that, or even a technology-based solution at the moment. There are all these problems waiting in the wings. Climate change is probably the most important and the most urgent... but I don't see why the energy system will be so difficult to change, particularly as we have decades to do it. If you think how different the world is today from how it was in 1950, what will it look like in 2050? Almost all the industrial plants that exist will have been retired and replaced by then. So long as we have the politics in place to ensure no new carbon-intensive plants are built, we can get there. CNN: What gives you optimism? Mark Lynas: I just don't see any particular reason why we shouldn't solve this problem. Given that carbon is not necessary for development. You don't need to burn coal to be prosperous, you don't even need to bun oil for transport, and there is an alternative for almost everything people want and value in their lives that is currently provided by a fossil fuel, perhaps with the exception of aviation... The politics look so difficult at the moment because the interests of different countries aren't really aligned, but that's a job for political leaders. It's been rather slow going, you know two steps forward, one step backwards, or in the last couple of years, two steps backwards one step forward. We do have to recognize that lack of progress. But political leaders are engaged in this and I can't see how it will just be dropped. Plus, the climate will keep on changing, whether it's global average temperatures or extreme weather events, so we are going to have solve it, even if we have to solve it very hurriedly and very expensively, we will have to do it. Simple as that.","Climate change expert Mark Lynas was at COP15 summit .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Tuesday urged both industrialized and developing countries to do more during this week's Copenhagen summit toward reaching an agreement on limiting carbon emissions. With world leaders gathering in hopes of forging a deal to reduce the emissions blamed for increasing global temperatures, Ban told reporters that ""Nature does not negotiate with us."" ""We have a chance -- a real chance, here and now -- to change the course of our history,"" he said. But both industrialized and developing countries ""can and they must do more."" ""This is a time to stop pointing fingers,"" Ban added. ""This is a time to start looking in the mirror and offering what they can do more of."" The divide between rich and poor countries is one of the key fissures at the U.N. climate change conference that is nearing a climax in Denmark. Developing countries object to restrictions which they fear would keep them from following the same path to prosperity that the United States and other industrialized nations took, while developed countries are wary of taking steps that would hinder their own economies. Representatives of more than 100 developing nations walked out on the climate summit Monday to protesting what they called inadequate offers of aid from richer countries. Island states in particular, which are more vulnerable to rising sea levels, are pushing for limits that would reduce carbon emissions enough to limit the expected rise in average global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). John Holmes, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said the impacts of climate change are more likely to be felt by developing countries. ""This is something that's happening now,"" he said. ""Climate change has a human face, and that face is represented in part by the most vulnerable and poorest people in the world."" The so-called ""High Level Segment"" of the conference, in which world leaders sit down in an attempt to hash out a final agreement, begins on Wednesday evening. Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told reporters Tuesday that ""nowhere near enough progress"" had been made towards a deal. But Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the summit's host, said he remained confident an accord could be struck by week's end if governments were ""ambitious."" ""We can do this by Friday,"" he said. ""I've chosen to be optimistic about that."" Are you in Copenhagen? Share your images . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that Washington is ready to do its part to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, but other countries must play their part as well. ""Nearly all of the growth in emissions in the next 20 years will come from the developing world,"" Clinton wrote in an opinion piece for the International Herald Tribune.

"(CNN) -- The pope's personal preacher apologized Sunday for comparing fury over sexual abuse within the church to anti-Semitism. ""If, against my intention, I've hurt the Jewish people's feelings and those of the victims of child abuse, I'm truly sorry and ask forgiveness,"" the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa said in an interview published in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. He emphasized that Pope Benedict XVI ""not only did not inspire"" the sermon that contained the comparison, but also ""like everyone else, heard my words for the first time during the liturgy."" There was no official statement on the apology issued by the Vatican on Sunday. Vatican official did not immediately return calls from CNN. In a sermon Friday, Cantalamessa referred to a history of ""collective violence"" against Jews, then quoted from what he said was a letter from a Jewish friend who wrote that the anger at Catholic leadership over the sexual abuse scandal ""reminds us of the most shameful aspects of anti-Semitism."" The pope did not refer to the sex abuse scandal in his traditional Easter message on Sunday but said that humanity was suffering from a ""profound crisis"" requiring ""deep change, beginning with consciences."" The pope offered words of support to Christian minorities in Iraq, Pakistan and the Middle East as well as to the earthquake-stricken countries of Haiti and Chile and to Latin American and the Caribbean countries afflicted by drug trafficking.

"An Indian drug company executive allegedly tampered with and destroyed evidence after a dozen women died following sterilization surgeries, an official said Friday. Ramesh Mahawar, the head of Mahawar Pharmaceuticals, and his son Sumeet are also accused of forgery, Sonmoni Borah, commissioner of Bilaspur district in India's Chhattisgarh state, told CNN on Friday. In addition, all sales of their company's products have been banned until further notice, Borah said. The two men's arrests follow a police raid Thursday evening on a Mahawar Pharmaceuticals facility in Raipur, capital of Chhattisgarh state. A day earlier, the surgeon involved in more than 80 sterilization operations Saturday at a mobile clinic -- after which a dozen women died and scores more were hospitalized -- was taken into custody. Dr. R.K. Gupta was charged with negligence and attempted culpable homicide in the women's deaths, according to Borah. He remains in custody Friday. Gupta had defended his actions before his arrest, telling CNN that he and his team had followed all necessary safety procedures. He also said the women died because of drugs they received in their villages after the surgeries. Mahawar Pharmaceuticals produced the antibiotic, Ciprofloxacin, that the women took after Saturday's surgeries, Borah said. The current charge that Ramesh Mahawar and his son face doesn't implicate either of them directly in the women's deaths. But authorities -- who are waiting on lab results to specify the women's cause of death -- could decide to bring more charges against them later. The deaths have put a spotlight on India's decadelong initiative to curb population growth. Voluntary sterilization surgeries at mobile ""camps"" are part of that program, though some activists said they are too often conducted in unsafe and dangerous conditions.","Official: The head of Mahawar Pharmaceuticals and his son are arrested .

"(CNN) -- The number of people forced from their homes worldwide has risen to 43.7 million, the highest level in 15 years, according to a U.N. refugee agency report released Monday. That's up from 43.3 million people a year earlier, said UNHCR's 2010 Global Trends report, which was released to coincide with World Refugee Day. Of those displaced, the report classified 15.4 million people as refugees forced to flee their country and 27.5 million as displaced persons within their own country, forced to leave their home because of conflict or natural disaster, the report said. The release of the annual report comes amid ireports of people fleeing conflict in Syria, Sudan and Libya. In recent days, thousands have begun fleeing to refugee camps set up along the Syria-Turkey border to accommodate those attempting to escape a Syrian military crackdown on anti-government demonstrators. ""Four-fifths of world refugees are in the developing world, and it is the developing world that needs international solidarity to cope with this challenge,"" Antonio Guterres, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Monday. A woman, who identified herself as Nour, said she fled to the camps because she believed she would die if she stayed in Syria. ""I come here. This circumstance is so difficult,"" she said. ""I am pregnant. I cannot bear such things. "" The report said 10.5 million of the world's refugees are under the care of the United Nations, and another 4.82 million are registered with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. ""I think there are two dramatic misperceptions (regarding refugees),"" Guterres said.  ""The first is the idea that all refugees come into the north, into Europe, which is not true ... and the second perception is the inability to distinguish what economic migration is -- people moving from one country to another because they want, and that's a very legitimate aspiration, a better life, and what refugees are -- those that are fleeing the conflict and persecution, those that have no alternative but to flee from their country."" The report also found that Afghans accounted for a third of the world's refugees, followed by Iraqis, Somalis, Congolese and Sudanese refugees. Four-fifths of the world's refugees live in some of the world's poorest countries, with Pakistan, Iran and Syria hosting the most refugees, according to the report. ""The world is failing these people, leaving them to wait out the instability back home and put their lives on hold indefinitely,"" Guterres said in a written statement. ""Developing countries cannot continue to bear this burden alone, and the industrialized world must address this imbalance."" Guterres called for increased settlement quotas and accelerated peace initiatives in long-standing conflicts so that refugees can go home.

"BRASILIA, Brazil (CNN)  -- A doctor excommunicated by the Catholic Church for performing an abortion on a 9-year-old rape victim received a standing ovation during a national convention on women's health, according to a local media report. Archbishop Don Jose Cardoso Sobrinho excommunicated the doctors who performed the child's abortion. The response came during the opening ceremony of an event hosted by Brazilian Minister of Health Jose Gomes Temporao. The newspaper O Povo reported that Temporao called on the audience to acknowledge the ""brilliant"" work done by a medical team in the abortion, performed in Brazil's northeastern city of Recife. The girl was pregnant with twins after being raped, allegedly by her stepfather, police were quoted in media reports as saying. The abuse had gone on since the girl was 6, authorities said. The abortion was performed March 4 during the fourth month of pregnancy, according to media reports . Archbishop Don Jose Cardoso Sobrinho of Recife excommunicated the doctor, the child's mother and the medical team involved in the procedure. However, the stepfather was not excommunicated, with Sobrinho telling Globo TV that, ""A graver act than (rape) is abortion, to eliminate an innocent life."" The child was not excommunicated, Sobrinho said, because Catholic Church law says minors are exempt from excommunication. ""The church is benevolent when it comes to minors,"" he told Globo TV. ""As for the adults, especially those who approved it, performed this abortion, the excommunication is applicable."" ""God's law is above human laws,"" Sobrinho said. The case has outraged the Brazilian public and fueled a controversy reaching the highest levels of church and state in a nation whose law bans abortion except in cases of rape. Temporao recently said doctors must put law before religion. ""The question posed is very simple. There is a Brazilian law which states that a pregnancy can be interrupted in case of rape,"" Temporao said. ""It is legitimate for the church to have its dogmas, but these dogmas must not be imposed on society as a whole,"" he added. Earlier, a verbal spat ensued between President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and the archbishop over the church's decision. ""As a Christian and a Catholic, I find it deeply lamentable that a bishop of the Catholic Church has such a conservative attitude,"" Lula said on Globo TV. ""In this case, the medical profession was more right than the church,"" he said. Meanwhile, a Vatican cleric told Italy's La Stampa newspaper that he supports the Brazilian archbishop's decision to excommunicate all involved in the abortion except for the child. Dr. Olimpio Moraes, one of the doctors involved in the procedure, said he thanked the archbishop for his excommunication because the controversy sheds light on Brazil's restrictive abortion laws. He said women in Brazil's countryside are victimized by Brazil's ban on abortion. Some of the doctors vowed to continue attending church services, despite being expelled. ""The fact that I was excommunicated will not keep me from going to Mass, praying, conversing with God, and asking him to illuminate me and my colleagues in our medical team to help us take care of people in similar cases,"" one doctor said. TV Globo reported that the child, who is from a town outside Recife, has stayed in the city to recover and to escape media coverage. Her current condition is not known. A new report by Brazil's IPAS, a non-governmental organization that works with the health ministry, indicates that more than 1 million women undergo illegal abortions in Brazil each year. About 250,000 are treated by doctors for traumas due to botched abortions, said Beatriz Jalli, an IPAS official. Studies at a Brazilian hospital dedicated to treating female victims of violence, the Perola Byington in Sao Paulo, indicated that more than 40 percent of the cases involved children. ""This is why the Recife case is so important for women in Brazil,"" Jalli said. Jalli said the liberated ""Girl from Ipanema"" image that many foreigners have of Brazilian women is far from reality. ""We live in a male chauvinistic, patriarchal society with a very high rate of sexual crimes against women and minors,"" she said. ""Our reproductive rights are constantly criminalized.""

"Texas won another battle against Planned Parenthood this week. A federal appeals court, on Thursday, refused to grant another hearing to the organization, a decision that stops the organization's fight against Texas' effort  to ban state funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates. Texas Gov. Rick Perry applauded the decision, by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. ""Today's ruling affirms yet again that in Texas the Women's Health Program has no obligation to fund Planned Parenthood and other organizations that perform or promote abortion. In Texas we choose life, and we will immediately begin defunding all abortion affiliates to honor and uphold that choice,"" Perry said. The decision continues a legal struggle that has been going on for months. The Texas Women's Health Program provides about 130,000 low-income women with family planning exams, related health screenings and contraception. Texas opposed government funding for Planned Parenthood clinics because the organization provides abortions. The state said in March that it was willing to give up funding from Washington and run the Women's Health Program itself. It then adopted a rule that required clinics funded by the program to certify they do not perform abortions or are not affiliates of entities that perform abortions. In a letter to Texas officials in March, Medicaid Director Cindy Mann said the state's decision was regrettable. It would, she said, ""prevent women enrolled in the program from receiving services from the trusted health care providers they have chosen and relied on for their care."" Planned Parenthood sued Texas, winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and Texas' efforts would block women's access to preventive health care. But a federal court later ruled in favor of Texas.","Texas opposes government funding for abortion providers .

"Washington (CNN) -- China said Saturday it had suspended military exchanges with the United States over Washington's $6.4-billion arms deal with Taiwan, the territory that Beijing claims as its own. China's Defense Ministry said the decision to halt visits between the Chinese and U.S. armed forces was made ""in consideration of the serious harm and impacts on Sino-U.S. military relations"" brought about by the arms deal, according to a report on the state-run Xinhua news agency. Xinhua did not immediately provide further details on the visits. ""China will make further judgments as appropriate,"" the agency reported. China had already complained to the United States about the deal, announced Friday by the Obama administration. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei called it a ""rude interference in China's internal affairs, severely endangering China's national security"" and said China expressed its ""strong indignation."" The arms sale includes 60 Black Hawk helicopters, totaling $3.1 billion; 114 advanced Patriot air defense missiles; a pair of Osprey mine-hunting ships; and dozens of advanced communications systems. The deal with Taiwan -- which neither China nor the United States recognizes as a sovereign nation -- does not include F-16 fighter jets, which China has vehemently opposed. The State Department described the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan as a way to guarantee security and stability, despite China's objections. ""This is a clear demonstration of the commitment this administration has to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons it needs and as provided for in the Taiwan Relations Act,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday. He said the action is consistent with Washington's ""one-China"" policy and will help maintain security and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The arms sales come as the United States is hoping to persuade China to sign on to harsher sanctions against Iran and just after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized China for its policies relating to the Internet. Crowley would not speak directly about the timing of the announcement of the sales, and about the fact that the arms package does not include F-16s. A senior U.S. official said later that the United States expected Chinese criticism of the arms deal, but does not expect permanent damage. The official said he believed Clinton had discussed the sale in London with her Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of Thursday's international conference on Afghanistan. ""This relationship between the United States and China is broad, it's deep. There are a large number of issues. We don't see eye to eye with them and we have to have and do have the ability to speak honestly,"" the official said. The arms deal is the latest chapter in a decades-long uneasy standoff. China claims Taiwan is its own territory and has threatened to invade if Taiwan ever declares independence. The United States has said it will defend Taiwan if China ever attacks. The government in Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China until a Communist insurrection proved victorious in 1949. With the Communist takeover of mainland China, the losing faction fled to the island of Taiwan. Taiwan is formally known as the Republic of China, while Communist China's official name is People's Republic of China. Many Western nations and the United Nations recognized Taiwan as the legitimate Chinese government until the 1970s.","China suspends military exchanges with U.S. over $6.4B arms deal with Taiwan .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Five former Blackwater Worldwide security guards pleaded not guilty Tuesday to voluntary manslaughter charges and other crimes stemming from a shooting incident in Baghdad that left 17 Iraqis dead. Former Blackwater Worldwide security Donald Ball, center, leaves court after his arraignment Tuesday.

The five defendants, seated in a row at a courtroom table, remained silent in court, and as they entered and departed the courthouse. A lawyer entered their plea on their behalf. Attorney David Schertler, speaking for all the defendants outside the courthouse, predicted they will be proved innocent. ""We want to make it clear to everyone these men committed no crime. They were defending themselves on a battlefield in a war zone when this occurred,"" he said. If convicted, the defendants would face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison for each manslaughter count, seven years in prison for each count of attempted manslaughter, and a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence for the firearms charge. Judge Ricardo Urbina set a trial date for February 1, 2010. He agreed with defense attorneys that preparations for the complex case will require a full year, including the likely need for lawyers to travel to Baghdad to gather information and conduct interviews. ""The United States government had a year and a half to investigate the case, and we did not. So we need a year to catch up,"" Schertler told reporters. Lead government prosecutor Kenneth Kohl did not comment outside court. The Baghdad incident, which occurred September 16, 2007, exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life. It also created an extremely delicate political situation for the Bush administration and the Iraqi government. The five defendants are Donald Ball, 26, of West Valley City, Utah; Dustin Heard, 27, of Knoxville, Tennessee; Evan Liberty, 26, of Rochester, New Hampshire; Nick Slatten, 25, of Sparta, Tennessee; and Paul Slough, 29, of Keller, Texas. A sixth former security guard, Jeremy P. Ridgeway, 35, of California, has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter. Prosecutors did not bring manslaughter charges for three of the 17 fatalities because they do not believe they have enough evidence to win a conviction in those deaths. The company of Blackwater Worldwide does not face any charges. The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA), which was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services ""in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas."" The attorneys for the defendants contend that Blackwater's employees in Iraq are exempt from the provisions of MEJA because the company has a contract in Iraq with the State Department, not the Defense Department. Also muddying the case are assurances of immunity initially given to the guards by State Department diplomatic security agents, who were investigating the incident before the FBI tried to interview them once it took over. The State Department maintains its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution, but promised only that the statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution. But when the investigation was turned over to the Justice Department to examine possible criminal activity, FBI agents discovered some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again, complicating the FBI probe. A recently approved U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement pointedly specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country.

"South Korean authorities are cracking down on the company that operated the passenger ferry that sank last month, a disaster that killed hundreds of people and shocked the nation. The chief executive of Cheonghaejin Marine Company, the ferry operator, was arrested Thursday and is facing charges including causing death by negligence, said Yang Joong-jin, a senior prosecutor in the investigation. At the same time, the government has begun to take steps to revoke the company's business licenses, the the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said. The planned measures are aimed at taking away the licenses of the company for all its routes, including the one on which the Sewol passenger ferry sank, leaving more than 260 people dead and dozens still missing. Most of the dead and missing are students, all from the same high school, who were taking the ferry to the resort island of Jeju for a field trip. The stunning loss of life has shaken South Korea, raising troubling questions about safety standards and government oversight of businesses. President Park Geun-hye has apologized over the government's handling of the disaster and pledged to overhaul safety systems to try to prevent accidents in the future. Prosecutor: CEO arrested, charged in South Korea ferry disaster . Excess cargo blamed . Kim Han-sik, the chief executive officer of Cheonghaejin Marine, was arrested in connection with allegations that excessive cargo a played a role in the April 16 sinking, Yang said. Investigators have said the amount of cargo, more than double the ferry's limit, and the failure to tie it down properly was partly responsible for the sinking of the Sewol, which was carrying 476 passengers and crew. Speaking to reporters Thursday with his face covered, Kim apologized for the disaster. ""Victims of Sewol ferry and their bereaved families, I am sorry, I am sorry. I have committed crime that can only be paid back with my life,"" he said in comments broadcast on South Korean broadcaster YTN. Several other of the company's employees have been indicted in the case, along with the ship's captain and more than a dozen crew members. Authorities have searched the company's offices as part of the criminal investigation. 'Serious problems' The government, meanwhile, plans to take away the company's licenses for all its routes, including the one on which the Sewol sank, said Nam Jae-heon, an official at the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. ""Normally, we would cancel route by route, but in this case of Chonghaejin Marine Co., it is not just the route that is problem ... there are serious problems with firm's entire business practices,"" Nam said. ""We have decided not to wait for the investigation results from the prosecutor, as would have been the standard practice, but to go ahead with the revocation of the business licenses as soon as possible since there is enough evidence out there to support the revocation,"" he said. Chonghaejin Marine didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from CNN. At least 269 people died in the disaster, which happened while the ferry was traveling from Incheon to Jeju, off South Korea's southwestern coast. Thirty-five people still are unaccounted for, according to the country's coast guard. Search continues . Divers are still searching the submerged vessel for the missing people, braving frigid waters, strong currents and corridors clogged with debris. Last week, one of the divers died while working to recover bodies. The ill-fated voyage trip wasn't the first time the ferry had an excess cargo, a joint investigation team told reporters earlier this week. Since the Sewol began the Incheon-Jeju route in March 2013, the ferry carried excess cargo 139 times, investigators said. Cheonghaejin Marine earned an extra 62 million South Korean won ($62,000) for the excess cargo on the April 16 voyage, and nearly 3 billion South Korean won ($2.9 million) in extra profit for all of the excess cargo that the ferry carried since March 2013, investigators said.","The government is moving to revoke the ferry operator's business licenses .

"The first thing to remember about federal government shutdowns is that they do not matter very much. History does not now recall the three Democrat-led shutdowns during the Carter administration over using Medicaid dollars to fund abortions, even though their combined 28 days will almost certainly dwarf the Great Impasse of October 2013. Even the most famous modern shutdown, the 21-day Newt Gingrich/Bill Clinton standoff of 1995-96, had effects that were felt most acutely by comparatively well-off federal workers, not their taxpayer bosses. A recent Congressional Research Service summary of that event included among its headline impacts stuff like ""National Institute of Standards and Technology was unable to issue a new standard for lights and lamps that was scheduled to be effective January 1, 1996, possibly resulting in delayed product delivery and lost sales."" Probably the worst thing back then was that passports for Americans and visas for foreigners went unprocessed for three weeks, taking a temporary bite out of the tourism industry. So when President Barack Obama says the shutdown will ""throw a wrench into the gears of our economy"" and put ""the American people's hard-earned progress at risk,"" it is appropriate to treat such claims with skepticism. As we saw during the run-up to the March 1 sequestration trims in federal spending, politicians are incentivized by self-interest and unconstrained by shame in maximizing the hyperbole about what may happen if their ability to collect and redistribute our money is impeded even a little bit. None of this, however, means that the shutdown is good politics. On that score, all recent public opinion research is unanimous: It isn't. As a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday concluded, ""American voters oppose 72-22% Congress shutting down the federal government to block implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare."" All summer and early fall, Republicans have played a good political hand badly. Americans don't like federal spending levels, don't like increasing the debt ceiling  unaccompanied by spending cuts, are souring on President Obama and continue to be lukewarm at best toward his signature legislative accomplishment. This would suggest broad political support for keeping day-to-day federal spending levels (at most) as is, attaching some cuts to the inevitable debt-ceiling increase, and using the October 1 rollout of the Affordable Care Act as a teaching moment toward crafting policy and politics for legislative reform and eventually replacing it. Instead of focusing on those popular means to achievable ends, Republicans spent this political season attempting a Hail Mary pass with a broken throwing arm. Trying to defund Obamacare through deadline negotiations in the House of Representatives is not only massively unpopular, but—even according to some of the most influential backers of the project—probably doomed from the start. It appears unlikely at this writing that our latest government shutdown will end with much more than a relatively insignificant medical-device tax tweak to go along with yet another budgetary can-kicking exercise. By that time, it is plausible to assume, public opinion toward Republican negotiators will have further eroded, making it harder to get debt-ceiling concessions. Everyone, everywhere, will declare the whole sorry episode bad for America. But is it really? Despite the soul-killing grotesqueness of divided-government brinkmanship, there are some potential upsides even to this dreary saga, particularly for those of us who prefer our government limited. For starters, closing down Washington provides one of the only occasions to have a national discussion of what is and is not ""essential"" government work. At a time when entitlements, pensions and debt service will be swallowing ever-larger slices of the budgetary pie at all levels of government for as far as the eye can see, this is an exercise we'll all soon have to master. Shutdown politics from 2011 and earlier this year also produced something many people thought they'd never see: a year-over-year trim in Defense Department spending signed onto by the Republican Party. As Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, has observed, you cannot hope to limit the size of government if you do not also find some military spending to cut. Sequestration was the first in what will have to be many more such steps. Even the maddening and deeply irresponsible budgetary governance by continuing resolution has produced a desirable result through undesirable means: an effective flat-lining of government spending. (Or as The Cato Institute's Daniel J. Mitchell puts it, ""the federal government in the past two years has been wasting money at a slower rate."") So, you don't have to squint too hard to see some positive side-benefits of D.C. dysfunction. But that doesn't make it any less desultory. This year, for the first time since 2009, both the Senate and the House of Representatives fulfilled their legal requirement in passing an annual budget. It's long since time to supplement this minimal stab at responsibility with the legislative next step: a conference committee to hash out a compromise for consideration from the president. If our federal government must careen from crisis to crisis, the least it can do is push the deadlines out to every 12 months. There are too many actually interesting things going on in this country to waste our energy watching professional hucksters argue over our money.","Matt Welch: Government shutdowns haven't mattered much in past, nor will this one .

"(CNN) -- Debra Sholty was just opening up her business Thursday morning in Kokomo, Indiana, when a 3.8-magnitude earthquake rumbled through the north-central part of the state. ""It was like a huge explosion under your feet,"" said Sholty, the owner of Hobson Cleaners. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck just before 8 a.m. ET and was three miles deep. The USGS initially reported that the quake had registered a 4.2 magnitude, but later revised the estimate. Its epicenter was located about 15 miles east-southeast of Kokomo, and 50 miles north of Indianapolis. No damage was immediately reported in Indianapolis, though some residents closer to the epicenter were surprised by the quake's intensity. There was ""a very loud boom,"" Sholty said. ""We really felt it. ... It was like something hit the building from underneath. I actually felt an upward lift."" Laura Smith, who works at nearby Windmill Grill, told CNN she initially thought a truck had hit her building while trying to make a delivery. ""The whole building just shook,"" she said. ""You could feel your body shaking."" ""It was amazing,"" she added. ""Personally, I thought it was exciting."" Jerry Fiscus, owner of Kokomo's Hair Care East salon, said the quake shook his building ""pretty well,"" though nothing fell off the shelves. ""It was like a really big thunder strike,"" said Missy Dulmes, who was at home making breakfast at the time. ""You could hear the silverware shake in the drawer and the table moved."" Dulmes said she was initially concerned that a water pipe had broken. Few people contacted by CNN, however, reported being frightened by the incident, which is more commonly associated with west coast cities like Los Angeles than heartland towns like Kokomo. ""I'm over 50,"" Sholty said with a chuckle. ""Nothing really frightens me anymore.""","NEW: The Indiana earthquake has been downgraded from 4.2 to a 3.8 magnitude .

"A North Carolina law that made women who wanted an abortion get an ultrasound, and then have the image described to them, is unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled Friday. ""The Supreme Court has never held that a state has the power to compel a health care provider to speak, in his or her own voice, the state's ideological message in favor of carrying a pregnancy to term and this court declines to do so today,"" U.S. District Judge Catherine Eagles said in her ruling. The law required abortion providers to perform an ultrasound and place the image in the woman's line of sight. The fetus would then be described in detail, even if the woman asked the provider not to. Supporters of the law had argued that it would promote childbirth. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups that brought the lawsuit praised the judge's decision. ""Today's court ruling protects the rights of women and their doctors from the ideological agenda of extremist lawmakers,""  said Jennifer Rudinger, executive director of the ACLU of North Carolina. Oklahoma lost a similar fight in its own effort to require health care providers to perform an ultrasound before terminating a pregnancy. The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to accept Oklahoma's appeal over the law, which lower state courts had found unconstitutional.

"New Delhi (CNN)India's federal government on Tuesday warned states against allowing unlicensed Web-based taxi services after an Uber driver was accused of raping a woman in New Delhi. Home Minister Rajnath Singh said his ministry had advised state governments ""to ensure that the operations of the web-based taxi services are stopped"" and that non-licensed operators are prohibited until they register with authorities. Transport authorities in New Delhi on Monday announced a ban on Uber services in the Indian capital, saying their investigation revealed the company was violating permit rules. Authorities say Uber was operating as a local taxi on a national permit. Commercial vehicles on national permit cannot operate as taxis ferrying passengers from one destination to another within a city. New Delhi police say they will implement the ban. But Uber said it hadn't been officially notified of the measure and that its service was still operating in the city. Singh said police were exploring what he called Uber's ""possible legal liability"" in the rape case, in which a 26-year-old woman alleges she was assaulted at the weekend after being taken to a deserted stretch of road in an Uber car she had ordered. New Delhi police have filed a case against Uber ""under sections relating to cheating and violation of government rules and orders,"" said Deputy Police Commissioner Madhur Verma. Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused of raping his passenger, remains in police custody for questioning. Police say Yadav's address and background weren't verified in his driver registration. Uber said in a statement that it ""exclusively partners"" with registered drivers who have been through the commercial licensing process and who have government identification and state-issued permits. It called the alleged rape ""abhorrent"" and said it was cooperating with the investigation. Uber drew heavy criticism last month after one of its executives suggested that it would be fair game to dig up dirt on journalists who were critical of his company. A U.S. tech journalist singled out by the executive said there was an""escalating and scary pattern of misogyny"" at Uber, citing the way Uber has dealt with assault complaints from female riders and a recent promo offering free rides with beautiful women. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","Indian Home Minister advises states to halt operations of Web-based taxi services .

"A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order Sunday that will allow the only abortion clinic operating in Mississippi to stay open -- for now. The Jackson Women's Health Organization filed for the action in response to a new state law that would require a clinic's abortion providers to be certified OB/GYN practitioners, and for those physicians to all have privileges at an area hospital. The law, which took effect Sunday, puts the clinic at risk, as all its doctors do not have such privileges. The judge's order blocks enforcement of the law at least until the next hearing on the matter, which is scheduled for July 11. ""I'm jubilant,"" said Diane Derzis, clinic owner and president. ""It means the constitutional rights of women to make their decision, for the time being, is in place."" Officials at the Jackson clinic say they are working to comply with the law. All of its doctors are OB/GYNs who travel in from other states. But only one can practice at a local hospital. They say they are trying to gain privileges at Jackson-area hospitals, but that the cumbersome process and red tape forced them to file for a reprieve. ""Disappointing"" is how Gov. Phil Bryant described the decision, according to spokesman Mick Bullock. The governor ""plans to work with state leaders to ensure this legislation properly takes effect as soon as possible,"" he said. State Rep. Sam Mims, who sponsored the legislation, said ""we will speak with our attorneys regarding our game plan,"" in response to the judge's order Sunday. Bryant signed the bill into law in April after the Republican-dominated legislature overwhelmingly passed it. Mississippi is one of the toughest states on the abortion-rights movement. The state has laws requiring a 24-hour waiting period, as well as parental consent if the patient seeking an abortion is a minor. Mims previously told CNN the intent behind the legislation was to ensure that women undergoing abortions are receiving care from a certified, professional physician. ""If something goes wrong, which it might -- we hope it doesn't, but it could -- that physician could follow the patient to a local hospital. That's the intent. And what happens afterwards, we'll have to see what happens,"" he said. But Derzis believes that the real intent of the newly elected Republican majority was to end abortion in the state, not to improve women's health care. ""This is not about safety. This is about politics. Politics do not need to be in our uterus,"" she said.","Jackson Women's Health Organization filed for the action in response to a new state law .

"Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made history as the country's first directly elected president but his ambitious economic plans could be scuttled by the region's volatile geopolitics. As prime minister, Erdogan presided over the dramatic rise and fall of Turkey's economy, wooing the emerging East before being undone by the winding back of stimulus programs in the West. Despite the economic decline, and a 52% presidential vote being lower than expected, Erdogan's aims for expansion remain undimmed. He has outlined plans to boost Turkey's GDP from $820 billion in 2013 to $2 trillion in 2023, and to more than double per capita income from just under $11,000 to $25,000 in the same time frame. The year 2023 is important to Erdogan, as it is the 100th anniversary of the country's founding as a modern state by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Near term, the real challenge is avoiding stagnation due to the challenges in neighboring Syria and especially in Northern Iraq -- where the march of terrorist group ISIS continues -- which are undermining growth.  After hitting 2% in 2012, the economy grew 4% last year. The government is expecting to show 4% growth for 2014. In his victory speech Erdogan, who as PM presided over the violent Gezi Park protests, a Twitter blackout and a corruption probe that hit the government, declared he wanted to start a ""social reconciliation"" period, leaving the ""tensions, culture of clashes and virtual problems"" in the ""old Turkey."" Erdogan's force of personality carried him through nearly 12 years of prime ministership and he should not be underestimated in this new role. But his controversial rule as prime minister prompted ratings agency Fitch to Monday say political risk remained high as Erdogan shifted his power to president. ""Given the anti-government protests last summer in response to Erdogan's perceived authoritarian tendencies,"" Fitch said, ""political tension is likely to remain high as Erdogan seeks to extend the power of the presidency."" Fitch warned Turkey's ""policy coherence and credibility"" was already weaker than its ratings peers, noting Erdogan's leadership had contributed to political risk that fed credit weakness. Beyond the domestic concerns, Erdogan cannot control the volatility of his country's neighborhood -- and could find his plans entangled in his own divisive history and that of the region.

"Diego Mendieta was a man who needed help. There he lay, helpless. Alone. Dying. There were no news stories. There was no #prayforMendieta hashtag, not even a line on the internet. With the world oblivious to his plight, the Paraguayan, thousands of miles from home, passed away at the age of 32 in an Indonesian hospital on Tuesday. Mendieta was a footballer who formerly played for Persis Solo, a club based 90 minutes' flight from the capital, Jakarta. He had longed to return home to see his wife and two children but had not been paid four months' wages -- worth an estimated $12,500. Mendieta fell ill and died of cytomegalovirus, a common infection that can be spread by coughing or sneezing. In his final days, without enough money to finance his medical treatment, he changed hospitals three times and lost about 17 kilograms (about 37 pounds) in weight before his death. His skeletal frame was left on a stretcher, covered by an old Real Madrid shirt, with a few football fans for company. It is a story that has spread around the globe and left another stain on the sport in Indonesia, where two rival organizations are battling for control of the game. ""After his contract expired in June and his former club had not paid his salary, Mendieta suffered financially. He played in some rough football matches to survive in Solo,"" Indonesian journalist Sam Hadi of Kompas Daily said. ""He was unable to pay for his rented room in the last six months. He even had difficulties to pay for  food, so his friends, colleagues and fans raised money to help him. ""His agent had advised Mendieta to go home by preparing the flight ticket for him. But Mendieta reportedly said that he was ashamed of not bringing back money to his country."" Having fallen ill in early November, Mendieta was first diagnosed with typhoid. By the time he reached his third hospital, where he could not afford his medical bills,  the cytomegalovirus had crawled to his brain, Hadi said. ""It was very, very sad situation for him."" Football in the Asian country has been torn apart by infighting between the Indonesian Soccer Association (PSSI) and the breakaway Indonesian Soccer Rescue Committee (KPSI). Football's ruling body, FIFA, has threatened to impose sanctions unless an agreement is reached. Both bodies, which have their own competitions, have agreed to run just one league next season to avoid punishment from FIFA, whose executive committee expects to have to rule on the matter at its meeting next Friday. The PSSI did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. ""Unfortunately yet again, it seems that the set objectives will not be reached and we, therefore, anticipate that the PSSI will be sanctioned,"" FIFA Secretary-General Jerome Valcke wrote in a letter to Indonesian sports minister Andi Mallarangeng. ""We are fully aware that Indonesia is passionate about football and that sanctions will have a major impact. We have tried tirelessly to solve the problems, but we are afraid that there will be no choice unless the objectives are met or that significant progress has been made."" The division has caused great ructions within Indonesian football, with players often the victims both financially and physically. ""Mendieta's death raises questions of how he was treated by Liga Super's management. Why was he not paid his salary for so long?"" PSSI official Rudolf  Yesayas told AFP. ""Managing football is a complicated affair. Mendieta's death highlights the  importance of having one football association, not more."" The national team has also suffered, losing 10-0 to Bahrain in a World Cup qualifier in March, a result that was investigated by FIFA because of suspicions of match-fixing. ""It has been almost two years since Indonesian football split,"" Hadi said. ""However, the financial problems do not only hit the breakaway clubs but also the clubs which play under the PSSI competition."" He said 13 clubs from both leagues are months late with payments, according to the players' association. ""On this matter, PSSI said on its official website that they would help the cost of flying Mendieta's body back to Paraguay, but they won't pay the players' salary as Persis did not play under PSSI competition,"" Hadi said. ""On the other hand, Persis officials said they have transferred Mendieta's salary to his wife in Paraguay. "" Hadi said an out-of-contract Brazilian footballer, Bruno Zandonadi, also died in similar circumstances three months ago after being infected during treatment in an Indonesian hospital. While Solo Mayor Hadi Rudyatmo has said he will pay Mendieta's hospital bills, the act of charity has come too late for FIFPro, which represents footballers around the world, with a membership of 60,000. FIFPro launched a ""Black Book"" this year, detailing the abuse of players in Eastern Europe. It has repeatedly fought cases for players facing violence, arbitrary termination of contracts and non-payments of salaries. It has also taken up the case of 2010 World Cup finalist Wesley Sneijder, who has been asked to extend his contract for no additional pay by Italian club Inter Milan. ""FIFPro demands that the Indonesian football association make an end to the structural mismanagement of countless football clubs,"" the Netherlands-based group said in a statement. ""It is a disgrace for the whole of professional football in Indonesia,"" added Frederique Winia, secretary general of FIFPro's Asia division. ""I know countless stories of players who are intentionally not paid by their club and have to wait for months for their salary. But I have never before heard a story where a seriously ill player has been left completely to his fate by a club. ""I assume that both the club and the national football association of Indonesia realize that they have seriously failed and that they have much to explain, particularly to the family and relatives of Diego Mendieta. The least the club can do is to pay the arrears in salary to his family."" Mendieta's body has been transported back to Paraguay, where he will be buried. His wife, Valeria, remains adamant that the Indonesian authorities are solely responsible for Mendieta's death. ""He was practically abandoned. The only help he received was from three Paraguayan companions, nothing other than that,"" she told Radio Cardinal. Mendieta's plight has drawn widespread sympathy. ""It's a heartwrenching tale,"" Indonesian football expert Antony Sutton said. ""As an expat myself, I know what it's like to be on your own in a foreign country and left to fend for yourself,"" said Sutton, author of the Jakarta Casual blog. ""He hadn't been paid in four months and was all alone without anyone to pay the bills. The Persis Solo fans, who are extremely passionate, did their best to raise money and made about $300. ""But before I found out about the story, it was too late and he was dead. It's a real tragedy."" Emotional Muamba 'gets closure' While the case of Fabrice Muamba, the former Bolton player who collapsed on the pitch after going into cardiac arrest, drew intense media coverage, Mendieta did not have the same fortune. Muamba's collapse at Tottenham's White Hart Lane in March was broadcast around the world after the midfielder's heart stopped for 76 minutes. Twitter went into overdrive, players around the world wore ""Muamba"" shirts to express their solidarity, and news channels jumped on the story. His subsequent recovery has also been well documented, with interviews beamed around the globe, and an autobiography recently released. But in Indonesia, where football is not king and the sport is in disarray, Mendieta had little chance. It is only after his death that his name has become commonplace. ""He always complained of being lonely,"" said Guntur Hernawan, head of the internal medicine division at Moewardi Hospital in Solo. ""He said he wanted to go home because all of his relatives were in Paraguay.""

"Yaya Toure has retained his title as African Player of the Year after fighting off the challenge of Didier Drogba. The 29-year-old, who helped guide Manchester City to the English Premier League title last season, enjoyed a stunning year with the club. The Ivorian, who overcame fellow countryman Drogba and Cameroon's Alex Song, was obviously touched after being confirmed as the winner. ""I have a lot of emotion,"" he said after getting onto the stage in Accra, Ghana. ""I think this night is so special for me."" Drogba and Katongo lead nominations for African Player of Year . Toure scored six goals last season as City pipped rivals Manchester United to the title, while he also helped his country reach the final of the Africa Cup of Nations. The 29-year-old has now equaled the achievements of Senegal's El-Hadji Diouf by winning the award twice in a row. But he will face a challenge to make it three on the bounce as Cameroon's Samuel Eto'o did between 2003-2005, before the Cameroon striker collected the award for a fourth time in 2010. Drogba seals big-money move . Former Chelsea star Drogba had been highly-fancied to win the award after his stellar year at Stamford Bridge. The 34-year-old, now playing in China with Shanghai Shenhua, was an integral part of the team's European Champions League triumph as well as its FA Cup success. His equalizer in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich and his winning penalty kick led the club to its first every triumph in the competition. But it was Toure, who helped City win its first league title in 44 years, who won the vote, with Song of Barcelona coming third. ""Being in competition against Yaya and Alex was very difficult for me,""  Drogba told reporters. ""I don't mind if Yaya wins. I'm very proud."" Zambia win Africa Cup of Nations . Meanwhile, Zambia was named as the National Team of the Year following its incredible victory at the Africa Cup of Nations. Manager Herve Renard took the Coach of the Year accolade after leading Zambia to the title following his side's triumph over the Ivory Coast on penalties. Egypt and Al Ahly midfielder Mohamed Aboutreika was named as African Player of the Year Based in Africa. The 34-year-old collected the prize for the second time having also won it back in 2008.","Yaya Toure has been named as African Player of the Year .

"Following the Taliban prisoner swap that led to the release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told Fox News that 30% of the detainees released from the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay ""have already gone back into the fight."" It's a figure that has been frequently repeated in recent days, but is it true? It depends on who is doing the counting. According to the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which regularly releases an unclassified summary report about former detainees, as of January this year, 104 of the 614 detainees (17%) released from the prison have engaged in ""terrorist activities,"" while another 74 (12%) are suspected of doing so. It is impossible to assess the validity of the U.S. government's claim, referenced by McCain, that nearly 30% of the released detainees are confirmed or suspected of engaging in terrorist activity because the government has not publicly released the names of any of these detainees for the past five years. The U.S. government defines a ""confirmed"" terrorist or insurgent as based on a ""preponderance"" of information pointing to that conclusion, while someone  in the ""suspected"" category is based on plausible but unverified or single source reporting to that effect. In order to shed some light on exactly which graduates from Guantanamo have joined a militant group or engaged in some other kind of terrorist activity, the New America Foundation analyzed Pentagon reports, news stories, and other publicly available documents to create a list of former detainees who have ""returned to the battlefield."" The list can be found here. The New America list documents a much smaller number than does the U.S. government. Of the 620 former detainees who have been transferred from the prison camp, we have identified 15 former Guantanamo detainees (2.5%) who are confirmed to have engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities against the United States or its citizens, while there are 21 individuals (3.5%) who are suspected of engaging in such activities. We also identified 18 former detainees (3%) who are confirmed or suspected of involvement in militant attacks against non-U.S. targets. Taking all three categories together, the New America list finds only a third as many Guantanamo prisoners have returned to the battlefield, compared to the U.S. government estimate. A recent example of this is British citizen Moazzam Begg, a former Guantanamo prisoner released in 2005, who was arrested in December on terrorism charges related to the Syrian civil war. He has denied the charges. It's important to note that the vast majority of individuals who are confirmed or suspected to have militant groups were released under the George W. Bush administration, a fact that is missing from much of the current commentary. For the purposes of our study, for a former detainee to be considered ""confirmed"" that he had joined a militant group, there had to be a preponderance of information claiming he was directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activities. For those ""suspected"" of such acts, there were plausible but unverified accounts about their involvement in such activities. While it is certainly possible there are some former detainees participating in terrorist and insurgent activities who have not been identified publicly, we are confident that our numbers are reasonably accurate because groups like al Qaeda and the Taliban are eager to trumpet the identities of released Guantanamo detainees who join their ranks, as it is a propaganda coup for them, and the media is also quick to highlight such stories. Based on our findings, even if you combine all of the released detainees who are confirmed or suspected of taking part in any form of militant activity anywhere in the world, the total comes to 54, or 8.7%, which is much lower than the 30% being cited by the U.S. intelligence community and members of Congress. This percentage is also much lower than the recidivism rate of criminals within the United States, which currently stands around 67.5%,  according to the most recent statistics by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Some of the Guantanamo prisoners who were released by the Bush administration are certainly quite dangerous.  Said Ali al-Shiri, who co-founded al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2009, was transferred to Saudi Arabia in 2007. Shiri completed the kingdom's rehabilitation program and promptly headed to Yemen, where he became AQAP's deputy commander. He was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year. Another example is Abdullah Ghulam Rasoul (who also goes by the name Mullah Zakir), who has emerged as one of the top Taliban commanders. Rasoul was also transferred from Guantanamo to Afghanistan in 2007 by the Bush administration and rejoined the Taliban shortly after the Afghan government released him from custody. Under Obama,  the U.S. State Department and U.S. Defense Department use comprehensive threat assessments to determine a detainee's eligibility for release.  This has contributed to the fact that of the 88 prisoners released under Obama, we were only able to find publicly available information about one of those who had joined a militant group: Abdul Hafiz, who was returned to Afghanistan and is accused of fighting for the Taliban and targeting Afghan aid workers. (The intelligence community claims five Obama-era releasees have joined militant groups.) Of course the  high-ranking Taliban prisoners released in the exchange for Sgt. Bergdahl are not just low-level militants and President Obama himself has admitted that they might pose some future threat. ""Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely. There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place,"" Obama said. But these men are not being released freely into Afghan society. They have been transferred to the custody of Qatar, which is a rich, efficient police state and they have been banned from travel for a year. Assuming that ban holds, by the time they are able to travel back to Afghanistan, there will no longer be any U.S. combat presence as American combat soldiers are all pulling out at the end of December 2014. So any potential threat that those five Taliban officials might pose to American targets in Afghanistan will be much smaller by then.","John McCain cites U.S. statistic that 30% of Gitmo released prisoners return to battle .

"An emphatic Eric Garner talks to police, gesturing with his arms to make his point. Eventually, police move in as Garner raises both hands in the air and tells them not to touch him. One officer reaches for Garner's hand; seconds later, another officer wraps his arm around Garner's neck. Cellphone video shot by a friend of Garner's shows the officer maintaining that hold as Garner is taken to the ground, crying out, ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe,"" over and over again. The words stop. And Garner never gets up. A grand jury has decided that there's no probable cause to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo, the man who put Garner in that chokehold on a Staten Island sidewalk, in the 43-year-old's death. But that judgment certainly doesn't end the debate about what Pantaleo did -- not just whether it was a criminal act, but whether it was necessary and in violation of the New York Police Department's own policies. In an interview in August with CNN's Chris Cuomo, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said that no local laws criminalize chokeholds, though they are prohibited by his department. In fact, the NYPD could discipline Pantaleo or his fellow officers if an ongoing internal review finds their actions did not align with police department procedures. Yet Bratton has also cautioned against a rush to judgment. ""I've been around a long time in this business,"" he noted, adding that ""what it appears to be sometimes may not be what it is."" Medical examiner noted chokehold, other factors . Watching the video, a few things stand out. For one, Garner is clearly the biggest man in the shot. He's also outnumbered by police officers. The New York City medical examiner's office also offered pertinent facts when it classified Garner's death as a homicide this summer. He died because of a ""compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,"" the office found, while also calling Garner's ""acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease"" contributing factors. In other words, there was a chokehold, and it played a part in Garner's death. Which raises the question: Should the chokehold have been used at all? The answer depends -- as it has with many aspects of this case, which has spurred large protests in New York and beyond -- on who you ask. For Garner's family, and the thousands who protested Wednesday night in support of them, there's no doubt: The police officer's actions, including the chokehold, were uncalled for. ""I don't know what video they were looking at,"" said Garner's mother, Gwen Carr. ""Evidently, it wasn't the same one that the rest of the world was looking at."" A family lawyer, Jonathan Moore, said that Garner should have gotten at most a summons to appear in court for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, and he shouldn't have been treated as he was. ""(The officer) clearly was violating his own departmental regulations,"" Moore said of Pantaleo's chokehold. ""He clearly was using excessive force."" Forensic expert: Chokeholds can be deadly . Lawrence Kobilinsky, a forensic scientist and professor at New York's John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says that the chokehold he saw in the Garner video had the potential to be deadly. It seemingly cuts off the airway, which can lead to a condition called asphyxia -- which includes unconsciousness and suffocation, by cutting off one's oxygen supply -- ""and ultimately cardiac arrest and death."" ""It's a very dangerous chokehold, because you can damage the very delicate structures in the throat,"" Kobilinsky told CNN. ""... There are a lot of things police can do to prevent something like this."" Before he became an assistant director with the FBI and, now, a CNN law enforcement analyst, Tom Fuentes was a police officer. He was never taught the hold that Pantaleo used, but he was instructed how to ""to put pressure on both sides of the carotid artery to cut off blood flow to the brain or reduce it until the person fainted."" ""It supposedly did no permanent damage,"" Fuentes said. But many police departments, like in New York, decided to prohibit such chokeholds ""because it was so easy to misapply it and put pressure directly on the throat, directly choking the person cutting off air as opposed to making them faint."" As Fuentes explained, ""It was just too easy to have an accident."" 'At a certain point, they've got to touch him' Yet this doesn't mean the former FBI assistant director or other law enforcement experts believe Pantaleo should be charged or even disciplined for what he did to Garner. Fuentes says, from the video, it looks to him that the officer ""is trying to bring him down and, in the process of holding him, he does have his forearm across his throat and is choking him. And that is unfortunate."" The CNN analyst also says people should put themselves in the police officers' shoes. How long can they wait to arrest someone, whether they are accused of murder or something relatively minor? And, if a person does not comply, what can they do -- let him go or step in, perhaps using force? ""At a certain point, they've got to touch him,"" Fuentes said. ""That's just the way it goes. And when you resist arrest -- physically resist -- bad things can happen."" That point was echoed by Tom Verni, a former NYPD detective and police academy instructor. He told CNN that, after Garner was told he'd be arrested but would not comply, ""that debate is not going to go on for hours on end."" ""I don't know of any other officer that would have really done all that much different,"" Verni said. ""If you Monday-morning-quarterback this situation, anyone could come up with 1,000 different ways that they think they could have handled it at that time and place... (But) people make certain choices when they're interacting with police."" Legal analyst: System 'designed for officer safety' This story is not over. The U.S. Justice Department, under the direction of Attorney General Eric Holder, has launched a civil rights investigation into Garner's death. (Garner was black and Pantaleo is white, the same racial breakdown as in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by then-Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson -- a case that also triggered widespread protests and did not result in a grand jury indictment.) President Barack Obama has weighed in as well, saying, ""We are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement."" And, as Bratton told CNN, ""if there's a finding of guilt"" in the NYPD's review of Garner's death, ""a decision will be made as to an appropriate penalty or discipline."" Yet Mark O'Mara, a veteran defense attorney and CNN legal analyst, noted that the grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo because jurors couldn't agree that there was enough evidence to say he ""acted in a criminally negligent way."" Changing the law -- perhaps to bar chokeholds or put tighter restrictions on police when they try to arrest someone -- could affect future cases like that of Garner. But as it stands now, defense attorney and CNN analyst Danny Cevallos said, the current system is not set up that way. ""Once (police) make an arrest, everything is designed for officer safety,"" Cevallos said. ""And if a person doesn't immediately comply, then they can move right up the force continuum as needed. That's the way they're trained.""","Eric Garner died after being put in chokehold by a New York police officer .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two influential Republican senators said Sunday they oppose any effort by House Republicans to cut funding for U.S. participation in the Libya military mission. The comments by conservative Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina came on the 90th day of the Libya campaign -- which House Speaker John Boehner says is the deadline in the War Powers Resolution for the Obama administration to get congressional authorization it has yet to seek. Boehner, R-Ohio, said last week that cutting funding for the mission was an option that the Republican-controlled House will consider when it takes up a defense appropriations bill this week. He contended that President Barack Obama has failed to comply with the War Powers Resolution, and that the main tool Congress has to respond is to control the spending. However, McCain and Graham told Sunday talk shows such a move would send the wrong signal and undermine NATO allies leading the Libya mission with U.S. support. ""If we do not continue this effort in Libya, if (Moammar) Gadhafi remains in power, it could have profound consequences,"" McCain said on the ABC program ""This Week."" Graham, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" adhered to longstanding conservative dogma by declaring that the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which limits the ability of the president to unilaterally engage U.S. forces in combat, is unconstitutional. He also said the ouster of Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, was in the U.S. national interest, because failure to do so would undermine the U.S. standing in the world, cause oil prices to rise and send Libyan refugees streaming across the border into an already fragile Egypt. ""The president's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya, but I will be no part of an effort to de-fund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring Gadhafi down,"" Graham said, later adding that Obama ""needs to step up his game with Libya but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi."" Outgoing Defense Secretary Robert Gates also backed the Libyan mission, saying Obama was right to limit the scope of U.S. involvement and that he believes the president has complied with the War Powers Resolution. ""What was going on in Libya was considered vital interest by some of our closest allies. Those are the same allies that have come to our support and assistance in Afghanistan,"" Gates told CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""And so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on, in support of our allies who did consider it a vital interest, is a legitimate way to look at this problem."" In a separate interview on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Gates noted the war powers debate dates back several decades and administrations. ""Frankly, I think cutting off funding in the middle of a military operation when we have people engaged is always a mistake,"" Gates said, later adding: ""I believe that President Obama has complied with the law, consistent in a manner with virtually all of his predecessors. I don't think he's breaking any new ground here."" In a letter to Obama last week, Boehner strongly disagreed, saying the president would be in violation of the War Powers Resolution starting Sunday for failing to secure congressional authorization. Passed in 1973, the War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end the hostilities. In response to Boehner's letter, the White House sent Congress a 32-page report that asserted Obama didn't need congressional authorization because the U.S. forces play only a supporting role in Libya and don't engage in what the War Powers Resolution defined as hostilities. ""We're obviously not changing our mission,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Friday, later adding: ""What we have said is that our role in this mission, our support role and the kind of engagement we have right now, does not meet, in our legal analysis, ... the threshold set by the War Powers Resolution for congressional action."" Later Friday, Boehner said he specifically asked if the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel agreed with the administration's legal analysis, and that the White House's failure to answer that question made cutting funds for the mission a possibility. ""The House of Representatives will not allow the White House to continue skirting its obligations to the American people, this Congress, and the laws of this nation,"" Boehner said in a statement. ""Over the coming week, our members will review all options available to hold the administration to account."" At the Justice Department, deputy spokesman Tracy Schmaler seemed to acknowledge that opinions differed over interpreting the mission's compliance with the War Powers Resolution. ""Our views were heard, as were other views, and the president then made the decision as was appropriate for him to do,"" Schmaler said. On the ABC program, McCain called for passage of a resolution he drafted with Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts that supports the Libyan mission, which he said would serve as congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution. House Republicans aren't the only ones challenging the Libya mission. A bipartisan group of 10 House members has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Obama's power to commit U.S. forces to the Libya mission. Congressional opponents of the Libya mission include liberals such as Rep. Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, who generally oppose any war effort, as well as some Republicans who complain its objective of civilian protection fails to match the stated U.S. goal of Gadhafi's ouster. The opponents also say the Libya situation could become a stalemate that drains resources at a time of mounting federal deficits that must be addressed. The White House, however, says incremental progress is occurring through increasing diplomatic, political and military pressure on Gadhafi to step down. Carney repeatedly emphasized this week that Obama had kept his word to the American people that the initial U.S. leadership role in the mission would get reduced to a supporting role, and no U.S. ground troops would take part. Carney suggested that Boehner is playing politics with the issue, noting that he previously questioned the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution in a 1999 debate over former President Bill Clinton's push to take part in NATO bombing during the Balkans conflict. Boehner's complaints this week ""stand in contrast to the views he expressed in 1999, when he called the War Powers act, quote, 'constitutionally suspect,' unquote, and warned Congress to, quote, 'resist the temptation to take any action that would do further damage to the institution of the presidency,'"" Carney noted. John Yoo, a former Bush administration lawyer now with the American Enterprise Institute, also challenged Boehner's position on the matter. In an op-ed published Friday by the Wall Street Journal, Yoo -- known for bedrock conservative views -- wrote that Boehner and other Republican opponents of the Libya mission are playing politics by arguing about the War Powers Resolution instead of using their budgetary authority to cut funding for the Libya mission. ""By accusing President Barack Obama of violating the War Powers Resolution, House Republicans are abandoning their party's long-standing position that the Constitution allows the executive to use force abroad, subject to Congress's control over funding,"" Yoo wrote. ""Sadly, they've fallen victim to the siren song of short-term political gain against a president who continues to stumble in national-security matters."" Yoo called the lawsuit filed by seven Republicans along with Kucinich and other Democrats an ""utterly futile"" legal effort, adding that ""the Supreme Court has consistently turned away every case disputing the president's decision to start wars abroad, and there is no reason to think it will change its ways now."" ""Lawsuits only distract attention from the real weapons that Congress has to get its way and hold a wayward president accountable,"" Yoo wrote, saying House Republicans instead could try to de-fund military operations or other spending programs, or refuse to lift the debt ceiling until Obama either halts U.S. participation in the mission or gets congressional support. Another option would be to launch an impeachment effort against Obama, Yoo said, adding that ""holding hands with isolationist Democrats out of political convenience is no way to defend the Constitution."" Even though the Senate in March unanimously passed a non-binding resolution supporting a no-fly zone over Libya, some Republicans now express total opposition to the U.S. support for that effort. ""Our policy in Libya is substantially flawed,"" Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, said during last week's debate of GOP presidential hopefuls. She cited a litany of complaints -- the supporting U.S. role, a lack of vital national interest, unknown elements in the Libyan opposition being helped -- and said Obama ""was absolutely wrong in his decision on Libya."" In its report on the mission, titled ""United States Activities in Libya,"" the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $800 million. It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $1.1 billion. ""Given the important U.S. interests served by U.S. military operations in Libya and the limited nature, scope and duration of the anticipated actions, the president had constitutional authority, as commander-in-chief and chief executive and pursuant to his foreign affairs powers, to address such limited military operations abroad,"" the report said, adding: ""The president is of the view that the current U.S. military operations in Libya are consistent with the War Powers Resolution and do not under that law require further congressional authorization, because U.S. military operations are distinct from the kind of 'hostilities' contemplated by the resolution's 60-day termination provision."" In response, Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck called the White House arguments ""creative,"" adding that Obama as commander-in-chief ""has a responsibility to articulate how U.S. military action is vital to our national security and consistent with American policy goals."" ""With Libya, the president has fallen short on this obligation,"" Buck said. CNN's Dana Bash and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Sens. McCain, Graham oppose de-funding Libya mission .

"North Korea issued a statement on its official state news agency on Saturday denouncing Sony Pictures Entertainment's release of the movie ""The Interview."" It called President Barack Obama the ""chief culprit"" who forced the production company to ""indiscriminately distribute"" the picture. The statement attributed to the National Defense Commission also denounced the United States for blaming North Korea for a hacking attack on the moviemaker earlier this month. ""If the U.S. is to persistently insist that the hacking attack was made by the DPRK, the U.S. should produce evidence without fail, though belatedly,"" the statement publish by KCNA said.

Sony Pictures IT systems were hacked by a group calling itself ""Guardians of Peace"" or GoP, which complained about the pending release of the movie. The FBI has blamed North Korea for that cyberattack. Threats were also issued that there would be 9/11 style attacks on theaters that showed the film. The movie was not released as scheduled, and Sony Pictures later said film distributors had decided not to show the movie for security reasons. President Obama expressed disappointment over the move, saying free speech had not been upheld. Sony then arranged for direct distribution online via its own services, YouTube and through independent cinemas.","A statement called President Obama the ""chief culprit"" who forced distribution of the picture .

"(CNN) -- It's a number that even astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is having a hard time wrapping his brilliant mind around. His Christmas Day tweet commemorating the birthday of Isaac Newton was retweeted more than 69,000 times as of this writing, making it the most popular of his Twitter career so far -- and, arguably, his most controversial. ""On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world. Happy Birthday Isaac Newton b. Dec 25, 1642,"" the StarTalk host tweeted. He followed it up with a nod to the commercialization of Christmas: ""Merry Christmas to all. A Pagan holiday (BC) becomes a Religious holiday (AD). Which then becomes a Shopping holiday (USA)."" By then, he was on a roll. Earlier in the day, he tweeted, ""QUESTION: This year, what do all the world's Muslims and Jews call December 25th? ANSWER: Thursday."" His comments drew criticism and name-calling from various corners of the internet. ""Overly reductive, deliberately cynical and unnecessarily provocative,"" one person said on Twitter. Another accused him of ""trolling Christmas today to show you how smart he is."" Tyson's response to the controversy? ""Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them."" Later Friday, Tyson pondered ""My Most Retweeted Tweet"" in a Facebook post. He did not defend or disavow his comments. Instead, in true scientific form, he attempted to quantify their popularity compared to previous tweets. ""My sense in this case is that the high rate of re-tweeting, is not to share my enthusiasm of this fact, but is driven by accusations that the tweet is somehow anti-Christian,"" he wrote. ""If a person actually wanted to express anti-Christian sentiment, my guess is that alerting people of Isaac Newton's birthday would appear nowhere on the list."" According to his calculations, his average retweet rate falls between 2,500 and 3,500. ""Fun"" tweets can reach 10,000 while ""boring tweets barely break 1,000."" The Newton Christmas Day tweet had surpassed 62,000 retweets by the time he posted his Facebook note on Friday. By Saturday evening, it had reached more than 69,000. ""I wonder if you are as astonished by this fact as I am,"" he wrote. For example, he directly referenced Jesus in previous tweets that did not spread nearly as far. By way of example, he offered the following, which earned more than 13,000 retweets: ""Some claim the USA is a Christian nation, compelling me to wonder which assault rifle Jesus would choose: the AR-15 or AK-47."" He also addressed criticism that according to the calendar in use during Newton's time, his birthday would fall on January 4, 1643. ""One last bit of historical fact. All of England was celebrating Christmas the day Newton was born. But the Gregorian Calendar (an awesomely accurate reckoning of Earth's annual time), introduced in 1584 by Pope Gregory, was not yet adopted in Great Britain. To do so required removing ten days from the calendar -- excess time that had accumulated over the previous 16 centuries from the mildly flawed Julian Calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar in 46 BC. These remnants of the turbulent schism between the Anglican and Catholic churches meant that Catholic Christendom was celebrating Christmas ten days earlier than anybody was in England."" Tyson closed his note with holiday wishes and a warning that he'll be tweeting about Earth's perihelion in the New Year.

"In an overshadowed Election Day contest, Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood in a nonbinding referendum, marking the first time such an initiative garnered a majority. Puerto Ricans were asked about their desires in two parts. First, by a 54% to 46% margin, voters rejected their current status as a U.S. commonwealth. In a separate question, 61% chose statehood as the alternative, compared with 33% for the semi-autonomous ""sovereign free association"" and 6% for outright independence. While the results may be an indicator of what Puerto Ricans want, statehood will not be possible without congressional action in Washington, something that is not guaranteed. Read more: Puerto Rico: A forgotten front in America's drug war? An economic downturn and shrinking population were the factors that contributed to the support for statehood, where referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998 failed, Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said. ""I think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need,"" he said. An exodus of residents from the island has culminated in a staggering statistic: Fifty-eight percent of Puerto Ricans live in the mainland United States, McClintock said. Opinion: Treat U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico fairly . ""When you have a political status that scares away half of your population, it is time to reject that political status,"" he said. But some analysts say the views on statehood have not changed, despite Tuesday's results. The preference of many voters is to consider a report by the Obama administration that lays out several noncolonial options before choosing an alternative status, said Jorge Benitez, a political scientist at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras. This option, which is supported by the party that won the governorship, did not appear on the ballot. ""This isn't to say that support for statehood hasn't increased; it has,"" Benitez said. ""But the only thing we can decipher with certainty from the vote is that the people of Puerto Rico want a change to the current status. ""It isn't clear what change we want, but we want change,"" he said. The results of the referendum met with other criticisms, too. There were voters who prefer the current status but didn't agree with the way it was defined on the ballot, thereby inflating the number of votes against the status quo, said Luis Agrait, a history professor at the University of Puerto Rico. Secondly, a large number of ballots -- one-third of all votes cast -- were left blank on the question of preferred alternative status. If you assume those blank votes are anti-statehood votes, the true result for the statehood option would be less than 50%, Agrait argues. Opinion: 'But what's a Latino?' But McClintock accounts for the number of blank votes by explaining that those who voted to keep the current status would have left the question of alternatives blank. The referendum is nonbinding, but it compels lawmakers in Washington to act, he said. ""The people are withdrawing their consent to be governed the way they are governed,"" McClintock said, citing the Declaration of Independence, which states that a government's power comes from the consent of those governed. ""Congress will have to address this and will have to pay attention,"" he said. The roughly 4 million residents of Puerto Rico are American citizens but can't vote for president.  However, the almost 5 million Puerto Ricans living in the 50 U.S. states have full voting rights. Under its status as a commonwealth, Puerto Rico is subject to U.S. federal laws, though island residents are exempt from some federal taxes. Puerto Rico has a nonvoting representative in Congress. The territory played a role in presidential politics this year during the GOP primaries, when candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum visited the island, seeking its delegates for the primary election. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, created a small political firestorm when he said English should be the principal language in Puerto Rico before it could gain statehood. Romney said he would have ""no preconditions"" on language for Puerto Rico to gain statehood, though during a CNN debate, he said English should be the United States' official language. Last year, President Barack Obama made an official visit to Puerto Rico, the first such visit by a president in 50 years.","In a nonbinding referendum, Puerto Ricans voted on island's status as a U.S. commonwealth .

"(CNN)Somali government forces on Saturday captured a top commander of the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab, two of the country's military officials said. Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, Al-Shabaab's intelligence chief, was captured in a house near the town of El Wak, Somali military commander Isack Hussein Mursal told state-run radio. He was a close associate of former Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city in September. Somali forces captured Hersi and his driver without confrontation, officials said. The U.S. State Department had issued a $3 million reward for information leading to his capture. ""Zakariya has told us following his capture that he left Al-Shabaab a year and half ago and since then was looking for to surrender to the Somali government,"" Col. Abas Ibrahim Gurey, a senior military official, told CNN. The capture comes after militants with the group, which is linked to al Qaeda, attacked a large African Union base in Mogadishu on Thursday, killing three Ugandan soldiers and a civilian. Al-Shabaab has said that attack was revenge for the U.S. airstrike that killed Godane.  The State Department had offered a $7 million reward for information on Godane's location. CNN's Pierre Meilhan, Margot Haddad  and Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this story .","U.S. State Department reward money used to capture Al-Shabaab militant .

"It didn't take long Monday for speculation to ramp up online over the timing of the Boston Marathon bombings, which came on Patriots Day, a Masschusetts state holiday commemorating the opening battles of the American Revolutionary War. The American uprising against the British in Lexington, Massachusetts, was on April 19, 1775, but Patriots Day is celebrated in Massachusetts and Maine on the third Monday in April, falling this year on April 15. ""It's a day that celebrates the free and fiercely independent spirit that this great American city of Boston has reflected from the earliest days of our nation,"" President Obama said Monday, a few hours after a pair of bombs rocked the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing at least three and injuring dozens more. For many New Englanders, it is a day of pride that comes with historical re-enactments, the Boston Marathon, baseball and a day off for schools and government employees. It's now a day that will go down in history along with other violent U.S. incidents in April, including the 1993 FBI siege of David Koresh's compound in Waco, Texas, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, a mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999 and the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. Only the Waco siege and the Oklahoma City bombing actually occurred on April 19, the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Still, to many following developments in Boston online, the proximity of Monday's attack to the April 19 anniversaries was enough to suggest an act of domestic terrorism. ""Obviously, nobody knows anything yet,"" Esquire magazine's Charles Pierce said, ""but I would caution folks jumping to conclusions about foreign terrorism to remember that this is the official Patriots Day holiday in Massachusetts ... and that the actual date (April 19) was of some significance to, among other people, Tim McVeigh, because he fancied himself a waterer of the tree of liberty and the like."" McVeigh and Oklahoma City bombing co-conspirator Terry Nichols were associated with the extreme right-wing and militant Patriot Movement, which rejects the legitimacy of the federal government and law enforcement. Adherents sometimes form armed militia groups and claim the right to armed self-defense against what they believe to be an oppressive government. McVeigh said he targeted the Federal Building in Oklahoma City to avenge the raid on Waco. Despite commonly held beliefs, it's unclear whether the Columbine shooters timed that attack to mark either Adolf Hitler's birthday or the Waco incident. Time Washington correspondent Alex Altman also noted Patriots Day's ""significance"" to the ""militia movement"" in a tweet that was shared 507 times. He also mentioned the Oklahoma City bombing anniversary. In a subsequent tweet, he clarified that ""OKC was on Apr. 19, anniversary of the Battles of Lexington & Concord, which are celebrated in Mass as Patriots Day."" But is there really something about this time of the year that makes domestic terrorism more prevalent? ""I have seen nothing to suggest that anything about April itself makes people violent,"" Robert Blaskiewicz, who runs the blog Skeptical Humanities, said in a 2011 interview with CNN about the 20-year anniversary of the siege of the Waco compound. ""That said, the reason why we see certain types of political violence in mid- to late April is because of a few unhappy coincidences: that Waco happened to fall on the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first battles in a war against a tyrannical oppressor. ""For many people who labor under the idea that the federal government is a tyrannical foreign oppressor like the British monarchy, Waco symbolizes a war of a government against its people."" In the mythology that has grown up around Waco and Oklahoma City among self-identified patriots, he said ""the 19th has become a sort of high holiday for those who think that they live under the thumb of a tyranny."" But, as the injury count continues to rise in Boston, the prevailing sentiment is sorrow and solidarity. ""Don't know what to say. Everyone who grew up in and around Boston has been at the finish line on Patriots Day. Could have been any of us,"" tweeted Frank Dale, digital editor for ESPN's  ""Mike And Mike in the Morning"" show. President Obama offered a nod to the city's strength. ""Boston is a tough and resilient town, so are its people,"" he said. ""I'm supremely confident that Bostonians will pull together, take care of each other, and move forward as one proud city. ""And, as they do, the American people will be with them every single step of the way.""","Patriots Day in Massachusetts commemorates opening battles of American Revolution on April 19 .

"Ahmed Abu Khatallah has been an enigma since his name first emerged as a possible leader of the Benghazi terrorist attack that killed four Americans. He didn't hide in the months after the September 11, 2012, assault on a U.S. diplomatic compound, instead giving media interviews in public, including one with CNN's Arwa Damon. ""No problem,"" he replied in 2013 when Damon asked if he would be willing to meet with U.S. investigators presumably searching for him. ""But not as an interrogation,"" he added, suggesting instead ""a conversation, like the one we are having with you now."" It didn't work out that way. More than a year later, U.S. special forces nabbed Abu Khatallah in a weekend mission near Benghazi, the Obama administration announced Tuesday. Under questioning . Instead of the conversation he proposed, Abu Khatallah is being questioned before his transfer to the United States to face charges in the Benghazi attack. ""As a general rule, the government will always seek to elicit all the actionable intelligence and information we can from terrorist suspects taken into our custody,"" said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. The FBI-led High Value Detainee Interrogation Group team, which also includes CIA and military intelligence members, typically conducts such intelligence interviews. On Tuesday, a federal judge unsealed charges filed last year that accuse Abu Khatallah of killing a person in the course of an attack on a federal facility with a firearm and a dangerous weapon, and of attempting and conspiring to provide material support to terrorists resulting in death. The charges, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, also accuse him of discharging, brandishing, using, carrying and possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Former prisoner under Gadhafi . Believed to be in his early 40s, Abu Khatallah emerged from years in prison under the regime of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to form an Islamist militia and later became associated with Ansar al-Sharia, a group U.S. officials blamed for the 2012 attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others. Coming in the midst of a U.S. presidential campaign, the assault ignited a political firestorm. Republican critics of President Barack Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seized on the vulnerability of the U.S. compound on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks to accuse the administration of failing to provide proper security. They also alleged a politically inspired coverup when former U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, now Obama's national security adviser, went on Sunday talk shows a few days later and blamed the unrest on spontaneous protests against an anti-Muslim video made in America. Such protests occurred in other Middle East region cities that day, but U.S. officials later acknowledged the Benghazi attack was an organized assault instead of simply a spur-of-the-moment demonstration that spiraled out of control. Clinton said Tuesday in a town hall-style event broadcast on CNN that she hoped Abu Khatallah's capture would bring answers to some of the lingering questions over what happened in Benghazi. ""We want to know who was behind it, what the motivation of the leaders and attackers were,"" she said, attributing the lingering lack of information today in part to the ""fog of war"" in post-Gadhafi Libya. ""We tried to control traffic"" In his interview with CNN's Damon, Abu Khatallah offered little explanation for what happened or his exact role. ""I didn't know where the place was,"" he said, aided by a translator. ""When I heard, we went to examine the situation. When we withdrew and there was shooting with medium guns and there were RPG's in the air and people panicked, we tried to control traffic."" A New York Times investigation cited multiple witnesses in Benghazi who described Abu Khatallah as playing a leading role in the attack. In the CNN interview, Damon asked if anyone from the American or Libyan government tried to get in touch with Abu Khatallah afterward, and he responded: ""Never."" To Damon, Abu Khatallah sounded confident at the time, rather than like someone facing an international investigation. He also made clear his sentiments on al Qaeda, the terrorist network linked to Ansar al-Sharia, which means ""Supporters of Sharia."" ""Al Qaeda is not something to be afraid of,"" he said. ""Al Qaeda is people who are devout about protecting their religion and their people. America is the terrorist."" What took so long? His public appearances last year and the subsequent months that passed until his capture caused GOP critics to question what took so long. They hope to use the Benghazi issue against Clinton, the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic presidential nomination if she decides to run. Asked Tuesday about why it took so long to get Abu Khatallah, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said the important thing was that the mission accomplished its goal with no American casualties. He and other officials have emphasized that building a criminal case against a terror suspect for an attack in a foreign country is challenging and takes time. A law enforcement source also told CNN that Abu Khatallah went into hiding following media interviews he gave last year. ""What matters is not that it took a matter of time to get him, but that we got him,"" Kirby said. ""And I can't speak for his living habits. But let's just say for argument's sake he was living in plain sight. He's not anymore."" Captured key Benghazi suspect will face U.S. criminal courts . What to know about the consulate attacks .

"House Majority Leader Eric Cantor knew in October about former CIA Director David Petraeus' involvement in an extramarital affair, a spokesman for the congressman told CNN on Sunday. Doug Heye said Cantor, a Republican, was tipped to the information by an FBI employee. The congressman had a conversation with the official, described as a whistle-blower, about the affair and national security concerns involved in the matter, he said. The New York Times reported Saturday that on October 31, Cantor's chief of staff phoned the FBI to inform the agency about the call between the congressman and the FBI official. The Times reported that Cantor learned of the whistle-blower through Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Washington. Opinion: Petraeus' other seduction . A spokeswoman for Reichert told CNN on Sunday that the Times article was accurate but that the congressman had no further comment on his involvement in the case. Petraeus resigned from the CIA on Friday after acknowledging the affair. He told Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about the situation on November 6, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official. Clapper then advised Petraeus to resign, the official said. Petraeus' affair came to light when an FBI investigation looked into a complaint that his biographer, Paula Broadwell, was sending harassing e-mails to another woman close to the retired four-star general, a U.S. official told CNN on Saturday. During the investigation, other communications surfaced between Petraeus and Broadwell, a married mother of two, according to the official. A U.S. official said Sunday that Petraeus used a personal account to e-mail Broadwell and not his CIA account. CNN has not been able to reach Broadwell for comment. The official did not identify the woman who made the initial complaint and did not know the nature of her relationship with Petraeus. Official: Woman complained of harassing e-mails from Petraeus' biographer . The FBI interviewed Petraeus, said the official, who stressed that the CIA director was never the target of the investigation and his communications were never compromised. The official did not know whether Broadwell was interviewed. The official could not say if the investigation is still ongoing. The Times reported that the investigation had already begun by the time Cantor talked with the whistle-blower. Questions have arisen about why congressional leaders were not informed of the investigation immediately. According to a congressional aide familiar with the matter, the House and Senate intelligence committees weren't informed that there was an FBI investigation into the situation until Friday. ""The committees are required to be kept informed of significant intelligence activities,"" the aide said Saturday. ""If there was an official investigation that was looking, at least in part, at information that was compromising the CIA director, then I think there's a solid argument to say that the committee leadership should have been notified to at least some level of detail."" Rep. King: Petraeus' resignation doesn't preclude testimony . Petraeus' resignation comes days before he was scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The attack, in which four Americans were killed, became a point of contention during the presidential campaign. Some have even suggested that the timing of Petraeus' stepping down is suspect, given the expected grilling in Congress. Acting CIA Director Michael Morell will testify instead. CNN has confirmed that Petraeus was in Libya recently to meet with the CIA station chief to discuss the Benghazi attack and other issues. ""It just doesn't add up,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley on Sunday. ""You have this type of investigation. The FBI investigating e-mails, the e-mails leading to the CIA director, and taking four months to find out that the CIA director was involved. I have real questions about this. I think a timeline has to be looked at and analyzed to see what happened."" King: Petraeus story 'just doesn't add up' A senior U.S. official said Petraeus' departure wasn't connected to the Benghazi hearing. ""Director Petraeus' frank and forthright letter of resignation stands on its own,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic. ""Any suggestion that his departure has anything to do with criticism about Benghazi is completely baseless."" Broadwell spent a year with Petraeus in Afghanistan interviewing him for the book she co-wrote, ""All In: The Education of General David Petraeus."" His resignation Friday appeared to be an abrupt end to a spectacularly successful career in public service. ""After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours,"" Petraeus said in a letter to colleagues, explaining his decision to step down. Opinion: How Petraeus changed the U.S. military . Before his nomination as CIA director, Petraeus was considered the nation's most well-known and popular military leader since Colin Powell. He helped turn the tide against insurgents while commanding forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and literally wrote the book on counterinsurgency techniques by overseeing the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual. Earning praise from both sides of the political aisle, the retired four-star general took the helm of the CIA in September 2011. Petraeus, 60, and his wife, Holly, live in Virginia.

"(CNN)At least 23 people were killed in a Boko Haram attack in the Mozogo district in Cameroon's Far North Region, an official said. The regional governor, Mijiyawa Bakary, confirmed the attack by the Nigeria-based Islamist militants, but did not give further details. ""We are still gathering the facts from our divisional officers, but what we know for now is that the attackers killed at least 23 people. The damage could be more,"" he said. The attackers also burned down a village, security forces told CNN. A soldier on the front who did not want to be named told CNN by phone that the insurgents carried out a similar attack along the Waza-Mora highway on Friday, killing one Cameroonian soldier. The soldier said ""a corporal was killed and three soldiers were wounded. The attackers also confiscated a (Toyota) Land Cruiser belonging to the Cameroon military."" Earlier this month, the country's state-run broadcaster CRTV reported that 116 Boko Haram fighters and one Cameroonian soldier were killed during an attack that the militant group launched against a military column in northern Cameroon. And in May, Boko Haram militants kidnapped 10 Chinese road construction workers in Waza, just miles from the border with Nigeria, and killed one worker. The hostages were freed in October. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. The Islamist group  -- considered one of the world's most deadly terrorist organizations -- has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Increasingly, it has crossed into northern Cameroon, attacking military forces, as well as kidnapping foreign nationals. But there is no firm evidence the group has ambitions beyond Nigeria. CNN's Tim Lister and journalist Ngala Killian Chimtom contributed to this report.","Boko Haram fighters crossed the border into Cameroon and attacked a village .
