Poignant love letters a young soldier sent to his teenage sweetheart from the trenches have been revealed nearly one hundred years after they were written. Will O'Brien from Abersychan, regularly wrote to his girlfriend, Rose Nash, expressing his desire to be with her again, his longing for home and the terrible sights he had seen fighting for his country. Will was just 16 when he enlisted in 1915 and fought in the 5th Battalion of the Grenadier Guards. Letters from the front: Will O'Brien enlisted when he was 16 and constantly wrote to the love of his life, Rose Nash from the trenches . Before he was sent to the front, he had been working as a policeman and dating Rose Nash for a year. In the letters, he poured out his love for Rose and told of his dreams to be reunited with her after the war. In a one dated 26 September, 1916, he wrote: 'I . was dreaming of you last night and I thought that we were walking down . High Street Newport and seen you as plain as ever, and you can guess how . disappointed I was when I woke up and heard the guns barking away. But I . hope some day and before long my dream will come true.' Brave: Will fought in the Battle of the Somme with the 5th Battalion of the Grenadier Guards . Will and Rose wrote hundreds of letters to one another between 1915 and 1917. Will's letters describe his training, then life at the front, and express how much he misses his true love. A letter sent in 1915 from Caterham, Surrey, where Will was training, read: 'I . always wanted you from the first time I seen you, on the first morning . of this year, can you remember... You are the only girl I ever properly . cared for. In fact Rose I - you.' In another letter, Will wrote: 'Dear Rose, you were saying in your last letter that you didn't take the slightest notice of any other chaps and I am glad to hear it. 'I . have been with some girls before I met you and there is as much . difference between you and them as there is between chalk and cheese.' Insight: The soldier kept Rose up to date on his training and deployment . Loss: The couple sent one another hundreds of letters until Will died in battle in 1917 . He added: 'I only wish you were here so I could give you on of these XX in real.' In July, the notorious Battle of the Somme began in which Britain suffered 60,000 casualties on the first day. Will survived as the battle raged on for months and wrote to Rose of the horrors he had witnessed. On 14th October, 1916, he wrote from a barn in France: 'Well my dear girl, you said that you seen the pictures of the Battle of the Somme. Discovery: Rose's daughter-in-law Rose found the letters decades after they were written . Found love again: Rose went on to marry policeman John Nash . 'It . must be an interesting picture but you ought to be actually in an . advance to know what it is really like. Bullets whizzing past you and . your mates getting hit and dropping. It is a terrible sight and one . that you can never forget.' Eventually Will's luck ran out and he died in battle on 4 August, 1917. After the war, a heartbroken Rose went . on to marry another policeman from Abersychan, John Nash. He had known Will and was the man . who had come to tell her of his death at the front. Rose never forgot Will and kept his all his letters wrapped up in the bottom drawer of her wardrobe at her home in Abersychan. Following her death in 1982, they were discovered by her daughter-in-law, Joan Nash, when she was  clearing out the house. Joan, 80, a retired librarian from New Inn, Pontypool, has now decided to make the letters public. She said: 'I got to know Will through these letters. When I got to the part when he died, I was crying my eyes out.' She added that she decided to share them now, more than 30 years after their discovery, because 'it's the 100 years anniversary of World War One and I thought they might be of interest.'","Will O'Brien, from Abersychan, fought in 5th Battalion of Grenadier Guards .

As one of the best viola players in the world, Kathryn Bassano has performed with Madonna, Mick Jagger and Sting. Married to famous conductor, Peter Bassano, and with four children privately educated at Eton and Cheltenham Ladies' College, Mrs Bassano lives with her family in a £3million, six-bedroom house in the Buckinghamshire countryside. But now the 57-year-old classical musician has been forced by a High Court ruling to sell her £400,000 antique viola to pay off loans after a lengthy legal dispute over what was a £16,000 builder's bill. Kathryn Bassano, 57, has been forced to sell her rare viola to pay legal bills arising from a dispute with builders . Musical instrument dealer Alfred Toft, left, lent Mrs Bassano - who was represented in court by her conductor husband Peter Bassano, 68, right, - £100,000 in February 2010 using her rare Ceruti viola as security . The builder successfully sued for the money, which was owed as part of a £100,000 bill for works carried out on their home in 2002, and the lawyers' bills continued to mount up when the musical couple lost their appeal against the decision in 2007. To pay the legal bills totalling more than £185,000, Mrs Bassano, from Great Missenden, used the rare viola, made by renowned Cremonese craftsman, Giovanni Battista Ceruti in 1803, as security for a series of cash loans. Mrs Bassano effectively 'mortgaged' her instrument for six-figure loans to two antique instrument dealers, Alfred Toft and Peter Biddulph, and a pawnbroking firm, Borro Loan Ltd, raising £280,000 as a result. The court heard that instrument dealer Mr Biddulph lent Mrs Bassano £50,000 in 2009 after agreeing that he would sell the viola, which she had owned for years, on her behalf.  The loan was arranged on the understanding that the money he lent her would be repaid when he sold the viola. In February 2010 Mr Toft, also a dealer in fine stringed instruments, who lives in Penshurst, Kent, lent Mrs Bassano £100,000 after she approached him following a service at his local church. The loan carried a monthly interest rate of 2.5 per cent. Finally, Mrs Bassano, a former member of Academy of St Martins in the Fields and a number of symphony orchestras, pledged the viola to Borro Loan in return for £130,000. Country house: The Bassanos put their house in Great Missenden on the market for £3million to help pay the bills . Mr Bassano, with what the judge described as ‘conspicuous skill’, fought his wife’s corner in court after she was too unwell to attend the hearing, insisting that the loans were unenforceable. However, Mr Justice Popplewell rejected the conductor's bid to save the viola for his wife, and ruled that Mr Toft and Borro Loan were entitled to their money back, with interest. The viola was bought by Mr Biddulph last month for £230,000, but that was not enough to cover Mrs Bassano’s debts. The money will be divided up between Borro Loan and Mr Toft, but that still leaves Mrs Bassano heavily in debt and facing a potential claim by Mr Biddulph for return of the £50,000 he loaned her. Good violas, like this one, can cost several thousand pounds but Mrs Bassano's could be worth up to £400,000, an antiques dealer said . On top of that, the couple, who were reportedly declared bankrupt last year, may face having to pay the six-figure legal costs of the three-day High Court hearing. Earlier Mr Bassano argued that the viola was worth far more than the £230,000. It had been insured for £350,000 in 2009 and, he said, was probably worth more than that now. But the judge described the price Mr Biddulph paid as 'the best price reasonably obtainable'. Speaking outside court at the beginning of the case, Mr Toft said of the contested instrument: 'It’s a nice viola - it’s a rarity. 'Ceruti was the last of the great Cremonese makers. Whoever buys it will probably sell it for about £400,000.' The Bassanos' house was put on the market a year ago for £3million. Peter Bassano is a former member of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and professor at the Royal College of Music and is part of a 500-year-old musical dynasty, with a family tree linking him to six talented Italian brothers brought over from Italy by Henry VIII to entertain his court. A trombonist who is music director at the Oxford University Sinfonietta and conductor of the city of Rochester Symphony Orchestra, his ancestors were Venetian musicians. Kathryn Bassano, also known as Kathy, is a former member of the Academy of St Martins in the Fields and a member of a number of symphony orchestras.  Originally from Yorkshire, she has been playing the viola since the age of 11 and is said to be one of the world's best. Talented: Kathryn Bassano has performed alongside musicians including Madonna, left, and Mick Jagger . She was the first woman to play principal viola with the English Chamber Orchestra and has performed with Madonna and Westlife, Mick Jagger and Sting.  She has also recorded soundtracks for the Harry Potter and The Lord Of The Rings films. The couple have four children, three boys and a girl, and the boys were educated at Eton (where boarding fees cost £33,000 a year) while their daughter went to Cheltenham Ladies College (£30,000 a year). They bought their brick and flint house which enjoys far-reaching views over the Buckinghamshire countryside in 1997 for £350,000, and it is now said to be worth around £3million.","Kathryn Bassano, 57, is married to renowned conductor Peter Bassano, 68 .

Stalker: Jason Smith, pictured leaving a different trial in 2010, admitted harassing two women . A stalker who pursued a six-year campaign of threats and intimidation against women he found online will be detained in a psychiatric hospital after admitting harassment. Jason Smith, 28, was arrested after terrorising women whom he bombarded with text messages, phonecalls and threats of violence. A hearing at Manchester Crown Court was told that Smith - whom prosecutors say suffers from mental illness - sent incessant messages to a 21-year-old Sarah Brett, whom he had never met face-to-face. In one incoherent message he appeared to threaten the sleeping woman with throwing bricks through her window as punishment for upsetting him. It said: 'Bricks going to go through your window in about two minutes, if you don’t wake up going to smash - watch, you f****d my head up.' [sic] . Another said: 'I’m going to smash in your head myself and going to love it'. He later sent similarly demanding messages to one of her friends. Smith wrote: 'Anwer ya phone now', followed by 'Am gonna slap ya fat wrinkly mum... an smash her car up if Sarah doesn't ring tonight.' [sic] . He also created fake Facebook accounts in Miss Brett's name and posted spiteful updates about her mother. Smith would call as often as 300 times a day and sent her more than 200 threatening texts, the court heard. When she refused to meet, ignored his calls and changed her phone number, Smith instead began pursuing her friend. He threatened Beth O'Connor, also 21, with rape and said he would kill her family when she didn't help him track down Miss Brett. Harassed: Beth O'Connor, left, received threatening messages from Smith, right, as part of his campaign to contact her friend Sarah Brett, whom he thought was in love with him . Smith, who has similar previous . convictions, was detained under the Mental Health Act and is expected to . be taken to a psychiatric hospital. During the trial it emerged that Smith, a musician, had . previously been convicted of hounding a third woman between 2007 and . 2009. Deluded: Prosecutors said Smith, pictured last year, convinced himself he was in a relationship with Miss Brett . He sent her as many as 30 threatening messages a day over Facebook and . MySpace after she rejected her advances. He vowed to slash the victim’s face, rape her aunt and mother and shoot her father. The . court heard how Smith first contacted Miss Brett over dating site . Plenty of Fish, and later sent her a friend request on Facebook and . exchanged numbers with her. They . had once planned to meet, but Miss Brett changed her mind. However, . Smith had already convinced himself that she was in love with him, and . began sending huge numbers of intimidating messages, the court heard. Prosecutor Holly Holden said: 'Although . she didn’t actually meet him they did make a vague arrangement to meet . but she changed her mind. She accepted him as a friend on Facebook as . she didn’t see any reason not to. 'But . on his Facebook she noted that he only had one female friend. 'They . exchanged telephone numbers but he told her how he had lost money . gambling and was reassuring himself that she was not seeing anyone. 'She found it worrying as they were not in a relationship. She said she found it quite creepy. He phoned her 300 times a day. 'Sometimes she would go to bed and wake to hundreds of calls by him from his mobile and landline. 'Her . mobile phone would ring constantly, her male friends would sometimes . answer to try and ward him off. Sometimes she would reply to the . messages to say they were not in a relationship. 'She thought he was deluded to think they were in a relationship.' Threats: Miss O'Connor, left, received hundreds of texts, including threats directed at her aunt Angela Core, right . Miss Brett called police but decided not to make a statement at first for fear of 'burdening' her family. She changed her number after Smith sent her 236 threatening text messages. After . this Smith began to text . Miss O'Connor. Initially he called asking after Miss Brett, and later texted saying: ‘let me do yah Sarah’. When Beth said: ‘It’s . not Sarah’, he replied: ‘I know it’s Beth, Sarah is in London’. He said . if she didn’t get Sarah to call him he would keep texting. He sent 184 . messages and called 200 times. Erotomania, the disorder which it was claimed Jason Smith suffers, is a condition that causes a person to hold the delusional belief that someone is in love with them. The disease, also known as de Clerambault's syndrome, is the subject of Ian McEwan's novel Enduring Love, which was made into a successful film starring Daniel Craig. Film: A scene from Enduring Love . The conditions is said to inspire alternating periods of hope and resentment of the person. It is often directed at celebrities, or people the sufferer has hardly met and can lead to hopeless campaigns in which the sufferer attempts to make contact. Sufferers often convince themselves that the subject of their delusion is in love with them but unable to reveal their affections for practical or social reasons. However the condition can be difficult to diagnose with certainty, requiring months of observation. Later . Smith sent Beth a message saying ‘I’m going to get someone to do ya - . answer your phone now’. One message said: ‘I love Sarah and she loves . me’. In a victim impact statement Miss Brett said: 'Being on the receiving end of this is ruining my life and I live constantly in fear that he is going to cause me some harm. 'Someone fitting his description has been asking about me in bars and the thought of this terrifies me.' A separate statement from Miss O'Connor said: 'I think he is dangerous man who is . capable of anything. He said he was going to rape me and if he didn’t, . someone else was going to do it instead.' 'After . what happened, I’ve even been terrified to walk down the road and I am . constantly looking over my shoulder because I think he is there lurking . nearby. 'He’s even been walking around our neighbourhood with a picture of me. He was talking about bringing a gun and shooting me. 'This man is not safe to be around women. He was obsessed - this man should be in prison.' Smith admitted harassment last Friday and was . given a 28 day interim hospital order after Judge Andrew Blake was told a . bed had become available at Prestwich psychiatric hospital. In the hearing it had been claimed Smith suffered from erotomania - the delusion that another person is in love with them.

"By . Dr Ellie Cannon . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 25 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 18:08 EST, 25 January 2014 . When we read about social media in the news, it’s rarely for a good reason. Last week footballer-turned-pundit Stan Collymore was ‘declaring war’ on ‘vile internet trolls’ – those who write abusive things in order to bully others online. But another battle being waged  on sites including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube caught my attention last week: a campaign urging the public to come forward and ‘swab 4margot’. On the sites, enchanting images  of a gorgeous red-haired toddler  are emblazoned with the words: ‘Margot Needs You.’ Save Margot: The family of 17-month-old Margot Martini, who was diagnosed with a very rare type of leukaemia last year, has started a campaign to find a donor match for her . The adorable little girl in question is 17-month-old Margot Martini, who was diagnosed last October with a very rare type of leukaemia. In order to have a chance of a cure she needs a stem cell donor – previously called a bone marrow  donor. No relatives are a match,  so the search has had to be opened up to the world, through social media. Actually registering as a donor is an incredibly simple process. On the website deletebloodcancer.org.uk, you can order an at-home mouth swab kit. Once done and  sent off, it is processed in a lab and your tissue type can be determined and placed on a register. Although 90,000 Britons have now registered, only half of the 1,600 patients currently on the stem  cell donor waiting list will find a match. For the others, sadly, there  is little hope. Support: Gary Barlow is just one of several celebrities, and thousands of ordinary people, who are helping spread the word about Margot's plight . A YouTube video of Margot, with  a haunting soundtrack by pop star Ellie Goulding, has now been viewed more than 55,000 times. It is watched 1,000 times a day. Boosting awareness, the Martinis’ Twitter campaign has been  retweeted by celebrities with  huge followings such as Stephen Fry, Richard Branson, Gary Barlow and Ronnie Wood, while Margot’s Facebook page has more than  8,000 likes. In the first two weeks of the campaign, 12,000 people requested a swab kit from Delete Blood Cancer – a huge number in that timeframe. And even if a match for Margot  isn’t found, then many others like her could benefit. This sort of campaign represents a sea change in the world of health. Of course, finding a donor in such circumstances, even in the digital age, is a Herculean task, but less than a decade ago the outlook for desperately sick babies such as Margot, or adults in need of similar treatment, was far bleaker. Social media is a massive boon in what . is essentially a numbers game – the more people who register as donors, . the more chance those on transplant waiting lists who are perilously . ill will be helped. It is all about improving the statistics, and the only way to do that is  to tell more and more people. Some . 20 years ago I signed up as a stem cell donor in response to the Sue . Harris Campaign. Sue was a young woman with leukaemia who spoke at more . than 150 events across Britain to raise awareness  of her plight. For leukaemia patients, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are very effective in getting rid of cancer in the blood. But the aggressive treatment attacks all cells that divide rapidly (as cancer cells do) and destroys healthy bone marrow – the soft tissues inside the bones that create red blood cells. For the patient to survive the process, new bone marrow – stem cells – must be put back into the bones. There are two ways to donate: either under general anaesthetic, when stem cells are extracted from the hip or elsewhere with a needle, or through a process that is carried out while awake. This involves taking medication to increase the number of stem cells. Which type  of ‘harvesting’ is used depends on specific details of the donor’s and the recipient’s cases.Successful donors can remain anonymous. For the time, Sue’s campaign was a phenomenal success story in terms of recruitment, adding at least 15,000 to the register over the few years of her campaign. Towards the end of the campaign a donor match was found, but Sue was already too unwell for it to be a success, and shesadly died in 1997, aged 34. Most patients and their families won’t have the kind of tremendous strength and determination that Sue showed in the face of crushing illness. At the time, she had to persuade local newspapers and radio stations to carry her story,  but with so many needy patients, it was not feasible to expect every one to be given airtime. This is why blogs, websites and social media represent such a revolution: they are a direct route to a wide circle of people who actually care about you and your family. Mind you, it is quick and easy to click ‘like’ or retweet a campaign –most of us will have done so or at least be aware of such things. But it takes that bit more goodwill to take action and register to help. It’s an issue experienced by Jonni Berger, whose mother, Sharon, received a stem cell transplant last year following a social media campaign organised by her children. Sharon was diagnosed with leukaemia just before Christmas 2012. Jonni says: ‘Retweets raise awareness but people have to take action, and that is the hard part. ‘No one in the family was a match so my sister Caroline and I set up the #spit4mum Twitter campaign and had unprompted retweets from celebrities like Danni Minogue. ‘By January there was a 1,000 per cent rise in donor registrations. This type of campaigning really works. ‘But it took persistence and luck, and at the end of the day goodwill. Someone – we don’t know who – registered and saved her life. ‘That took a lot more than just pressing “Like” on Facebook.’ Yaser Martini, Margot’s father, explains it simply: ‘The first day I had my head in my hands. Margot was on life support, I was feeling very sorry for myself. But she had strength, and that gave us strength. We had to do something to save  our daughter. ‘The next day we started making our YouTube video. If nothing else, we knew this would be our emotional and sanity insurance policy.

Alexis Houston, who is often billed as Whitney's half-sister, has been branded a fake by the late singer's family . It is a headline-grabbing musical connection any singer would envy: to be closely related to soul diva Whitney Houston. But although Alexis Houston  – who has performed at a gala  for Prince Charles’s charity the Prince’s Trust – is often billed as the late star’s half-sister, Whitney’s family have branded her a fake. What’s more, it seems that Alexis may have been born 13 years earlier than she claims .  .  . and male. Whitney’s long-time publicist Jill Fritzo said the family maintain that ‘Alexis is no relation whatsoever to Whitney and are sorry that this person continues to misuse the Houston name. 'Everyone knows that Whitney did not have a sister’. Alexis, who has appeared on ITV’s This Morning and toured the UK, says on her website that she began to sing as a child at the same church in Newark, New Jersey, where Whitney found her voice. But Bahamas-based musician Gary Haase says he knows her as Wellington Stuart, son of local singer Wendell Stuart. According to court reports, Whitney sued a man by the name of Wellington Stuart in 1996 for claiming to be her cousin, although the outcome of the case is uncertain. And in 2001, a Wellington Houston, described in the press as Whitney’s cousin, issued a demo CD titled All’s Well. The label that released Alexis’s 2010 album Speak Love-Live Lessons is also called All’s Well Music. Last night, Jacob Ascher, who runs Alexis’s company, insisted she was Whitney’s half-sister, and born female. Reports suggest Alexis, who claims Whitney (pictured) found her voice in a New Jersey church, was actually born a man 13 years earlier than she claims . He said that although Alexis’s mother, Marjorie, was married to Wendell Stuart, her dad was entertainment executive John Houston, Whitney’s father. ‘She was always Alexis Houston,’ he said. ‘Wellington Stuart was the son of Wendell. It makes no sense that Alexis was born a man. She was born in 1984  or 1985 in the US and had the same dad as Whitney.

These painstakingly restored images offer up a snapshot of thriving commercial London more than 100 years ago. The images are the product of a single day's walk through Spitalfields in East London on a Saturday morning in 1912. Children, away from school, can be seen thronging the streets enjoying themselves. However, some simply stand and stare at the strange spectacle of photographer C A Mathew burdened with a tripod and heavy camera. On the day, April 20, London was still reeling from the news that HMS Titanic had sunk in the Atlantic after striking an iceberg five days earlier. The day's newspapers carried the latest details, as well as pictures of a packed memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral the previous day. Mr Mathew's unposed photos, a contrast to the rigid portrait photography of the age, show the bustle of the streets as tradesmen rumble past in horse-drawn carriages. A collection of the images taken that day, which have been described as 'the most vivid evocation we have of Spitalfields' in 1912, are due to be exhibited later this month at a gallery not far from the streets pictured. Some of the views have changed beyond recognition, but much of the architecture remains recognisible to this day. Eleven Spitalfields will host the pictures, which belong to the Bishopsgate Institutute and were restored by local photographer Jeremy Freedman. The runs from March 7 to April 25. Bustle of the streets: C A Mathew captured this scene, showing horse-drawn traffic along a busy East London street. Children look on with a mixture of excitement an apprehension as adults can be seen hovering around a pub in the background . Snapshot: The pictures, taken on a Saturday morning, show children thronging the streets as tradesmen tried to make their way between the brick buildings . Commercial: Pedestrians can be seen packing the streets outside traditional shops in this business district of London . Broad streets: Men, almost all wearing hats, can be seen walking from shop to shop as the day's shopping begins . Stand and stare: Shoppers and tradesmen seem intrguied by Mr Mathew's camera equipment, and stand back to stare directly into the shot . Then and now: The prospect down Artillery Passage looks very different today, but the distinctive shapes of the buildings are still recognisable . Passage of time: Some buildings on Bell Lane, in the background of the pictures above, are clearly the same as were pictured by Mr Mathew . Different: White Lion Street, which is now called Folgate Street, has the same shape as in 1912, but does not resemble the old photographs very much . One story dominated the morning papers on Saturday April 20 1912. Reports were still rolling in about the shocking sinking on the Titanic, which had struck an iceberg in the mid-Atlantic in the early hours of April 15. The Daily Mail that day offered up a comprehensive account of the final hours, telling the now-famous story of how the band kept playing even as the ship, thought to be unsinkable, slipped beneath the waves. History: The main story from the news pages of that day's Daily Mail . A striking picture of British mourners crowding the streets headed the page. It showed thousands of people gathered in front of St Paul's Cathedral, where a memorial service had been held the previous day for the 1,500 dead. An accusatory side item from New York told of the moment Mr Ismay, the chairman of White Star Line which had sold the tickets to passengers, came ashore. The businessman explained how he managed to secure a space on the last lifeboat leaving the ship. Meanwhile the main article praised the courage of Captain Edward Smith, whom it said remained absolutely calm throughout the disaster and filled passengers and crew with courage by urging them 'Be British!'","Pictures were taken on April 20 1912 by C A Mathew and show the busy commercial streets as the day begins .

Warning: Boris Johnson said police and social services are often too hampered by political correctness to act . The children of Islamist radicals should be taken into care, Boris Johnson said last night. The Mayor of London said hundreds of children were at risk of being turned into fanatics by extremist parents. But he warned that in many cases social services and the police are simply too influenced by ‘absurd’ political correctness to take them into care. Mr Johnson said young people were increasingly being ‘radicalised at their home’ and taught the sort of ‘crazy stuff’ similar to the views espoused by the killers of Lee Rigby. He said lack of clarity about the law meant the authorities were reluctant to intervene. The Mayor wrote in the Daily Telegraph: ‘A child may be taken into care if he or she is being exposed to pornography, or is being abused – but not if the child is being habituated to this utterly bleak and nihilistic view of the world that could lead them to become murderers. ‘It is the strong view of many of those involved in counter-terrorism that there should be a clearer legal position, so that those children who are being turned into potential killers or suicide bombers can be removed into care.’ The Mayor drew parallels about the way in which political correctness hampered action by citing the Daily Mail’s revelations about senior Labour politicians, the National Council for Civil Liberties and its affiliation with a paedophile organisation. He said: ‘Look at the case of Harriet Harman. You may ask yourself how on earth this relatively astute politician could have allowed her organisation to be affiliated to a body that brazenly called itself the “Paedophile Information Exchange”. 'The answer – which Harman would do well to admit – is that back in the Seventies she got into a complete intellectual fog.’ He said many young people are being taught 'crazy stuff' like the views of Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo who murdered fusilier Lee Rigby with no remorse and have since been jailed . He said the NCCL, in search of minorities to protect, came across the PIE and ‘mushily decided’ the group must have protected status. Mr Johnson said there were thousands of counter-terrorism officers working doing a ‘fantastic job’ to keep the public safe. They had to work out which vulnerable young people were most at risk of radicalisation. The Mayor wrote: ‘That will sometimes mean taking a view about what is happening to them in their homes – and I worry that their work is being hampered by what I am obliged to call political correctness.’","'Young people taught 'crazy stuff' like extreme views of Lee Rigby's killers'

Whistleblower Sandra Haynes-Kirkbright was suspended by Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust after raising concerns about 'fixed' figures . An NHS whistleblower has been threatened with the sack after going public with concerns that a hospital was fiddling its appalling death rates. Sandra Haynes Kirkbright claimed she was headhunted by hospital bosses and asked to 'fix' the figures to cover up the true extent of the hospital's failings. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was suspended by the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust after repeatedly raising her concerns – and in March last year spoke to the Daily Mail about fears that she had been hired to make the death rates look better. Last week she received a letter via email ordering her to attend a disciplinary hearing. The letter also revealed she could be fired for speaking out. The threat is totally at odds with repeated assurances from the Government and the chief executive of the NHS that whistleblowers acting in the public interest will be protected. In the letter, hospital bosses claimed the  50-year-old 'behaved recklessly or negligently' by going public 'without the Trust's authorisation to do so'. The hospital also accused the whistleblower of breaching her employment contract by ignoring confidentiality agreements and rules regarding speaking to the Press. The letter adds: 'The hearing will be held in order to consider the facts of this case, and you should be aware that this may result in formal disciplinary action, not excluding dismissal.' The Mail last year revealed the case of whistleblower Gary Walker – a former hospitals chief in Lincolnshire who broke a £500,000 gagging clause to raise urgent concerns about patient safety and high death rates. The scandal prompted Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to insist he would ban gagging clauses, declaring: 'The era of gagging NHS staff from raising their real worries about patient care must come to an end.' Last night Stephen Dorrell, the Tory chairman of the Health Select Committee, warned any hospital which tried to sack a whistleblower could face action from NHS executives. 'If it can be shown information has been disclosed in the public interest then any attempt to take disciplinary action against that person should prompt action against the hospital by NHS management,' he told the Mail. Threat: Sandra Haynes Kirkbright and an edited version of the letter she received . Former Health Secretary Mr Dorrell said legal safeguards and assurances by NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson protected whistleblowers. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was a health coder – administrators who record details of the care received by patients. They do not need medical qualifications and have been accused of having too much influence over how hospitals are found to be performing. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, who is originally from Texas, was hired by Royal Wolverhampton in October 2011 after it scored one of the highest mortality rates in the country, with concerns raised over high numbers of deaths at weekends. She had previously worked at Stafford Hospital, where she had overseen an improvement in coding following the hospital scandal there. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright said conditions at Wolverhampton were as bad or worse as those at Stafford, where as many as 1,200 patients died needlessly. But rather than improving patient care, she believed the hospital wanted to improve its shocking death rates. Bosses offered to almost double her salary to £54,000 a year in the belief that she had distorted death figures at Stafford and could do the same for them. She refused to do this but realised others at the trust were 'breaking every rule in the book'. She claimed coders were using tenuous excuses to record too many deaths at the hospital under 'palliative care' category. This meant their deaths – officially classed as unavoidable – would not alter the hospital's highly scrutinised mortality rate.Palliative care focuses on relieving the suffering of patients. Figures show between 2009 and 2011 the death rate at Wolverhampton fell by 13 per cent, from very poor levels to the national average. At the same time, the number of deaths recorded as 'palliative care' rose from 2.19 per cent to 20.3 per cent, about double the national average. When she blew the whistle internally, she was told not to put the allegations in writing because 'the Press can get hold of it through Freedom of Information'. Nine months after starting work for Wolverhampton, she was suspended for alleged bullying and harassment. She believes this was simply a way of silencing her. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, who sought no payment for her story and is suspended on full pay, said she faced ruin if she was sacked. 'I've been sick to my stomach for three days,' she said. 'I feel like David fighting Goliath. I've just been telling the truth.' A Health Department spokesman said: 'We have been absolutely clear that staff who have the courage and integrity to speak out … must be protected and listened to.' The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust refused to comment. In the past it insisted it was 'categorically false' to suggest palliative care patients had been coded incorrectly to cut death rates.","Sandra Haynes Kirkbright raised concerns about 'fixed' figures .

"PUBLISHED: . 15:03 EST, 2 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 07:06 EST, 3 March 2014 . More than 100 BBC executives are earning six-figure salaries, despite pledges to curb top pay and offer viewers better value for money, . New figures have revealed that more than 100 of the corporation's top earners make at least £100,000 a year, and 80 of them are on salaries of £150,000 or more. According to an official BBC register of elite staff, 13 executives were also given a pay rise of up to 10 per cent, at a time when the broadcaster is facing cuts to its spending. Value for money: Since Lord Tony Hall took over the post of BBC director general in April last year he has been trying to cut the percentage of executives from 2.5 per cent of the workforce to one per cent . It also follows last year's severance pay scandal in which the National Audit Office found that the BBC handed over £1.4million more in pay-offs to senior managers than it needed to. Since Lord Hall took over the post of director general in April last year he has been trying to cut the percentage of executives from 2.5 per cent of the workforce to one per cent. And although more than 25 senior managers have left the broadcaster since his tenure began, the number of serving managers required to declare their income as more than £100,000 has risen from 100 to 102, according to the Sunday Times. The BBC said that the loss of these 25 senior figures had led to savings to the pay bill of more than £2million between March 31, 2013, and January 1 of this year, and that the number of senior management earners had also fallen by two per cent. Since taking over as director general, Lord Hall has been keen to argue that the BBC provides value for money and in a speech to the Oxford Media Convention last week he said  a BBC survey had shown that some viewers would happily pay between £15 and £20 a month, compared to the £12 currently paid. Cost: Lord Hall has suggested that viewers who watch BBC programmes through the iPlayer catch-up service should be forced to pay the £145.50 annual licence fee . He also accepted . the BBC needs to cut the amount it spends and refused to rule . out making cuts to some channels such as BBC Three or BBC Four, as well . as suggesting that viewers who watch BBC programmes through the iPlayer . catch-up service should be forced to pay the £145.50 annual licence fee, . which currently only applies to those who watch shows as they are . broadcast. And in the wake of the severance pay scandal last year, he called . for the Corporation to be run like an employee-owned organisation such . as John Lewis rather than a bank seeking to maximise shareholder . profits. He said: ‘The BBC is not a standard public service. In . ethos we’re less like the City and more like John Lewis...we are the . BBC, not a PLC.’ Director General Tony Hall £450,000-a-year (a decrease of £221,000 compared with Mark Thomas but the same as George Entwistle) Managing director, finance and operations Anne Bulford  £395,000 (£43,000 more than former chief financial officer Zarin Patel) Director of news and current affairs James Harding £340,000 (the same as his predacessor Helen Boaden) Director, television Danny Cohen £320,000 (£50,000 more than George Entwistle's basic salary as director of vision in 2011/12. Mr Cohen did not receive a pay increase on his promotion from controller of BBC One) Source: BBC / Sunday Times . In March 2013 the number of managers required to declare their pay stood at 103, which has now risen to 111, plus four non-executive directors. Once recently departed staff and non-executive directors are removed from the tally, the figure has risen from 100 to 102, according to the Sunday Times - although the BBC refute this. Staff remain on the list for one quarter after their departure. Some . 87 of them have a salary higher than that of Prime Minister David . Cameron's £142,500-a-year pay, and 82 are on more than £150,000-a-year. 'The website referenced still contains profiles of a number of individuals who have left the organisation and simply counting them doesn't deliver up to date numbers - the latest figures show senior manager numbers have reduced under Tony Hall by more than 25 people, reducing the pay bill by more than £2m,' a BBC spokesman told MailOnline. 'It is also factually inaccurate to suggest 100k senior management earners are up under Tony Hall - they are also down (by two per cent).' Some senior figures have also received pay rises, despite many in the public sector being subject to a pay freeze. Chief adviser Claire Dresser, who is . responsible for running the Director of Television's executive office . currently is recorded as having a salary of  £109,433 and a total remuneration of £114,233 - although that figure from November 2013 has risen nearly £10,000 from her June listing. And controller of entertainment commissioning Mark Linsey also declared a pay rise of 10 per cent, giving him a total remuneration of £230,000 after taking on some new responsibilities. The corporation reportedly needs to reduce this figure to 65 people by the end of 2015, and the BBC Trust has recommended that the senior management salary bill should be reduced by recruiting new figures who are paid less than their predecessors. Lord Hall himself commands a £450,000-a-year salary, the same as his predecessor George Entwistle, who resigned after just 54 days in the job, but less than Mark Thompson who earned £671,000 a year.","More than 100 of the BBC's top earners make at least £100,000 a year .

However, her manager declined to say whether or not he had bought it . Fame: Her manager, left, hopes his investment in Dee will turn her media 'career' into a lengthy one . Dee - due to be interviewed by presenter Emily Maitlis on the BBC's Newsnight tomorrow - was spotted on Wednesday at Chichester Caravans in Birmingham where she looked inside a used Lunar Freelander, priced at £6,995. The 10-year-old holiday vehicle is 19ft long and includes four berths and a full kitchenette including an electric oven and hob. It is now listed as sold on the company's website, but the outspoken mother's manager said only that 'negotiations are in progress'. Barry Tomes, who signed up as White Dee's manager less than two weeks ago, told MailOnline he would pay for the caravan so his client had somewhere to escape from it all. 'To buy a caravan for someone is not such a bad investment,' he said. 'I manage recording artists around the world and we would pay £10,000 or £20,000 to produce an album without knowing if the money will come back. Not that one! The TV personality looks disapproving as she examines the wares on-site on Wednesday . Heading in: Dee opens the door to the caravan, which is 19ft long and includes four berths . Joking around: It's been claimed offers have soared in, including for TV appearances and marriage proposals . Outspoken: Her brash attitude to being on benefits made White Dee a source of huge controversy . 'James Turner Street is a nightmare street, she's got two children both at school so I suggested she might want somewhere to go away with the kids. It was my idea. 'We've been offered three or four holidays abroad and she's been offered a fabulous mobile home in the south of France. 'I've been doing this for 40 years - I was driving Rolls Royces for Lulu when I was 17 - but I've never seen so many offers from so many places. I certainly don't think she's a flash in the pan.' Mr Tomes declined to expand on speculation that Dee, touted as a wannabe rapper, has been given a recording contract but said negotiations were under way. She has also had a reported three marriage proposals since her appearances on Channel 4. He said he is planning several other PR moves with the divisive 44-year-old, but added there was a 'serious side' to her too. 'James Turner Street is no different to streets all over this country,' he said. 'It's just the one that got on TV.' 'White Dee' proved to be one of the most controversial people featured on the Channel 4 documentary, exemplifying what some called a culture of choosing benefits over work. But the channel has also been beset by claims that selective editing exploited its stars and turned them into little more than 'poverty porn' to bash the unfortunate.","Deirdre Kelly, 44, from Channel 4 show was at dealer in Birmingham .

Millions of children driven to school each day by their parents are ‘killing the planet’ with the pollution they generate, green campaigners claim today. They argue that the traditional school run by mums and dads in their 4X4s and other vehicles ‘costs the Earth’ because every time a child is driven to primary school and back their car releases into the atmosphere the equivalent of 84 balloons worth of carbon dioxide (CO2) - the so-called ‘greenhouse-gas’ which some scientists blame for global warming. Millions of children driven to school each day by their parents are 'killing the planet' with the pollution they generate, environmental transport charity Sustrans has claimed . They are urging parents to encourage their children to walk, cycle ‘scoot’ on a scooter or take a bus to school rather than rely on the chauffeur services provided by legions of mums and dad causing gridlock outside the school gates. The research by environmental transport charity Sustrans says that if a child is driven to school every day they would generate 183,379 balloons worth of CO2 over their school career: ‘That’s 84 balloons every day’, says Sustrans. Overall Journeys to school made by car are responsible for releasing over 363,075 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere each year, it claims. Their report notes:’Currently over 1,760,000 children are driven to primary school across the UK - even though pupils live an average of 1.8 miles from their school which takes just 20 minutes to bike or scoot. ‘ . The announcement comes at the start of The Big Pedal (3 -14th March); an inter-school competition run by Sustrans which encourages families to cycling or scoot the school run. This year The Big Pedal is partnering with Climate Week (3-9th March) to emphasise the impact the school run has on the environment. 'In future please ask your mother to drop you off at the school gates' More than 1,520 schools have signed up to take part in The Big Pedal 2014 and will make hundreds of thousands of bike and scooter journeys over 10 days. The report says; ‘Last year families made 847,725 journeys by bike and scooter saving an impressive 704 tonnes of CO2 – or 52,800,000 balloons - from being released into the atmosphere had all these journeys have been made by car.’ Malcolm Shepherd, chief executive at Sustrans said: ‘Driving to school not only contributes to UK-wide air pollution levels, it also causes pollution at the school gates which can be harmful for children. ‘If families who lived closer to school travelled by bike or scooter then both pollution and congestion levels could be significantly reduced.’ He added: ’Parents who make this simple change to their daily routine will help everyone breathe a little easier and will find their journeys help make them happier and healthier too.’ Organisers said this year The Big Pedal is partnering with Climate Week (3-9th March) to emphasise the impact the school run has on the environment. Mr Shepherd noted: ’The Big Pedal proves that families can change the way they travel – but we need this change to last for longer than two weeks to make a lasting impact on the environment.’ Kevin Steele, the founder of Climate Week said: ‘We’re calling on all the teachers who support us to change themselves from pedagogues to pedalogues and get their schools involved in the Big Pedal for Climate Week.'","Environmental transport charity Sustrans says pupils should walk or cycle .

In limbo: Mr Wilson at home with son Mark, 17 (left) and the X-ray which was finally performed on his leg (right) Unable to drive, he was given a lift home but claimed instead of X-raying him, staff at Airedale Hospital gave him an appointment to see a physiotherapist a week later. When he attended the appointment, the expert immediately sought a second opinion and he was lined up for surgery, he said. But after further delays, the surgery has still not happened. Stuck: Mr Wilson did not attend hospital for two days after his fall, but the pain increased . Mr Wilson, who said he plans to take legal action against the hospitals, said: 'I tripped and at first I thought it was a sprain but the pain gradually got worse so I went to A&E two days later. 'I . only got as far as the triage nurse who told me it was a bit pointless . me being there and I should go to my local hospital as an outpatient. There was no X-ray.

A convicted paedophile who fled Britain to Cambodia is behind bars again after being deported and flown back to the UK. Former special constable Ian Bower, 48, from Bramcote, Nottinghamshire, fled the UK eight years ago for Cambodia from a probation hostel after serving time for child sex abuse crimes. He was convicted of similar offences in 2012 in Cambodia, including paying young boys in Asia the equivalent of 8p to perform sex acts on him - and was jailed for two years. Ian Bower, who fled the country eight years ago from a probation hostel after serving time for child sex abuse claims, was deported from Cambodia on Friday after being jailed for sex crimes in the country . Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister signed a deportation . order and Bower was flown back to the UK on Friday. He was joined on his flight by officers from the National Crime Agency after . Cambodian authorities sought their assistance to ensure his safe . deportation. He was arrested by detectives when he landed at Gatwick Airport. A Derbyshire police spokesman said: 'Bower was released from a Cambodian prison in late 2013. The former special constable was arrested as he arrived back in to the UK on Friday after the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia signed a deportation order . 'In January this year, Cambodian authorities arrested him in relation to a suspected passport offence. 'We are sure that the families of his victims will be pleased that he is back in prison.' Bower was jailed at Derby Crown Court in 2004 for three years for indecently assaulting a male and gross indecency with a child and nine months for making indecent photos of children. After being released in January 2006 on licence, the former Derbyshire police special constable was put into a probation hostel. A month later he went missing. British authorities were notified by children's rights organisation ECPAT UK that Bower was in Cambodia in 2007 when he was arrested for abusing two brothers, aged 12 and 14, while teaching English in the country. However, after the children withdrew their statements, the case against him was dropped and he was allowed to stay in the country. Yesterday, Bharti Patel, chief . executive officer at ECPAT UK, said: 'We welcome the news that convicted . child sex offender Ian Bower has been finally arrested by Derbyshire .

'However, nothing was done to facilitate Bower's return and he was arrested again in 2011 for committing indecent acts on five boys aged 11 to 16, while working as an English teacher in Cambodia. 'It is clear from Ian Bower's record of convictions for sexual offences against children in Britain dating back to 2004 that he is a high-risk sex offender. 'Clearly, the failure of the British authorities to take action over an eight-year period has meant that Bower was able to travel freely to Cambodia to sexually abuse vulnerable children as young as 11 years old.'","Ian Bower fled UK eight years ago for Cambodia from probation hostel .

One of the largest natural landslides in recent years took place in a remote area of southeastern Alaska on February 16, when 68 million tonnes of rock and debris crashed down a mountainside leaving deposits 40 foot deep. Large landslides in remote locations used to go unnoticed, but a new crowdsourcing approach involving a UK-based blogger, an Alaskan helicopter pilot and NASA, helped scientists pinpoint the exact location of this latest slide. This innovative new approach is the result of the discovery last year by two Columbia University scientists that seismic data can reveal the time, force, direction, and speed of a large landslide. Unlike earthquakes, which release bursts . of energy for a few seconds, landslides create sustained seismic . readings that can last many minutes. One of the largest natural landslides in recent years took place in a remote area of southeastern Alaska on February 16, when 68 million tonnes of rock and debris crashed down a mountainside leaving deposits 40 foot deep . Large landslides in remote locations used to go unnoticed, but a new crowdsourcing approach involving a UK-based blogger, an Alaskan helicopter pilot and NASA, helped scientists pinpoint the exact location of this latest slide . Images from the NASA Earth Observatory showing Mount La Perouse before the landslide, left, and afterwards with the debris clearly visible, right . So when this recent big landslide occurred, its rumblings were quickly picked up by the network of seismic sensors in place around the globe to detect earthquakes. That seismic data put the Alaskan whopper somewhere in the vicinity of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Unfortunately the seismometers can only locate where a landslide occurs to within 30 kilometers and from there it took a coordinated effort to track it down. Key to this crowdsourcing effort was geographer Dave Petley who works at Durham University in the U.K. and also runs The Landslide Blog. Two Columbia University scientists last year discovered that seismic data can reveal the time, force, direction, and speed of a large landslide . That seismic data put the Alaskan landslide somewhere in the vicinity of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and helicopter pilot Drake Olson located it on the flank of Mount La Perouse . Scientists estimate that the debris flowed 4.8 kilometers downhill and left deposits as deep as 40 feet, almost the height of a five-story building. ‘I post the details and approximate location of the landslide, and we then, in effect, crowdsource finding it,’ he told Wired. His blog post was noticed by geomorpholgist Marten Geertsema of the University of Northern British Columbia, who contacted Alaskan helicopter pilot Drake Olson. About a week after the landslide occurred, Olson flew to the location and photographed the exact region where it happened, on the flank of Mount La Perouse. From the images, Petley estimated that the debris flowed 4.8 kilometers downhill and left deposits as deep as 40 feet, almost the height of a five-story building.

Without . this coordinated online effort, Petley said, the Mount La Perouse . landslide might never have been spotted as snow quickly cover the . impacted area. The new technique has helped scientists realize that landslides are much more common than once thought. ‘We used to think they were pretty rare, But we’ve probably just missed them in the past,’ said Petley. Researchers now think that roughly half a dozen big landslides happen in a typical year, though a massive earthquake can trigger as many as 40 large landslides.

Former Sky Sports commentator Ross McFarlane who is tonight locked up accused of breaching a child pornography sex offenders order - just four weeks after a judge spared him jail . A Sky Sports commentator who was spared jail just four weeks ago for paedophile offences was behind bars today after police re-arrested him. Former professional golfer Ross McFarlane has been charged with three counts of breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. He will appear in custody before a judge tomorrow morning. The 52-year-old was spared jail on January 30 by Judge Johannah Cutts who gave him a suspended sentence despite pointing out that within four months of an earlier conviction he was again making indecent images of children. 'While the sexual offences prevention order did not stop you, it did do its job as police became aware of what was happening,' she told him. McFarlane, from Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, will appear before Judge Francis Sheridan tomorrow morning charged with again breaching the court order in relation to child sex offences. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police confirmed that McFarlane had been charged on Friday, February 21 with three counts of breaching a sex offender order. He appeared before a special magistrates court hearing the next day, where he was remanded in custody. He will appear before Judge Sheridan at Aylesbury Crown Court via a video-link from prison tomorrow for a preliminary hearing of the breach charges. McFarlane was previously sentenced at the same court on January 30 for possession of 162 indecent images of children and given 10 months in prison, suspended for two years. He was also given a 10-year order banning him from contact with children under 16 without parental permission and was also ordered to sign onto the Sex Offenders Register for 10 years. The latest breaches were believed to involve contact with children. A regular fixture on Sky viewers' screens since 2001, McFarlane became a professional golfer in 1979 and won the Deutsche Bank Open of Europe in 1997, his only European Tour tournament win. That year he achieved his highest ranking of 26th on the tour. His father Noel played for Manchester United's youth side in the mid-1950s which featured many members of the Busby Babes side killed in the Munich air crash in 1958. At the court hearing in January, McFarlane's defence barrister Helen Warren told Judge Cutts: 'He is horrified to find himself here and is extremely upset, not just for himself but for those that know him.' Sentence: Mr McFarlane pleaded guilty to two offences at Aylesbury Crown Court, Buckinghamshire (pictured) She said McFarlane had sought rehabilitation and counselling since his arrest. 'He is very ashamed of himself and what he has put his family through,' she added. A spokesman for Sky Sports said at the time that it had been unaware of McFarlane's convictions and added that he had been used 'sporadically', around 10 times per year. 'Ross was an occasional, freelance golf expert and, of course, he will not be appearing again,' the spokesman said.

A paedophile who has been jailed for sexually abusing young boys was close friends with child-killer Roy Whiting and was worshipped by him as a 'God', it has been claimed. Speedway cycling coach Michael Green, 71, was jailed for nine years on Friday for attacks on two boys in Hampshire in the early 1980s. Now it has emerged he was a friend, coach and mentor at the time to Whiting, who was jailed in 2001 for abducting and killing eight-year-old Sarah Payne in a crime which shocked the nation. Mentor: Paedophile Mike Green (left), who has been jailed for nine years for sexually abusing boys, was a good friend of future child-killer Roy Whiting (right) at Crawley Tigers Speedway Club, where the pair are pictured . The link has been revealed by a former mutual friend who released a photo of Green and Whitingn now 55, grinning together at a speedway track. The friend, who wanted to remain anonymous, fears the pair may have fuelled each others' perversions while close friends at the Crawley Tigers Cycle Speedway Club, West Sussex. Jailed: Now 71, Michael Green had a mental breakdown after he was convicted . They grew close through a shared love of the sport and were pictured together at an awards ceremony. 'It's one hell of a shock for the sport,' said the source. 'Was Green involved in the sport to do this? He put a lot of money into the sport but was there an ulterior motive? 'He did a lot of good for the sport and attracted a lot of top riders but it is sad, so sad. 'He was a clever guy, but odd. Roy and Mike were very close. 'Some people have asked, ""Did one push the other?"" You've got two guys with that sort of mentality in one place. 'I think Mike Green was God in Roy Whiting's eyes. If there was a photo they were in it together.' Green was jailed at Hove Crown Court after a jury convicted him of one count of rape and two indecent assaults. The victims were both teenagers in the early 1980s and although they are both now physically strong men, they struggled to come to terms with what had happened, the court heard. Judge Anthony Niblett told Green: 'By your actions you caused [the rape victim] physical pain and emotional harm. 'But, far more significantly, you caused him emotional and psychological trauma from which he has suffered to this day. 'He had no-one to turn to for help at that stage in his life. Influence: A former mutual friend fears Roy Whiting (left), who abducted and murdered Sarah Payne (right), might have fuelled and been fuelled by the perversions of Michael Green at the cycling speedway club . Jailed: Green denied the offences but was convicted by a jury at Hove Crown Court, pictured . 'He kept the secret of what you had done to him until well into his adult life. 'His adolescence and early adult life were afflicted by alcohol and drug abuse, used to block out what had happened. Campaign: Sarah's mother Sara lobbied for 'name and shame' laws as Whiting had abused before . 'Only . in later years, when he remarried, helped and supported by his wife, . has he been able to unburden himself and begin to come to terms with . what has happened.' One of . Green's victims said after the sentencing: 'The impact that this man has . had on me and on my life has been like a life sentence. 'Today I can find some closure as justice has been done.' Defence barrister Jonathan Ray QC said Green, from Hove - who denied the charges - suffered a mental breakdown after being convicted. But Judge . Niblett described Green as a 'sexual predator', and told him: 'You've been in denial for decades. You've shown no remorse.' Police have encouraged any further victims of Green to come forward. Whiting was jailed for life in 2001 when he was convicted of abducting and murdering eight-year-old Sarah Payne in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex. Her death was the trigger for legislation, widely dubbed 'Sarah's Law', which allows people to ask police if someone who has contact with children is a convicted sex offender. Since the law came into force in 2011, more than 5,000 applications have been made to police which resulted in parents learning the past of 700 paedophiles.","Speedway coach Michael Green, 71, jailed for nine years for 1980s attacks .

"By . Ralph Ellis . PUBLISHED: . 19:05 EST, 26 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:40 EST, 29 January 2014 . Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... with some star turns and a look through the leagues, too. This week includes Jack Rodwell failing to make an impact against Watford, Adel Taarabt continuing to frustrate and Craig Noone's resurrection under Solskjaer. 1) Jack Rodwell’s £12million move to Manchester City has been an 18-month nightmare of niggling injuries and lack of action even when he has been fit. The 22-year-old has changed his car and moved house to try to solve his persistent hamstring problems since leaving Everton. Struggled: Jack Rodwell (right) did not play well against Watford and was hauled off at half-time . Any hope that getting picked against Watford in the FA Cup might turn the tide for him proved a big let down, however. Manuel Pellegrini said he wished he could have subbed all 11 players at half time when the Championship side were leading 2-0 – but it was Rodwell and Micah Richards who were the pair that did get the hook. Fight back: Sergio Aguero's second-half hat-trick brought City back from two goals down to win 4-2 . 2) Mark Schwarzer celebrated his 41st birthday back in October but continues to justify Chelsea’s decision to give him a one-year contract as cover to Petr Cech. The 1-0 win over Stoke meant the 6ft 5in goalkeeper has now kept five clean sheets in his six appearances since moving to Stamford Bridge. That’s one more than Fulham, who ditched him in the summer after signing Maarten Stekelenburg despite his 220 appearances, have managed all season. Unbeatable: Chelsea's reserve goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer has kept five clean sheets in six matches since moving to Stamford Bridge . 3) Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino made six changes for the clash with Yeovil to give some stars a break before this week’s Premier League matches with Arsenal and Fulham. But one man who didn’t get rested was newly-capped England striker Jay Rodriguez, who played all 90 minutes of the 2-0 win over Championship side Yeovil. The 24-year-old, who won his first England cap in the November friendly against Chile, has appeared in every one of Saints’ games in all competitions this season. The hamstring injury which kept Seamus Coleman out of Everton’s win at Stevenage means Rodriguez is now one of only three Premier League players who have appeared in every one of their club’s first-team games. The other two are Liverpool’s Jordan Henderson and Stoke skipper Ryan Shawcross – the only man to have started every match. Key man: Jay Rodriguez is one of just three Premier League players who have appeared in every one of their club's first team games this season . 4) Winger Craig Noone played a key role in Cardiff’s promotion side but struggled to adapt to the demands of Premier League football – it was mid-December before he started a game. But the 26-year-old from Kirkby, who has worked his way up from playing non-League football with Skelmersdale, looks like being a key man under Ole Gunnar Sokskjaer. He was one of the stars of the show in the 1-0 win at Bolton, and has played in all the club’s last eight matches. Revitalised: Craig Noone (left) has been given a new lease of life under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer . 5) Adel Taarabt continues to be the most frustrating player in football. Sent on for the last 23 minutes by Fulham boss Rene Meulensteen following a red card for Sheffield United skipper Michael Doyle, he gave the ball away the first five times he touched it. The Moroccan’s loan move from Queens Park Rangers has brought him just one goal, right back in August against Burton Albion. At least Fulham rescued a replay against 10-man Blades on this occasion. The other five matches when Taarabt has been brought on from the bench have all ended in defeats. Frustrating: Adel Taarabt had no impact after being introduced against 10-man Sheffield United . 6) Swansea skipper Ashley Williams has been linked with big clubs including Arsenal but looks likely to stay at the Liberty Stadium when the window shuts this week. That’s good news for Swans boss Michael Laudrup, whatever the ambitions of the 29-year-old captain of Wales. He played Birmingham almost on his own in the first half at St Andrew’s – making five vital blocks including two goal-line clearances. Top performer: Swansea skipper Ashley Williams (left) was excellent against Birmingham, making vital blocks and two goal-line clearances . 7) Leicester striker David Nugent appointed himself penalty taker for this campaign after watching youngster Anthony Knockaert miss the one at Watford that cost the Foxes a place in last year’s play-off final. The 28-year-old has been deadly, with nine successful spot kicks so far – just one short of Arthur Rowley’s club record for penalties in a season set way back in 1953. He should have reached that milestone on Saturday, but are nerves setting in? His tame effort was easily saved by Middlesbrough’s Shay Given. 8) Stephen Hunt’s starring role in Ipswich’s 2-0 win over Reading was a reward for his determination to rescue his career after it all went wrong at Wolves. The 32-year-old Republic of Ireland midfielder signed at Portman Road in November on a short-term deal where he didn’t earn a penny unless he got picked for the Championship club’s team. He’s now started two games and Ipswich have won them both, and he’s been given a proper contract that lasts until the end of the season. Impact: Stephen Hunt had a starring role in Ipswich's 2-0 win over Reading . 9) Crewe’s tradition for open football, long established by Dario Gradi, comes with huge risks. They defended better in the 1-0 defeat at Tranmere which left them just a point above the relegation zone in League One, having played two more games than 21st placed Sheffield United. But their goal difference is now an astonishing minus 27 – the worst of any of the 92 clubs.  Premier League Fulham are on minus 26. 10) They say teams reflect their manager, and Fleetwood are a good example given the reputation for commitment and determination their boss Graham Alexander gained in his playing days at Preston and Burnley. They won 4-2 at Burton to go third in League Two, despite putting up with an hour’s delay to kick off while torrential rain was cleared from the pitch, and then scoring two own goals. Alexander’s side will need the same character again tonight.  With barely 48 hours break they travel to face leaders Scunthorpe for the benefit of the Monday night TV cameras.","Jack Rodwell struggled against Watford and was substituted at half-time .

Ascot: A picture of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall sharing a joke at Royal Ascot has been chosen as the image for the couple's Christmas card this year. Last year's image was at the Diamond Jubilee . The Prince, who is pictured holding a racing programme, looks smart in an Anderson and Sheppard morning coat, a shirt by Turnbull and Asser and a top hat by Lock and Co. Printed on the cover of each Christmas card is the Prince of Wales' feathers and the Duchess' cipher and inside are the words 'Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year' with the photograph opposite surrounded by a thin red border. The couple attended the races in June this year. While her husband the Duke of Edinburgh . stayed at home to rest and recover from an 11-night stay in . hospital where he had exploratory abdominal surgery, the Queen was . joined in the horse-drawn procession by Charles and Camilla. Last year, the couple chose an image from the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

Charles and Camilla were on board the Spirit of Chartwell alongside the Queen, Prince Philip, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The Prince of Wales wore his Royal Navy admiral's ceremonial day dress uniform for the event, while the Duchess of Cornwall had braved the rain in an Anna Valentine coat and dress and a hat by Philip Treacy. The nautical spectacle, which was Prince Charles' suggestion, saw 1,000 vessels sail along the Thames watched by huge crowds lining the banks of the river. The ceremony kicked off a long bank holiday weekend of celebrations to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Politicians have also released this year's Christmas cards with Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband both putting their children centre stage.

Police have spent thousands of pounds sending suspected criminals home from the cells in taxis, it can be revealed today. Six forces across the country booked cabs for people after they were released while two others admitted getting police officers to drive them home. The figures sparked accusations that suspected are being pampered when they are booked into custody after being arrested on suspicion of criminal wrongdoing. Taxi service: Kent and South Wales Police officers drive suspects home from the cells, a MailOnline investigation has revealed . Officials claimed they had a duty of care to get 'criminals' home safely if they are released late at night rather than have them roaming the streets. Separately. the figures revealed that police forces spent £17million on fleets of hire cars last year for occasions when their own unmarked cars were unavailable. Scotland Yard was by far the biggest spender in the last financial year - blowing £9.2million on vehicles that included BMW, Audi, Mercedes and Alfa Romeo cars. The force spent £5.9million hiring . cars during the Olympics alone, according to figures released to the . MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act. Thames Valley Police were the next biggest spenders and shelled out £965,945 on hired vehicles. Police . in Dorset, Durham, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Suffolk and North Wales . all admitted using a slice of their hire car budget to pay taxi companies to drive . suspects home. In total, . they said they spent £13,592 on cabs for at least 828 suspects, with . North Wales Police blowing £4,151 on 318 journeys. Cab ride: Police forces in Dorset, Durham, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Suffolk and North Wales all admitted using a slice of their hire car budget to pay taxi companies to drive suspects home . All figures are for the 2012-13 financial year . Northamptonshire Police paid £3,143 on taxis to drive 336 people home from the cells. Kent and South Wales Police also admitted getting their own officers to drive people home. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the Taxpayers' Alliance said that police should not be running a taxi service. 'Taxpayers will be left wondering why one earth they are paying for a cab ride home for those who have been nicked,' he said. 'Unless there is a clear danger to someone’s welfare or an obvious mistake in the arrest then there is no need for police forces to cough up for rides. 'Ultimately the police should be able to use their digression but taxpayers would rather see coppers tackling crime, not acting as a taxi service.' A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said they only use taxis as a 'last resort'. 'We are required to complete a risk assessment for everyone released from custody to ensure their safety,' he said. 'Occasionally, it is necessary to use a local taxi service for those who may be more vulnerable, such as young people, particularly if they are released late at night when alternative transport is not available. 'This is a last resort when other options have been exhausted and, on many occasions, those released are taken to a nearby bus station rather than returning them home.' Deputy Chief Constable Gareth Pritchard said: 'North Wales Police consider the welfare of individuals who leave our custody. 'As part of this process there are occasions when those being released are transported from St Asaph to other locations to facilitate their journey. As St Asaph custody is isolated from the main public transport routes, the expenditure of the force is higher than other forces. 'The force considers that in specific circumstances such expenditure is justified to ensure the person being released has a safe journey. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said they currently have 126 hired vehicles. 'The Metropolitan Police Service hires vehicles to supplement its fleet when additional transport resources are required for increased short-term operational need,' he said.","Six police forces gave suspects taxis home from the cells after questioning .

Brandon McGraw, 33, a Marine from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, was pronounced dead in Euroa, Australia, after a freak accident during a skydiving excursion with his wife, Cherilyn. According to a report in The Jacksonville Daily News, McGraw, an Afghan War veteran, watched his wife do a tandem jump and then exited the plane. Scroll down for video .

In an interview with the newspaper, an employee of the skydiving school said McGraw’s jump was going fine until shortly before landing, when his parachute suddenly veered left and right and he slammed into the ground. The 33-year-old gunnery sergeant was pronounced dead on the scene at around 12.30pm local time after going into cardiac arrest. His wife was not injured. On January 16, 2012, Cherilyn McGraw went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and won the Stuff Your Down Under Pants contest, taking home a trip for two to Australia. A clip from the episode in which Mrs McGraw and her rivals had to stuff oversize 'pants' with balls shows the young woman clapping and jumping up and down following her victory. The Huntington couple, who got married in November 2011, made the long trip to Australia this past weekend with a stopover in New York City.

I bet her name is Angel.' Capt. Barry Morris, with Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, told the station WTKR that McGraw, an extreme sports enthusiast, was a well-trained and experienced skydiver with many jumps under his belt. The 33-year-old had served both in Iraq and Afghanistan, and had just returned from his third tour of duty. He was assigned to Company G, 2d Marine Special Operations Battalion stationed in Camp Lejeune. Neighbor William Sidberry told WWAY3 that McGraw was a very friendly and open person who loved serving his country.

Joyous day: The couple married in November 2011 and lived in Huntington, North Carolina . On her Facebook page, the Marine’s inconsolable widow eulogized her husband, calling him her ‘hero’ and ‘angel.’ She also shared Brandon’s haunting final photos showing him grinning aboard the plane before his fateful skydive. ‘These are truly such symbolic photos,’ she wrote. ‘He was happy and doing what he loved. It's amazing all that photos can capture in a moments time… I love you more than anything in the world, honey. You are the most amazing man.’ Less than a week before his tragic death, Brandon McGraw wrote a long post on his Facebook account in memory of seven Marines, among them several close friends from his unit, who died in a December 8, 1999 helicopter crash. Grief-stricken: Cherilyn remembered her late husband as her 'hero' and 'angel' in a touching Facebook post . ‘Less than 2 years later 9-11 happened and ushered in 10 years of combat and a lot of casualties, so this small incident has been largely forgotten - but I shall never forget,’ the sergeant wrote. McGraw's death marks the first fatality in the 30-year history of the Euroa Skydive, an Australian skydiving school. Ian Matthew, who works for the school, said the American skydiving enthusiast and his wife had the required training and proper documentation necessary for a solo jump. Although the cause of the deadly crash remains under investigation, Australian news media have suggested that windy conditions may have played a role.","Brandon McGraw, 33, was pronounced dead after slamming to the ground in Euroa, Australia .

Notorious gangster John Gilligan has been shot while celebrating a family christening at his brother's house. The drug lord was targeted at the home in Clondalkin, near Dublin, at about 7pm on Saturday night. It is understood the 61-year-old was with family and friends in the house when two masked gunmen tried to force their way inside. Accused: Drug baron John Gilligan was released from prison last year for a cannabis trafficking scheme. He had denied and was acquitted of the murder of the journalist Victoria Guerin . Gilligan is believed to have locked himself in a downstairs toilet as the attackers got inside. Up to four shots were fired in the attempted murder, Irish police said. Gilligan was hit at least twice, suffering bullet wounds to his shoulder or upper chest area and also another bullet wound in one of his legs. Shot dead: Journalist Veronica Guerin. Gilligan was tried for her murder and was acquitted . Gardai said that two men forced their way into the gangster's brother's house on Greenfort Crescent where the day-long christening celebrations had been taking place. Both men were armed and wearing masks. Gilligan was treated at the scene and then taken to Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown with what police described as 'non-fatal' injuries. The attackers fled the scene in a silver SUV or 4x4 type vehicle, detectives believe. The crime boss, who was released from jail last year after being convicted of a multi-million euro cannabis trafficking operation in the 1990s, is understood to have been recently warned of threats to his life. It had also been reported that a gunman attempted to shoot him in a pub in north Dublin several weeks after his release. Gilligan was freed from Portlaoise Prison last October after being jailed in 2001. He had been arrested in 1996 after being stopped by UK Customs officers with IRÂ£296,000 in a suitcase as he attempted to get on a plane for Amsterdam at London's Heathrow Airport. Within hours of his release Gilligan repeatedly denied the murder of Ms Guerin, a crime journalist with the Sunday Independent, who was shot dead in 1996. He had been tried for and acquitted of her murder.","John Gilligan, 61, was targeted at brother's house in Clondalkin, near Dublin .

It became clear Mr Booth was suffering from Alzheimer’s when he became  forgetful and suffered short-term memory loss. Tony Booth is being cared for by wife Stephanie (left) who says Cherie (right) is a 'constant source of support' Illness: Mr Booth was diagnosed in 2004 and wife Stephanie said she is struggling to care for him . The effects of the condition made it impossible for Mr Booth, who played ‘Scouse Git’ Mike Rawlins in the 1960’s and 1970’s sit-com Till Death Do Us Part, to learn scripts, Mrs Booth said. She wrote in the Irish Times: ‘We are at the stage where he cannot look after himself. Tony’s forgetfulness is now the greatest threat to his safety. ‘There are dark times when I feel I can no longer cope. It is hard to repeat the same answer again and again as if each time were the first response to the question.’ ‘Tony is leaving me and I will not get him back. Hopefully, we are still some way off Tony completely retreating into the hinterland of his mind.

A dull grey line drawing, unearthed in the US Patent Office, could be the blueprint for the cheap iPhone that Apple has always denied it's going to make. Patent Number 8,364,032 was filed by Apple with the US Patent Office in February last year, and granted late last month. The patent covers a device with a front-facing screen, a rear-facing camera and a plastic body - with no iconic home button. Groundbreaking: Patent Number 8,364,032 doesn't look like much, but it could herald Apple's entry to the low-cost market in China . Flagship: Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, launched the now iconic iPhone 5 in San Francisco last autumn . Queueing: Eager customers wait to get in to a newly opened Apple store in Beijing - but analysts say Apple is missing the boat in the important Chinese market . But don't hold your breath if you'd like to snap up this phone: if this is indeed the cheap iPhone that has been rumoured, it is likely to be for the customers in emerging markets such as China and India. The flagship iPhone 5 was launched amid much fanfare at the end of last year. But the iPhone 5's maps were a disaster. Apple had dropped Google's polished and more Maps app in favour of its own. And the problems quickly emerged, with the new maps directing drivers on to airport runways, missing churches in Milan, and even a missing bay in Ukraine. Chief executive Tim Cook apologised, saying: 'We strive to make world-class products that deliver the best experience possible to our customers. With the launch of our new Maps last week, we fell short on this commitment. Scott Forstall, the executive in charge of Maps, was quickly fired. Apple has in the past concentrated on making expensive hardware for high-value customers, making the bulk of its profits from selling hardware. But analysts have said that the Californian firm should make a cheaper smartphone to gain more of a foothold in the important Chinese market. Apple's grip on the smartphone market has weakened - researchers IDC said that in the third quarter of 2012, it had accounted for only 14.6 per cent of worldwide smartphone shipments, down from 23 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2012. Rumours about a cheaper version of the iPhone have been circulating for some time, and what we know from the patent application seems to fit: the plastic body mentioned in the patent would keep costs down. The cheaper version could be powered by the lower-cost Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, and wouldn't have the very high-quality 'Retina' screen. A cheap iPhone for emerging markets would be a departure from the Californian giant's previous strategy. However, Phil Schiller, senior vice-president of marketing, told the Shanghai Evening News: 'Every product that Apple creates, we consider using only the best technology available. 'Despite the popularity of cheap smartphones, this will never be the future of Apple's products. But Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, told the Chinese state-run Xinhua News last month: 'China is currently our second largest market. I believe it will become our first. I believe strongly that it will.'","Patent application reveals the move to a cheap plastic body .

His 'Bronson Special' - the Costa Del Asylum - features the prisoner lying on a hammock in bright colours . His surreal images, mostly depicting his 40 years behind bars, have sold for thousands of pounds over the years . The 61-year-old has spent the last 40 years in jail - save just four months and nine days between crimes - with 36 of those years spend in solitary confinement due to his 'aggression' and serial hostage taking. During his time in solitary, Bronson's 'greatest pleasure' was sketching and painting hundreds of artworks, many of which depict his life 'inside his cage'. The pieces have attracted praise, winning him 11 awards from the Koestler Trust, a prison arts charity. One painting has even been displayed at Angel Tube station in London - a move that provoked sharp criticism from the National Victims Association. But on Wednesday, Bronson proclaimed he has stopped drawing after prison chiefs at maximum security HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire banned him from sending work out because it is being sold on 'for a profit'. Members of the Charles Bronson Appeal Fund claim his work supports charities and helps him calm down . Many of the works are cartoons that tell the story of his numerous crimes, including detaining an art teacher . He has received acclaim for his sketches, with one of his works (right) displayed at Angel Station, London . Supporters of Bronson - whose donated pictures have raised tens of thousands of pounds for charities - have warned there could be consequences if he is now sitting idle in his cell with nothing to do. A spokesman for the Charlie Bronson Appeal Fund said on Wednesday: 'We have a very important message from Charlie. 'According to Woodhill staff, someone wrote in saying they had sold a piece of his art for charity. 'Subsequently, they stopped anything containing art from going out. 'Charlie has asked us to let people know that he will not be writing any more letters at all, and is sending no mail while this is the case. 'He now has even more time on his hands as he is not doing any art or writing or replying to letters. 'We'd like to ask the obvious - that people don't write to Charlie asking for art or advising him of art sold. It may be for the best of intentions but does not help Charlie in his position.' Despite being in maximum security HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire, he has recently been deemed less violent . It is the second time Bronson, who spent 36 years in solitary confinement, is banned from sharing his work . Dozens of his paintings were approved by Transport for London to hang in Underground stations . The convict, who has spent just four months and nine days free since 1974, claims his violence is behind him . Tom Hardy's 2009 portrayal showed a violent streak, that supporters warn could be provoked by the ban . It is the second time HMP Woodhill officials have barred Bronson from sending out his work, after a brief ban in 2010. Whenever he is banned from drawing he is known to take 'a turn for the worse', supporters claim. Despite being held at maximum security HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire, the muscle-bound convict, who is said to do 2,000 push-ups a day, claims his violent days ended more than a decade ago - and recently passed a Violence Reduction Programme. However, supporters are worried the ban will set him on edge. A source said: 'Charlie uses art and writing as a way to relax - he needs to be creative to keep a lid on things, so this ban is not helpful at all.' Writing recently, Bronson said: 'My days of violence and crime ended well over a decade ago. 'I could make a good living out of my art.'","'Britain's most violent prisoner' has 11 awards for his colourful sketches .

Kim was released into the custody of his sister, who lives in Massachusetts, and an uncle from North Carolina. Attorneys aren’t saying where he will stay. Under the conditions of his release, he cannot enter Harvard’s campus without prior approval of Harvard and the federal court, other than to retrieve his belongings with an escort. This morning, Kim was led into court in . handcuffs and wearing dark sweatpants with 'Harvard' written down the left leg and a gray T-shirt. Mr Gold, a federal public defender, said Kim was dealing with the pressure of finals and the third anniversary of the death of his father, a professor at a South Korean university.

On Saturday night, Kim sent an email over his dorm Listserv, The Harvard Crimson reported. ‘I was wondering if anyone had taken GOV 1368: The Politics of American Education (Paul Peterson) in the past,’ Kim wrote in the email. ‘I have several quick questions about the course.’ Too busy? While he's been extremely active in extracurricular since high school--he played the viola, played tennis and swam, and more recently danced in a Harvard dance troupe--Kim's confession indicates he'd spread himself a little thin and went to extreme measures to catch up .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:37 EST, 18 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:45 EST, 18 December 2013 . A presidential advisory panel has recommended sweeping limits on the government's surveillance programs, including requiring a court to sign off on individual searches of phone records. It also recommends stripping the National Security Agency (NSA) of its ability to store that data from Americans. It was unclear how the 40 recommended changes, if enacted, would impact the scope of the vast government surveillance programs. Presidential task force: An independent advisory panel ordered by President Obama on Wednesday recommended 40 changes to the NSA's surveillance programs . While President Barack Obama ordered the review board to submit recommendations following government spying disclosures earlier this year, he is under no obligation to accept the proposals. The White House authorized the release of the review group's report Wednesday, weeks ahead of schedule. The president was also conducting an internal review of the government's surveillance programs and planned to announce his decisions in January. The review board's proposals address the government's ability to collect intelligence both in the United States and overseas. The recommendations include tightening federal law enforcement's use of so-called national security letters, which give the government sweeping authority to demand financial and phone records without prior court approval in national security cases. The task force recommended that authorities should be required to obtain a prior ‘judicial finding’ showing ‘reasonable grounds’ that the information sought is relevant to terrorism or other intelligence activities. The panel was created amid a political firestorm that followed leaks last summer by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Leaks: The task force was created amid a political firestorm that followed leaks last summer by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden . The disclosures triggered outrage among civil libertarians and many members of Congress, who considered the degree of data collection an overreach of post-9/11 anti-terror efforts. Leaks about surveillance and a secret court that works with the NSA put enormous pressure on Obama, who came into office promising a more transparent government. Key members of Congress are considering changes to programs under the Patriot Act law to restrict NSA snooping programs. 'The message is very clear,' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said following the report's release. 'NSA, you've gone too far, according to CNN. Leahy mentioned the section in law allowing telephone data collection 'was not essential to preventing attacks,' according to the report. That directly contradicts national security officials, who have said the authority had helped thwart terror plots both in the United States and abroad. 'Just because we can collect massive amounts of data doesn't mean we should do so,' Leahy said. 'Gone too far': Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy says telephone data collection is not essential to preventing attacks . International spying: The panel also tackled the diplomatic furor over NSA spying on the leaders of allied nations, including Brazil's president, Dilma Rousseff . In addition, the panel proposed terminating the NSA's ability to store telephone data and instead require it to be held by the phone companies or a third party. Access to the data would then be permitted only through an order from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. ‘With regard to the bulk metadata of phone calls, we think there should be judicial review before that information is accessed and we don't think the government should retain it,’ said Richard Clarke, a member of the five-person panel. If both recommendations were enacted, it's likely they would slow down the intelligence collection process. The panel recommendations do allow for exceptions ‘in emergencies’, leaving open the possibility of intelligence agencies scanning the information quickly and asking for permission later if they suspect imminent attack. Although the task force did not recommend ending any of the NSA's daily sweeps of telephone and Internet data, as some critics urged, a senior lawyer for one influential privacy advocate group said the review group's recommendations would amount to ‘sweeping’ changes in government policy if Obama accepts them in bulk. The recommendations ‘will fuel the NSA reform effort both within the administration and in Congress’, said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel with the Center for Democracy and Technology. The panel also tackled the diplomatic furor over NSA spying on the leaders of allied nations, including Germany. Furious: Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, almost cut political ties with the US when she discovered her phone had been tapped . Michael Morell, a task force member and former deputy director of the CIA, says the panel is not trying to disarm the intelligence community . The group recommended that the president personally approve such spying and that the decisions be based in part on whether the United States shares ‘fundamental values and interests’ with the leaders of those nations. ‘Just because we can doesn't mean we should,’ Clarke said. Panel members said they did not think any of the recommendations would harm U.S. national security. ‘We are not in any way recommending the disarming of the intelligence community,’ said Michael Morell, a task force member and former deputy director of the CIA. ‘We're not saying struggle against terrorism is over.","An independent advisory panel ordered by President Obama recommended 40 changes to the surveillance programs Wednesday .

He grabbed the victim by the throat, before repeatedly punching him - causing him to fall to the ground with blood pouring down his face. Shockingly, Partridge, who is 6ft 3in tall and tattooed, put so much weight behind each blow that his own feet left the floor, according to eyewitnesses.

'He said: ""Stop taking picture of my car. You're going to pay for what you've done - I'm going to kill you"". 'He then closed the distance between us and grabbed my throat in a choking grip, lifting me onto the balls of my feet, before pushing me into a bramble bush.'

Sherrie Nixon of the little town of Quitman was caught completely off guard Monday when federal authorities arrested her son Chris Nixon just four hours after their Manhunt began. ‘It’s really hard for me to deal with this right now,’ said the weeping mother of an accused child predator. Accused: Chris Nixon is charged with taping a sex act with a 6 to 10 year old using his cell phone. The 20-year-old Louisiana man's mother has been left emotionally devastated by the news . 'I never expected this': A home in Quitman, Louisiana, where the accused pedophile's  mother wept and was nearly speechless when reporters arrived Tuesday . Chris Nixon was arrested after Homeland Security investigators quickly received 50 tips from concerned citizens identifying him as the pale, dark haired John Doe in the suspect’s photos. ‘I never expected this,’ Sherrie told a KNOE reporter as she shooed her from her home. ‘Just get my dog in the house and let me go lay down.' Chris Nixon stands accused of sexually abusing prepubescent minor between 6 and 10 years old and taking video of the crime using a cell phone camera. Nixon is accused of sexually abusing two victims in northern Louisiana. The 20-year-old was being held Wednesday as prosecutors sought to deny him bond. Meanwhile, neighbors who say they knew him well are nearly as shocked as the young man's mother . ‘This is a person who we have video evidence has molested a child, and let's be very clear about what this is, this is child rape,’ Public Affairs Officer for the Department of Homeland Security Bryan Cox told KSLA. Canadian authorities were first to discover videos online taken February 2012 and March of 2012 of at least two victims. GPS coordinates embedded in the videos pointed to the Jonesboro area of Louisiana. Authorities first used traditional investigative methods to try to find the suspect. When that failed, they turned to the public for help, making a public plea and setting up a tip line. In fewer than four hours, investigators had received 50 tips and had arrested Nixon at his home near Jonesboro. Nixon made his first appearance in a Shreveport federal court on Tuesday and is expected back in court for a detention hearing on Thursday.

Sol Campbell has branded the Football Association institutionally racist and claimed that he would have been England captain for 10 years if he had been white. The former Tottenham, Arsenal and Portsmouth defender, who won 73 caps with England, makes the claim in his autobiography, which is published later this month. In it, he says he was overlooked for the captaincy because of the colour of his skin. Campbell said: 'I believe that if I was white I would have been England captain for 10 years. 'I don't think it [the situation] will change because they don't want it. It's all right to have a black or mixed race captain of the Under 18s or Under 21s but not for the full national side. 'There is a ceiling and, although no one has ever said it, I believe it's made of glass. 'Michael Owen was made captain ahead of me and I thought, ""What's going on here?"" I think the FA didn't want me to have a voice. 'Owen was a fantastic forward but nowhere near being a captain. I've asked myself many times why I wasn't [named captain]. I keep coming up with the same answer. It was the colour of my skin.' Campbell was England captain for three friendly games in 1998 and 2005 but never received the captaincy long term. Paul .

Former FA executive director David Davies, who was at the organisation when Campbell was a player, said he was 'surprised' by the former defender's allegations and believed they were 'wrong'. 'I am surprised by this because the reality is that in my time the managers selected the captain,' he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. 'I never - and to my knowledge nobody else in the FA - ever sought to influence them. 'My belief is (the allegations) are wrong. I also have to say I am quite proud, along with a number of people of that era, of setting up (anti-discrimination campaign group) Kick It Out in football .

AKA Jeff Gillooly: In 1994, Jeff Stone--who then went by Jeff Gillooly--helped mastermind the attack on Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan to help improve his wife Tonya Harding's chances as winning gold . The ex-husband of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding has given a rare interview as the 20 year anniversary of the scandal approaches early next year. Jeff Gillooly, who now goes by Jeff Stone, is the same man who went to jail for masterminding the 1994 Detroit attack on Nancy Kerrigan, but he seems more remorseful about how Harding’s life has turned out two decades later. ‘She'll never be remembered for how wonderful a figure skater she was,’ he said. ‘She'll be remembered for what I talked her into doing.’ Stone, who remains in the Oregon town . of Clackamas, after returning there when he was released from a . two-year stint in prison in 1995, sat for a rare interview with Amy K. Nelson for the blog Deadspin. ‘The . most common question I'm ever asked, if it comes up, ""Do you regret . what you did?""’ said Stone. ‘I guess that's kind of a yes-and-a-no . question. Yes, it was pretty darn stupid.’ But . Stone goes on to describe a his happy life as a family man with a wife . and kids. And he seems to believe the 1994 scandal helped him to get . there. ‘What's there to regret,’ he wondered. ‘Not much.’ He’s . also not totally taking the blame, though, despite Tonya Harding’s . years of denying she had any knowledge of what Gillooly and his . associates, Shane Stant, who carried out the attack, and . co-conspirators, Shawn Eckhardt and Derrick Smith were planning. 'What's there to regret? Not much': Gillooly is pictured here in 1994 in a court hearing involving the case. Now on his third marriage and raising tow daughters, he says he regrets little . 'We decided to do something really stupid there, and it ruined her': Gillooly was sentenced to two years in prison but says his biggest regret is helping ruin Harding's career . ‘We,’ he said, ‘absolutely rode her career. She was the best figure skater—women's figure skater—that ever lived.’ And he insists Harding knew what was being planned. ‘Of course she did. I think most people know that she did,’ he said. Though he seems to think he’s in a far better place than his ex-wife these days. 'Whack heard round the world': Here, Kerrigan wails 'Why me?' after being clubbed in the knee at a Detroit skating practice. The attack began one of the most infamous sagas in sports history . 'Of course she knew': Harding (at right in 1994 and at left much more recently) maintains that she had no knowledge that the attack was happening, but Stone says she gave the okay . Kerrigan, seen here in 2004, sat for an upcoming NBC documentary on the attack that will air during the 2014 Winter Olympics in February . ‘She's . a very unhappy person, from what I can tell,’ he said. ‘I occasionally . see her on television and I kind of see—I've read some stories in the . paper about what her personal life has become and the trouble she's got . there, and it's just sad to me.’ Harding . and Stone divorced in 1993, according to the piece in Deadspin, . reconciled prior to the Kerrigan attack and then split for good . thereafter. Stone and Harding sold a sex tape and stills of themselves to Penthouse for $200,000 plus residuals in June of 1994. Now in her 40’s, married for a third time and with a two-year-old son, Harding says she’s turned to motivational speaking. Stone . recounts in the interview how Jeff Gillooly became a punch line on late . night television, Far Side comics, Saturday Night Live and even on . Family Guy. NBC and . ESPN are planning to air competing Nancy Kerrigan/Tonya Harding . documentaries during the upcoming Sochi Winter Olympics as a nod to the . anniversary of the January 6, 1994 attack.

Authorities across the Channel have decreed that the English term 'sexting' is to be henceforth known in French as 'textopornographie'. L’Académie française made its pronouncement earlier this month, ruling also that the imported gerund's associated noun, 'sext', must to French speakers become 'texto pornographique'. And if that's a bit of a mouthful for heavy breathing French lovers the Académie has also suggested a ready-made contraction, 'sexto'. 'Ooh la la! Un sexto!' Sexting, or textopornographie, is the act of sending sexually explicit messages and photographs, usually between mobile phones, that has become popular with the rise of portable technology . The decision came among a wave of . rulings that proposed new French terms for 'prenuptial agreement', . 'happy slapping' and 'child grooming'. L’Académie française, which is . France's linguistic watchdog, has been fighting a long war against the . infiltration of English terms and idioms, advising countrymen to replace such . words as 'le weekend' with 'le fin de la semaine' and so on.

The English term, a portmanteau of sex . and texting, first rose to popularity in the early 21st century. As . the spread of technology encouraged the risque practice around the . world, many languages adopted the word too. But France's authorities . have now decided to crack down on its usage. Technology . has proved a potent Trojan horse for smuggling English words into French, previously spurring authorities to invent new terms . for email (courriel), software (logiciel) and walkman (baladeur). Last . year, they famously ruled that the Twitter-inspired term 'hashtag' be . replaced with the more elegantly French version 'mot-dièse' L’Académie . française was founded in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, then chief . minister to King Louis the XIII, as the preeminent authority on matters . pertaining to the French language.

Other English words and terms given a Gallic reinterpretation included 'child pornography', which is now 'pédopornographie'; 'child grooming', which became 'pédopiégeage'; 'happy slapping', which was given the more appropriate-sounding description 'vidéoagression'; and 'prenuptial agreement' is now 'accord prénuptial'. The French Government commissioned a report into English usage three years ago, which warned that the global domination of Anglo-Saxon culture had plunged the future of the French language into a 'deep crisis'. The report said: 'English-speakers have a vision of the so-called English-speaking world, but an equivalent concept does not seem to exist in France.

Use of the extremely common ADHD medication Ritalin can cause dangerously long-lasting, unwanted erections with long-term use. The Food and Drug Administration released a statement Tuesday announcing it will update its priapism, a condition that can permanently damage a patient's penis. The stimulant drug in Ritalin, methylphenidate, is also found in the brand names Daytrana and Concerta--an extended release version often prescribed to adutls--among many others. Possible side effects: Ritalin is one of many commonly prescribed stimulant medications that the FDA now warns causes a dangerous, long-lasting medical condition called priapism . Priapism is a long-lasting, sometimes painful erection that can last for several hours. The condition occurs when blood becomes trapped in the penis. The FDA says patients taking a methylphenidate product who experienced priapism ranged in age from 8 to 33 years old. Patients experiencing priapism should see a doctor immediately. If left untreated, the condition can cause permanent scarring and erectile dysfunction. The agency warned people to talk to their doctors before halting the drugs and said priapism has only occurred from use of methylphenidate in rare cases. Despite the condition's rarity, the shear popularity of drugs like Ritalin make it a cause for concern. According to the New York Times, sales of stimulant ADHD medications have more than doubled since 2007, from $4 billion to a whopping $9 billion in 2012. Parents should discuss warning signs with younger boys using the stimulants, who who may be embarrassed to talk about the symptoms. Medical help should be sought for patients on the stimulant who develop erections lasting longer than four hours. ADHD is a common disorder that hampers a one's ability to pay attention and control behavior. Medications that use the stimulant can help increase focus and reduce impulsivity in patients. The FDA said patients taking a methylphenidate product who experienced priapism ranged in age from 8 to 33 years old, with a median age of 12 and a half. Priapism happens when blood becomes trapped in the penis, leading to abnormally long-lasting erections. ADHD treatments have received FDA scrutiny before. Isolated reports of heart attacks and strokes in kids taking the drugs caused worry and prompted a study a few years ago that concluded the treatments don't raise the risk of serious heart problems. Commonly prescribed: The possible side effect of Ritalin and other drugs containing methylphenidate is rare. However, the sale of such stimulant medication has spiked in recent years, meaning more patients need to be aware of the the potential risks .","The FDA says ong-term use of the medication used to treat ADHD can cause a potentially serious medical condition called priapism .

"By . Ralph Ellis . PUBLISHED: . 19:33 EST, 2 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 22:13 EST, 2 March 2014 . Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football... with some star turns and a look through the leagues, too. This week includes Adam Johnson's nightmare League Cup final, Arsene Wenger's error in dropping Mathieu Flamini for the trip to Stoke and Fulham's managerial woes. 1) Arsene Wenger’s decision to leave Mathieu Flamini out of the team at Stoke forced Jack Wilshere to take a deeper role – meaning the England star effectively played with the handbrake on. Nearly half of the passes he played were in Arsenal’s half of the field, and he failed to create a single chance for a team mate before going off nine minutes from the end. Handbrake on: Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere played a deeper role against Stoke and was ultimately ineffective . Error: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger decided to leave Mathieu Flamini on the bench on Saturday . It was the first time in ten matches that Wilshere has not either made a chance or had a goal attempt of his own. 2) Adam Johnson has been the catalyst for Sunderland’s best form of late and looked as if he could be a Wembley star when he set up Fabio Borini’s early goal. After that, though, he suffered a nightmare against his former Manchester City team mates. They tightened up on him so much that by the time he went off with half an hour to go he had found a team mate with only two other passes. In all he only touched the ball 21 times, losing possession on 13 of those occasions, and got in just one cross. Assistance: Adam Johnson (left) congratulates Fabio Borini after setting the frontman up against Man City . Crowded out: After his side's opener, Johnson failed to get the into the game which Sunderland went onto lose . 3) Joe Allen has never really established himself at Liverpool since he followed Brendan Rodgers from Swansea as the first big buy of his management reign. If anything stops the 23-year-old from making it at Anfield, though, it won’t be lack of effort. Given his first start of 2014 at Southampton, EA Sports stats show he ran 7.9miles during 90 minutes of effort to contribute to the 3-0 win. No player in any Saturday’s Premier League games went further, and his total of 63 sprints was only matched by Chelsea’s hat-trick hero Andre Schurrle. Workhorse: Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen (right) covered more miles than any Premier League player on Saturday . 4) It’s just like old times in the North West – a 4-1 win for United and a good performance by somebody called Neville. That won’t be any comfort for David Moyes, though.  It was FC United of Manchester who beat Droylsden at Gigg Lane in front of a crowd of nearly 2,000, to move into the play-off places in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League. The Neville was left winger Lee who made a telling contribution as a second half substitute - but is no relation to Gary or Phil. 5) Fulham have suffered from some odd management decisions all season and it looks as if Felix Magath has dropped straight into the pattern. Lewis Holtby was not only his best player in his first match in charge at West Brom, but also helped the boss by translating the manager’s instructions from German. His reward was to be left on the subs bench against Chelsea – getting on only for the final 28 minutes when although he created a chance it was too late to rescue the game. Struggles: Fulham manager Felix Magath (left) trudges off the Craven Cottage pitch on Saturday . 6) Cardiff owner Vincent Tan has praised Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for bringing in seven new players for an outlay of just £6million during the January transfer window. Clearly you get what you pay for. Solskjaer used all of his new boys and started five of them in the 4-0 thrashing by Hull a week ago. By this weekend he’d axed all but Cala and Fabio from his starting line-up at Tottenham with only Kenwyne Jones and Mats Daehli coming off the bench – and Fabio was one of the players he subbed. The 1-0 reverse at Spurs meant the Bluebirds (or is it Redbirds these days?) suffered their fifth defeat in seven Premier League games since the former Manchester United star took charge.

The former Liverpool and Villa star should at least be given credit, though, for being brave enough to give defender Danny Baath his first team chance amid the wreckage of a disastrous campaign. The 23-year-old has grown from there as the cornerstone of Kenny Jackett’s team this season, and was excellent in the 3-0 win over Port Vale that put the club top of the table.  He is the only ever-present in 32 League One games so far. 8) Chris Martin’s red card in Derby’s defeat at Burnley might mean striker Conor Sammon finally gets the chance to start a game when Steve McClaren picks his side to face Millwall at home next week. The lanky Irishman, 27, came on as a half time sub at Burnley as former England boss McClaren tried to orchestrate a fightback before his ten men ultimately lost 2-0. If the former Wigan star does get to play next week it will be only his second start of the season – despite coming on as substitute an incredible 27 times. 9) Middlesbrough will be leading the campaign for goal-line technology in the Championship as well as the Premier League as their barren run now stretches to more than 700 minutes without scoring. Tough times: Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka has seen his side go without a goal for over 700 minutes . Jacob Butterfield thought he’d brought the wait to an end with a 20-yard drive against Sheffield Wednesday which appeared to go a foot over the line. Sadly for Boro boss Aitor Karanka, who last saw his team score back on January 18th, ref Andy D’Urso had to accept the advice of his assistant Paul Hodkinson who didn’t give the goal. Just to make matters worse for Boro they ended up losing to another controversial decision when Dean Whitehead was sent off for handling Leon Best’s shot on the line, and Atdhe Nuhiu scored the resultant penalty. 10) Plymouth’s board were brave when they stuck by John Sheridan early in the season – they were just two points above the relegation zone in October after losing to ten-man Hartlepool. They have got their reward in a sustained run of form since – and Saturday’s 5-0 thrashing of Morecambe made it four wins in the last five games. A crowd of nearly 7,000 saw Lewis Alessandra score twice and the Pilgrims are now two points outside the League Two play-off zone with a game in hand over seventh placed Southend.","Adam Johnson failed to make a big enough impact in the League Cup final .

From peacock blue Manolo Blahnik spikes to towering Sergio Rossi, the stars of Sex and the City were as famous for their footwear and they were for their exploits in and out of bed. Now, Kristin Davis, the actress who played conservative Charlotte, has spoken out against the cult of the high heel and has apologised to fans for encouraging them to squeeze their feet into uncomfortable shoes. But her confession isn't entirely out of character: with flats now the stylish shoe of choice, Davis seems as fashion-savvy as ever. Scroll down for video . Popular: Davis, seen here with her SATC co-stars, says she regrets encouraging women into heels . 'I do feel guilt about the heels,' said the 49-year-old star. 'It did seem we were trying to say to women, ""You should be wearing heels like these"". Speaking in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Davis added: 'But we definitely weren’t. Were they beautiful shoes? Yes. Were they appropriate for the characters? Yes, that’s what women like that wear. 'But it became a bigger picture thing, where it seemed women should be wearing them every day.' Although her stance might come as a shock to TV fans, flats have been steadily gaining ground on heels and are currently the stylish shoe of choice, as Davis, who says she only wears flats, is all too well aware. So fashionable are flats, Karl Lagerfeld sent all of his models down the runway in trainers during January's round of couture shows in Paris, while off the catwalk, stylish flats have been embraced by everyone from Rihanna and Cara Delevigne to Home Secretary Theresa May. What's more, orthopaedic style flats such as Birkenstock sandals have been deemed the hottest shoe for summer, along with the equally sturdy pool slider. Seal of approval: Karl Lagerfeld accessorised every outfit with trainers during the Chanel couture show . Stylish: The Duchess of Cambridge in her taupe Mint Velvet canvas plimsolls and favourite J Brand skinny jeans . Stylish: Alexa Chung shows off her fashion savvy in a chic pair of buckled flat pumps . Other popular choices include the brogue, especially in sunny pastel shades, and the loafer. Even the humble ballet pump and the equally low key plimsoll are enjoying a new lease of life, with the Duchess of Cambridge choosing a pair of the latter to wear on the plane en route to a holiday in Mustique. Since Sex and the City ended in 2004, Davis has had something of a chequered career, with roles in rom coms such as the badly-received Couples Retreat interspersed with stints voicing children's cartoons and a guest appearance on Project Runway. Her latest project will see her star as Beth Gallagher in a stage adaption of Fatal Attraction, scheduled to begin at London's Haymarket Theatre this month. Nevertheless, she remains best known for her Sex and the City character Charlotte and her impressive wardrobe of sky high heels. 'I . wear heels so rarely now,' she added. 'It hurts when I do – you have to . get in training for them, and it takes a lot of practice.' And Davis isn't the only former Sex and the City to swear off heels. Last year, co-star Sarah Jessica Parker revealed that she had been forced to give up her spikes because of damage to her feet. Speaking . to Net-a-Porter's in-house magazine, Parker said: 'I went to a foot . doctor and he said, ""Your foot does things it shouldn’t be able to do. That bone there – you’ve created that bone.

Elle's love for The Voice star began in 1986 when she first saw her appear in an episode of Aussie TV show The Henderson Kids, and since then, she's seen her idol perform more than 100 times. The stalking awareness campaigner from Portsmouth has also managed to meet Kylie an impressive 20 times and says the star is 'one of the nicest people you could meet'. Super-fan: Elle Richardson has spent more than £150,000 amassing a vast collection of Kylie memorabilia . 'Kylie is one of the nicest people you could ever meet,' she reveals, 'as she doesn't come across as a diva or a superstar - she always has time for her fans.' Devoted Elle spends £700 at every concert, adding to her haul of books, clothes, badges, beach balls, Easter eggs and calendars by approaching the souvenir stand and asking for 'one of everything'. She buys all of Kylie's singles several times over because they have different artwork and even different barcodes depending on the country where they're released. 'I remember reading a magazine and seeing all the different artwork for the same single around the world and that's when my collection started because I wanted everything,' she remembers. Expensive: Elle spends £700 on merchandise such as posters and keyrings every time she goes to a concert . Rare: Among the items in her collection is one of the 12"" singles for the Locomotion released in Sweden . Great day: Elle with Kylie outside the ITV studios in 2007 - she has met her 20 times . 'I bought CDs, records, cassettes in all the different covers, mixes, and even different barcodes. I was spending hours and hours searching for different items which were rare and no-one else could find.' Among rare items in Elle's vast collection is a hand-signed 12"" Swedish withdrawn record of her hit Locomotion - one of only a handful that exist. Other highlights from the collection, which is so large, some of it has to be kept in storage, are replicas of the dresses used in the 1988 video Got to be Certain. A more personal treasure is a 21st birthday card signed to the super-fan with love from Kylie Minogue. The 35-year old added: 'I started liking her when I was eight years old after a family friend sent over a video of a wedding and at the end of the tape was a couple of episodes of The Henderson Kids, which she was in. 'I remember seeing her character and being able to relate to it. A couple of months later I saw her star in Neighbours and started to follow her through her acting and music career. She added: 'I then went to see her first show in the UK in 1989 when she starred alongside the likes of Sinitta, Sonia and Jason Donovan - I absolutely loved it, it was a magical memory. 'I have seen her on every UK tour and sometimes I stay over to see more than one of her show dates. Prized possession: Elle with a 21st birthday card sent to her by the singer and signed 'with love from Kylie' Merchandise: Elle's collection has grown so large, some of it now has to be kept in storage . 'Whenever I go to her concerts now I go to the merchandise stand and ask for one of everything they have - bags, books, key rings, hoodies - the lot. It costs me nearly £700 pounds a time. 'I have never really understood why I collect it but she is definitely an inspirational person and very down to earth. Unsurprisingly, Elle is also a fan of BBC talent show, The Voice, which this week managed to see off Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway to become one of the weekend's most viewed shows.

A budget hotel is being used to accommodate patients at a leading London hospital in a bid to free up beds. The Premier Inn in Hampstead is being used to house patients at the Royal Free Hospital - at a cost of £500,00 over the last two years. Figures have revealed that the hospital’s use of the hotel as a makeshift ward has increased dramatically in less than three years. The Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead is putting patients up in a local Premier Inn, new figures have revealed . Due to pressure on beds, doctors at the Royal Free are being asked to assess whether patients need hospital-level care or whether they are well enough to stay in the hotel, the Ham&High reports. Figures made available to the local paper revealed that in 2010 262 patients stayed at the Premier Inn. In 2012 and 2013 the total figure was 1,900. As a result, the cost of hotel rooms has risen from just over £40,000 in 2010 to more than £500,000 in 2012 and 2013 combined. The hotel has confirmed that it has seen a ‘significant’ rise in the number of patients the hospital is sending to them. Managers at the hotel, in Haverstock Hill, also explained that the rooms the hospital uses have no extra access to emergency equipment than any other room does. In 2012 and 2013 the London hospital spent £500,000 putting 1,900 patients up in the budget hotel . The Royal Free says it only uses the Premier Inn (pictured) for the convenience and comfort of patients . Despite this, the Royal Free argues that the strategy does not affect the quality of care received by patients. They say they offer hotel rooms purely for the convenience of patients who live a long way from the hospital so are not able to easily go home for the night. A spokesperson said: ‘The Royal Free offers a range of specialist services and our patients travel from all over the UK to receive treatment. 'Some of the treatment will last more than one day, but overnight medical care is not required. 'For those patients living far from London, rather than ask them to travel home or have them stay in hospital overnight, we offer them a room in a nearby hotel. 'Patients might also be offered a room in a hotel if they have an operation scheduled very early in the morning. The hotel, which Lenny Henry is the face of, said the rooms used for patients are no different to any other rooms. It said they contain no special equipment for patients . The hospital says only patients who are well enough not to need overnight care are offered a hotel room and that it means they get have a more comfortable night than they would in a hospital bed . 'Only patients who do not need overnight . care will be offered a room in a hotel and our staff always carefully . assess patients before making this decision. This ensures patient safety . is never compromised. 'The rise in patient hotel stays is due to a . new approach we took, which included looking carefully at how and where . patients were cared for to ensure they were receiving care in the most . appropriate setting. 'We found that there were many patients who did not . need to stay in hospital, for the reasons outlined above, and so we . implemented new guidelines to ensure only patients in need of 24/7 . nursing care stay in wards overnight to free up hospital beds for those . who need them.

The study revealed that there is a 31 per cent fall in diagnoses when the new guidelines are used. ‘This study raises a concern that a medical provider diagnosing a child under the new guidelines won't find the child to be on the autism spectrum, when the same child under the old criteria might have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder,’ said lead researcher Dr Kristine Kulage. The old manual included three distinct subgroups under the broad definition of autism spectrum disorder – autistic disorder, Asperger’s disorder and pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified. The revised manual eliminates these subgroups, instead establishing a more limited range of criteria for a diagnosis of autism that is designed to encompass individuals who previously would have fallen into one of the subgroups. However, the new manual does include a new category - called social communication disorder - to diagnose individuals who have communication difficulties but lack other attributes associated with autism. When using the new manual, there was a 22 per cent fall in the number of people diagnosed with autistic disorder and a 70 per cent fall in the number of diagnosis of pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified. However, there was no notable decline in the number of people diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder. ‘We are potentially going to lose . diagnosis and treatment for some of the most vulnerable kids who have . developmental delays,’ said Dr Kulage. The researchers say the guidelines could leave thousands of children without the diagnosis they need to access educational and social support . ‘In many instances, children require a diagnosis of ASD to receive medical benefits, educational support and social services. The new guidelines are not thought to have a significant impact on diagnosis in the UK. Carol Povey, Director of the National Autistic Society's Centre for Autism, said: 'Whilst the DSM is very influential, it is not the main set of criteria used in the UK, so we don’t expect that there will be any immediate changes to the way that autism and Asperger syndrome are diagnosed in this country. 'The removal of the term Asperger syndrome is concerning for some people who view the term as part of their identity and use it in their day to day vocabulary. The changes won’t prevent people from continuing to use the term to define themselves and nor should it. National Autistic Society says the guidelines are very important but that they are not the main tool used to make autism diagnoses in the UK . 'All individuals who currently have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum, including those with Asperger syndrome, will retain their diagnosis.' People with autism tend to have . difficulties with communication, to misread facial expressions, and to . have difficulty making friends. They . may also be heavily reliant on routines, extremely sensitive to changes . in their environment, and intensely focused on interests not . appropriate to the social context they are in. Symptoms vary in severity, and early diagnosis and access to treatment have been proven to result in better outcomes.","American Psychiatric Association has released new diagnosis guidelines .

A ballerina who was too ashamed to go outside because of her misshapen spine has managed to avoid surgery. Hannah Martyn, 19, feared she would be labelled a hunchback after being diagnosed with scoliosis three years ago. Her dreams of becoming a professional dancer were shattered when she was told she faced nine hours of spinal surgery to place metal rods in her back. Hannah Martyn, 19, was diagnosed with scoliosis - curvature of the spine - three years ago . However, Miss Martyn, from Wigan, was then referred to London-based clinic Scoliosis SOS where she was offered non-surgical treatment. Following her treatment at the clinic she has returned to dancing five times a week. Miss Martyn said: ‘Scoliosis just took over my life and left me distraught - I was paranoid and insecure about going out in case people were looking at my back. ‘I lost all my self-confidence. I love dancing - it’s the way I choose to express myself. So when doctors told me I needed to have a major operation I was torn to pieces. ‘I knew I wanted to be a professional dancer and it’s all I wanted to do. But the surgery would dramatically reduce my flexibility.’ Instead, she turned to a non-surgical treatment to improve her condition, and has stunned medics with her remarkable progress. When she was diagnosed, Ms Martyn was warned she might need a risky nine hour operation to place metal rods in her back as a way of straightening her spine . In a bid to avoid surgery, the ballerina undertook an exercise programme designed to strengthen the muscles in her back. This was so successful that she has now returned to dancing five times a week . Scoliosis causes the spine to develop an S-shaped curve. The condition affects about four children in every 1,000 and if left untreated it can lead to fatal heart and lung problems in severe cases. Current treatments for severe scoliosis centre on having a major operation, which can be risky and involves metal rods being inserted either side of the spine to straighten it. Instead of surgery, the Scoliosis SOS clinic focuses on using a series of individually-tailored muscle exercises in order to treat the condition. Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape. Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not hanging properly and back pain. Pain usually only affects adults with the condition. In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000. It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis. It is more common in women than in men. Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows. However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing. Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine. In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain. Source: NHS Choices . Miss Martyn said: ‘I knew there were huge risks involved with the operation and that there could be a very long recovery period. ‘But after just a few weeks of treatment the difference in my posture is obvious, I can’t believe how far I’ve come. ‘I was overwhelmed by my final photographs and I am relieved that I am no longer at risk from surgery.’ Just before Miss Martyn turned 18, in a last attempt to save her daughter from having major spinal surgery, her mother Janet decided to start searching for an alternative treatment. It was at this point that she came across Scoliosis SOS. A spokesman for Scoliosis SOS said: ‘Current treatment in the UK is to wait until the curve becomes so severe, that the only option left is to operate. ‘The major operation is an incredibly risky procedure which involves metal rods being inserted either side of the spine, before the spine is fused solid. ‘After endless X-rays and appointments with various specialists Hannah was told that she would need surgery as soon as possible. ‘But after just four weeks of treatment with at our clinic, Hannah had achieved some remarkable results. ‘Not only had she managed to stabilise her condition but she had made significant improvements to her posture, physical appearance and lung capacity.’ A spokesperson for Scoliosis Association UK said: ‘With respect to the treatment of scoliosis we always advise that patients follow the advice of a scoliosis specialist. ‘The scientific evidence that intensive exercise “cures” scoliosis is sparse and unreliable. ‘In mild curvatures intensive exercise can improve posture, muscle strength (thereby supporting the spine more efficiently), flexibility, and appearance, but there is no long-term evidence that it will ultimately prevent progression of a curve. ‘It is important to remember that the scoliosis is different in individuals and that some may have only very mild curvatures that will not progress. Before her treatment (left), Ms Martyn was to ashamed to go outside as she was scared of being labelled a hunchback. Since her treatment (right) she says she is really happy with the improvement in her posture . ‘Such individuals will therefore benefit from treatments that improve appearance – largely because of positive psychological benefits. ‘Specialists undertake surgery only if it is essential for the long-term health of the individual, how much of the spine is fused will depend on the position and severity of the curve, and great care and consideration is taken to minimise the effect on spinal flexibility. ‘The dangers of surgery are overstated. Serious complications are very rare indeed. ‘Staying fit and active and keeping the core muscles strong is highly desirable for everyone, and especially so for people with spinal conditions, however, a life-long programme of specific exercise is a huge commitment, with no guarantee of long-term success.’ For more information visit www.sauk.org.uk .","Hannah Martyn was diagnosed with curvature of the spine three years ago .

A formerly obese man is getting his teeth into a new challenge by running the London Marathon after shedding more than a quarter of his body weight. Paul Hinton, 38, from Stoke-on-Trent, once tipped the scales at a belt-busting 20st, but decided to get fit after joining a slimming club in April last year. The father of three has now lost 6st and has raised an impressive £2,000 for Caudwell Children's charity in the process. Big plans: Paul (centre) used to weigh 20st but will now run the London Marathon to raise money for charity . He now plans to join Mo Farah and tackle the London Marathon on April 13 and in a quirky twist, 30 of his friends will be running a mile each to support him - while pushing an object weighing six stone to symbolise his weight loss. Paul, a delivery driver, now weighs a trim 14st 7lbs and said: 'I felt really emotional when I heard that they were doing this for me. 'When I joined the group last year, I had absolutely no confidence because of my weight. I had tried programmes like Weight Watchers but nothing seemed to work. 'Then I decided to join Life Without Limits. The group was so friendly and when we did a weigh-in earlier this year, I found I had lost 5st 7lb.' He adds: 'But the main thing wasn't about weight for me. It was accepting myself. I found that the world of being fat is a lonely place where you feel like people are judging you all the time and have a perception that you are lazy.' Goal: Paul has already raised £2,000 worth of sponsorship money for the race, which takes place on 13th April . Hero: Paul will join British Olympic champion Mo Farah for the 26-mile race through London . So low did Paul feel about his weight, he found himself reluctant to leave the house and even left him unable to play with his children. 'The more low I felt, the less I went out,' he reveals. 'My children often asked me to take them to the park but I always made excuses not to. 'While I was losing weight, I decided I wanted to run the London Marathon to prove to people that fat people can run. 'I started off with a half mile run around the block and I had to stop six times. It has got a bit easier since then but there have been times I wanted to give up. 'This is why I am so grateful for the other members' support because without them I would have quit weeks ago.' Paul's fellow class members will be completing a 26-mile run collectively to symbolise the miles Paul will cover in his London Marathon challenge. He plans to join them for the first and last leg of the event, which starts at the Bucknall Road fitness studio in Stoke-on-Trent at 10am on Saturday March 22. Personal trainer and fitness studio owner Rachael Hunt, 37, from Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'Paul's story is really inspirational. 'When he first came along to the group, he was very shy and was lacking confidence but now he's completely different. 'We just want to do all we can to give him that final boost before he does the marathon. To some people, it is just a race but we know it means a lot more than that to Paul.'","Paul Hinton, 38, from Stoke-on-Trent used to weigh 20st .

"By . Eve Mcgowan . PUBLISHED: . 17:48 EST, 1 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:48 EST, 1 March 2014 . Elizabeth Rowland, from Fleckney, Leicestershire, is the first person in Britain to undergo the procedure . A woman of 84 has become the first in Britain to be implanted with a next-generation artificial heart valve. Before having the new valve fitted, Elizabeth Rowland was so ill from the common heart condition aortic stenosis - in which the main valve becomes thickened - that she could barely walk. But she is now back on her feet and in need of less medication. At present 5,000 Britons a year have valve replacements, but the new Lotus implant vastly reduces the chance of blood leakage and life-threatening complications. The valve is fitted using keyhole surgery under local anaesthetic, meaning that frail patients - such as Elizabeth - don't have to undergo a risky and invasive open-heart operation. Made of a metallic mesh and titanium, the new valve is about the size of a 10p piece. 'The Lotus valve offers such precision and control that it's  like the difference between landing a plane with or without the help of autopilot,' said consultant cardiologist Dr Jan Kovac, who carried out the operation at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital. 'You are able to place it precisely where you need it. This valve is also much more sophisticated in that you are able to move it as many times as you like until you're completely happy it's in the right position.' A special seal in the system also reduces the risk of Paravalvular Leakage - a potentially life-threatening complication where blood leaks between the implant and the heart tissue. It is one of the main causes of death from the procedure. Elizabeth, from Leicestershire, said: 'I'm so pleased to have had this operation - it has given me a new lease of life. 'I can move about more and I don't need quite so much medication. The care I received was excellent, too - everyone was lovely. I'm pleased to be one  of the first in the UK to have had this procedure.' In spite of the intricacy, Elizabeth's keyhole operation took  just 40 minutes. Dr Kovac made an incision in her groin, then threaded a balloon catheter (a narrow tube pre-loaded with the prosthetic valve) up through the femoral artery into her heart. The catheter allowed a balloon to be placed inside the aortic valve to stretch it open and create space for the new valve to be inserted. Once the valve was in the correct position, the balloon was deflated, allowing the new valve to start working straight away. Dr Kovac manipulated the position of the replacement valve with a control handle attached to the balloon catheter. Approximately three per cent  of the population over 65 and five per cent of people over 75 suffer from aortic stenosis. Elizabeth had the operation to insert an implant, carried out by consultant cardiologist Dr Jan Kovak . The disease stiffens the heart's main aortic valve and prevents it from opening and closing as it should. That restricts blood flow into the main artery that takes blood into the body. While mild narrowing of the valve may not produce symptoms, severe narrowing can cause shortness of breath, chest pain  or tightness, and dizziness or fainting. Left untreated, it can lead to heart failure and sudden death. The most common cause is deposits of calcium building up. Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The Lotus System is an exciting technical breakthrough. This is the next generation of valves for a pioneering technique that means frail and elderly patients who wouldn't survive open-heart surgery can have the procedure. 'The new valve has a better adhesive to stop leakage around the sides and it has been developed so that its fitting can now  be done with much more precision. It's amazing that we're now able to replace the aortic valve so well.'","Elizabeth Rowland, 84, from Leicestershire, is the first in Britain to have op .

Now, 26 years on, the Massachusetts-based mother-of-three has discussed the devastating effect amnesia has had on her life and her family's. In an interview with MailOnline to coincide with publication of her memoir, I Forgot to Remember, the 48-year-old revealed that she was a completely different person after her freak accident - something which her husband, Jim, understandably struggled to cope with. Coming to terms with memory loss: Su Meck, pictured here with her husband Jim, has opened up about the devastating effect amnesia has had on her life and her family's . 'For 20 years he had affairs and would be . away traveling a lot. 'He wasn't getting what he needed at home. It was years before I was able to have sex again,' Mrs Meck said, adding that she doesn't blame Mr Meck for his actions. While she was a rebellious free spirit before her head injury, she was 'cold and logical' afterwards. The concept of love and marriage was difficult to comprehend and, before she wrapped her head around that, she still had to re-learn how to read, write and even tie her shoelaces. 'I wasn't the person Jim married,' Mrs Meck mused. Indeed, in her new memoir she highlights just how different she was - using 'she' to refer to her former-self. Starting from scratch: Mrs Meck, pictured here at a family gathering, said that it took years to familiarize herself with places and faces and still to this day she has no memories from her youth . Photographic record: Still to this day she cannot remember meeting Mr Meck at college, their first kiss or even being pregnant with their two sons Benjamin and Patrick, now aged 27 and 26 . 'She never knew me, and I know nothing of her except what people have told me. 'She rebelled; I conform. She broke rules; I follow them. She drank and smoked pot; I don’t even know the taste of beer or wine, and the smell of smoke makes me physically ill. 'I like vegetables; she hated them. She loved to swim; I am absolutely terrified of the water.' 'I never fell in love with Jim. In my eyes we never dated.

Still . to this day she cannot remember meeting Mr Meck at college, their first . kiss or even being pregnant with their two sons Benjamin and Patrick, . now aged 27 and 26. It was around four years after her accident that Mrs Meck was able to start forming memories again. One of the earliest things she remembers is seeing Benjamin learning to ride a two wheel bike in the driveway at home for the first time. 'Because my scans didn't show anything up doctors thought I was faking it or looking for attention. It was very frustrating,' Mrs Meck said, recalling what happened after her accident . Back to school: Mrs Meck is currently studying for bachelor's degree in music at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts - she finishes her final semester this May . However, one thing that set her back . was falling pregnant in 1993. Despite having the body of a 27-year-old . Mrs Meck said she still felt like a child. 'I was totally freaked out, I thought it was disgusting, gross!' she exclaimed. She . said as she watched her daughter, Cassidy, grow she felt more like a . big sister than a mother as the two would learn how to do things . together - from reading books to mathematical equations. 'I felt like I grew up with all of my children. Like we're siblings, it's difficult to explain,' Mrs Meck laughed. 'Because my scans didn't show anything up doctors thought I was faking it or looking for attention. But Jim had to live with me. He knew it was serious' In 2007, almost two decades after her life-changing head injury, Mrs Meck said her marriage finally reached breaking point. Part of the reason for this was her inability to keep on top of things at home while determinedly pursuing a music degree at Maryland’s Montgomery College. 'Studying took my attention away from things at home,' she recalled. 'When I went back to school I was scared to death and a complete mess. I forgot to make dinner, do the grocery shopping or clean. 'Jim felt very ignored during that time and he was ready to leave and had one foot out the door. I was just in ""going to school mode"".' Seeing what was going on, Mrs Meck's teenage children encouraged her to seek help from a marriage counselor. I Forgot to Remember by Su Meck is out now . It was during a therapy session that Mr Meck confessed his infidelities. Despite the revelation the couple decided to work things through. Commenting about how things are now between them, Mrs Meck said: 'I never fell in love with Jim. In my eyes we never dated. I was just assigned to a family. 'We've had such a rough marriage and it's just different. We have our own ways of doing things.' This week Mrs Meck went on a trip for the first time without a family member or friend by her side. She said that she had more than 50 Post-It Notes dotted around her hotel room to remind her where she was and what needed doing. Asked what her hope is for the future she replied: ‘People with Traumatic Brain Injury are often misunderstood and more research is needed into the topic. 'I'd love my story to draw more attention to the topic and to help other families who are going through the same. 'Because my scans didn't show anything up doctors thought I was faking it or looking for attention. It was very frustrating and they told me I should go and see a shrink. 'But Jim had to live with me. He knew it was serious.' Mrs Meck is currently studying for bachelor’s degree in music at the prestigious Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. She finishes her final semester this May. She concludes: 'I'm not ever going to be the person that I was. I feel like I'm 20. 'I have good days and bad days but I'm stronger than ever now.' I Forgot to Remember by Su Meck, published by Simon & Schuster, is out now on Amazon.com . Memory loss is one of the most common side effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Even in mild cases, it is still very common. The more severe the memory loss after a TBI, the more significant the brain damage is likely to be. Patients are often unable to recall what happened just before, during and after they sustained a head injury. This temporary memory loss is caused by the brain swelling as a result of the damage it sustained. It presses against the skull and even parts of it that were uninjured by the impact are still unable to function correctly. The patient's memory typically returns as the swelling goes down over a period of weeks or even months. However, damage to the nerves and axons (connection between nerves) of the brain may also result in memory loss. The brain cannot heal itself like a limb so a victim's memory will be permanently impaired unless the brain learns how to perform it differently over a period of time by establishing new nerve connections. This cannot be predicted but doctors now believe victims may continue to regain brain function many years after suffering a TBI.","Su Meck's memory was erased 26 years ago when she was knocked unconscious by a kitchen ceiling fan .

A councillor who died after spending 15 months waiting for a heart operation was 'let down by the NHS he loved'. Ron Jones was suffering from severe heart disease and was waiting for surgery after doctors told him he needed a triple bypass and a new valve. But Mr Jones, a councillor in Newport, South Wales, tragically died of heart failure last August, aged 78, after being stuck on the operation waiting list for 15 months. Ron Jones, 78, died of heart disease after waiting 15 months for vital heart surgery . His partner of 30 years, Pam Allen, is devastated that he was let down by the health service he had adored. She said: 'He was let down by the NHS he loved. Why did he wait so long when they knew what was wrong with him? 'Why was he waiting 15 months from the point he was diagnosed? To me, heart surgery is an emergency.' Mr Jones was told in May 2012 by Royal Gwent Hospital that he would need a double heart bypass and a new valve. In autumn 2012, he was given an angiogram at the hospital, but his GP was furious when she discovered that he did not have any stents put in. Ms Allen, 68, said: 'The doctor said that would have given him quality of life until he had the operation.' Mr Jones needed a triple heart bypass and a new heart valve because of his severe heart disease . Mr Jones was told he would need a triple bypass at a further appointment in October at the University of Wales Hospital Cardiff. Ms Allen, of Pill, Newport, said: 'The doctor said: ""Do you have any questions?"" We said: ""When do we come in? Tomorrow?"" 'He said: ""No, three to six months"".' When Mr Jones was told in April that the operation wouldn’t be for the foreseeable future, she got Newport West Assembly Member Rosemary Butler involved. The couple then received a letter saying that Mr Jones had been put on a 36-week waiting list - but that he had gone on the waiting list on December 17. He was finally given an appointment for a pre-assessment clinic on June 5, 2013, and was told his operation would take place within six weeks. But the operation never took place. Ms Allen said: 'In August, Ron woke up in the morning and went to the toilet, he came back and said I’m dying, I need an ambulance.' The ambulance crew arrived quickly, but Mr Jones died before they could get him to hospital. Ms Allen now has two complaints outstanding, against both the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and the Aneurin Bevan Health Board. She said: 'I see him in this house every day, it still upsets me, I thought: right, something has got to be done. I have got to make a stand now.' Last July, a damning report found that patients were 'dying regularly' waiting for surgery at the University of Wales Hospital Cardiff.

Cardiff and Vale University Health Board offered its sincerest condolences to Mr Jones' family for their loss. A spokeswoman said the board is arranging a meeting between Mr Jones’ relatives and the clinical team. Mr Jones' operation was due to take place at the University Hospital of Wales (pictured). The hospital has been investigated over claims patients are regularly dying as a result of lengthy waiting lists . The spokeswoman said: 'We would like to reassure the family that steps are being taken by health boards and the Welsh Health Specialist Services Committee to increase cardiac capacity. 'This has included further investment in the service, providing surgery at weekends and commissioning services from other providers. 'We would also like to reassure patients and their families waiting for treatment that arrangements are in place to regularly review and monitor patients on the waiting list. 'However if anyone has any concerns they should see their GP. We would also add that outcomes after cardiac surgery at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board are excellent, some of the best in the UK, and that clinical teams are constantly working to improve patient care and timely access to services.'","Ron Jones had heart disease and was told in May 2012 he needed surgery .

These marble-sized objects are remnants of small meteorites that broke up in the Martian atmosphere, according to scientists in Hawaii. Researchers had previously thought that the blueberries were evidence of water flowing over the Martian surface billions of years ago. These marble-sized objects, nicknamed 'blueberries, are remnants of small meteorites that broke up in the Martian atmosphere, according to scientists in Hawaii . The tiny sphericals were discovered on Mars by Nasa’s Opportunity rover a decade ago near the Endeavour Crater, and scientists have since been baffled by their origin. ‘They seem to be crunchy on the outside, and softer in the middle,’ Opportunity's principal investigator, Steve Squyres said. ‘They are different in concentration. They are different in structure. They are different in composition. They are different in distribution. So, we have a wonderful geological puzzle in front of us.’ The tiny sphericals were discovered on Mars by Nasa's Opportunity rover a decade ago near the Endeavour Crater, and scientists have since been baffled by their origin . Some scientists maintain that the research in Hawaii is overlooking key data. Many still believe the 'blueberries' point to evidence of water on Mars billions of years ago. They believe these iron-rich orbs, discovered at the rover's landing site in 2004, formed when the Red Planet was  warm enough to host liquid water. In some places minerals precipitated out of the water as it diffused through rock, leaving behind hard masses. Erosion eventually exposed the blueberries embedded in outcrops.. One theory suggests that magma from volcanic eruptions, rather than water, may have formed the orbs. However, large amounts of the iron-bearing mineral hematite have been found in these blueberries, which could suggest they formed when groundwater flowed through porous rocks. Water flow can trigger chemical reactions that cause the iron minerals form into small sphere. But this theory doesn’t explain the narrows sizes of the blueberries. In the journal Planetary and Space Science, scientists at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu suggest that a meteorite impact better explains the shape and composition of Martian blueberries. ‘None of the physical properties of the spherules match the concretion model,’ Anupam Misra, who led the study, told Joseph Bennington Castro at National Geographic. ‘But the meteorite theory explains all of their properties.’ The paper points to uniformity of hematite rocks on Mars. Most of the hematite rocks are about 0.16 inches (4mm) in diameter, and usually no larger than 0.24 inches (6.2mm). The bluberries are thought to be composed of hematite. This is the mineral form of iron oxide that leaches out of the soil as ground water rises up through it . Professor Misra said these size differences can be explained if the Mars rocks came from meteor impacts. According to the researchers, a meteorite 1.6 inches (4 cm) in diameter could scatter a thousand 0.16-inch spherules over a large area. However, the theory has proved to be controversial, with some arguing that the conclusions don’t take into account key facts. ‘These spherules didn't form from some kind of high-temperature event, as you would expect from something melting in the Martian atmosphere,’ Timothy Glotch, a geoscientist at Stony Brook University in New York, told National Geographic. Opportunity’s analysis of the blueberries suggests that they formed during a low temperature process, he said. According to the researchers, a meteorite 1.6 inches (4 cm) in diameter could scatter a thousand 0.16-inch spherules over a large area .","Martian spheres, named 'blueberries', have left experts baffled for a decade .
Now scientists claim a meteorite may have scattered blueberries on Mars .
This contradicts an earlier theory that the blueberries were evidence of water flowing on Mars billions of years ago ."

Severely brain-damaged patients have been brought 'back to life' by zapping their brain with an electrical current . Severely brain damaged patients have been brought briefly ‘back to life’ by zapping their brain with an electrical current. Awoken from their near-coma state, some were able to move their hands or follow instructions – others were able to answer simple questions. The remarkable discovery could lead to new treatments for people left minimally conscious by car accidents or blows to the head. It also raises the possibility that such patients will be able to tell doctors whether they want to live or die. They could also be asked whether they feel pain. Researcher Steven Laureys, a coma scientist, said: ‘In some cases, members of your family can be left with difficult decisions about whether to remove life support. ‘And we can’t make any decisions ethically if we’re not sure about the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic options.’ Dr Laureys, of the University of Liege in Belgium, treated 55 people with severe brain injuries. Some were in a vegetative state, which meant they appeared awake but were unresponsive to the world around them. Others were in a minimally conscious state, in which patients show fleeting signs of alertness but recovery is not guaranteed. Some had been in the near coma-like conditions for years. However, almost a third temporarily showed signs of consciousness after their brains were stimulated with a mild electric current for 20 minutes. Dr Laureys told New Scientist magazine: ‘Two patients emerged from a minimally conscious state all together.’ When asked questions such as ‘Am I touching my nose?’, they were able to answer by nodding their head or making specific eye movements. Others were able to follow instructions to nod or squeeze their hand. Researchers at the University of Liege in Belgium studied the effect electrical currents had on 55 brain-injury patients . All of the effects wore off after about two hours but Dr Laureys is now investigating the effect of stimulating the brain for longer. It is not entirely clear how the current helps but it may boost brain activity that underlies conscious tasks but has been suppressed. Joseph Fins, a professor of medical ethics in the US, said: ‘It is like we are opening and shutting a window for a few hours and that could be perceived as cruel. ‘But we didn’t give these people brain damage, we are trying to make it better. ‘These kind of experiments show that a window exists and now you that that you might be able to use other interventions to enhance that window.’ New Scientist says: ‘This discovery has clear medical benefits: it should help doctors make better assessments of patients’ conditions. ‘The hope is that researchers will be able to extend the stimulation, resulting in more significant brain activity and even, perhaps, a return to something resembling an acceptable quality of life. ‘Before then, there is a host of ethical issues. ‘No one has yet asked the obvious ethical questions: are you suffering?  Do you want to live, or die?'","Some patients treated by electrical current were able to move their hands, others could answer simple questions .

So Barbara Short couldn't believe the news when doctors confirmed she was pregnant again - with twins. The 32-year-old, from Hartlepool, had been devastated when her twins Ava and Alfie, born at just 23 weeks, had died. Barbara Short amazed doctors by conceiving two sets of twins in a year. The first set, Ava and Alfie, died when born at 23 weeks. Just two months later she learned she was expecting Lilly and Frankie (pictured) But just over two months later, she received the wonderful news that she was pregnant again - and there were two heartbeats. She added that while she was 'overjoyed when the babies were born healthy,' she still felt an emptiness for the children she had lost. She has now given birth to another set of twins - Frankie and Lilly Wallace. Ms Short said: ‘It’s as if Ava and Alfie have been sent back to me. I can’t believe how I can be so blessed to have another two and be able to take them home with me. ‘Everyone, even the doctors, were shocked at me having two sets of twins in less than a year. It was definitely meant to be that I was given Frankie and Lilly.’ Ms Short suffered complications almost as soon she found out she was pregnant in April 2012 and just 23 weeks into her pregnancy she was rushed to hospital and gave birth. Lilly (pictured) and Frankie were born in July 2013 and were both healthy enough to go home within a few days . Tiny Ava Wallace and Alfie Wallace were born at the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton. Ava came into the world at 2.50am weighing just 9oz, while Alfie was born 10 minutes later and weighed 1lb. The pair - who Ms Short says could have fitted into the palm of her hand - were taken to the James Cook University Hospital, in Middlesbrough, and placed on ventilators. But Ava lost her fight eight hours after she was born and Alfie battled on for just a few more hours before dying at 4.30pm on the same day. Former delivery driver Ms Short, who has two older children, Molly-Jo Short, seven, and four-year-old James Wallace, said her world came crashing down after their deaths. Frankie was not breathing when he was born so he had to spend five days in hospital before going home . She said: ‘I felt like I was looking in on someone else and it wasn’t me. I’d had two babies, but I was going home with none. ‘None . of it seemed real. I was empty, my stomach was empty, but yet I had . nothing. I still haven’t got over that and I don’t expect I ever will.’ But just nine weeks later Ms Short went from despair to happiness when she discovered that she was pregnant again - with twins. And unlike her pregnancy with Ava and Alfie, she had no health problems and went into labour at a safer 36 weeks. After a Caesarean birth, Ms Short delivered Frankie and Lilly on July 22 last year at 4.17pm. Although Frankie was not breathing when he was born, doctors worked on him and he took his first breath six minutes later. Ms Short said: 'When [Frankie and Lilly] were born I was over the moon, but at the same time I was still grieving for Ava and Alfie. But even though they have filled the void, I'll still always feel an emptiness for the two I lost' Lilly was taken home two days after her birth and Frankie came home five days later, after being looked after in the special care baby unit. Ms Short, who has since split from the babies’ father, said seven months on, both babies are healthy and Frankie is ‘really stern and serious’ and Lilly is ‘full of smiles’. Ms Short said: ‘It’s hard to explain but when they were born I was over the moon, but at the same time I was still grieving for Ava and Alfie. ‘But even though they have filled the void, I’ll still always feel an emptiness for the two I lost, especially when I go to the cemetery. ‘I know their souls are with us though. They can never be replaced.’","Barbara Short, 32, lost her first set of twins, Ava and Alfie Wallace, when they were born at just 23 weeks, each weighing about 1lb .

Evidence of a brutal murder has been found after forensic analysis on 1,600 year-old mummy discovered in South Americaâ€™s Atacama Desert. Researchers believe the mummy was of young Incan woman in her twenties who suffered from a tropical parasitic infection known as Chagas disease. The disease had placed the young lady on the brink of death, and researchers believe she may have been murdered in a ritual killing. Evidence of a brutal murder has been found after forensic analysis of 1,600 year-old mummy discovered in South America's Atacama Desert . The mummy was acquired in the 1890s by Princess Therese of Bavaria, however all documentation about its history has long been destroyed. For over a hundred years, the mummy was housed in the Bavarian State Archeological Collection in Germany. Hair bands made from alpaca or llama hair, as well as the shape of her skull, gave scientists clues to her South American origin. Forensic analysis on the mummy's hair suggested she likely had a diet high of seafood and maize. The left image shows the external appearance of the hair plaits which are fixed at their ends by tiny ropes of foreign material. On the right is the detailed view of the mummy's face . Ritual killings were common within the Incan culture. In 1999 three Children of Llullaillaco, who found deep frozen were found with an extraordinary collection of elaborate gold, silver and shell statues, textiles and pots containing food The children included a 13-year-old known as the 'Llullaillaco Maiden' Human sacrifice was common within the Incan culture, which developed immediately before the arrival of the Spanish in what is now parts of Peru, Chile and Ecuador between 1400 and the mid-1500s. Sacrifices focused on juveniles and young adult female victims. The society also drew their victims from other location with beauty making a female a prime target. Child sacrifice was called capacocha.  The process of capacocha could begin years before the selected person was killed.  The Incan state held annual rituals where they sacrificed children to the gods in order to promote a healthy harvest. There is no evidence that this murder was a sacrifice to the gods, but scientists believe the young female was on the brink of death from a parasitic infection when she was killed. But to better understand her origin and life history, Andreas Nerlich, a paleopathologist at Munich University, recently examined the skeleton, organs, and ancient DNA. While there was no evidence of trauma from the mummyâ€™s external appearance, a computer tomography (CT) scan revealed the frontal bones of the skull had been smashed. Researchers, writing in the journal PLOS ONE, believe she was killed from several hits to the skull using a sharp object . When the woman died, she was buried in the Atacama Desert where the sand and air naturally mummified her. Forensic analysis on her hair suggested she likely had a diet high of seafood and maize, and she could have been aged anywhere between 20 and 25 years old when she died. The skull will be on exhibit at the Archaeological Collection of the State of Bavaria in Munich until mid-August. Child sacrifice was called capacocha.  The process of capacocha could begin years before the selected person was killed. A mummified body of a child who was killed during one such sacrifice is pictured here .

It may look like something a Bond villain would conjure up as a base for their evil regime, but this research vessel set to be stationed in the middle of the ocean is actually a marine research facility - and it is set to become a reality. Called SeaOrbiter, the floating aquatic lab has been designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie, who announced that production was about to begin on the project, which will take two years to build. 'I'm really glad to announce that we have reached our goal,' he said after the project raised over $440,000. Scroll down for video . This diagram details the different features of the SeaOrbiter vessel. It has a platform lift for divers on the left-hand side, while stern thrusters power the ship. Bunks for the crew as well as the VIP cabin and Captain's room are on the right-hand side. The retractable keel weighs 180 tonnes . French architect Jacques Rougerie designed the incredible structure. A countdown on the SeaOrbiter site claims construction will start in 201 days, which would make the start 31 May 2014. The project will cost $52.7 million and has support from Nasa and the European Space Agency because the conditions on the SeaOrbiter are similar to those found in space. The 1,000 tonne vessel is 170ft tall but almost two thirds of this will be underwater, . Between 18 and 22 marine biologists will live on the hybrid boat laboratory. It will be the only vessel allowing 24-hour exploration. This will allow construction of the vessel’s ‘eye’, a kind of lookout post that sits 18 metres high above the water, to begin. 'More than 600 people contributed, and now we are able to start on construction,' said Rougerie. 'When in two years Sea Orbiter is built, we hope all out backers will come with us.' Almost two-thirds of the 170-ft tall ship will sit underwater making it possible to directly study ecosystems and fish levels at great depths. Between 18 and 22 marine biologists will be able to live on board the vessel at any one time because it has living quarters and kitchens. The laboratory part of the 1,000-tonne ship will sit below the surface to make the SeaOrbiter buoyant, but to also give a direct line of sight and access into the ocean to depths of up to 6,000 metres. According to Rougerie, the SeaOrbiter will additionally feature a ‘fish-collection system for studies of the pelagic ecosystem, plankton biodiversity, and fish stocks.’ Architect Rougerie developed the concept of the ocean lab around 12 years ago. He built his first underwater house on 4 August 1977. In 1981 he launched the Hippocampe, a scientific base suspended in mid-water that slept two people. The Hippocampe was capable of diving to depths of around 12 metres and could stay underwater for between seven and 15 days at a time. Called SeaOrbiter, the 1,000-tonne floating aquatic lab, pictured, was designed by French architect Jacques Rougerie. Construction on the ship is due to start in May 2014.

Virile: Sultan Moulay Ismaïl led Morocco from 1672 to 1727 and theoretically could have sired over 1,000 children as rumoured . Sultan Moulay Ismaïl is known as a warrior as well as a the world's most prolific father. The Moroccan ruler, who led the country from 1672 to 1727 is rumoured to have sired over 1,000 children. And while this might seem unlikely, scientists have worked out that it is theoretically possible, if the leader had sex once a day - for 32 years straight. According to computer simulations, the amorous leader, who was the first sultan of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty which is still the royal house of Morocco, could have set the record for the greatest number of children fathered by anyone throughout history. The historical ruler holds the title in the Guinness Book of World Records, which says that he fathered 888 children. But a French diplomat called Dominique Busnot who visited Morocco at the time, wrote that sultan Ismaïl had 1,171 children by 1704, as well as four wives and 500 concubines, LiveScience reported. Scientists have previously dismissed the number of children as highly unlikely as women are only fertile for a few days every month. A team of scientists from the University of Vienna created computer simulations to explore how many times sultan Ismail would have had to have had sex to be able to father 1,171 children in 32 years. Amazingly they found that not only was it possible, he would have had to have sex once a day over the lengthy period. Anthropologist Elisabeth Oberzaucher, who was lead author of the study published in PLOS One, said: ‘We were as conservative as possible with our calculations and Moulay could still achieve this outcome.’ Scientists from the University of Vienna created computer simulations to explore how many times sultan Ismail would have had to have sex every day to be able to father 1,171 children in 32 years - and they found the answer was approximately once. A painting showing the sultan meeting a French ambassador is pictured . Moulay Ismaïl is noted as one of the greatest figures in Moroccan history. He fought the Ottoman Turks in 1679, 1682 and 1695/96. After these battles the Moroccan independence was respected. The ruler also liberated several seaports occupied from Spain and Britain. He is thought to have used 25,000 slaves for the construction of the capital in Meknes and displayed thousands of heads of slain rivals at the beginning of his reign. He ruled until the age of 80 and is said to have fathered 888 children in his time - although there are reports of 1,171 children. A number of different conception models were created. One model assumed the menstrual cycles of women did not synchronise, while another assumed they could and the quality of sultan Ismail’s sperm was also taken into account as well as how he aged. The study said that the ruler would have had to have sex between 0.83 and 1.43 times a day to father so many children in 32 years. The scientists also said that the rule needs a harem of between 65 and 110 women to do it – not the 500 concubines he is estimated to have had. However, Dr Oberzaucher noted that the results of the study differed quite a lot depending on which model was used. While the sultan was free to have sex with different women, any suspicion of adultery by the women was severely punished. The sultan is said to have personally strangled unfaithful women as well as ordering their breasts to be cut off or their teeth pulled out. Other men who eyed up the women could also be punished by death. Sultan Ismaïl ruled for the longest period of time in Morocco’s history and is remembered as a bloodthirsty warrior. Reports suggest that he displayed between 400 and 1,000 heads of enemy chiefs and political rivals in the city of Fez at the beginning of this reign and over the next 55 years killed over 30,000 people off the battlefield.","Sultan Moulay Ismaïl ruled Morocco between 1672 to 1727 and was known as a bloodthirsty warrior as well as a prolific father .

A three-year-old heart patient died after a glitch with a new NHS computer system left him without a check-up appointment for 20 months. Samuel Starr underwent complex cardiac surgery aged nine months at the scandal-hit Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. He was recovering well and was due to have regular check-up appointments and scans at a different hospital nearer his home in Frome, Somerset. Samuel Starr, three, died after a computer glitch meant he did not have a check-up for 20 months. He was born with a heart condition and underwent surgery when he was nine months old . But his family claim teething problems with a new booking system meant he 'dropped off the appointments list' and did not receive a crucial follow-up scan for 20 months. By this time, his condition had deteriorated considerably and he underwent a second operation during which he suffered a stroke. Further complications followed and he died in the arms of his parents Catherine Holley and Paul Starr a month later. The couple have now condemned the lack of care that was given to their son after his operation. In a statement, they said: 'He was a beautiful boy. He was smart, clever, he had good vocabulary, he had lots of friends, went to nursery, he had a nice life with plenty of time with his family and friends, he was well loved. 'In 20 months, he went from having a healthy heart to a bad one. It wasn't as it he had poor care in that time - he had no care at all. 'It was not in our understanding that this was going to have to happen.' Samuel was born with a restricted pulmonary artery meaning blood could now easily flow away from his heart to his lungs. Samuel had an operation at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and he was recovering well initially. However, his heart then began to struggle but this was not picked up because he went for so long without a check-up . He underwent surgery at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, which has been at the centre of a recent scandal involving a number of baby deaths. The surgery went well and he was due to have regular follow-up appointments at the Paediatric Cardiac Clinic at the Royal United Hospital (RUH) in Bath after being discharged. But his appointments became 'sporadic' and his parents claim they often had to chase the hospital over the scheduled dates. They allege their community nurse contacted the hospital for a check-up on five occasions but with no success. A subsequent report has suggested a new computer-based patient booking system introduced at the RUH in 2011 was to blame. According to a Freedom of Information request, it caused 63 overdue appointments - one of which was Samuel's. Some took nearly two years to discover. Samuel was due to have his check ups at Royal United Hospital, Bath, but they became sporadic. A report has suggested a new computer-based patient booking system introduced at the RUH in 2011 was to blame . Samuel last received a heart scan in October 2010 but this was not repeated for another 20 months because of booking problems. Unbeknown to his family, his cardiac condition was slowly deteriorating and by the time he was seen by his cardiologist in June 2012, he required another operation. But the heart unit in Bristol was unable to schedule this until August and he was so frail by this point he needed a month in intensive care afterwards. He died on September 6 2012 in the arms of his parents. Minutes of board meetings at the RUH a year before Samuel's death reveal there were 'significant issues with... data that had not been migrated which affected... long-term follow-up appointments'. Ms Holley said: 'They should have reverted back to the old system until the new one was working properly.' By the time Samuel's failing health was diagnosed he was very weak and he had to have more heart surgery. He died a month later following complications. An inquest into his death is due to open at Flax Burton Coroner's Court (pictured) on Monday . An inquest into Samuel's death is due to be opened on Monday at Flax Bourton, near Bristol, and is expected to last four days. An RUH spokesman said: 'We have offered our sincere condolences to the family of Samuel Starr following his sad death. 'The coroner's inquest will be held very soon and we hope that this will provide both Samuel's family and everyone involved in his care, with a clearer indication of the circumstances surrounding his death.' A University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust spokeswoman added: 'We strive to do our best for every child in our care and it is a matter of great sadness to us when a child dies. 'We are committed to learn from every poor experience and to do all we can to look back and examine whether there are any areas where we can improve our practice or make other changes that ensure a better experience for future families. 'The coroner will conduct a thorough and independent inquiry into Samuelâ€™s death and we are committed to working with her to provide all the information she needs to do this and to respond promptly to any recommendations that she may make. 'It would not be appropriate for us to comment further until the inquest has concluded but we would like to offer our sincere condolences to the Starr family for their tragic loss.'","Samuel Starr was born with a heart condition - had surgery at nine months .

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs local people 'suffered too much for too long under a system which ignored appalling failures of care in their local hospital'. He said the time had come to plans to dissolve the trust and move key services to neighbouring hospitals. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the time had come to overhaul the trust in the wake of a catalogue of failings . The trust, which has long been plagued . by financial difficulties, was at the centre of one of the biggest . scandals ever to hit the National Health Service. The Francis Inquiry condemned the ‘appalling and unnecessary suffering of hundreds of people’ at the trust. Patients . at Stafford Hospital were left lying in their own urine and excrement . for days, forced to drink water from vases, given the wrong medication . or sent home with life-threatening conditions. Mr Hunt said local people deserve to know that the NHS has learned the lessons and is guaranteeing high-quality, safe services. He added: 'The changes recommended following this independent process, supported by local doctors, will secure the safe and high quality services that the people of Stafford deserve having endured years of uncertainty and failures in care. '90 per cent of patient visits will continue locally, with a minority of services eventually being moved to neighbouring hospitals once the local NHS is satisfied there is sufficient capacity. 'I want Stafford to be a proper district hospital that continues to meet the needs of patients nearby, including for emergency care and births.' He warned that without £20million in extra funding, the troubled trust would not have been able to pay staff and suppliers in 2012 and 2013. Between 400 and 1,200 people died needlessly as a result of appalling care at Mid Staffordshire hospital . Overall control of Stafford Hospital . will now to go to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire while . Cannock Hospital will be run by Royal Wolverhampton Trust. Paediatric . assessment will still take place at Stafford Hospital by specialist . staff, in conjunction with A&E, and critical patients will be . allowed to stay overnight in Stafford as long as the appropriate staff . are on duty. The plans would . mean the hospital would keep its current limited-hours A&E . department. The hospital would lose in-patient paediatrics. Philip Atkins, leader of Staffordshire County Council, said: 'The decision to dissolve Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust means it is absolutely crucial that all partners involved in the NHS now pull together and deliver what is best for the people of Staffordshire. 'While this will undoubtedly be a bitter blow for campaigners, it is also an opportunity to show how the county can now lead the way in demonstrating how integrated hospital and community care can be both delivered safely and meet the highest standards. 'The trust, as it stood, was both financially and clinically unstable, and as a county council we have always recognised the difficult challenge facing the trust special administrators, and I think they have acknowledged this too. 'There are still significant concerns over the financial fragility of the whole Staffordshire health economy and the wider impact this decision will have, especially as only last week Staffordshire was identified as one of 11 financially challenged health economies.' But Christina McAnea, head of health for Unison, said: 'It is bitterly disappointing for the local community who have campaigned for local services and have rallied behind the hospital, as well as for staff who have worked hard to turn the trust around.' The . Francis report said there was an unhealthy focus on money and . Government targets that means the NHS does not put its patients first. Campaigners from Cure NHS demanded change after patients ere left lying in their own urine and excrement for days, forced to drink water from vases, given the wrong medication or sent home with life-threatening conditions . It called for a 'zero tolerance' approach to poor standards after 'appalling' failings caused by 'a lack of care, compassion, humanity and leadership'.with some patients left lying in their own faeces for days, forced to drink water from vases or given the wrong medication. That followed a 2009 investigation by the Healthcare Commission which found between 400 and 1,200 more people died at Stafford Hospital than would have been expected.

A descendant of Austrian archduke Franz Ferdinand has said his family should take no blame for the outbreak of the First World War. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand is widely considered to have triggered the start of the conflict, which killed 37million people, 100 years ago. But Karl Habsburg-Lothringen has insisted to journalists that his family have no need to show any remorse for the war - because they do not need to 'redeem' themselves for anything. A descendant of Franz Ferdinand (pictured with his wife) has said his family should take no blame for the outbreak of the First World War - despite the archduke's assassination widely being considered a trigger . This is an artist's impression of the moment when Archduke Ferdinand and his wife were shot by Gavril Princip . Archduke Ferdinand was shot in Sarajevo, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian area of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Bosnian Serb Gavrilo Princip, who was 19 years old. This action, on June 28, 1914, led to Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia. After that Serbia's ally Russia, and Russia's allies France and Britain, were pulled into conflict with Austria-Hungary and its treaty partner, Germany. But, in an interview with a number of European newspapers, including The Guardian, Mr Habsburg-Lothringen has said the First World War was already an inevitability at this stage. He told the papers: ‘If you were to simplify it, you could say that the shooting in Sarajevo started the First World War. ‘But if there hadn’t been the shooting in Sarajevo, it would have kicked off three weeks later somewhere else.’ Karl Habsburg-Lothringen has insisted his family have no need to show any remorse for the war - because they do not need to 'redeem' themselves for anything . The confrontational nature of the Austro-Hungarian empire along with Russia in Eastern Europe led to the Balkan war in 1912. This conflict was generally considered to be a ‘prelude’ to the First World War, but Mr Habsburg-Lothringen also said his grandfather, the last Austro-Hungarian emperor, Charles I had only ‘inherited the war’ and should take no blame. Archduke Ferdinand was the uncle of Charles I. Archduke Ferdinand was killed in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, alongside his wife, Sophie on June 28 1914. Eventually killed by 19-year-old Gavrilo Princip, the couple had earlier that day been attacked by another man who threw a grenade at their car. Archduke Ferdinand was shot in the neck, while his wife was hit in the abdomen. The assassination is believed to have started a domino effect which led to the break out of the First World War a month later. Princip and others wanted Bosnia to become part of Serbia.","The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand is widely thought to have pulled Germany, Russia, France and Britain into conflict in 1914 .

Mozilla has broken the smartphone price barrier with a prototype for a $25 (£15) device aimed at the developing world. The smartphone, created in partnership with Chinese low-cost chip maker Spreadtrum, will be able to run simple apps and make use of mobile internet. Analysts claim it would appeal to the type of people who currently buy cheap ‘feature’ phones who are locked into long contracts to subsidise the cost of smartphones. The smartphone, created in partnership with Chinese low-cost chip maker Spreadtrum, will be able to run simple apps and make use of mobile internet . The prototype could allow Mozilla to have an early lead in a market that is increasingly being targeted by mobile device manufacturers. The Firefox OS device, however, should be judged at a lower-end standard, said Mitchell Baker, chair of the Mozilla Foundation at a press conference. ‘Imagine the phone in your pocket is a feature phone. Imagine, when you go buy one of these devices, that every euro is precious to you,’ Mr Baker said. ‘Looking at the richness and power we're able to offer to this market, you'll be astonished. Then imagine where we can go from there.’ As well as the prototype low-cost smartphone, Mozilla launched several high-end models, including the Huawei Y300 (pictured) Huawei has launched its first Firefox OS smartphone today at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Dubbed, the Huawei Y300, the 4-inch handset runs Firefox OS v1.1, features a dual-core 1GHz Snapdragon 8225 processor, 512MB RAM, 4GB storage, 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 2.1, a 5-megapixel rear camera and a VGA front camera. The device seems to have the same basic specifications as its earlier Android smartphone. The company did not give a concrete timeline, though there are reports of a release in the next couple of months. Final pricing is also yet to be confirmed. Other brands are expected to make similar announcements over the next couple of days at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona. ‘These solutions expand the global accessibility of open web smartphones to first-time and entry-level smartphone buyers by reducing the time and cost required for handset makers to bring these devices to market,’ said Spreadtrum in a press statement. Jay Sullivan, Mozilla’s chief operating officer, told MWC that Mozilla plans to add 12 markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa this year to the 15 markets it entered by the end of last year. Individual partners are expected to release the dates of availability for each market. ‘We are about bringing people online,’ Mr Sullivan said during the introduction. A spokesman for Mozilla told MailOnline that Firefox is able to run so well on low-end handsets with because it 'cuts out the middle man.' He said he expects phones to become even cheaper and the specifications to increase as more people adopt the Firefox OS. At last year’s MWC, 18 wireless carriers supported the development of an open mobile operating system by Mozilla to build out a range of cheaper smartphones. In addition to the $25 (£15) smartphone, Mozilla also launched several high-end models, including devices from Huawei and ZTE.","Smartphone created in partnership with Chinese chip maker Spreadtrum .

A futuristic skyscraper measuring more than 3000ft tall is planned to be built in Saudi Arabia. But for engineers, it’s a tall order and they are trying to work out how to construct the massive tower by testing methods of pumping wet concrete, which would need to travel half a mile skywards. The Kingdom Tower, which is intended to be erected in Jeddah, is planned to be 3,280ft (1km) tall but there are huge challenges to be overcome in its construction, including how to build tall lifts and reduce its overall weight. A tall order: The Kingdom tower, which is intended to be erected in Jeddah, is planned to be 3,280ft (1,000metres) tall. An artist's impression of what the finished development could look lie is pictured . The shape of the tower is designed to reduce 'wind load' which increases with height. Its tapering wings are an aerodynamic shape to reduce structural loading due to wind. It is a similar shape to the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai, which also has quite a stiff shape. The differing shapes at different levels mean wind loads will go around the building. One of the challenges is to build the tower so that it is not too rigid, but not too flexible so that it is unstable or people feel nauseous. Another challenge for super tall buildings is the use of lifts and fire escapes, which in effect mean expensive unusable space. The challenge of pumping concrete so high up a single, pressurised pipe is a huge engineering undertaking. The developers of the massive tower have confirmed that a company named Advances Construction Technology Services (ACTS) has begun investigations on the materials needed to build the monster skyscraper. They are said to be around half a million cubic metres of concrete and approximately 80,000 tonnes of steel, The Saudi Gazette reported. The skyscraper is intended to be the centrepiece of the Kingdom City development beside the Red Sea and have 200 floors, 160 of which would be habitable. It is estimated to cost $1.23bn and would be 568ft (173metres) taller than Dubai’s Burj Khalifa tower. ‘ACTS will also deploy special equipment . to evaluate the rheological properties of concrete to ensure concrete . will be pumpable to very high elevations,’ the article said. Problem solving: Engineers will have to solve multiple problems to build the tower, from reducing the structure's weight and making it sway the right amount, to piping concrete almost one kilometre into the sky . Artists' impressions of the towering structure are pictured . The foundations of the tower will be 200ft deep and have to withstand salt water from the Red Sea, Gizmodo reported, meaning that testing the materials has to be the first item on the building agenda. The company will looks at the strength of different high performance concretes, as well as which steel to use. Once they have decided upon the exact materials to use, engineers will have to work out how to pour each floor on top of the last one and it is likely that teams of people will pump millions of tonnes of concrete though a thin, pressurised pipe so that it can be spread out by builders above. Centre piece: The skyscraper is intended to be the centre piece of the Kingdom City development beside the Red Sea and will have 200 floors, 160 of which would be habitable. This is an image of what it might be like to look down from the structure . As the tube could be as narrow as six inches and gravity means that it is not easy to pump wet concrete skywards, this could be one of the most challenging pieces of the whole project. However, a similar technique was used to build the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, which set the world record for the highest concrete pumping. The developers of the massive tower have . confirmed that a company called Advances Construction Technology . Services (ACTS) has begun investigations on the materials needed to . build the monster skyscraper. Two illustrations of what the tower might look like from above  are pictured . The world's tallest man-made structure is Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, which is 2,722 ft (829.8metres) tall. The building gained the official title of 'Tallest Building in the World' at its opening on January 4, 2010 and has 160 floors. Other tall skyscrapers include Shangahai's World Financial Centre, which is 1,599ft (487metres) tall and Taipei 101 at 1,474ft (449metres) tall - both of which have 101 floors. Since the 1960s engineers have have mostly used tubular designs innovated by Bangladeshi-American structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan to build skyscrapers. This engineering principle makes the buildings structurally more efficient and stronger and reduces the use of material to keep costs down while allowing the buildings to reach greater heights. Engineers managed to deliver six million . cubic feet of concrete to higher levels of the building through a single . tube and this all had to be done at night so that temperatures were low . enough for the concrete to set. It is not absolutely certain that the . Kingdom Tower will be built, but the tests could prove whether it would . be possible to create it. Experts have been discussing whether it is possible to build such a tall skyscraper for a few years, after the project was proposed in 2010. Dr Sang Dae Kim, the director of the Council on Tall Buildings told Construction Weekly: ‘With Kingdom Tower we now have a design that reaches around one kilometre in height. Later on, someone will push for one mile, and then two kilometres. ‘At this point in time we can build a tower that is one kilometre, maybe two kilometres. Any higher than that and we will have to do a lot of homework.' ‘In terms of practicalities, we don't need to build at two kilometres - but someone with a lot of money might still want to do it.’ It is not absolutely certain that the Kingdom tower will be built, but the tests could prove whether it would be possible to create it, in theory. An illustration of what the luxurious lobby might look like is pictured . The proposed tower is estimated to cost $1.23bn and would be 568ft (173metres) taller than Dubai's Burj Khalifa tower, which is currently the world's tallest building (pictured)","The Kingdom Tower will measure 3,280ft (1km) tall if it is built in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to provide views of the Red Sea .

Married mother Ethel Anderson, 31, was told she was a 'parents' worst nightmare,' on Monday as she was jailed in Tampa, Florida. Judge Chet Tharpe told Anderson in court that she manipulated the boy's parents into believing he was safe and groomed the child for sex. Anderson was charged with nine counts of molesting a student after it was discovered that she was having sex with a boy who was 12-years-old at the time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Married mother Ethel Anderson, 30, was told she was a 'parents' worst nightmare,' on Monday as she was jailed in Tampa, Florida . Tears streamed down Anderson's face as she was sentenced, but Judge Thorpe, right, showed little sympathy as he accused her of grooming the child . Anderson had denied the charges but her victim, now 14, took the stand in September to testify that the alleged abuse . started four or five weeks into their tutoring sessions when she would . kiss him and perform oral sex on him in her home. He told the court: 'I felt like she was a girlfriend, I loved her and she said that I was her boyfriend and she loved me. 'She would rub on my legs, kiss on my ears, neck and stuff like that... We would tongue kiss.' The former 'teacher of the year', from Riverside, Florida, who has a six-year-old child, told the judge today she is not a sexual predator and not a risk to society according to Fox. But the boy's mother showed no signs of forgiveness. 'Anger and hatred don't even begin to explain how I feel about what you took from my son,' the boy's mother said in a statement read at the sentencing by prosecutors. 'His innocence is lost forever.' Anderson wept in court as she claimed that she was not a threat to society and was not a predator - but her victim's mother and the judge disagreed . Anderson was described by a judge as a 'parent's worst nightmare' Anderson, who worked as a language arts . teacher at Mango Elementary School, cried as she listened to the teen's . testimony earlier this year and denied the charges when she took the stand. When confronted about the 230 pages of racy text messages she said they were just sexual therapy that she was using on the 'troubled student' to motivate him. She told the court: 'At the time, with him struggling with school and having behavioral issues and anger issues, acting out at home and not being able to connect with his family, the way that he and his parents felt, that was my purpose. 'To gain his attention and, yes, I did it in an inappropriate way.' The mother claimed the boy would threaten her, telling her things like, 'keep playing you're gonna lose your child'. The boy also told the court that he did not want to lose his virginity to a teacher and would tell her to stop, but she persisted because she 'wanted him so bad', ABC reports. The parents of the young boy were suspicious of their son's close relationship to the Anderson and tipped off police. Wearing a wire, the boy's mother later confronted Anderson, when she admitted having oral sex with him. The tape was played to the jury. In her testimony, Anderson testified she only admitted to sex acts in the secretly-recorded confession by the boy's mother, only because that is what she thought the mother wanted to hear. The 30-year-old turned down a 15-year prison deal followed by 15 years of probation and a jury decided her fate. The boy has since transferred schools.","Married mother Ethel Anderson, 31, was told she was a 'parents' worst nightmare,' on Monday as she jailed in Tampa, Florida .

Google today added stunning footage of the Arctic Tundra and its Polar Bear inhabitants to Street view - and also revealed staff had had a close encounter when capturing the images. Aware of the animal's ferocity, Google wisely decided to mount its cameras on top of a 'Street View ice buggy' rather than its traditional backpack - but this didn't stop one animal taking a closer look. The images, to celebrate International Polar Bear Day, were captured in Churchill. Scroll down to explore the area on Street View . Too close for comfort: Google's Street View buggy gets a little too close to comfort as it tries to photograph polar bears in the Arctic . Up close and personal: Google staff captured this image of a bear trying to scale their vehicle to get a closer look at the camera mounted on its roof . The Street View Trekker camera took more than a year to develop. It weighs 40lb and includes a multi-lens 15-megapixel camera, an on-board hard drive, and enough battery to run for an entire day. Cameras are positioned to give a 360-degree view so every possible angle is captured and photos are automatically captured every 2.5 seconds. The Trekker can be fitted inside a backpack meaning it can be worn by Google photographer - or mounted on vehicles to avoid bear attacks. Google worked with Krista Wright, Executive Director of Polar Bears International to capture the images, converting one of the organisation's research vehicles into a roving 360 degree camera. She revealed a buggy was the only option to capture the animals. 'In Inuit poetry, the polar bear is known as Pihoqahiak, the ever-wandering one,' she said. 'Some of the most majestic and elusive creatures in the world, polar bears travel hundreds of miles every year, wandering the tundra and Arctic sea ice in search of food and mates. 'Today, with the help of Street View, we’re celebrating International Polar Bear Day by sharing an intimate look at polar bears in their natural habitat.' The Street View Trekker, usually carried on a backpack was mounted on a Tundra Buggy, with the help of outfitters Frontiers North. 'This allowed us to travel across this fragile landscape without interfering with the polar bears or other native species,' said Wright. 'Through October and November we collected Street View imagery from the shores of Hudson’s Bay as the polar bears waited for the sea ice to freeze over.' Google's close encounter: Staff were stunned when a bear tried to climb onto their trck to get a closer look at the camera mounted on top of it . 'We’ve joined forces with Google Maps to collect Street View imagery from a remote corner of Canada’s tundra: Churchill, Manitoba, home to one of the largest polar bear populations on the planet.' PBI has been working in this region for more than 20 years, and claims to have witnessed firsthand the profound impact of warmer temperatures and melting sea ice on the polar bear’s environment. It hopes that regular visits from the Google team will help it spot changes. The bear then moves to the back of the truck - causing staff to make a hasty exit inside . 'Understanding global warming, and its impact on polar bear populations, requires both global and regional benchmarks. 'Bringing Street View to Canada's tundra establishes a baseline record of imagery associated with specific geospatial data—information that’s critical if we’re to understand and communicate the impact of climate change on their sensitive ecosystem. 'As we work to safeguard their habitat, PBI can add Street View imagery to the essential tools we use to assess and respond to the biggest threat facing polar bears today.' Explore the area on Google's Street View Below . The trekker is usually mounted on a backpack . The organisation has also been working with Google to create a live 'bear tracker' 'We also use the Google Maps API to support our Bear Tracker, which illustrates the frozen odyssey these bears embark on every year. 'As winter approaches and the sea ice freezes over, polar bears head out onto Hudson Bay to hunt for seals. 'Bear Tracker uses of satellite monitors and an interactive Google Map to display their migration for a global audience.' The project, which can be seen below, lets people track the animals in real time as they move.

The breathtaking images reveal an unrivalled view of aurora over Australia as well as an incredible shot of the moon setting on the Earth’s blue atmosphere. ‘Flew over fascinating aurora at south of Australia a few hours ago,’ Wakata tweeted yesterday, before posting these stunning shots of his view to his 71,000-strong Twitter army. 'Flew over fascinating aurora at south of Australia a few hours ago,' astronaut Koichi Wakata tweeted yesterday, before posting this stunning shot of his view to his 71,000-strong Twitter army . An aurora is caused by collisions between electrons from space with the oxygen and nitrogen in Earth’s upper atmosphere. The electrons -which come from the Earth’s magnetosphere -transfer their energy to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms and molecules, making them ‘excited’. As the gases return to their normal state, they emit photons, small bursts of energy in the form of light to create the spectacular light shows that can be seen from Earth. The Southern Lights, known as the aurora australis, often take the shape of a curtain of light, or a sheet, when seen from Earth. They are commonly seen as green and sometimes as red. Like the Northern Lights, the aurora australis is strongest in an oval centred on the south magnetic pole putting on stunning shows in the vast expanse of Antarctica. When the solar cycle is near its maximum, the Southern Lights can sometimes be in New Zealand, southern Australia as seen in these images, and southern Chile and Argentina. Auroras are a spectacular sign that our . planet is electrically connected to the sun. These light shows are . provoked by energy from the sun and fuelled by electrically charged . particles trapped in Earth’s magnetic field.

This is the first time it’s been developed to run on smaller devices with mobile batteries. Fujitsu said: ‘While technologies already exist that convey texture by vibrating the touchscreen display panel itself or by generating static electricity, Fujitsu Laboratories has developed the industry's first technology to use ultrasonic vibrations to convey tactile sensations by varying the friction between the touchscreen display and the user's finger. ‘This technology enables tactile sensations – either smooth or rough, which had until now been difficult to achieve – right on the touchscreen display. 'Users can enjoy realistic tactile sensations as they are applied to images of objects displayed on the screen.’ By varying the ultrasonic vibrations, using a layer beneath the screen, this reduces friction and creates what Fujitsu calls a ‘floating effect.’ By varying the ultrasonic vibrations, using a layer beneath the screen, this reduces friction and creates what Fujitsu calls a 'floating effect'.

This tricks the brain into think the screen is slippery, and mimics liquid. To create a ‘bumpy or rough’ touch sensation, the prototype table quickly switches between high and low friction, in response to where the fingers are placed on the screen. This combination of tactile information, visual information from the display, and audio information from the speakers can trick the brain into thinking it’s touching something physical. Disney researchers have worked with a different technology to create a similar effect. They used an algorithm for 2D touchscreens that modify the friction between a user's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at. Disney Research said the technology can be used to feel soft, fragile features (pictured) Examples demonstrated by Fujitsu include a Japanese harp, which gives users the sensation of plucking the strings of a koto, a traditional Japanese harp. The DJ demonstration gives the impression that users are touching a CD placed on a mixing deck, using volume and other controls as if they were physical buttons. As a user turns the lock in the Vault demonstration, sound and tactile feedback gives the illusion of turning a combination lock on a safe. One key feature of Disney's algorithm is that it can be implemented in real-time. A 3D model of objects (like the kettle seen here) can be zoomed and panned in real-time to sense fine edge and protruding features of the object . While the Alligator demonstration gives the sensation of touching the skin of a real-life alligator. Fujitsu continued: ‘By enabling more realistic and intuitive operability, the tactile sensory technology in this prototype has wide-ranging potential applications, including for electronic product catalogues, on tablets and other devices.’ The technology could lead to textured maps where users can feel tall mountains, new apps for visually impaired people and more interactive touchscreen games.

The say the smaller stones, known as bluestones, came from a newly discovered site in the Preseli Hills in Wales. The stones' rock composition revealed they come from a nearby outcropping, located about 1.8 miles (3 kilometers) away from the site originally proposed as the source of such rocks nearly a century ago - and call into question the theory the stones were floated down the Bristol Channel on rafts. The researchers focused on the 'bluestones', the smaller rocks shown here - and found they came from a site in the Preseli Hills in Wales . Scientists have known the bluestones originated from the Preseli Hills since 1923, when H. H. Thomas from NERC's British Geological Survey recognised the distinctive dark grey spotty rocks, known as spotted dolerites, during fieldwork. Further work in the early 1990s then tried to tie down the specific locations of the rocks' origin by matching the chemistry of the Stonehenge bluestones with those at the proposed origin site. In fact, the rocks actually come from a different site three kilometres away, the new study found. The discovery of the rock's origin, in turn, could help archaeologists one day unlock the mystery of how the stones got to Stonehenge. The new study, published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, suggests that the site researchers had previously thought was the starting place of many of Stonehenge's rocks may not have been the source after all. The research focused on the smaller stones at Stonehenge, called bluestones. The chemistry of these rocks varies, but they all originate from the Preseli Hills in Wales and are thought to have been transported to the Stonehenge site over 4000 years ago. Around 80 of these bluestones, weighing up to three tonnes each, were transported 250 kilometres from southwest Wales to Wiltshire to build Stonehenge. Researcher previously thought they had found the site where the stones came from - but in fact, the rocks actually come from a different site three kilometres away. However, they team admit they still don't know how the stones were transported. 'The Holy Grail question is how were the stones moved and why,' explains Dr Richard Bevins of National Museum of Wales who led the research. 'Many people think humans transported the stones south, down from the Preseli Hills and then up the Bristol Channel on rafts. 'But a second school of thought says these rocks are glacial erratics that were transported by ice to Salisbury Plain and so were available in the local environment. 'We're trying to discover the source of the stones so archaeologists can excavate sites in order to see if they can find evidence for people working the source stones,' he said. Researchers found that at least 55 per cent of the dolerite bluestones came from a location, known as Carn Goedog  (marked), which is farther north than the location Thomas had proposed in 1923, and about 140 miles (225 km) away from Stonehenge . The research could change the theory of how the rocks were brought to Stonehenge . In the new study, the team looked at the minerals, such as chromium, nickel, magnesium oxide and iron oxide, which are part of the crystallizing structures forming in the original magma. The researchers found that at least 55 percent of the dolerite bluestones came from a location, known as Carn Goedog, which is farther north than the location Thomas had proposed in 1923, and about 140 miles (225 km) away from Stonehenge, Bevins said. Scientists have known the bluestones originated from the Preseli Hills since 1923, when H. H. Thomas from NERC's British Geological Survey recognised the distinctive dark grey spotty rocks, known as spotted dolerites, during fieldwork. Further work in the early 1990s then tried to tie down the specific locations of the rocks' origin by matching the chemistry of the Stonehenge bluestones with those at the proposed origin site. 'The earlier research looked at the source of one of the spotted dolerites and tied it down to a specific outcrop, Carn Meini. 'When we looked at it again we realised the descriptions of the rhyolites from Carn Alw and those at Stonehenge didn't look the same at all,' says Bevins. The team took images showing the rocks at Stonehenge and the rocks at Carn Alw. They then asked members of the public with no geological background whether they looked the same. Pupils of Highworth Warnford School try to recreate the movement of stones to Stonehenge. The new theory means that the stones were unlikely to have been floated down the Bristol Channel. 'We asked people ""does A look like B?"" and everyone said no,' Bevins continues. 'This is astonishing because this has not been questioned since the original publication by Thomas in 1923.' The team used a new method of identifying the chemical makeup of the rocks, to match the rocks with their origin. They believe that they have now identified Carn Goedog as the source of at least 55 per cent of the spotted dolerite bluestones at Stonehenge. 'If Carn Goedog is the true origin of the dolerites, and Craig Rhos-y-felin is a source of the rhyolitic bluestones then it does bring into question the stones being transported by rafts down to the Bristol Channel, because both of these outcrops lie on the northern side of the Preseli Hills. 'The rocks would have had to be dragged up the hills, across the summits and back down again before they even reached the waterways. 'It's just not likely,' Bevins concludes.","Research focused on the smaller stones at Stonehenge, called bluestones .

Scroll down for video and the full list of England's extinct species . The Scottish Wildcat is much bulkier than a domestic cat, with thick fur and a non-tapered tail. They once roamed the forests and grasslands of Europe, but are now extinct in England, Wales and Scandinavia and numbers in Scotland are critically low with less than 100 remaining . 'It’s so easy to think of species . extinction as something that happened decades ago in England, but year . upon year we continue to lose species, at a rate which is far higher . than would occur naturally,' said Dominic Price, director of the Trust. 'Sometimes the list of extinct species names can seem rather dry and scientific so this project aimed to find as many pictures as still existed of these species, to give a fitting testament to the role they played in lighting up our countryside, and highlighting the tragedy that these lights have now gone out.' The Red-backed shrike became extinct in 1988 due to habitat loss, agricultural intensification and egg collecting. These birds, butterflies, beasts and bugs are among hundreds of species which have become extinct in England over the last 200 years . The black-backed meadow ant became extinct in 1988 due to urban development and inappropriate land management . The world is currently experiencing the sixth mass extinction event, with species disappearing as a result of habitat loss, intensification of agriculture and pollution, as well as other human activities. England’s lost species include ants, bees, beetles, butterflies, dragonflies, fish, fleas, fungi, mammals, moths, shrimps, spiders and wasps. The plant Davall’s Sedge was once found at a site in Somerset, but in the 19th Century it was drained for development and has never again been seen in this country. Ivell’s Sea Anemone, which was only ever found in England, has become globally extinct following changes in water quality as its one known site. The Trachea atriplicis or orache moth  became extinct in 1905 due to the drainage of fens.

The Gomphus clavatus or pig's ear fungus became extinct in 1927 due to habitat loss and degradation . In Victorian times the large tortoiseshell butterfly was widespread in southern England, but it became extinct in 1953 due to Dutch elm disease, which eradicated the main larval food source. The black-backed meadow ant became extinct in 1988 due to urban development and inappropriate land management. The great auk (left) was a flightless bird which grew up to 85cm tall and became globally extinct in the mid-19th century. The dainty damselfly (right), which has a blue body, was once found in Essex but severe flooding in 1953 destroyed its breeding sites . In Victorian times the Large tortoiseshell butterfly was common in woods in the south of England. But the beautiful insect has since suffered a severe decline and is now extinct in the British Isles. Causes of decline include climate change and Dutch Elm disease which eradicated its main larval food source. It is now found in mainland Europe, northern Africa and western Asia . The Species Recovery Trust has now launched an online database with information and images of England’s lost species. 'If we continue to allow these extinctions to occur, this country will soon be bereft of the biodiversity that remains,' added Dominic. 'We hope the website will raise awareness and knowledge about conservation issues in this country, and inspire people to become more involved in protecting their local biodiversity.

Amid unusually tight security, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law goes to trial Monday on charges he conspired to kill Americans in his role as al-Qaida's mouthpiece after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Spectators at the trial of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith — the highest-ranking al-Qaeda figure to face trial on U.S. soil since the attacks — will pass through a metal detector before entering a Manhattan courtroom where prosecutors will try to prove to an anonymous jury that the one-time terror network spokesman tried to rally others to kill Americans. Prosecutors say they plan to show jurors during their opening statement a picture of Abu Ghaith seated with bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders on the day after Sept. 11, 2001, as they make statements about the attacks. They say Abu Ghaith described the circumstances of the filming in his post-arrest statement. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and spokesman, goes to trial Monday in New York on charges that he conspired to kill Americans in his role as al-Qaeda's mouthpiece after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . Also during the trial, prosecutors will show jurors post-9/11 videos in which the charismatic bearded man promises more attacks on the United States as devastating as those that demolished the World Trade Center. 'The Americans must know that the storm of airplanes will not stop, God willing, and there are thousands of young people who are as keen about death as Americans are about life,' Abu Ghaith said in an Oct. 9, 2001, speech. In one widely circulated propaganda video, Abu Ghaith can be seen sitting with bin Laden and current al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri against a rocky backdrop. Defense lawyers for the balding and bearded defendant are offering some surprises in the case, including an assertion last week that some of the government's evidence relates to a detainee at Guantanamo Bay with a similar name to Abu Ghaith rather than to the defendant who has pleaded not guilty. U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on Friday called the mistaken identity claim 'utterly meritless'. His attorneys are also trying to enlist help from professed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed to bolster the case for acquittal, though it hasn't come fast enough for them to gain permission from Kaplan for Mohammed to testify, perhaps through a video link to Guantanamo Bay. If convicted, Abu Ghaith could face life in prison. Abu Ghaith is married to Osama bin Laden's eldest daughter, Fatima, one of nearly two dozen children bin Laden was believed to have fathered before he was killed in Pakistan by U.S. special forces in 2011 . Defense attorneys said Friday that Mohammed had provided a 14-page response to written questions, but his lawyer was refusing to turn it over unless there was a guarantee that military lawyers at Guantanamo wouldn't review it. The judge refused to consider the matter further. The Kuwaiti-born defendant was flown to the United States a year ago from Jordan, where he was captured as he headed to Kuwait, which had revoked his citizenship after the Sept. 11 attacks. In an affidavit filed last year as he tried to suppress a 22-page statement he made to authorities, Abu Ghaith said he left Afghanistan in 2002 and entered Iran, where he was arrested and held in prisons and interrogated extensively. Abu Ghaith said he was released from Iranian custody on Jan. 11, 2013, when he entered Turkey, where he was detained and interrogated before his Feb. 28, 2013, release. He said he was heading home to Kuwait on a plane to see family when the flight landed instead in Amman, Jordan, where he was handcuffed and turned over to American authorities. Abu Ghaith is married to bin Laden's eldest daughter, Fatima, one of nearly two dozen children bin Laden was believed to have fathered before he was killed in Pakistan by U.S. special forces in 2011. Before heading to Afghanistan in 2000, Abu Ghaith was an imam at a Kuwaiti mosque and taught high school religion classes until 2000. Abu Ghaith is accused of conspiring to kill Americans in his role as al-Qaeda's mouthpiece after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . When he was brought to the United States for trial, some criticized the move, saying al-Qaida leaders should not receive the protections offered by a civil court trial. But numerous pre-trial hearings have gone on without a hitch in a courthouse that has featured more than a half dozen major al-Qaida-related terrorism trials over the last two decades stemming from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, a 1993 plot to blow up New York City landmarks including the United Nations, the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa and a plot to blow up a dozen U.S. airliners over the Far East in 1995. Attorney General Eric Holder announced in November 2009 that Mohammed would be tried in federal court in New York City in the Sept. 11 attacks, but the decision was reversed months later after city officials complained that the trial would impose large security costs on the city and be disruptive to the local economy.","Sulaiman Abu Ghaith to stand trial in Manhattan on Monday .

Police were waiting for them with buses and vans to speed the process. Protesters cheered as U.S. Park Police warned them that blocking the sidewalk or strapping themselves to the fence would lead to their arrest. In all, 372 were arrested, police said. Organizers estimate that about 1,000 people participated in the protest overall. The protesters were speaking out against the $5.4billion pipeline being proposed by Canadian energy firm TransCanada Corp. If built, the pipeline will transport crude oil from Alberta to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It's currently under review by the State Department and other agencies, but President Obama has a final say on whether it gets approved. Their cause: Some of the protesters held up signs like 'don't tarnish the earth' while others changed 'climate justice now' Climate change: The protesters believe the proposed pipeline will worsen global warming .

'If the Democratic Party wants to keep our vote, they better make sure President Obama rejects that pipeline,' said Nick Stracco, a 23-year-old student at Tulane University in New Orleans. Supporters for the pipeline however, believe it will be good for the U.S. economy by creating thousands of temporary construction jobs and improving energy security. 'Today's protest represents a fringe minority of people against any use of fossil fuels,' said Matt Dempsey of Oil Sands Fact Check. 'This extreme position is well outside the American mainstream.

By monitoring them throughout one night in realtime, they looked at why sleep is so important and what can be learned from the vast variety of animal sleep patterns. For the experiment, they rigged the zoo with a complex system of over 30 night-vision cameras and 20 infra-red motion sensors, which spied on the animals throughout the night. They typically found that animals most likely to be prey slept less than those at the top of the food chain. The documentary will show meerkats in their nests sleeping with an ear open for danger, despite being piled on top of each other in an adorable sleep heap and flamingos arranging themselves so they can keep a wary eye out for nocturnal predators. Ms Bonnin told The Radio Times: ‘When the meerkats are asleep, the matriarch will be in the middle and she will have the deepest sleep.

The programme will show that dolphins have come up with ingenious solutions to allow them to sleep while swimming – by shutting down each side of their brains alternately, while keeping the opposite eye open for navigational purposes and to resurface and breathe. Ms Bonnin said that getting to the bottom of why animals and humans need certain amount of sleep and why is a ‘holy grail’ for scientists. The programme will show that dolphins have come up with ingenious solutions to allow them to sleep while swimming - by shutting down each side of their brains alternately, while keeping the opposite eye open for navigational purposes . ‘Historically you think that the most highly evolved animals will need the most sleep, to recover and consolidate memory. But what’s becoming clear is that it’s got nothing to do with brain size or metabolic activity or where in the evolutionary tree the animal sits. It’s really all about what it has to do in its environment to survive.’ The documentary says that giraffes typically sleep for two hours a night, but the National Sleep Foundation says they can survive without shut eye for weeks. The golden dormouse balances itself on a tree branch to sleep and the tiniest movement wakes it up straight away. Rats have similar sleeping patterns to humans and need rest to be alert and learn new tasks the next day.Scientists study animals to try and find treatments for human sleep disorders. Both humans and some animals - including the octopus and cuttlefish - display rapid eye movement, which is associated with deep sleep and dreams. In deep sleep, dogs have been known to bark and twitch their legs to run lying down, platypuses imitate killing crustaceans in their sleep and humans have been known to talk as well as sleepwalk. Some pet cats and dogs have been caught on camera sleepwalking. Some scientists think that the amount animals sleep can depend upon their metabolic rate, while others think it has to do with surviving in a given environment. Smaller animals tend to need more sleep than larger ones, yet top predators such as lions sleep for over eight hours a day. Land-grazing animals like giraffes and cows spend so much time eating that they don’t have much time left for sleep. Horses stand 98 per cent of the time, making it difficult for them to sleep deeply, while other animals have to keep an eye or ear open for predators. Some birds sleep with an eye open, while the African Papio papio baboon sleeps on its heels in an awkward pose to make it difficult for it to sleep deeply. Marine animals such as dolphins keep one hemisphere of their brains awake so they can swim and breathe while they are sleeping.","Sleep experts spent a night a Bristol Zoo with hi-tech cameras to spy on the animals through the night .

'She loves chocolate and if she smells it we have to run in to another room. We give her some chocolate as a special treat, but not too often because it's not good for her.

Raccoons are on average 24 to 38 inches long, and can weigh as much as 23lbs. In the wild the mammals only live for around three years, but can survive until 20 in captivity. Some experts think the dark â€˜maskâ€™ which covers their eyes may reduce glare from the sun and help them to see at night. Their five-fingered paw has been likened to a human hand and, as Liz Kirby attests, makes them very capable of getting round the house and into unexpected places. Raccoons are considered pests in their native USA, and states with large populations have issued advice on how to keep them out of properties. In urban environments, much like foxes, they can take to rooting through rubbish bags for food. Raccoons can eat almost anything, though their main diet tends to be insects and plantlife. The first written record of the raccoon comes in a journal entry from pioneer Christopher Columbus. The species is especially fond of water and swimming, thought it can run as fast as 15 miles per hour on ground. Raccoons are thought to be intelligent animals, and studies have shown they can remember solutions to tasks for as long as three years.","Phill Kirby and Liz Kirby bought six-month-old Zella over the internet .

Misty Copeland managed to dance her way from a childhood spent living in a highway motel with a struggling single mother and five siblings onto the world stage as the second black woman in the history of the American Ballet Theatre to gain the status of soloist. In her new memoir, Life in Motion: An Unlikely Ballerina, Copeland reveals her improbably jounrney from poverty in San Pedro, California, to the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, according to extracts in the NY Daily News. Copelandâ€™s mother, Sylvia DelaCerna, had six children she could barely support. After several marriages and other failed relationships, the family ended up living in at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, a roadside motel neighbored by liquor stores and taco stands. Scroll down for video . Now 31, American Ballet Theatre dancer Misty Copeland has experienced a significant rise since first starting ballet at the age of 13 . Misty Copeland dances with Prince during his Welcome 2 America tour at Madison Square in December 2010 . Humble beginnings: Copeland lived with her mother and five siblings at the Sunset Inn in Gardena, a suburb of LA, when she was first discovered as a dancer . At the age of 13, Copeland was discovered on a basketball court at a local Boys & Girls Club of America by Cynthia Bradley, a former dancer and instructor who was starting a program with the club to bring in students on full scholarship who might not be exposed to classical ballet. Copeland was selected to be one of them and, despite being at a late age to start dancing, proved herself to be a natural. She was a fast learner and could execute movements without difficult or hesitation. Bradley became so close to Copeland during their tutelage that she brought her protege to live with her, with Copeland returning to her mother on weekends. However the arrangement ended in a sensational court battle in 1998 after Copeland filed for legal emancipation from DelaCerna so she could live permanently with Bradley. DelaCerna accused Bradley of brainwashing Copeland and successfully fought to regain custody of her daughter. Despite the legal drama, Copeland was signed to the American Ballet company as a student at the age of 17. Big break: At the age of 17, Misty Copeland was signed to the American Ballet Theatre in New York as a student . Family: Mother Sylvia DelaCerna (right) pictured with daughter Misty Copeland (center) and three of her other children . But as her body matured, she was told her curves distracted from the classical line a ballerina should present. She was told her body needed 'lengthening', which is ballet speak for losing weight. Adding to the adversity was her growing awareness that many in ballet didn't welcome a brown. However at 19-years-old she was signed to the company full-time through sheer determination and hard work. 'ABT, seeing how hard I had worked, how well I was performing, eventually stopped asking me to lengthen,' she wrote in her book. 'They came to see things my way, that my curves are part of who I am as a dancer, not something I need to lose to become one.' Misty Copeland's memoir is a about how she battled poverty and racial bias to dance her way to the top . Copeland went on to perform with Prince and TLC, appear in commercials for Coach and Dr. Pepper and develop her own line of sportswear. However she considers her biggest achievement to date as becoming first black woman to ever play the Firebird, which she did in 2012. Making the performance even more triumphant was the fact she did it on a leg riddled with stress fractures that dealt her unbearable pain. 'I was transformed. For the next ninety minutes, I fluttered and darted. I was the Firebird,' she wrote. And I felt no pain. All the training, all the practicing, all the nurturing had come together for this climactic moment. 'They were all there with me, everyone who had sustained me. And so many more. 'This is for the little brown girls.'","Misty Copeland is the second black woman in the history of the American Ballet Theatre to be name a soloist .

They then moved south to Belgravia. As well as its estate in Mayfair and Belgravia, Grosvenor Estate's assets include the Liverpool One shopping complex, and the luxury residential development 3-10 Grosvenor Crescent, in London. It also owns the residential tower Westminster Terrace in Hong Kong. After a dramatic intervention by Historic Scotland in 2012, the Duke had to postpone sending in the bulldozers. The country’s top conservation body officially listed the mansion as an historically important building - meaning a presumption against demolition. The Duke owns all the other homes at Archfary, through a trust, to house estate workers. Historic Scotland scheduled the building as a category C listed building - the same status that protects almost half the country’s listed buildings. The duke’s 96,000 acre estate say it costs between £20,000 and £30,000-a-year to maintain the lodge.

Local MSP Rob Gibson said in 2012 that if the Duke did not need the lodge - and there were no building issues such as asbestos - it should be converted into social housing. The second Duke of Westminster died at the lodge in 1953 aged 74 - just a month after attending the Queen’s coronation. His widow Anne died there 50 years later and it has been empty ever since.

When Simon Tibbs took over at St Faith’s Church, he hoped his congregation would evoke the Christian spirit by welcoming him into the parish. But within nine months the priest had been driven out of his post by disgruntled worshippers after he tried to crackdown on their drinking sessions. Annoyed that  he was trying to ban boozing after services and  making changes at the church, they began a whispering campaign against him. Revd Simon Tibbs was 'hounded out' of the church because he attempted to enforce a booze ban . Last September the 41-year-old cleric, who was dubbed the ‘cyber priest’ after blogging  about a pilgrimage on social networking sites, agreed to step down from the church, in Crosby, Liverpool. But an investigation into his treatment yesterday revealed several members of  the congregation behaved in a way ‘not befitting of a Christian community’ and effectively bullied him into leaving. Fr Tibbs replaced an elderly Sunday school leader . Retired bishop the Right Reverend Stephen Lowe was appointed to look into the ‘serious relationship difficulties’ between the vicar and his worshippers at St Faith’s, which once counted the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr  Robert Runcie, among its congregation. His report said Mr Tibbs unearthed a drinking culture at the church which was akin to a ‘social club’ and blamed an ‘inner circle’ of long-standing, conservative members of the congregation, opposed to change, for his ousting. ‘There was a culture among a very small number of members of St Faith’s that  bullying and the undermining of Simon Tibbs are acceptable as a means to an end  - his removal,’ the Bishop said. ‘Members enjoy Anglo-Catholic worship of a traditional kind but have little interest in either Church growth or mission to the community in which they are  set. ‘Simon challenged something about the culture of St Faith’s and upset some key members of the ‘inner circle’ of St Faith’s power. They felt the maintenance of the historical legacy of the church rested with them and any attempt to change it should meet with fierce and organised resistance. ‘Simon’s critics clearly believe ‘the Church that trained an Archbishop of Canterbury’ and ‘has the biggest quota in the Deanery’ should remain untouched.’ The report also found evidence of ‘political division’ between the left-leaning  priest and a small number of ‘very right-wing’ worshippers. Originally from Sussex, Mr Tibbs studied English Literature at Edinburgh University, and spent time teaching English abroad, before being ordained as a  priest in 2005. Both his father and grandfather were also priests. In 2010 he completed a 400 mile pilgrimage from Edinburgh to the shrine of St  Mary the Virgin in Walsingham, Norfolk, to raise money for Christian Aid, which  he chronicled on Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Youtube. He took over at St Faith’s in January last year after reading about Dr  Runcie’s links to the area and moved into the vicarage with his dog, Poppy. The investigation into the vicar's departure identified 'serious failings' in some church-goers . Originally from Sussex, both Rev Simon’s father and grandfather were also ordained priests.

He . described the church its website as an 'outward-looking inclusive . community formed in the liberal Catholic tradition of the Church of . England'. During his tenure Rev Simon would encourage more family oriented services to persuade young people to join the church. He . held 'pet blessing' services with reports of dogs, cats, rabbits, . guinea pigs, tortoises, hamsters and even snakes sitting in the pews . with their owners. At the . time of his appointment Rev Simon said: 'I came up to visit . and just fell in love with the area and the people here who all seem . amazingly warm and friendly. 'What really struck me as a southerner coming up here was how people are so willing to strike up a conversation with you.' At the time of his appointment Mr Tibbs said: ‘I knew all about Rev Runcie’s background in Crosby and the remarkable life he had. I came up to visit and  just fell in love with the area and the people here who all seem amazingly warm  and friendly. ‘What really struck me as a southerner coming up here was how people are so  willing to strike up a conversation with you.’ Shortly after his arrival, Mr Tibbs began holding more family oriented services  to persuade young people to join the church. He also held ‘’pet blessing’’ services with reports of dogs, cats, rabbits,  guinea pigs, tortoises, hamsters and even snakes sitting in the pews with their  owners. But some parishioners were unhappy with his methods, with one claiming Fr Simon  was ‘not blessed with skills to develop relationships’ and that he ‘upset  several parishioners’ when he sacked the church’s elderly Sunday School teacher. Mr Tibbs is continuing as a minister at St Mary’s Church, also Crosby. Following his resignation, he said: ‘This has been a very difficult period for  me and I am grateful for all those who have supported me. I have made many  friends at St Faith’s and I know there are many who appreciate what I’ve been  trying to do. ‘I now wish to devote my energy to my fruitful ministry at St Mary’s as I seek  to move forward in my ministry.’ The Bishop of Warrington, the Right Reverend Richard Blackburn, said he was ‘greatly saddened’ by the findings of the report and that bullying would not be  tolerated in the Diocese of Liverpool. ‘It is clear that a new fire needs to be kindled at St Faith’s,’ he said. ‘We  must rebuild and we shall rebuild St Faith’s so that it becomes a vibrant,  beating heart of mission.’","Father Simon Tibbs urged a halt to excessive alcohol consumption after church and the replacement of an elderly Sunday school leader .

A woman desperate to lose weight has swallowed a gastric balloon, which works by expanding in her stomach to curb appetite. Lucy Heather from Berkshire says she piled on the pounds after having her two children and was miserable at four stone overweight. After managing to lose a stone and a half on her own she plateaued - and sought the assistance of a Â£3,000 surgery-free gastric balloon, she revealed to Lorraine on the sofa this morning on ITV. Scroll down for video . The Obalon balloon is swallowed as a pill and expands in the stomach to make you feel full . 'I felt it for the first couple of days but now can't,' says Lucy, who has had the balloon in her stomach for two weeks and is eating smaller portions because of it. The balloon can be swallowed in a capsule and expands once inside the stomach. It works by floating on top of the . stomach, stopping you eating quite as much and stimulating the receptors which tell you you're full, sooner. As the device is so new, doctors are as yet unaware of any long-term side effects - though in the short term, Lucy says, the balloon is relatively low risk, and removal through a simple endoscopy is reportedly fast and painless. Critics such as nutritionist Amanda Ursell, who joined her on the sofa, say the balloon will not change your eating habits in the long term. 'Its not a magic bullet,' she says. 'It is absolutely crucial that people realise this. You must invest commitment to weight loss.

'If you are going to do it you have to embrace that you are going to have to change your eating habits afterwards. You have to make the commitment to change your eating habits long term and your lifestyle.' Lucy says she is getting nutritional advice and exercising, and Lorraine will follow her progress and have her back on the show in a few months. 'I haven't noticed any significant side effects, no nausea or anything like that,' says Lucy. Lorraine will have Lucy back on the show in a few months to monitor her progress . Last . month the Mail reported that, unlike other gastric balloon treatments, . the new device, called Obalon, does not require invasive surgery. Instead, in a 10-minute procedure,  patients simply swallow a capsule the size . of a large vitamin pill which contains a deflated balloon. The . capsule is attached to a hollow tube and, once the capsule arrives in . the stomach, the balloon is inflated to the size of an apple. The . capsule dissolves and the tube is removed via the mouth. Patients . receive a second balloon 30 days after the first procedure, with the . option of a third balloon after around 60 days, based on their weight . loss and feelings of fullness. At the end of the treatment plan, a few months later, the balloons are deflated and removed during an outpatient procedure. Patients . are not able to retain the balloons for more than 90 days but the hope . is that the treatment will help them make lifestyle changes which they . will then be able to maintain once the balloons have been removed. Obalon costs from Â£2,995 for a two-balloon treatment. It is currently only available privately. It is aimed at people who are not sufficiently overweight to qualify for weight-loss surgery. Clinical trials in the UK and in the U.S. have shown that patients lose an average of 1st 3lbs in 12 weeks.","Lucy Heather is one of the first British patients to try the Obalon .

The tape of ex-President John F Kennedy, brother Robert and the blonde bombshell has never been seen and was supposedly seized by the Tulane County Sheriff’s Office after William Castleberry defaulted on a debt. William Castleberry claimed to RadarOnline the 8 mm film shows the trio engaging in intercourse, but says it was not made public out of respect for former Yankee great Joe DiMaggio. Family affair: Marilyn Monroe stands between Robert Kennedy (left) and John F. Kennedy at a May 19, 1962, house party just hours after she infamously sang 'Happy Birthday' to the president . It is set to be sold auction Tuesday along with various other memorabilia collected by Castleberry. 'It’s real. I had it for years and I never released it out of respect for Joe DiMaggio… I’m just sick about it and I’m desperately trying to raise money to get it back,’ he told the site. Castleberry, 56, says he lost the tape after lawyers demanded a $90,000 balloon payment while he was paying off a $200,000 judgement for selling a fake statue. ‘They demanded a $90,000 payment I couldn’t afford and that is when the sheriff came in and seized the sex tape and all of my other memorabilia I have been collecting my entire life,’ he told the site. Attorney Ryan Sullivan added that he heard of the tape’s existence and even personally found an 8 mm canister while Castleberry’s house was ransacked by repo men. ‘I was able to locate a 8 mm film in a canister at the house, which was turned over to [authorities],’ said the lawyer, who is representing the plaintiffs ripped off by the phony statue. Sullivan noted that he has not viewed the tape and cannot verify its contents. ‘I have no idea what is on the tape, it could be what Mr. Castleberry says, or it could be a Disney cartoon,’ said Sullivan. ‘The only way anyone will ever know is if they buy it and view it.’ Hollywood star: Marilyn Monroe with gentlemen surrounding her with adoration in a scene from the 1953 film 'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' Castleberry’s valuables will be auctioned off with a minimum bid of $200,000 for the whole collection, Sullivan continued. The family of private eye Fred Otash, hired by the troubled starlet to record her phone calls, admitted last year that he spied on JFK and Monroe during their illicit affair, and said he filmed the tape, according to RadarOnline. Castleberry has until Tuesday to raise the money needed to keep the tape private, failure to do so will result in the auction going forward. He said he’d make the tape public should he recover it and other items including a signed Babe Ruth jersey and books signed by Thomas Edison himself.","The tape was seized by authorities after memorabilia collector William Castleberry defaulted on a judgement .

Six months . later Miss Brown ended the relationship and started seeing Mr Crossley. He was then sacked from his £80,000-a-year job. A source with knowledge of the dismissal said: ‘Kim told Mike that he was in a relationship with a vulnerable person at work, and that it was inappropriate so he had to go. Secret: Miss Hamilton (pictured), a former City trader who joined Blue Cross in 2008, never openly admitted her relationship with Miss Brown . ‘His departure was a direct result of his relationship with Mel. It was an entirely personal thing. But how could it be inappropriate if Kim had also had a relationship with Mel?’ the source told the Sunday Telegraph. A former trustee of the charity added that the sacking of Mr Crossley was ‘hush-hush’, with the circumstances of his departure never being revealed. The charity’s most recent annual report notes: ‘One employee who is no longer employed by Blue Cross received £174,233 during the course of the year.’ It is believed that Mr Crossley was given a year’s salary, a £60,000 payoff and other benefits that had been accrued. Miss Brown, whose relationship with Mr Crossley ended when he left the charity, told friends she had been upset by her treatment by Miss Hamilton. After their relationship ended, Miss Hamilton began seeing one of Miss Brown’s close friends who also worked at the charity. She is said to have sent Miss Brown a Valentine card last February after the relationship had ended, which left her confused. Last August, Miss Brown was found hanged at her flat in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. An inquest will be held later this year. There is no suggestion that her relationship with Miss Hamilton was in any way linked to her suicide. However, police investigating the death are understood to want to look at a laptop on which Miss Brown is said to have kept a personal journal, which included her thoughts on her relationship with Miss Hamilton. It has been claimed that after the laptop was returned to Blue Cross following her death the journal was deleted, but parts of it have now been recovered. Blue Cross is a charity that provides support for pet owners who cannot afford private veterinary treatment, helps to find homes for unwanted animals, and educates the public in the responsibilities of animal ownership . The charity’s website states that Miss Hamilton lives in a ‘sleepy village with her partner Maria and their beloved dogs’. Miss Hamilton split from private investigator Maria Cooper two years ago. She now lives in London with her new girlfriend, who no longer works for Blue Cross. The charity was founded in 1897 and has four animal hospitals, 12 rehoming centres and an income of £31million. Chairman Zair Berry said last night that no comment could be made until after Miss Brown’s inquest, and that Mr Crossley left in 2012 ‘for purely performance-related reasons’. Mr Crossley, who now works for the Marine Conservation Society, declined to comment at his home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.","Blue Cross boss Kim Hamilton, 53, was in relationship with Melanie Brown .

A Cincinnati man who shot his 11-year-old daughter on Sunday has been asked to be let out of jail so he can attend her funeral. Deandre Kelley is facing charges of reckless homicide after Shanti Lanza was hit by a bullet he allegedly fired into the air outside her house. The 34-year-old had been arguing with Shanti's mother, Kristina Lanza, and didn't realize their daughter had been shot until later in the day. Kelley, who is being held on $500,000 bond, was allegedly drunk when he arrived at the couple's Sedamsville home at about 2am. Shanti was hiding in her bedroom while her parents argued outside, but she was hit by a stray bullet as Kelley allegedly fired four times into the air, police told ABC5. Kelley's attorney, Hugh McCloskey Jr, said the death appeared to be an accident and appealed for his client to be allowed to attend the funeral for Shanti on Saturday. 'At the request of Shantiâ€™s family, [I] filed this Motion seeking an Order from this Court allowing Mr Kelley a furlough from the Hamilton County Justice Center in order to participate, in any manner that this Court deems appropriate and under the supervision of the appropriate law enforcement,' he wrote. A judge is expected to rule today on whether Kelley, who could be facing up to three years in prison, will be allowed to attend the service. Antwone Kelley said his brother had left the family's home unaware that his daughter had been shot. 'He might drink a little bit but that . was his child, that was his baby. He didn't mean to do this at all. He's . more heartbroken than anybody,' he said. Loss: Shanti Lanza was shot as she hid in her bedroom while her parents argued .

Malcolm Collins contacted his brother-in-law so he could buy Owen Hill's £1.8million house for himself at a reduced rate . This is the first picture of the estate agent who tried to swindle a dying pensioner out of £800,000 by selling his house for just over half its real value. Malcolm Collins contacted his brother-in-law so he could buy Owen Hill’s £1.8million house for himself at a reduced rate. The sale was halted only when Mr Hill’s neighbours intervened – but by this time the pensioner, who had felt ‘humiliated’ and ‘distressed’ after discovering how he had been duped, had died. The case has led to concerns that many other vulnerable people could have fallen victim to similar schemes by aggressive estate agents. Mr Hill, 88, had served in the Merchant Navy on the Arctic Convoys during the Second World War, and had been very astute in business when he was younger. But he had become very unwell in his old age, was frail and confused and had lost much of his sight, and had no concept of how much his three-storey townhouse in one of the country’s most exclusive areas was worth. In March last year, he was contacted by upmarket Bargets estate agents – owned by Neil Stone, 50, a self-made millionaire who lives in a £3million four-bedroom house in Hampstead Garden Suburb, North London. The London agency, which is based in Regent’s Park and deals in properties worth as much as £30million, had written to many wealthy homeowners in St John’s Wood, North London, as part of a marketing tactic. The letter from the agency claimed it had a  ‘genuine buyer’ interested in  purchasing Mr Hill’s home. Neil Stone, 50 (left), a self-made millionaire, owns the estate agents that Collins works for. Jason Harris, 45 (right), Collins's brother-in-law, offered £1million to buy the property which was actually worth £1.8million . Thinking the letter had been addressed to him personally, Mr Hill responded and was quickly visited by Mr Collins, 41, on behalf of Mr Stone’s firm. According to court documents, Mr Hill was ‘in a fragile and vulnerable physical and mental condition’ when he was subsequently ‘misled and taken advantage of’ by the agent. Rather than carry out a valuation on Mr Hill’s house, Mr Collins asked the confused old man how much he wanted. When Mr Hill said £1million, Mr . Collins did not tell him it was worth almost double, or put the property . on the open market. Instead, he called Jason Harris, 45, who is married . to Mr Collins’s sister, so he could buy the house for himself at the . reduced rate. Mr Hill had no . idea Mr Harris who works as acquisitions director of property company . First Urban Group, was related to Mr Collins. The elderly man was . subsequently driven to a lawyer to exchange contracts. The . sale was stopped only when horrified neighbours found out. They . threatened to take the agents to court and forced the sale to be frozen. Property: Mr Hill lived alone in the terraced house in sought-after St John's Wood . Neighbourly: It was only when Mr Hill told his neighbours in the street about the proposed sale that it was called off when they brought in other lawyers to stop the deal . The neighbours claim that Mr Hill was . caused considerable distress and embarrassment by the realisation that . he had been duped, which ‘almost certainly’ hastened his death in May . from lung cancer and pneumonia. Jane Cooper has spent the past year fighting through the courts to have the deal rescinded and legal costs covered by Bargets. She . has since organised the sale of Mr Hill’s house for more than . £1.8million so his next of kin in Australia would receive the full worth . of his property. Vulnerable: Owen Hill, 88, agreed to sell his £1.8million home for £1million after an estate agent visited his home . Mrs Cooper, a retired solicitor, said it had been obvious Mr Hill was extremely unwell at the time he signed over his house. ‘Owen couldn’t see clearly and was terribly muddled,’ she said. ‘He had no concept of money. It was obvious to anyone he met that Owen was very, very frail.’ Mr Hill’s neighbours used GSC Solicitors to battle with Bargets to cover the huge legal costs involved in fighting for justice for Mr Hill. They settled out of court late last year. Papers were lodged at the London Mercantile Court and Bargets’s insurers settled by paying £71,000 towards the £100,000 the episode cost Mr Hill’s estate. Bargets is now being investigated by the National Federation of Property Professionals. With no official regulator, however, none of the agents can be struck off or officially penalised. Mr Collins, who has worked at Bargets for three years, was initially given a ‘second chance’, but he was sacked on Friday after his boss was confronted by the Mail. He declined to comment. Mr Stone apologised and insisted nothing similar had ever happened before or would ever happen again. ‘It was an error of judgment,’ he said. ‘When I found out the true events, we wanted to get it rescinded. So at least we actually did something about it. I’m sorry for the whole debacle. I’ve never had problems before.’ Mr Harris, who lives in a £1million house in Stanmore, North London, declined to comment.","Owen Hill responded to a letter saying a buyer was interested in his home .

"By . Ian Birrell In Crimea . PUBLISHED: . 04:01 EST, 2 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:10 EST, 2 March 2014 . Ukraine put its armed forces on full alert and braced for an invasion on Saturday night after accusing Russia of ‘naked aggression’ for sending 6,000 troops into its Crimean territory. Tensions rose alarmingly as Russian soldiers, armed with machine guns, surrounded key strategic sites on the peninsula, including the parliament and Council of Ministers. Russian President Vladimir Putin won parliamentary backing to deploy his forces anywhere in Ukraine under the pretext of protecting Russian interests. Occupation: Armed men patrol around the regional parliament building in the Crimean city of Simferopol on Saturday . But Ukraine’s new interim president Oleksandr Turchynov warned his country was threatened with a ‘military invasion and occupation’ and ordered increased security at nuclear power plants and airports. Prime Minister David Cameron said last night there was ‘growing concern’ over the crisis. He added: ‘There can be no excuse for outside military intervention in Ukraine, a point I made to President Putin when we spoke yesterday.’ US President Barack Obama also spoke to Putin in a 90-minute call and warned of the consequences of continued ‘violation of international law’. But Russia’s actions seem to  be calling his bluff as a hitherto  covert invasion turned into a chillingly obvious new wargame. The news came as: . The UN Security Council called an emergency meeting, and Ukraine has asked the four permanent  members other than Russia – the US, Britain France and China – for help as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was ‘gravely concerned’ about the situation. President Barack Obama has warned Russia against any military intervention in Ukraine after the country's new leaders accused Moscow of deploying forces in the Crimea region . Flashpoints: Russia moves in . Yesterday began with troops surrounding key positions. Soldiers patrolling in the Crimean capital Simferopol wore no insignia but spoke with Russian accents. Then Russia claimed gunmen from Kiev tried to seize the Crimean Interior Ministry, and although the claims were heavily contested the pro-Russian Crimean premier asked for Putin’s help to ensure peace in his region, which was granted. After President Obama’s warning, European leaders urged all sides to refrain from anything that might increase tensions. It is hard to envisage a more volatile situation – and Britain, along with the US, is a guarantor of Ukrainian territorial integrity under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Nato ambassadors will meet today to assess the situation. Yet the reality on the ground is that Russia is already controlling Crimea with support from many residents. Crowds flocked yesterday to the centre of Simferopol to show support for the Russian soldiers. ‘I am very happy to see them here,’ said Galina Filippenko, a pensioner in Lenin Square. Others waved military flags, sang patriotic songs and chanted: ‘Russia, Russia, Russia.’ 'Invasion': These troops, amassed outside the Crimean town of Balaclava, have been decried by the Ukrainian government as an occupying force . There is growing antagonism towards the West over its support for the new government in Kiev. There were also chants of ‘Berkut, Berkut’, a reference to the special forces disbanded after being accused of killing 88 protesters in Kiev. At Simferopol’s Berkut base I found barricades erected, drivers honking horns in support and people taking food to the paramilitaries. One man warned of bloodshed if Ukrainian forces moved on them. According to one witness, the latest Russian troops went into Simferopol city centre shortly after 5am. Within hours, troop trucks were on the streets and cordons were erected around government buildings. The soldiers were supported by locals organised into what they called civil defence groups, who blocked streets, supported by traffic police. ‘We are here to ensure stability and return power to our legally elected president,’ said the leader of one unit. ‘The revolution in Kiev was illegal. We think it was carried out by the Western powers. Their goal is to cause civil war.’ Russia’s foreign ministry claimed ‘unknown armed men from Kiev’ had tried to seize the Crimean Interior Ministry on Friday night, leaving several people injured. It said the assault was defeated by ‘the decisive action of self-defence squads’. But guards at the ministry yesterday said they were unaware of any overnight attacks. Crimean police also rejected the claims. Among the crowds protesting in front of parliament I found Anatoly Madzhar, 72, who spent 15 years in a Soviet jail and five years exiled in Siberia after joining a 1961 uprising. ‘Even if there are sacrifices now they will be for the benefit of our children,’ he told me. Madzhar seemed happy to believe Russian propaganda, which focused heavily on far-Right involvement in the Kiev protests. ‘The people have decided to join Russia where there is no oppression and people are free – and there are no Nazis,’ he said. But support for deposed president Viktor Yanukovych seems to have withered after his flight to Russia, despite his insistence he remains Ukraine’s rightful president. ‘He betrayed his country,’ said activist Marina Fyodorova, 47. ‘He should have stood his ground and taken responsibility for his deeds, even if he was lynched.’ Ukraine’s new president signed a decree yesterday declaring that Thursday’s appointment of Sergiy Aksyonov, the pro-Russian premier of Crimea, was illegal. Aksyonov insisted he had taken control of local troops, customs and tax administration. He also brought forward a referendum on the region’s status to the end of this month. If it goes ahead despite the opposition of the Kiev government, it will almost certainly endorse some form of independence under the wing of Moscow. There are also signs of tensions between the majority Russians and the Muslim Tatars, who comprise 250,000 of the two million Crimeans.

It is available in two launch colours – an intensely deep red inspired by called Rosso California inspited by classic Ferraris of yesteryear, and an elegant Blu California. A Ferrari spokesman said: 'The Ferrari California T epitomises elegance, sportiness, versatility and exclusivity: characteristics that have distinguished every California model since the 1950s.'

It is available in two launch colours ¿ an intensely deep red inspired by called Rosso California inspited by classic Ferraris of yesteryear, and an elegant Blu California . Ferrari said: 'One major challenge involved in the design of the California T was to guarantee it a typically intense, exhilarating Ferrari engine sound. This was achieved through meticulous design work and the use of special manufacturing techniques for essential components.' 'The engine produces a powerful, engaging sound during both the intake and exhaust phases, becoming even more potent as engine speed increases. This the first time a result of this kind has ever been achieved with a turbo engine.' So you may not even want to take advantage of the California T's new infotainment system with an intuitive, high-resolution 6.5in screen featuring both touch-screen and conventional controls.

The new Ferrari California's sleek proportions were penned by the Ferrari Styling Centre in collaboration with Italian styling house Pininfarina. A spokesman said: 'They are very much in keeping with the Ferrari front-engined ethos. The shape of the California T's flanks is inspired by the 250 Testa Rossa's famous pontoon-fender styling. The front wing line stretches back towards the compact, muscular rear, bringing an aerodynamic sleekness and movement to the sides.'

Pina Coladas might not sound like an obvious choice of diet drink but it seems they could be the weight-loss answer we've all been looking for. The Pina Colada diet combines a menu of tropical fruit with healthy protein shakes, weight-loss supplements and regular workouts and claims to result in a new bikini body in just four weeks. Sound too good to be true? FEMAIL put it to the test. Deni lost 10lbs and toned up through following the Pina Colada diet plan and regular gym sessions . DENI SAYS: 'I . had piled on a few pounds over Christmas and, at just 5ft 4in, it was . noticeable, so I decided to see whether the Pina Colada diet could make a difference. Despite its name, the diet allows no alcohol. The Pina Colada moniker comes from the cocktail flavoured protein shakes that I drank five times a week, and from all the mango, papaya and pineapple I ate. The concept behind the plan is to get in the holiday spirit by eating the same healthy . things you might while sunning yourself abroad, thus inspiring you to . get your bikini body back. You start each day with melt water - regular tap water which has been put in the freezer and then melted again. This, say the brains behind the diet, is crucial because the freezing and thawing process removes salts and other harmful material while retaining essential minerals such as calcium, magnesium and natrium. Later, you get to tuck into a meal plan that focuses heavily on vitamin C and is complemented by Garcinia Cambogia tablets, thought by some to help with weightloss, and meal replacement Skinny Shakes.

While . trans fats were all but banned, healthy ones were allowed. I would cook with walnut oil and drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over salads.

The pills contain extracts from the Indonesian garcinia gambogia fruit, which looks like a small pumpkin and is used in curries and chutneys. Its 'magic' component is hydroxycitric acid (HCA). HCA has been found to suppress the appetite, inhibit fat production and increase energy levels - without the negative side effects of caffeine. Another key benefit is its capacity to boost levels of serotonin, relieving stress and low moods which often prompt us to binge eat.

Despite the protein shakes and pills, it didn't feel like I was on a 'diet' - it wasn't torturous and I didn't feel deprived.

"By . James  Nye . and Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 15:06 EST, 2 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:31 EST, 3 March 2014 . Defiant: Piers Morgan declared that he is now looking forward to doing higher profile interviews with bigger names after his live show was axed by CNN . Piers Morgan has claimed the imminent end of his much-vaunted nightly show on CNN will actually allow him to do the kind of interviews he always wanted to do on the cable network. Morgan, who confirmed the axing of his eponymous live show last week after three-years of inconsistent ratings, said that he will be staying on at CNN. 'I’ll make a deal to do 20 to 25 shows a year, all interviews with big names. That’s what I wanted to do in the first place, not reports on snow storms and that kind of thing,' said Morgan in typically forthright fashion. Indeed, in a sidewalk interview with TMZ, Morgan said that he was relieved his show was over and appeared to imply that some of his daily output through CNN was not substantial enough. 'I'm ready to move on,' Morgan said. 'I want to do big interviews.' He told TMZ that his favorite shows were the ones where major names like the Dalai Lama, former president Bill Clinton and Oprah were interviewed. 'I came to do the show to do big interviews,' he said. 'I wasn't doing enough. I want to do less shows, more big interviews.' Scroll down for video . Morgan's guests in 2014 have included Jordan Belfort, the subject of the movie The Wolf Of Wall Street . Three years after taking over from Larry King in the coveted 9pm slot, ratings for Piers Morgan Live have not matched rivals such as Fox News and MSNBC, causing network president Jeffrey Zucker to pull the plug on the British journalist. The show's ratings have fallen from an audience of two million to around 270,000. The date of the last show has yet to be decided. ‘It’s been a painful period and lately we have taken a bath in the ratings,’ Morgan, 48, told The New York Times. CNN's audience has tired of hearing a Brit weigh in on American cultural issues, Morgan said. During his tenure, he adopted a polarizing stance on controversial topics, in particular on gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, where 26 people, including 20 children, were killed. Morgan said: ‘Look, I am a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarising, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it.' More of the same? Piers Morgan claimed that his interview with former President Clinton was one of the high-points of his reign as nightly talk-show host in the United States . Morgan replaced the acclaimed presenter Larry King, pictured here interviewing Paul McCartney . Plans for a replacement are underway, but Morgan and the network are in talks about him remaining on the air in a different role. ‘Jeff and I have been talking for some time about different ways of using me,’ said Morgan, whose contract with the network ends in September. Morgan made a promising start when his show, previously called Piers Morgan Tonight, aired on CNN on January 17 2011. His first guest was Oprah Winfrey – and he managed to reduce her to tears. During points in the interview Oprah teased Morgan, pointing out that she could cry, but wasn't going to. However, right at the end of their exchange, the 56-year-old broadcaster began to well up as she talked about Martin Luther King. For his final question, Piers sought Oprah's approval, asking her: 'How did I do?' Morgan reduced Oprah Winfrey to tears on his first show in January 2011 . And despite Oprah telling Morgan 'you're good' at various points throughout the interview, she chose to describe him as 'surprising' when asked directly. 'Surprisingly bad?' Piers questioned. 'No just surprising. And that's good. Who doesn't want to be surprised?' Some media critics also warmed to Morgan. 'The premiere of Piers Morgan Tonight revealed host Piers Morgan to be clever, tenacious, vain, a flatterer, and fitfully funny,' said EW.com. Politico said 'Morgan might be just the solution that CNN needs’ and the Philadelphia Inquirer remarked: 'If [Morgan] shows the judgment, skills and news sense he showed… with the toughest first-night assignment a TV talk-show host ever had, he'll make people forget Larry King even more quickly than they already have.' However, others weren’t so kind. One of Morgan’s most difficult shows saw him interview pro-gun campaigner Alex Jones. Morgan had waded into the gun debate in America, publicly calling for a nationwide ban on military-style semi-automatic weapons. Radio host and conspiracy theorist Jones responded by organizing a petition to have Morgan deported, which received over 100,000 signatures. Morgan's world famous interviewees included former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice . Morgan interviewed Jones about gun control shortly afterwards, but Jones spent the majority of the interview shouting at Morgan, often preventing him from expressing his views. The show ended with Jones yelling: 'Don't try what your ancestors did before'. Morgan - who has also presented ITV show Life Stories - has said in the past that he believes he is the best at his job in Britain. He said he rated Michael Parkinson but said he thought he was better than everyone else. Earlier this month, Morgan - former editor of the Daily Mirror - confirmed he had been questioned over claims of phone hacking. He was interviewed under caution at the end of last year by officers investigating claims of illegal interception of voicemails by Mirror Group journalists. No arrest was made and it's thought the matter has gone no further. The Mirror Group was brought into the phone-hacking investigation for the first time in March last year when detectives from Operation Weeting arrested four journalists in dawn raids.","Piers Morgan Live confirmed to be canceled last week after the presenter said his talk show has 'taken a bath in the ratings'

Disturbing video of the moment an off-duty police officer shot dead a Kansas City firefighter hours after his wedding has been released. The upsetting footage recorded by two bystanders, shows 26-year-old Anthony Bruno grappling with officer Donald Hubbard, 42, in the early hours of December 1 outside the the Marriott Muehlebach Hotel after the firefighter assaulted a cab driver. An intoxicated Bruno resists arrest and ends up on top of Hubbard, punching his head, causing the police officer to fire two shots - killing Bruno outside the hotel where he was due to spend his first night as a married man. Scroll Down for Video . Arrest: Donald Hubbard stands over Anthony Bruno in Kansas City as the police attempts to arrest the firefighter . Last month, the Jackson County Prosecutor's Office declared that Hubbard, who was seriously injured during the fight, would not be criminally charged in the shooting. A grand jury issued a no-true bill, which means that the case is closed according to the prosecutors officer. Police reports found that Bruno was drunk following his wedding reception when he attacked a cab driver and then Hubbard, who shot and killed the groom. It was a dispute over a $6 cab fare between Bruno and his wife Stephanie, 29 - who was still wearing her wedding dress - that sparked the tragic series of events. Fatal series of events: Hubbard can be seen here burying his knee (left) into Bruno's head - which causes him to lose his temper and turn on the police officer . Gouging: Bruno begins to punch and gouge Hubbard who shoots the firefighter seconds later . Stephanie Bruno told investigators that the cab driver had thrown money in her face and made a sexual slur - which caused her new husband to get out of the vehicle and begin to punch driver,  Ahmed Alomari. Hubbard, 42, who was still wearing his police uniform, but technically working off-duty as a security guard for the Marriott, approached and chased Bruno after he witnessed the altercation. 'Throughout my entire contact with the suspect, I gave him numerous verbal commands to give me his hands and to stop resisting,' Hubbard told investigators later, according to documents obtained by the Kansas City Star. 'In my attempts to place handcuffs on the suspect, he continued to resist and we eventually went to the ground.' In the cellphone footage, two by-standers observe the altercation between Bruno and Hubbard as they battle on the ground. Firefighter: It was Anthony Bruno's wedding day on November 30th and he was shot dead in the early hours of December 1 . Officer Donald Hubbard, 42, shot fireman Anthony Bruno, 26, in the chest at about 2:30 a.m on December 1 outside the Marriott Muehlebach Hotel in Kansas City . Wounds: Hubbard shot Bruno dead because he feared for his life and the extent of his injuries are visible (right) Bruno is clearly resisting arrest, but events quickly spiral out of control when the officer appears to knee Bruno in the head as he tries to cuff him. This causes Bruno to become enraged and he actively appears to want to overcome the officer, rather than resist arrest. Hubbard is seen looking at the two by-standers and mentioning the word 'help' before Bruno climbs on top of him, begins to gouge his eye and mouth and then start to pummel his dead. 'Hey, don't fight the cop, don't fight the cop!' one of the onlookers shouts, right before the camera's view slips away and two gunshots ring out. 'He was on top of me and I was in an extremely vulnerable position, and I was exhausted from the struggle with the suspect,' Hubbard told investigators later, in the documents obtained by the Star. 'I donâ€™t know how many times he struck me, but I started to black out and saw lines across my eyes. He continued to strike me and I started to lose consciousness, and I believed the suspect was not going to stop hitting me until he killed me. I feared for my life and I drew my weapon, fired two shots center mass.' Ahmed Alomari's injures: He got a blackened eye and bruises on his arm after he said he was beat up by Anthony Bruno . Bruno was struck both times and pronounced dead at a local hospital. Hubbard, a 17-year veteran of the department, is to undergo facial reconstruction surgery for the injuries he suffered during the attack, police confirmed. Hubbard is a command sergeant major in the National Guard with 25 years of service and multiple tours of duty overseas. Bruno joined the Kansas City Fire Department in 2008 and was assigned to Station 17, said Battalion Chief James Garrett. 'At that location, the suspect began fighting the officer in an assaultive manner. Subsequently to this assault, the officer was seriously injured,' Kansas City Police Department spokesman Capt. Tye Grant said to KCTV5. 'Fearing for his life, the officer fired his duty-weapon striking the suspect.' Witness Ashley Janzen says her friend took out a cell phone and started recording, KSDK.com reports. Janzen, a critical care nurse, attempted CPR on site. She told police that Bruno pleaded with her not to let him die. 'If maybe he would have just accepted being detained, none of this would have happened,' Janzen said.","Kansas City firefighter Anthony Bruno, 26, was shot dead by police officer Donald Hubbard, 42, following his wedding .

"PUBLISHED: . 15:25 EST, 3 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:11 EST, 3 March 2014 . Jailed: Prison officer Julie Turton, 54, struck up an intense sexual relationship with a heroin dealer inmate, as well as smuggling drugs and stereo equipment into prison . A senior prison officer who struck up an intense sexual relationship with a heroin dealer inmate and smuggled in drugs hidden inside chocolate Kinder egss for prisoners has been jailed. Julie Turton, 54, exposed herself to a risk of blackmail by . engaging in sexual contact with heroin dealer Danny King, . Birmingham Crown Court heard. The wing manager claimed she had enjoyed the best day of her life during her relationship with King, aged in his 30s, and even sent him an intimate picture of herself on her iPhone when he was transferred to another jail. Turton, who worked at HMP Birmingham, was jailed for two years and eight months after she admitted five charges of . misconduct in public office. She had acquired stereo equipment from Argos . for another prisoner, conducted illicit phone communications with . inmates and supplied cannabis found hidden inside two chocolate Kinder eggs. Robert Price, prosecuting, told the . court that King had been housed on M Wing at HMP Birmingham between . November 2011 and May 2012 before he was moved to HMP Leyhill in . Gloucestershire. Turton's . affair was exposed after police raided her home in May last year and . found a hand-written, but undated, letter from King addressed to 'my . beautiful sexy Julie....' 'In the body of that letter, Danny King was expressing his undying love for Miss Turton,' Mr Price told the court. 'He . spoke in apparently serious terms of future plans, that fate had . brought them together and he spoke of how wonderful the sex would be.' Hidden: Turton smuggled cannabis into the prison where she worked, hidden inside chocolate Kinder eggs . Subsequent . police inquiries established that the lovers had spent almost 400 . minutes chatting over the phone while King was serving his sentence. Jonathan Park, mitigating, told the . court that Turton's life had spiralled out of control after she found . out her husband had been unfaithful. 'At . that stage, for the first time in her life, she felt particularly . isolated and she was emotionally vulnerable,' Mr Park said. Sentence: Turton, who worked at HMP Birmingham, was jailed for two years and eight months after she admitted five charges of misconduct in public office . 'Her . position is that the sexual activity (with King) was restricted to two . occasions, that they happened in a prison setting, and that the activity . itself was a combination of kissing and sexual touching - and on each . occasion lasted no more than five minutes.' Passing sentence, Recorder Thomas Rochford . told Turton, of Hembs Crescent, Hamstead, Birmingham, that her 'special . link' with King and inappropriate friendships with others defied . belief. Pointing out that Turton was well aware her actions would compromise the security of the 160 inmates in her care, the judge told her: 'What you did in your role as a senior prison officer was to form a sexual relationship with Danny King. Persuasion: Arteef Hussain, 25, who is already serving a six-year term for possession of a handgun, was sentenced to a further 12 months for encouraging Turton to supply cannabis . 'The precise details and frequency of . what went on between you is not known, suffice it to say that some sort . of sexual intimacy took place on prison premises in Birmingham. 'You also knew, no doubt, that your sexual relationship was bound to cause serious risks to security and to discipline. 'People like you are trusted and the prison service depends upon the trust that is placed in staff such as you.' Recorder Rochford also sentenced . 25-year-old Arteef Hussain, who is serving a six-year term for . possession of a handgun, to a further 12 months' custody for encouraging . Turton to supply cannabis while he was being held at HMP Birmingham. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Martin Brennan, who led the investigation, said the prison had raised concerns about Turton, who was then dismissed from her post. Pete Small, director of the privately-run prison, said the sentence properly reflected Turton's 'reckless' behaviour. 'As an established prison officer with more than 20 years of experience, Julie Turton not only let herself down, but abused the trust of her colleagues and the prison service,' said Mr Small. 'The overwhelming majority of our staff act with integrity and professionalism to provide a safe environment for prisoners, staff and prison visitors. 'There is no place for misconduct or corruption at the prison and if we have any suspicions over any staff, we will always investigate and, if necessary, work with the police to bring a prosecution as we did in this case.'","Julie Turton, 54, had a relationship with Danny King at HMP Birmingham .

Conservative chairman Grant Shapps has insisted it would be 'crazy' for Boris Johnson not to play a key role in the party's election campaign next year. Mr Johnson reacted angrily to suggestions in Saturday's Daily Mail that David Cameron and George Osborne are trying to persuade him to stand in 2015 so that he is fully bound in to the election result. The Mayor's allies insisted it was 'bull****' that the Chancellor had already personally delivered him a message saying that he should attempt to return to the Commons next year. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps appearing on BBC1's current affairs programme, The Andrew Marr Show . It has been widely assumed that Downing Street would be against a 2015 Commons comeback, since it would suggest Mr Johnson wanted to be in place to challenge for the leadership because he expects Mr Cameron to lose the election and be ousted as party leader. But a close ally of the Prime Minister told the Mail that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne were 'telling Boris to stand' and 'own this campaign as much as anyone else'. There has even been speculation that Mr Johnson could be offered a formal campaign role, even the party chairmanship – an offer that would be difficult to turn down. Mr Johnson's supporters saw the intervention as an attempt to call his bluff – and prepare the ground in case he does decide to stage an early return to the Commons. Yesterday, an ally of the Mayor told the Mail on Sunday that he believed Mr Osborne, who is also tipped as a future Tory leader, was responsible for trying to 'destabilise Boris'. 'This is nothing to do with party loyalty and everything to do with Osborne and Cameron trying to destabilise Boris. He saw it coming a mile off. There has been speculation that Boris Johnson could be offered a formal campaign role. Here, the Mayor of London gives his keynote speech to the Conservative Party Conference last year . 'They want to make sure that if the Tories lose, Boris gets as much flak as they do and can't stand as leader as a break with the failed Cameron-Osborne regime,' the source was quoted as saying. Mr Shapps, speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr programme on Sunday, attempted to calm the controversy – but suggested Mr Johnson should play a major role in the campaign, whatever his intentions on a return to Parliament. 'Boris is a guy who is able to communicate incredibly well and it would be crazy for him not to be part of the 2015 message,' he said. 'We all think Boris is a fantastic London Mayor and he's got a lot to offer. He's doing a brilliant job in London; his term runs till 2016, so he's got a little way to go, but no doubt he'll have many things to offer. What Boris does is up to Boris.' A close friend of the Mayor attempted to play down the row, insisting: 'Boris's focus is on London – it was in 2012 when he stood for a second term, it will be in 2016 when he finishes that term. 'In between, only two things matter to Boris – delivering for London, and ensuring we have a majority Conservative government led by David Cameron after 2015. Boris will be out and about doing all he can to make sure that happens.' Rebel Tory MP Mark Pritchard ‏condemned the speculation. 'Inside and outside of Parliament people are fed up of Old Etonians thinking they can pass on Number Ten like some sort of plaything or baton,' he said. Jon Ashworth, Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'The Chancellor is spending his time fighting with Boris Johnson like ferrets in a sack over a Tory leadership vacancy after the next election. 'Senior Tories should be getting to grips with the cost-of-living crisis facing ordinary families, not putting their own interests first.' Mr Johnson, who was MP for Henley between 2001 and 2008, has encouraged 'will he, won't he' speculation about when he might stand again for the Commons. Former Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson, now on trial over the phone hacking scandal, has said Mr Johnson is desperate to be prime minister but would rather see Mr Cameron 'fail miserably' than actively stab him in the back. 'Boris Johnson desperately wants to be prime minister and David has known that fact longer than most,' Mr Coulson said. 'When Boris asked me to pass on the message that he was keen to stand as mayor of London, David responded “Well, if he wins, he'll want my job next”.' He added: 'Stabbing David, or anyone else for that matter, in the back would be distinctly off brand - just not very Boris. He would much prefer to see David fail miserably in the election and ride in on his bike to save party and country.'","Close ally of PM says Mr Cameron he is 'telling Boris to stand'

Dewani, 33, from Bristol, has argued that he should not be forced from the UK to face trial over wife Anni's death until he has recovered from mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. A panel of judges, headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, ruled in January that it would not be 'unjust and oppressive' to extradite him if an undertaking was given by the South African government relating to how long he would be kept in the country without trial if his illness continues. The South African authorities have now given the necessary assurances, but Dewani's lawyers returned to London's High Court today to challenge the undertaking before Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice Blake. They also asked for permission to take the case of the millionaire businessman, who is compulsorily detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act, to the Supreme Court, the UK's highest court. But the judges rejected complaints made about the adequacy of the undertaking and also refused to give the go-ahead for the case to go to the Supreme Court. Dewani is accused of ordering the killing of 28-year-old Anni, who was shot as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010.

An . application was made to the judges to delay immediately triggering the . 28-day period in which the law now requires Dewani to be extradited. Mark Summers, appearing for Dewani, argued that the delay was necessary because there was a possibility of medical experts producing fresh evidence to indicate that Dewani's condition was 'chronic - incapable of being treated', arguably making him ineligible for extradition. Mr Summers applied to the judges to delay formally 'pronouncing' their decision for 14 days so that the 28-day period for extradition would not begin to run immediately.

Refusing the application, Lord Thomas said: 'The provisions of the Extradition Act are designed to ensure extradition is a speedy process. 'I therefore pronounce today. Any period that is applicable under the relevant legislation will run from today.' After the ruling today, Anni's father Vinod Hindocha (pictured with his wife in a 2013 picture) said: 'We are quite happy with the decision and we hope to get the answers that we have been seeking for the past three and a half years' After the High Court ruling, Anni's father Vinod Hindocha said outside the Royal Courts of Justice: 'We are quite happy with the decision and we hope to get the answers that we have been seeking for the past three and a half years.

The mother of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman has announced that there will be public celebrations of her son's life in both New York City and Rochester this spring. At a screening of Hoffman's Oscar-winning film Capote in Rochester on Friday, critic Jack Garner read a statement by Marilyn O'Connor thanking fans and friends for their support. ‘It has been a devastating loss for us, but I know that you also feel a great sorrow,’ she said. Scroll down for video . Philip Seymour Hoffman's life will be celebrated at memorials in both New York City and Rochester this spring . Marilyn O'Connor, right, walking into the Frank Campbell Funeral home in Manhattan on February 7 and, left, in happier times at a 1999 screening along with her son . The retired judge described her son as ‘a gift’, reports the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle. ‘We miss and cry for the little boy and the man, the brother, the uncle, the husband, the father, the friend... We will also miss his talent, his knowledge of his craft, and seeing results of his hard work. He was a gift to me for 46 years. I wanted more.’ Hoffman grew up just outside Rochester and used to go to watch movies at The Little Theatre, the venue for Friday's screening. 'My heart is broken and will never be the same again, O'Connor said in the statement. 'I know many of you feel the same. We will find our way through this and hear his clear voice and laughter as we do, because he is cheering for all of us to go on, to shine, to be the best that we can be. Thank you all and especially, The Little Theatre, a place Phil loved to go and watch movies.'

The Oscar-winning actor, 46, was . found dead on February 2 in his $10,000-a-month West Village apartment . surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes. Hoffman's . tragic death came less than a year after he completed a stint in rehab . for his addiction after being clean for 23 years. According to the New York medical examiner on Friday, acute mixed drug intoxication was the cause of death. One of the drugs found in Hoffman's system was benzodiazepine - a psychoactive drug with sedative and muscle relaxant properties that can be used to treat anxiety disorders. The other prescription drug found in Hoffman's system amphetamine was an 'upper' - such as  Adderall - and can be used to give an enhanced feeling of wakefulness and focus.

In true Hollywood fashion, the Academy Awards on Sunday promised a cliffhanger finale to the tight race for best picture Oscar between favorites 12 Years a Slave and Gravity and a big gamble on rain and the red carpet. After three days of heavy downpours soaked parts of the red carpet along Hollywood Boulevard, workers removed the plastic tenting and unwrapped the golden Oscar statues hours before hundreds of movie stars in designer dresses and tuxedos begin arriving for Hollywood's biggest night. And while it was still drizzling outside the Dolby Theatre as TV crews from around the world went live from Hollywood, organizers were confident that the most glamorous of red carpet shows would go off without a hitch. They did, however, keep a bunch of umbrellas on hand. Scroll Down for Video . Busy: Preparations are readied ahead of the Oscars on Sunday, March 2, 2014, at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles . Unlike the stormy hosting of Seth MacFarlane last year, this Oscar show with host Ellen DeGeneres has a deliberately safe vibe of cheery song-and-dance. The nimble and amiable DeGeneres is expected to return the broadcast to more traditional territory. Many of the night's biggest categories, too, seem to hold little chance for surprise. The well-established favorites include Matthew McConaughey, Cate Blanchett, Lupita Nyong'o and Jared Leto. Each comes into Oscar Sunday having won a parade of awards over the last few months, including honors at Saturday's Spirit Awards. The night's biggest question mark won't come until the very end. The historical drama 12 Years a Slave, the 3-D space spectacle Gravity and the con-artist caper American Hustle are vying for best picture in the night's closest contest. Watch Video Here: . Final checks: Members of the media take positions on the red carpet ahead of the 86th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California . Gravity is expected to lead the ceremony in total awards, cleaning up in technical categories like visual effects and cinematography. Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron is considered a lock for best director for seamlessly marshalling new digital technology to render the lost-in-space drama. He would be the first Latino to win the category. While the global hit easily topped the other eight best-picture nominees at the box office, the lower budget, less widely seen 12 Years a Slave is believed to have a narrow edge for the academy's top honor. Combating the downpour: Staff hurriedly clear the water away from the red-carpet in preparation for this evenings Oscars . Though voters last year chose entertainment over history lesson (Ben Affleck's Argo over Steven Spielberg's Lincoln), many see Steve McQueen's brutal adaptation of Solomon Northup's memoir as a landmark film difficult to watch but impossible to overlook. ABC, which is telecasting the ceremony, hopes the drama of the best-picture race will be enough to entice viewers. The show last year drew an audience of 40.3 million, up from 39.3 million the year before when the silent-film ode The Artist won best picture. After three days of heavy downpours soaked parts of the red carpet along Hollywood Boulevard, workers removed the plastic tenting and unwrapped the golden Oscar statues hours before hundreds of movie stars in designer dresses and tuxedos begin arriving for Hollywood's biggest night. And while it was still drizzling outside the Dolby Theater as TV crews from around the world went live from Hollywood, organizers were confident that the most glamorous of red carpet shows would go off without a hitch. They did, however, keep a bunch of umbrellas on hand. Frontrunners: Matthew McConaughey and Cate Blanchett Aattended the Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday, and the actors did not leave empty-handed - taking home the best actor and actress gongs respectively . Favorite: Matthew McConaughey is thought to be the front-runner to take home the prize for Best Actor for his work in the AIDS drama Dallas Buyers Club . This year's Oscars celebrate what is widely regarded as one of the most high quality years in film and performances in recent memory. The president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, called it the best line-up 'in the last decade or so.' That means that awards are likely to be scattered widely as the 6,000-plus members of the Academy seek to reward as many films as possible with the famed golden statuettes. While British director Steve McQueen's brutal slavery drama 12 Years a Slave is the presumed frontrunner for best picture, Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron's groundbreaking space thriller Gravity lurks just behind. And there could be an upset for the night's top honors. 'I feel more comfortable putting my chips on '12 Years a Slave' just because there is more historical basis for doing so,' said Scott Feinberg, awards analyst at The Hollywood Reporter. 'But at the same time there is no denying that there is great enthusiasm for other movies.' Among those is 1970s crime caper American Hustle from director David O. Russell, which scored 10 nominations. The Wolf of Wall Street: Leonardo DiCaprio is nominated for his sixth Oscar for his portrayal of a corrupt, cheating investor in Martin Scorcese's hit movie . For the second year in a row, Russell has achieved the rare feat of having his actors nominated in all four acting categories. Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, a tale of financial greed and excess, has also been a hit with audiences and critics. A total of nine films are competing for best picture, including Somali piracy thriller Captain Phillips, the adoption drama Philomena, the heartland comedy Nebraska, the computer-age romance Her, and the AIDS activist biopic Dallas Buyers Club. But the Academy could also make history this year if it chooses 12 Years a Slave for best picture. It would be the first time that the top film honor goes to a movie by a black director in the 86 years of the Oscars. Potentially historic: Lupita Nyongo  holds her award for best supporting actress and director Steve McQueen holds his award for best director for 12 Years a Slave at the 2014 Independent Spirit Awards on March 1, 2014 in Santa Monica, California . On Saturday, the real-life story of free man turned plantation slave Solomon Northup gained more momentum by sweeping the Independent Spirit Awards, a show that recognizes movies made on small budgets. It scored five wins out of seven nominations, including best feature film. The Spirit Awards also bestowed honors on the frontrunners for all four acting races for the Oscars, which may yield few surprises on Sunday. Cate Blanchett won best actress at the Spirit Awards for her portrayal of the disgraced socialite in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine. Matthew McConaughey took best actor for his role as the unlikely AIDS activist in Dallas Buyers Club, for which he lost some 50 pounds (23 kg) and his co-star Jared Leto won best supporting actor. Ensemble: Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper, Jeremy Renner, Christian Bale and Jennifer Lawrence in a scene from American Hustle - one of the leading contenders for Best Picture Oscar . Bright lights: Actress Jennifer Lawrence attends the 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards while Jared Leto (right) is the hands-down favorite to take home the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his work on Dallas Buyers Club . Also on Saturday, newcomer Lupita Nyong'o won best supporting actress for her role as hardworking slave Patsey in 12 Years a Slave but she faces a challenge at the Oscars from Jennifer Lawrence as the loopy housewife in American Hustle. Sunday's show caps an unusually long awards season extended by weeks by the Winter Olympics and fatigue was evident. 'Yeah, I'm a little bit tired today,' Blanchett said on Saturday, adding 'but I'm full of adrenaline, whatever happens, it's a very exciting place to be.' The Oscars show will feature homages to movie heroes and The Wizard of Oz on its 75th anniversary. U2 and Pharrell Williams will be among the performers for best original song. Among the presenters will be Hollywood power couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt as well as Sidney Poitier on the 50th anniversary of his best actor win for Lilies of the Field, the first Oscar in that category for an African American.","Days of heavy rains gave the Oscar's red-carpet a soaking on the morning of the ceremony .

Emanuel, clad in a green Chicago Public Library T-shirt and shorts, went first, followed immediately by Fallon.

The annual event draws several thousand hearty plungers to raise money for Special Olympics Chicago. Scores of people dressed in parkas and polar bear outfits gathered along the lakefront early, hoping to catch a glimpse of the New York-based comedian. Fans mingled with participants, carrying signs with pictures of Fallon's head. Many were dressed in costumes — including, appropriately, polar bears. It was 10 degrees an hour before the plunge, and . Chicago firefighters in red wetsuits waded in before the waves of plungers began, throwing chunks of ice out of the area. Seventeen-year-old high school senior Marilyn Lamanna and a friend got up at 5 a.m. to snag a spot where they hoped to watch the feat unfold. ‘Between Jimmy Fallon and the Special .

A charity is under investigation after a British father-of-three allegedly used one of its aid convoys to travel to Syria and carry out a suicide bombing. Children in Deen, based in Yardley, Birmingham, has admitted that Abdul Waheed Majeed travelled to the war-torn country with the charity in July last year. He is believed to have later died after driving a truck packed with explosives into the wall of Aleppo prison - killing dozens of civilians and allowing hundreds of inmates to escape. Charity trip: Abdul Waheed Majeed, pictured at a Syrian refugee camp, is believed to have died after driving a truck packed with explosives into the wall of Aleppo prison - allowing hundreds of inmates to escape . It is thought that the 41-year-old, from Crawley, West Sussex, was the first ever Briton to carry out a suicide attack in Syria. Now, regulators at Charity Commission are investigating Children in Deen's decision to allow Majeed to join its aid convoy. A . commission spokesman said: 'We are aware that the registered charity, . Children in Deen, was involved in an aid convoy to Syria in July last . year. 'We are currently . assessing whether there are any regulatory concerns arising from this, . and recent media coverage in relation to this.' Aid convoy: The father-of-three travelled to Syria with Birmingham-based charity, Children in Deen, in July 2013 . Suspect: Majeed (left and right), 41, is thought to be the first ever Briton to carry out a suicide attack in Syria . During the attack at Aleppo prison on February 6, Majeed is believed to have driven an armoured dumper truck into the facility's wall. The vehicle was draped in the flags of Jabhat al-Nusra - an extremist faction aligned to al-Qaeda and banned in Britain. In a video later released by the group, Majeed can be seen laughing, smiling and pointing at the sky moments before he is believed to have carried out the suicide attack. Explosion: The suicide bombing on February 6 killed dozens of civilians. Above, smoke rises from Aleppo prison . Driving to his death: This photo shows the modified truck reportedly driven by Majeed during the horrific attack . Today, Children in Deen trustee Sara . Rathore said that between five and 10 charities were involved in two . overseas aid convoys it sent to Syria in March and July last year. The July convoy included 148 individuals - one of whom was Majeed, she confirmed. 'Children . in Deen is a legitimate charity and the convoy was fully legitimate,' she said. 'We provided details of the individuals travelling to the . authorities before departure. Shocking: Video footage shows Majeed pointing up to the sky with friends just moments before the bombing . 'Some of those on the list were told they . could not go for various reasons unrelated to terror suspicions. But . Majeed clearly was not one of those flagged up.' She . added that the charity, which works in Syria, Gaza, and Pakistan, . continues to send aid to Syria - but now does so in shipping containers. Concern: Last month, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was deeply concerned at the threat posed by returning British jihadists . 'It is more cost-effective to send aid over in containers, and takes less manpower,' she said. Children . in Deen, which means 'faith' in Arabic, supports three projects in . Syria - a school, a bread factory and a women's project providing . employment support. On its website, it states it is 'dedicated to improving the lives of deprived children in third world countries and help break the cycle of poverty.' It adds: 'We also provide emergency aid to disaster hit areas around the world.' Last month, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was deeply concerned at the threat posed by returning British jihadists. ‘We have not changed the policy,’ he said. ‘We are concerned about the number of British people going to Syria for humanitarian reasons or to get involved in the war that is happening. ‘There are a few hundred people going out there. They may be injured or killed, but our biggest worry is when they return they are radicalised, they may be militarised, they may have a network of people that train them to use weapons.’ The Charity Commission has now opened two separate statutory inquiries into aid organisations to Syria. The commission said in August that it was monitoring Aid Convoy and an affiliated organisation called Syria Aid.","Abdul Waheed Majeed travelled to Syria with Children in Deen in July 2013 .

Winner: Bruce Crawcour may have set a legal precedent he won a payout from travel giant Thomson Holidays in a landmark legal case which could pave the way for thousands of out-of-pocket holidaymakers to claim compensation . A grandfather has won a full refund from travel giant Thomson Holidays in a landmark legal case that could see thousands of out-of-pocket holidaymakers claim compensation. Bruce Crawcour, 66, launched his battle with parent company TUI Travel after he was forced to cancel a holiday when his wife Kay, 63, fell ill. Instead they charged him the full £2,256 for the two-week break the couple were due to have last May in Majorca at the luxury Protur Biomar Gran Hotel. But the retired civil servant managed to prove the company was not out of pocket after the flights and hotel room vanished from the Thomson website before the departure date. He argued this meant they had managed to sell the package on. On Wednesday, he became one of the first holidaymakers in the UK to be awarded damages from a tour operator for a cancelled holiday. The pensioner, who represented himself at Telford Small Claims Court, was awarded a full refund as well as £300 court costs. The ruling could now spell major changes for holidaymakers who follow suit and sue travel firms over cancellation clauses in package holiday contracts. Experts believe it may force tour operators to change their policies on late cancellation fees. Yesterday Mr Crawcour, said: ‘My wife was admitted to hospital on a Monday and we were due to fly on the Sunday. I called up to tell TUI that we needed to cancel, as she was not fit to travel. ‘We had booked a holiday plus a private taxi from Palma airport costing £150. I asked a girl on the customer services desk if she could cancel the taxi to save me money. ‘However, she said no – that anything I had paid on my final invoice was final. I thought that was extremely unreasonable, as I was phoning six days in advance. Eagle-eye: The retired civil servant managed to prove Thomson were not out of pocket after the flights and hotel room vanished from its website before the departure date . According to the Citizens Advice bureau: 'Under package holiday regulations you only have the right to cancel if your organiser has made major changes to your holiday. 'If your organiser hasn’t made any changes to your holiday your right to cancel will depend on the terms and conditions of your holiday contract. You may be able to cancel your holiday but your organiser might charge you a cancellation fee. 'You will normally be able to find information about your organiser’s cancellation policy in your holiday brochure or with your booking information'. ‘I then decided to track on the TUI website what happened to the components of our holiday, and within 24 hours our plane seats were unavailable and within four days our hotel room was unavailable. They had basically robbed us blind.’ Mr Crawcour, from Shrewsbury, argued in court that the company breached the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 1999 and guidance from the Office of Fair Trading on Unfair Contract Terms in Package Holiday Contracts. He added: ‘That meant that operators can impose a sliding scale of charges which increase as the departure date approaches, only if they can prove they have had a pre estimate of the holiday company’s loss.’ Mr Crawcour believes that if the simple task of cancelling the taxi had been done, TUI would never have had to answer to his claims.

One person has died and 30 others were injured in a massive pileup on Interstate 25 as a band of heavy snow moved through south Denver on Saturday, authorities said. Police say 104 vehicles were involved in crashes along a roughly two-mile stretch of highway as a short but intense burst of snow slammed the area. The northbound lanes were closed for several hours, but the interstate has since reopened. The injured were taken to nearby hospitals. Coordinated response: Emergency workers respond to a massive pileup accident on Interstate 25 in Denver, Saturday, March 1 . Massive pileup: As a flurry of snow hit the area, visibility all but disappeared . Multi-crash accident: Many separate crashes caused the pileup . Drivers and passengers who were not hurt were put on a city bus to speak with accident investigators, and some wrecked cars were towed to a nearby high school, the Denver Post reported. Meanwhile, about 100 snowplows and four large tankers with deicing fluid were busy clearing roads throughout Denver, according to the Colorado Department of Transportation. Meteorologists said the storm was part of the same system that has saturated California and is slowly moving across the West en route to the Plains and Mississippi Valley on Sunday. 'We're on the front leading edge of it, so there's some moisture coming up,' National Weather Service meteorologist Jim Kalina said. Write-offs: Many uninjured people were taken by bus to accident investigators while cars were towed to a nearby school . On foot: Sean McLaughlin and his family had to leave the scene on foot carrying their possessions . Emergency: Rescue workers at the chaotic scene . That, combined with a cold front that moved into Colorado on Friday night, made for whiteout conditions and slick roadways across the state. Sean McLaughlin told CBS that the weather came on suddenly. 'It just went from great visibility from half a mile up the road to almost nothing down in here,' said McLaughlin. Fatality:The terrifying crash left one person dead and 30 injured . Authorities are advising motorists to travel with water, blankets, windshield wiper fluid, hand warmers and nonperishable food items . White out: Traffic slows after authorities closed a section of Interstate 35 in Lakeville, Minnesota, Friday, February 28 . Highway officials closed the westbound lanes of a section of Interstate 70 west of Denver after treacherous road conditions led to numerous accidents. Traffic is still slow in the reopened lanes. The transportation department warned that recently fluctuating temperatures in Colorado led to the slick road conditions, and authorities advised motorists to stock their vehicles with water, blankets, windshield wiper fluid, hand warmers and nonperishable food items. Freezing drizzle and highs in the low 20s were expected in Denver on Sunday, making way for sunny skies and highs in the mid-50s by Monday. Authorities have not identified the motorist who was killed.","One person has died and 30 others were injured in a huge pileup in Denver, Colorado Saturday .

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are livening up the idea of sedate royal tours, heading for an action-packed Down Under adventure which includes a jet boat ride, a chance to coach opposing rugby teams, a yacht race and a trip to bushfire ravaged regions. The royal couple and Prince George will also experience the more traditional royal pit stops at military bases, civic receptions and encounters with Australian wildlife. Despite the event-filled trip, the royal couple will not visit Melbourne, where officials are already complaining at being 'snubbed' by the Duke and Duchess. Prince George's first official royal engagement will see him among children and mothers at New Zealand's Government house soon after their 18-day trip begins on April 7.

The Australian Communications minister Malcolm Turnbull has made a lengthy denial after his remark about 'a demented plutocrat' media mogul was interpreted as a reference to News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch. Turnbull made the controversial comment last Friday night at the launch of the Saturday Paper, a new  venture from the stable of independent publisher, Morry Schwartz, the Guardian Australia reported. On the stage with Schwartz, also publisher of the Monthly magazine and the Quarterly Essay, Turnbull said Schwartz’s publishing ventures operated at a profit so he was not a 'demented plutocrat' looking to push an agenda. Of course I didn't: Australian Communications minister Malcolm Turnbull (left) referred to a 'demented plutocrat' news boss during his speech to launch a new independent newspaper, but later denied he was referring to Rupert Murdoch (right), instead alluding to the fictional mogul in the 1941 film, Citizen Kane . Mislaunch: On stage last Friday at the launch of the new Saturday Paper, Malcolm Turnbull said publisher Schwartz's ventures operated at a profit so he was not a 'demented plutocrat' looking to push an agenda . Speculation ensued as to whether Turnbull was referring to Rupert Murdoch. On a Sunday morning blogpost, Turnbull said he was surprised people thought he was referring to Murdoch. 'Rupert Murdoch has been publishing newspapers, including today some of the world’s most influential such as the Wall Street Journal, the Times of London and The Australian, for more than 60 years,' Turnbull wrote. 'And they have been and remain profitable. Far from being a rich man like [William Randolph] Hearst and many others who makes his money in some other area and then chooses to start a newspaper to promote his own political views, Rupert Murdoch started off as a newspaper man, the son of a newspaper man, and remains a newspaper man.' Turnbull said he had referenced the Orson Welles character, Hearst, from Citizen Kane earlier in his speech. At a loss: Rupert Murdoch (above) has an international news empire which includes a loss-making national Australian newspaper, which Malcolm Turnbull denies he was referring to in his speech . In a copy of the speech – written before Turnbull delivered it, and obtained by the Guardian Australia – the demented plutocrat comment does not appear. In the speech, he made observations about the state of the media, industry regulation and the potential for profit, saying the launch of The Saturday Paper showed rumours of the death of newspapers appeared to be exaggerated, though the 'rivers of gold' in classified advertising were drying up. 'These days few newsrooms have the luxury of ignoring where their funding comes from,' he said. 'In large part, the industry is yet to settle on a single model, or even strategy, that guarantees viability. 'I have often said that in the digital age, perhaps the scarcest commodity of all is people's attention spans.' He noted the success of the Daily Mail online, Guardian Australia and Buzzfeed Australia as examples of Australia's media becoming more diverse. 'While media companies jostle and vie in the new environment, the role of governments is pretty simple: to help, not hinder, new business models emerge and make it easier for companies to innovate,' he said. 'Across my portfolio the current media, telecommunications and radio communications regulatory framework is still fundamentally based in a mid-1990s world of relatively stable technologies and business models.' He said the explosion of the internet, mobile phones and social media. along with the the rollout of a fast broadband network and the rise of cloud computing had changed the media landscape. 'In heavily regulated markets, tight regulation usually helps incumbents – they have armies of lawyers to help navigate complex rules and lobby governments where smaller companies lack the resources,' he said. 'The pressures on the regulatory arrangements and the negative impact of out-dated regulation on the sector will only increase.'","Australian minister refers to 'demented plutocrat' newspaper boss .

"By . Kate Lyons . PUBLISHED: . 22:12 EST, 2 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 23:02 EST, 2 March 2014 . This week marks the thirtieth anniversary of the commencement of the miners' strike of 1984-1985. Three decades on and the effects of Britain’s infamous industrial struggle are still being felt. The strike started on March 6, 1984, when National Coal Board chairman, Sir Ian MacGregor, announced that four million tonnes of capacity was to be taken out of the industry, leading to a loss of 20,000 jobs across the North of England, Scotland and Wales, which would lose their primary source of employment. On March 12, 1984, the strike went national, with National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) president, Arthur Scargill, calling for NUM members in all coal fields to down tools. Miner's wife Gail Downes (left) was one of the many miners and their families who protested the closures of the mines across the country. She is pictured here outside Haworth Colliery . A picketer, injured during clashes with police at the Orgreave Coking Plant near Rotherham, is helped away by his comrades. An estimated 20,000 people were injured or admitted to hospital during course of strike and three people were killed . Police officers move into the picket lines at the Orgreave coking plant near Rotherham in 1984, where more than a dozen arrests were made . It was one of the most bitter industrial disputes in the nation’s history and a key part of Margaret Thatcher’s legacy as prime minister. Within a week, most of the country’s 183,000 miners had downed tools and a daily routine was established in many coal towns, of miners picketing outside collieries. The protests were often violent, with large numbers of police sent in to restrain picketers, with an estimated 20,000 people injured or admitted to hospital. During the course of the strike, three men were killed – two on the picket lines and a taxi-driver who was driving a coal miner, who had crossed the picket lines, to work. Families and communities were riven with division over the dispute and torn apart by the poverty brought about by a year of downed tools. The effects of the strike are still felt across the nation, with those ‘scabs’ who crossed the picket lines still snubbed in the streets of mining towns 30 years on. ‘People have long memories,’ explained Alan Cummings, 66-year-old former NUM lodge secretary in the ex-pit village of Easington Colliery, County Durham. ‘There's very few people [who] talk to them and it split families.’ Picketing miners make a run for it as violence flares at the Orgreave coking plant. The bitter industrial dispute began in March 1984 after the announcement that 20,000 jobs would be cut due to closures of coal mines across the country . Defining episode: The miners' strike was one of the defining moments of Margaret Thatcher's prime ministership .

A mass rally of striking miners in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire in May 1984. The strikes began in March 1984 and continued for a year . The closure of the mines has devastated communities across the country. Mr Cummings says that Easington Colliery’s reliance on coal meant that the pit’s closure was disastrous. ‘It's been total devastation,’ he said. ‘It's my worst nightmare and I knew it was going to happen.’ Whereas the Germans planned pit closures in their coalfields, ‘here, they just wiped us out’. Mr Cummings says that the colliery houses were sold off to landlords in the 1990s, and there was an influx of problem tenants and class A drugs into the village. Shops closed down and the once vibrant community life died out. The strikers were known as Arthur’s Army after NUM president, Arthur Scargill, who became a fixture on British television and radio during the strike. There is no sign that Mr Scargill, who is now 76 and has removed himself from public life, will be attending the commemorative events planned for the 30-year anniversary. In 1984 he warned miners that the government had a long-term plan to destroy the industry, closing more than 70 pits across the country. The government denied these claims and Ian MacGregor wrote to every member of the NUM claiming that Mr Scargill was deliberately lying to them and there were no plans to close any more pits than what had been announced. Cabinet papers released in 2014, under the 30-year rule, indicated that MacGregor, who died in 1998, did wish to close 75 pits over three years. These revelations prompted veteran Labour MP, Dennis Skinner, to call on the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to review statements made by the Thatcher government during the strike, to see how their statements from the Despatch Box matched with internal documents, reported the Mirror. More than 200 miners were arrested during the year of picketing and spent time in custody or jail .

Communities were divided by the miners' strike. 30 years later and those who crossed the picket lines are still snubbed by many in their communities . The strike was ultimately unsuccessful, with miners returning to work in early 1985 due to financial hardship, and the strike was called off on March 4 that year. Ken Capstick, 73, a former miner and vice-president of the Yorkshire NUM, told the Guardian this year that ‘the victory was in the struggle itself.’ ‘The way I would put that is this, if you've got a young lad at school and he's being bullied, and he comes out of school at the end of the day and the bully is waiting for him, to give him a good hiding … the bully may be bigger than him, but he has a choice. ‘He can either cower down and take his beating, or he can stand and fight, and hope to maybe land a few punches. He may still lose. But his victory is in the struggle itself. ‘We stood and fought against enormous odds, and not just for the pits – for our way of life.’ For many, the miners' strike is the defining moment of Margaret Thatcher’s prime ministership, with many mining communities reacting with glee to the former Tory leader’s death last year. Mr Cummings spoke of his village’s celebration at her passing, saying he did not care that it offended some people. ‘What an epitaph she has in these mining communities: death, a lot of people have committed suicide, and no hope. All down to her, and some of her spawn that's about now,’ he said. 20 striking miners were arrested when they attacked miners returning to work at the Tilmanstone Colliery, near Dover, Kent .

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said teaching at independent schools was an 'easy gig' Labour's education spokesman was last night accused of denigrating hard-working teachers at independent schools by claiming they had an ‘easy gig’. Privately educated Tristram Hunt also suggested he would sack untrained teachers if he became Education Secretary, and said he would not undo Michael Gove’s school reforms as many were built on Labour policies. Many unqualified teachers work at private schools, but they can also be hired by free schools and academies, which are taxpayer funded but free of local government control. In other state-funded schools, staff must have Qualified Teacher Status. Dr Hunt, whose former headmaster, Giles Slaughter – from University College School in North-West London – was unqualified, singled out Brighton College for criticism on BBC1’s Sunday Politics show yesterday. The day and boarding school has 39 teachers without formal teaching qualifications, including headmaster Richard Cairns. It charges £32,790 a year for boarders and sends about 30 pupils to Oxbridge. Presenter Andrew Neil said Mr Cairns ‘finds incredibly inspirational teachers who don’t necessarily have a teaching qualification’. But Dr Hunt replied: ‘It is a very different set of skills to teach ten nice young boys and girls in Brighton compared to a class of 30 with more challenging circumstances, with special educational needs, with differing abilities. ‘Being a teacher at Brighton College is an easy gig compared to some difficult schools.’ Mr Cairns said he was ‘saddened that any politician should seek to denigrate my teachers in this way’. He added: ‘They are incredibly dedicated professionals who work long hours to bring out the very best in the young people in their care. Dr Hunt said Labour would not allow unqualified staff to teach pupils (library image) ‘The school day is much longer than in the state sector and there is an expectation that all teachers be involved in the extra-curricular programme, including on Saturdays. ‘Pupils are encouraged to work hard and play hard, and their teachers are with them every step of the way. It is certainly not a vocation for the idle or the faint-hearted.’ Dr Hunt said Labour would not allow unqualified staff. Asked if he would fire them, he said: ‘We don’t think they should be in the classroom if they’re not interested in improving.’","Tristram Hunt said teaching at independent schools was an 'easy gig'

Crisis: 140 out of 323 councils said they have had to invest public money in food banks for the poverty-stricken . More than a third of  councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £3million to the taxpayer. An investigation has found that dozens of local authorities have put aside public cash to combat what they claim is a rising tide  of food poverty. But some critics will question whether councils are using food banks as a political stick to beat the Coalition over its welfare reforms. BBC Panorama asked all 375 councils in England and Wales about food banks and 323 responded. Of those, 140 said they had provided funding over the past two years. While most councils paid for support such as management and administration, some were even paying for the food. The programme found that two councils covering the Chingford and Woodford Green constituency of the Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, have between them committed almost £70,000 to food banks. The Coalition has recently come under fire from Anglican bishops over its welfare reforms, in an open letter describing food poverty as a national crisis. Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, who joined the attacks on behalf of the Catholic Church, said yesterday that people up and down the country were living in destitution. In a country as wealthy as Britain, this was a disgrace, he added. He said it was sometimes suggested that produce from food banks was sold on, but ‘I listen to my priests and they have said that when they put, from the food bank, three days’ food in front of a woman with her children, and she bursts into tears because she hasn’t eaten for three days – that’s not a fantasy, that’s human lives’. The Bishop of Manchester, David Walker, told Panorama: ‘We need government to be explicit whether food banks are to be part of the system and, if they are, how do we make them work effectively. If they are not part of the system, we need a clear signal from government about that.’ Ministers say food banks increase demand by offering free produce, and insist there is ‘no robust evidence that welfare reforms are linked to increased use of food banks’. Anglican bishops have blasted the Coalition for its welfare reforms which they claim have led to this crisis . The Department for Work and Pensions told Panorama: ‘Food banks do not form part of the benefit system. ‘Local authorities are now responsible for providing short-term, emergency help to those who need it and additional funding has been devolved to help them do so. Local authorities are better placed to give local support than a central system.’ In Derbyshire, the county council says its most pressing public health concern used to be healthy eating, but this had been overtaken by food poverty. The council has just invested £126,000 from its public health budget into food banks. Counties like Derbyshire have had to forego healthy eating programmes to help support those without food . ‘Some people in the country are not able to eat at all and if people can’t eat at all, what’s the point in trying to get them to eat healthily?’ said Julie Hirst, public health specialist at the council. Professor Liz Dowler, a food policy expert at the University of Warwick who helped produce a government-commissioned report about food aid, said: ‘Food banks are an inadequate plaster over a gaping wound. ‘They do not solve the problems. And that they should be enshrined as an inadequate solution is  deeply immoral.’ Last night the Policy Exchange think-tank claimed 68,000 people had their welfare payments stopped unfairly each year, heightening demand for food banks. Dr David Webster, a research fellow at the University of Glasgow, said there was ‘an undeniable link’ between the tougher benefits regime and the increased use of food banks.","140 of 323 councils said they have had to use taxpayers' for the crisis .

Decision: A Supreme Court ruling will decide if rap lyrics were admissible in an attempted murder trial . A New Jersey man whose rap lyrics boasted he would 'blow your face off and leave your brain caved in the street' will have his attempted murder case considered by the state's Supreme Court, which will decide whether the words he penned should have been admitted at trial. Vonte Skinner's case is being watched closely by civil liberties advocates who contend the lyrics should be considered protected free speech under the Constitution. In an amicus brief in support of Skinner, the ACLU New Jersey contends that rap lyrics, because of their violent imagery, are treated differently than other written works. 'That a rap artist wrote lyrics . seemingly embracing the world of violence is no more reason to ascribe . to him a motive and intent to commit violent acts than to... indict . Johnny Cash for having ""shot a man in Reno just to watch him die,""' according to the brief. After . an initial trial ended without a verdict, Skinner was convicted at a . second trial of shooting Lamont Peterson multiple times at close range . in 2005, leaving Peterson paralyzed from the waist down. Peterson . was reluctant initially to identify Skinner as the shooter, but . eventually testified at the trial that Skinner was the assailant. Peterson testified the two men sold drugs as part of a three-man 'team' and developed a dispute when Peterson began skimming some of the profits . for himself. During . the trial, state prosecutors read 13 pages of rap lyrics that were found . in the back seat of the car Skinner was driving when arrested. The . writings, some penned three or four years before the Peterson shooting, . include a reference to 'four slugs drillin' your cheek to blow your face . off and leave your brain caved in the street.' Aspiring rapper: The case will set a precedent for using rap lyrics and other forms of expression as evidence . Another passage describes a mother in a mortuary, taking clothes 'red soaked ravaged with holes' and 'Wonderin' if you died in pain. Was it instant or did you feel the slugs fryin' your veins.' In a 2-1 ruling that overturned the verdict, an appellate court noted that, similar to admitting evidence of prior crimes, caution must be exercised when allowing prior writings as evidence in a trial. The judges also wrote that the lyrics weren't necessary to buttress the state's case. 'This was not a case in which circumstantial evidence of defendant's writings were critical to show his motive,' the majority wrote. 'Nor was such evidence important to show that defendant had the intent to kill Peterson, which the State was required to establish to prove attempted murder. This brutal shooting bespoke intent to kill.' Judge Carmen Alvarez wrote in a dissenting opinion that the lyrics' relevance in showing motive and intent outweighed their prejudicial effect on the jury, and that 'defendant's songs narrated events similar to the conduct which resulted in the charged offenses.' In its brief, the ACLU said that an analysis of similar cases in other states found that in 14 of 18 instances, judges allowed rap lyrics to be admitted as evidence. The brief urges the Supreme Court to toughen the standards for admitting lyrics as evidence in a trial. 'We're not saying song lyrics can never be evidence, but that there needs to be a direct connection to the crimes,' said Jeanne LoCicero, deputy legal director of the ACLU New Jersey. The Burlington County prosecutor's office, which is to argue the case before the Supreme Court, declined to comment on the case.","New Jersey Supreme Court is deciding whether a 2012 trial attempted murder trial should have allowed rap lyrics as evidence .

Outgoing Ofcom boss Colette Bowe, said statutory regulation of the press would be a 'grave error' The outgoing head of Ofcom has warned that any form of statutory regulation of the Press would be a ‘grave error’. Colette Bowe, who is due to stand down from media standards watchdog this month, said Lord Justice Leveson’s idea of underpinning an independent press regulator with legislation made her feel ‘very nervous’. Addressing the Oxford Media Convention she said: ‘I would say I do not think the press should be subject to statutory regulation in any form whatsoever. I would regard that as a grave error for this country and this society.’ Asked if her views encompassed the Government’s current plans on regulation - as agreed by the three main political parties last October - she said: ‘Again, speaking totally personally I am very, very nervous about any form of regulation near our press.’ In its written evidence to the Leveson inquiry, Ofcom said the principles of effective regulation of the Press ‘could be achieved within a self-regulatory, non-statutory model’. But the chair of Ofcom was more emphatic in her criticism when speaking at last week’s event. She said: ‘I think what needs to happen with our press is that journalists and editors need to know the law, need to make sure that it is being complied with and there needs to be a very good system for handling complaints but I am instinctively very uncomfortable with the idea of regulating the press.’ Labour, the Tories and Liberal Democrats agreed a Royal Charter last October to set up a new body to oversee regulation of the Press. Controversially, the basis for the deal was thrashed out in late-night talks with the celebrity-backed pressure group Hacked Off, from which newspapers were excluded. Newspapers warned the new proposals were neither ‘voluntary nor independent’ and could give politicians too much power. Under Leveson¿s original proposals, Ofcom would have played a key role in press regulation and would have acted as a 'backstop' regulator if publishers refused to sign up to the new body . More than 90 per cent of the industry, including the Daily Mail, have instead signed up to Ipso, an independent press regulator. Under Leveson’s original proposals, Ofcom would have played a key role in press regulation. The quango - run by ex-New Labour adviser Ed Richards - would have acted as a ‘backstop’ regulator if publishers refused to sign up to the new regulatory body. It would not only have certified the new Press regulator but reviewed how the new body was working after two years and then at three-yearly intervals. David Cameron rejected the involvement of Ofcom little more than 90 minutes after the Leveson proposals were published. Instead, the controversial Royal Charter plan was devised.","Colette Bowe outgoing head of Ofcom said press 'should not be subjected to statutory regulation in any form'

British troops involved in the Bloody Sunday killings should be given an amnesty from prosecution as terrorists have been, a former Northern Ireland Secretary said yesterday. Peter Hain spoke out after it emerged that nearly 200 suspected IRA terrorists had received 'comfort letters' assuring them they were no longer being sought by police. An Old Bailey judge ruled last week that John Downey would not be prosecuted for the 1982 Hyde Park terror blast, which left four soldiers dead, because he had effectively been given immunity as part of the peace process. Former Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain spoke out after new revelations about IRA suspects emerged . It came as police in Northern Ireland began erecting billboards appealing for witnesses to come forward for a new criminal investigation into Bloody Sunday. It is 42 years since soldiers from the Parachute Regiment opened fire when a civil rights march in the Bogside, a nationalist area of Derry, descended into rioting. Fourteen people died and 12 were seriously wounded. The Police Service of Northern Ireland launched a new murder investigation after the 2010 Saville Inquiry into the killings was heavily critical of the Army. The complex probe is expected to last four years and could lead to criminal prosecutions of veteran paratroopers. Mr Hain, a Labour grandee who served as Ulster Secretary from 2005 to 2007, yesterday defended  giving amnesties to terror fugitives, insisting it paved the way for the IRA declaring an end to its war and the decommissioning of weapons. Terror: Rioters confront paratroopers on Bloody Sunday 42 years ago in Derry . But he said the same should apply to paratroopers who were involved in Bloody Sunday. He said: 'Difficult as I know it is for victims on all sides, I see no point in endlessly searching for evidence for crimes committed so many years ago in the Troubles and which is increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to get given the passage of time. 'If you have addressed the question of former terrorists involved in activity, then it should apply even-handedly right across the board to members of the British security forces as well.' Mr Hain said his attempts in 2005 to introduce laws to extend immunity from prosecution to soldiers as well as Republican and Loyalist terrorists were scuppered by Sinn Fein and the SDLP. He added that attempts to prosecute paratroopers responsible for the deaths would divert police resources away from catching renegade Republicans still carrying out terror attacks. Sinn Fein's Raymond McCartney said Mr Hain's remarks were 'ill-judged and inappropriate'. He said some families 'wish to seek prosecution against those responsible for the death of  their loved ones'.","Peter Hain spoke out after revelations about  IRA suspects .

Teenagers would be made to study maths and English until the age of 18 under a Labour government, the party has revealed. In a bid to drive up standards, it would become compulsory for pupils in England and Wales to keep up the subjects, even if they leave school at 16. But education leaders have already warned that the plan, supported by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt, would require training many more teachers. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt (left) supports the move but Martin Doel (right), who leads the Association of Colleges, warned the plan would require investment . The announcement from Labour, expected to be confirmed in a major paper on education tomorrow, comes as part of new plans for a 'national baccalaureate' designed to help young people into work. Their proposal is part of a set of reforms which aims to reduce the number of people who are not in education, employment or training, (NEET) as well as meet the demands of businesses, which consistently complain of low standards in literacy and numeracy. According to Labour, around one million young people are currently NEET because careers advice and guidance is inadequate. The new education plan will apply both to students who stay at school to pursue A-levels and to those who leave for apprenticeships. But education leaders were quick to point out the practical problems with increasing the amount of teaching, and demanding further study when many pupils still fail to reach required standards at GCSE level. Martin Doel, the chief . executive of the Association of Colleges, told the Observer: 'In principle asking everyone to do maths and English to the age of 18 is a good idea. 'However, such a commitment would require many more specialist teachers to be recruited and trained. There is also a huge challenge to ensure that half of young people achieve grade A to C in GCSE maths, let alone the next level.' Further study: New Labour proposals outline plans to make English and maths compulsory in some form until age 18 . Organisations offering training or apprenticeships would have to ensure that further maths and English study featured in their programmes, forming a so-called 'technical baccalaureate'. Schools would also be pressured to make sure that pupils who leave aged 16 move to apprenticeships or another form of training - rather than regular employment or the dole - or face losing funding. Under the proposals, if too many youngsters leave school but do not continue learning, schools could be fined and the money given to careers advice organisation. Labour's plan follows an announcement from education secretary Michael Gove that teenagers who fail to achieve C grades in maths of English GCSEs would have to keep studying them beyond sixteen. However, its proposals are further-reaching, and have been described by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt as a way to reach out to the 'forgotten 50 per cent' of teenagers who do not go to unviersity. Mr Hunt today said: 'Reforms must focus on driving up standards . in maths and English, strengthening character and resilience and . equipping the labour market of the future with the skills set it needs. More of the same just won't do.' Professor Chris Husbands, who chairs the . group which made the proposals, said: 'In Britain, we have a poor . record of delivering high skills and effective qualifications for the . forgotten 50 per cent: the half of young people for whom the current . qualifications regime simply does not deliver. 'What we have set out is do-able and practical. Our economic and our social future depends on getting this right.' Neil Carberry, a spokesman for business lobbying group the CBI said: 'This is an important contribution to building a more effective education system between 14 and 19. Businesses will welcome the focus.'","Bid to drive up standards would see additional focus on key subjects .

Even though Grace Latkovski, 9, uses a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy and cystic fibrosis, that doesn't stop her and her sister Quincy Latkovski, 11, from competing at the Jamfest Super Nationals and becoming an instant darling among fans. In fact, both Quincy and Gracie incorporate wheelchairs in their heart-warming routine set to the song 'Reflection' from popular Disney film Mulan. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gracie Latkovski may be in a wheel chair but that doesn't stop her from living her life to the fullest . Both Gracie (left) and her sister Quincy (right) use a wheelchair in their dance performance . The routine incorporates the use of a mirror to illustrate the lyrics to the song 'Reflection' and to show how Gracie feels liberated on the inside despite her disability . This year’s Jamfest Super Nationals was larger than ever with 300 teams performing and more than 4,000 dancers. 'There wasn't a dry eye in the house,' Jamfest representative Hayley Reyes said of their unique performance. Jamfest was the first time the girls appeared on a national stage and they made quite the impression. 'Within a second, everyone became a family,' Reyes said to HLN. The girls' mom Christin Latkovski told HLN that Gracie picks all her songs and that the lyrics, 'I am now in a world where I have to hide my heart and what I believe in, but somehow I will show the world what's inside my heart and be loved for who I am,' describes the way Gracie struggles with her disability but how she overcomes it. In the performance, Quincy doesn't push Gracie around, rather Gracie is able to operate her own motorized wheelchair on which she can twirl and dance. The girls show the national audience how they've manged to master their ability . As Gracie twirls in her chair, Quincy does impressive flips in the air . Gracie does not see herself as disabled and wants people to believe in themselves despite what other people may view as limitations. The sisters study at a dance studio where Gracie takes both private and group lessons. Gracie teaches others how to reveal who they are on the inside not through physical appearance but through art and creativity. The routine begins with both Gracie and her sister Quincy sitting in wheelchairs looking at each other from opposite sides. Eventually, Quincy rises from her wheelchair, dances through the mirror to the other side and acts as Quincy's inner self full of enthusiasm and exuberance. Quincy spins, pops her leg into the air, and even flips on the stage in front of the massive and appreciative audience. The girls spin hand in hand on the stage until Quincy walks back through the mirror for the grand finale. Even though Gracie may never be able to kick her legs, it doesn't make her feel any less special on the inside especially with the love of her mother, her older sister, and her adoring fans. Their touching routine was undeniably a showstopper .

A brownstone owned for decades by director Spike Lee's father was tagged Friday with graffiti only days after his famous son went on a long-winded rant against gentrification in New York City. The Brooklyn home was spray painted with the words 'do the right thing,' a reference to 'Do The Right Thing,' a 1989 movie directed by Lee - a neighboring home was also hit by the vandals . The vandalism appears to have been in response to a Tuesday night rant that came when Lee was asked to argue against the development of poorer neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Harlem. The director also blasted an audience member at the Pratt Institute panel discussion who started defending the changes in the neighborhoods. 'Do the right thing': Vandals tagged a brownstone owned by Spike Lee's father . Response: The graffiti is believed to be part of a backlash against Lee's controversial comments only days earlier . Glass was shattered at the neighboring home and the words 'do the right,' a reference to the title of a Lee-directed 1989 movie about racial tensions dividing Brooklyn, were spray painted on both brownstones, CNN reported. 'All I know is that he made a lot of comments that went viral, the next day my house is vandalized,' Dianne Mackenzie told CNN. 'There is probably some kind of connection in the mind of whoever did this ... There is no reasonable reason for it. If this person has got something to say, fine say it. Don't damage my property,' she continued. Lee has not publicly spoken about the incident and was not immediately able to be reached by MailOnline for comment. 'He lives in Manhattan so ... this is my dad's house, and it's kind of personal,' Arnold Lee told the network in reference to his famous brother. 'Leave us out of it. Because I feel bad ... my neighbor, she is a good friend,' he added. His soapbox: Spike Lee argued that New York City is being gentrified at an alarming rate and it is no longer the same city that he grew up in . The vitriol is believed to have been a . response to Lee not only railing against Brooklyn's rapid . gentrification, even in traditionally poverty-stricken and . minority-dominated neighborhoods. Lee . even personally attacked an audience member defending the rising rents . and quickly changing demographics, an outburst Lee did not take kindly . to. 'Let me just kill you right now,' Lee shouted at the unidentified spectator. 'Have . you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the mother****g’ Westminster Dog Show,' he said, drawing a comparison to the high-brow . competition that would seem out of place in the harder-edged streets of . Brooklyn where he grew up. Lee pointed the finger at white New Yorkers who have moved into historically black neighborhoods and changed the environment, arguing that those changes have caused the areas to evolve into something completely different. 'Here’s the thing: I grew up here in Fort Greene. I grew up here in New York. It’s changed. And why does it take an influx of white New Yorkers in the south Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed Stuy, in Crown Heights for the facilities to get better?' he continued. 'The garbage wasn’t picked up every mother****g’ day when I was living in 165 Washington Park. P.S. 20 was not good. P.S. 11. Rothschild 294. The police weren’t around. 'When you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers, three o’clock in the morning on 125th Street, that must tell you something.' Protecting a legacy: Lee complained that residents in Brooklyn and Harlem are now stopping events in public parks for fear of excessive noise of garbage . 'Crystal ball': Lee said that a scene in his 1989 hit Do The Right Thing foreshadowed gentrification problems to come in Harlem . The 10-minute exchange was transcribed by New York Magazine, and it was clear that he knew it would cause a firestorm. 'My father’s a great jazz musician. He bought a house in nineteen-motherf****g’-sixty-eight, and the motherf****g' people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He’s not — he doesn’t even play electric bass! It’s acoustic! We bought the motherf****g’ house in nineteen-sixty-motherf****g’-eight and now you call the cops? In 2013? Get the f*** outta here!' 'You can’t just come in the neighborhood and start bogarting and say, like you’re motherf****g’ Columbus and kill off the Native Americans. Or what they do in Brazil, what they did to the indigenous people. You have to come with respect. There’s a code. There’s people.' 'I’m for democracy and letting everybody live but you gotta have some respect. You can’t just come in when people have a culture that’s been laid down for generations and you come in and now s**t gotta change because you’re here? Get the f**k outta here. Can’t do that!' 'The black American population in New York City is going down because of... reverse migration and what we have and - and its something that de Blasio's going to, I mean he can't get the snow off the ground but still- what we need is affordable housing for everybody.' In spite of his outrage, Lee has on the tony Upper East Side since 2000. He . keeps connected to his Brooklyn roots by basing his company's . headquarters in Fort Greene. The topic was raised when a male audience member asked about a recent New York Times article that extolled the benefits of gentrification. This was not the paper's first recent foray into the issue, as a series they ran about homelessness in the city pointed out that some of the worst-run shelters is located next to brownstone houses that now sell for multiple millions. Lee said that gentrification is shown by more than just a heavier police presence on the streets but also by the dismissal of cultural customs. 'Then comes the mother****g’ Christopher Columbus Syndrome. You can’t discover this! We been here. You just can’t come and bogart. 'There were brothers playing mother****g’ African drums in Mount Morris Park for 40 years and now they can’t do it anymore because the new inhabitants said the drums are loud.' He boasted that his . critically-acclaimed film Do The Right Thing, which was released in . 1989, predicted the gentrification debate like a 'crystal ball', citing a . scene where a white man in Harlem is berated by his black neighbor . after the man accidentally scuffs up his new Air Jordan sneakers. Lee . told a story about how a party in Fort Greene park was proposed in . honor of Michael Jackson when the singer died but the plan got nixed . after residents complained that there would be too much garbage. Changing scene: Lee said that Fort Greene Park is cleaner than it has ever been . 'Garbage? Have you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the mother****g’ Westminster Dog Show. There’s 20,000 dogs running around. Whoa. So we had to move it to Prospect Park!' Lee said. 'I mean, they just move in the neighborhood. You just can’t come in the neighborhood. I’m for democracy and letting everybody live but you gotta have some respect.

It was very emotional. 'If he hadn't got here so quickly and done his job so well, I just wouldn't be here now. 'It's scary to think I was dead for 15 minutes, Mr Leonardi saved my life by doing what he did.

In a shocking case of animal cruelty, Jacob Vanderschoot cut his young Staffordshire terrier cross' throat with a boning knife and left it for dead in a western Sydney yard. Vanderschoot, 22, attacked the dog in March 2013 in Bidwill, and in a joint prosecution between Animal Welfare League NSW and NSW police, he was convicted of animal cruelty under the Crimes Act and not the Prevention Cruelty to Animals Act. Facing up to five years jail, on Thursday, and after 10 months of court proceedings, Vandershoot pleaded guilty to the horrific attack which left the 10-month old puppy fighting for life in Bidwill. Horrific: Bouncer's attack was so bad, animal inspectors said it was one of the worst they had witnessed . But despite his brutal crime, Vanderschoot was sentenced to just 12 months' intensive correction in the community for his attack on his dog Bouncer. This will see Vanderschoot remain in community but under the supervision of Corrective Services NSW and subject to probation and parole conditions. Magistrate Stephen Corry said while Vanderschoot 'caused severe injuries' to the dog and 'allowed it to suffer unnecessarily for hours with its throat cut,' he did not impose a jail sentence based on factors including a psychological report, Vanderschoot's age and previous good character. Vanderschoot was charged with serious animal cruelty causing prolonged suffering, the most serious animal cruelty charge in NSW, after Bouncer was found by neighbours who rescued the near dead animal and took him to a local vet for urgent life-saving treatment. Why?: Bouncer was left to suffer for hours after his owner cut his throat with a boning knife . Brutal: The cut on Bouncer's throat needed emergency surgery to save his life after he was left in the yard of his owner's home . The Animal Welfare League was notified by the vet due to the horrific injuries the animal sustained. Inspectors worked with police to find and prosecute Vanderschoot. The league is a registered charity that has cared for surrendered, neglected and abandoned animals for more than 50 years and is authorised to investigate allegations of animal cruelty under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. Animal Welfare League Inspector Damien Thiele said the attack was brutal and one of the worst cases of animal cruelty seen by inspectors. 'It was very disturbing - especially in that it wasn't something in the heat of the moment,' Thiele said. Happy: Animal Welfare League Inspector Damien Thiele said Bouncer had spent a successful year learning how to be a normal dog again after his horrific attack . 'He (Vanderschoot) had two goes at cutting his throat. He went and got a knife, he's taken the dog into bush area near his house, tried to cut the dog's throat, then he's taken it back to the premises and left it on his lawn. 'He tried cutting his throat once and then tried again. We don't know the gap, but there were two lacerations. 'It's disturbing how premeditated it was, he left the dog to suffer and the magistrate commented on that.' Thiele said he was happy Vanderschoot had been sentenced, but the fact he had no previous convictions may have helped him escape jail time. 'Our focus was on bringing him before court,' he said. 'When we seized the dog at the vet he became evidence.' After the attack the league took custody of Bouncer. For about a year, Bouncer has undergone intense rehabilitation with Animal Welfare League staff including behaviorist specialists and from external specialists. Rehab: Animal Welfare League workers (pictured) spent months working with Bouncer to transition him into being a normal pet . On the mend: A foster home is being sought for the Staffordshire terrier cross who was just 10-months old when he had his throat viciously cut . On the back of his successful rehabilitation, a foster home is being sought for the dog. Until then he remains at the Ingleside shelter. 'We're focusing on getting him into the right home. The behaviorist said physically he's fine. He's not aggressive at all. 'He does like to jump fences so the person who takes him on weill need a high fence in place - it's about the right person for the dog.' Bouncer was also used as the face of the organisation's call to action to help raise funds for victimised animals.

More than 50 years after the murder of 25-year-old Texas beauty queen Irene Garza, her family continue the fight to bring her suspected killer, a former Catholic priest, to justice before the 81-year-old retiree outruns the clock. In April 1960, the young school teacher and former Miss South Texas was found lying in a canal in her hometown of McAllen after having disappeared the day before Easter. A devout Catholic, she had gone to Sacred Heart Catholic Church to give confession to Father John Feit, a bespectacled 27-year-old visiting priest. Shocking crime: Irene Garza, who was Miss South Texas, was found dead lying in a canal in her hometown around Easter 1960. A Catholic priest who heard her final confession, Rev. John Feit, has been a person of interest but was never arrested . Changed man: John Feit, 81, is now a grandfather who lives in a retiree community in Scottsdale, Arizona, . Feit was immediately a suspect in . Garza's death because 23 days earlier he had been found guilty of . attacking another young woman at a nearby church. He did not serve any . jail time and was fined $500. When questioned by police, Feit offered various stories regarding his whereabouts on the night of the murder. Asked to explain the scratches on his hands, the 27-year-old said he got hurt while climbing into his home after getting himself locked out. But Feit was never arrested in the . Garza case and was quietly transferred to a monastery before leaving the . priesthood in the late 1960s. Garza's . relatives, who have spent the last 50 years pressing the authorities to . charge Feit with murder, believe that District Attorney Rene Guerra has . been a part of a cover-up to keep the former clergyman out of prison. Now . a stooped, white-haired grandfather, Feit continues to live a . comfortable life in an upscale neighborhood in Scottsdale, Arizona. He . has vehemently denied ever killing Garza in interrogations with police . and interviews by the media, including most recently CBS News' 48 Hours. The . Garza murder has become a political issue. The victim's family have . emerged as supporters of Ricardo Rodriguez, a candidate for Hidalgo . County District Attorney who will seek to unseat the 32-year incumbent . Guerra. 'Our current . district attorney imparts justice on his arbitrary beliefs as when he . tells someone that justice will be dispensed when pigs fly,' Rodriguez . told a crowd of voters. Grilled: Feit was questioned in Garza's death but has never been charged. Her family believes local officials covered for him because of his religious title . The aspiring district attorney was referring to a remark allegedly made by Guerra to Garza's cousin, Lynda De La Vina. Recalling her encounter with the prosecutor, Miss De La Vina said: 'he put his finger in my -- in my face and said, you know, ""You will never get an indictment. You'll get one when pigs fly.""' Irene Garza, a brunette beauty crowned Miss All South Texas Sweetheart, was first in her family to graduate from high school and go to college. Second victim: Three weeks before the tragedy, Maria America Guerra was attacked by a man inside a church; she later identified her assailant as Father Feit . The Mexican-American woman became a grade school teacher who often used her own money to buy supplies for her students. The elegant, eye-catching woman was last seen alive heading to confession on the night of April 16, 1960. She never returned. Her borrowed car was found the next morning near the church. Two days later, someone spotted Irene's leather purse, one of her high-heeled shoes and a piece of her white lace veil. The alarming discoveries set off a massive search in the county, which ended five days after Garza's disappearance when her body was fished out of an irrigation canal. The young woman was fully dressed, but her underwear was missing and the buttons on her blouse were undone. The autopsy found that Garza had been struck with a blunt object and then suffocated. The medical examiner also determined that the 25-year-old woman had been raped while comatose. Three weeks before the tragedy, Maria America Guerra was kneeling at the communion rail inside a church in neighboring Edinburg when a man in horn-rimmed glasses and priestly attire came up from behind, grabbed her and tried to gag her. Guerra, however, was able to fight off her assailant and escape. After Garza's murder, Guerra was shown Feit's photo in a lineup and recognized him as her attacker. But the priest escaped with only a light fine after the jury became deadlocked. When the cold case was reopened in 2002, two witnesses came forward to investigators to say Feit allegedly confessed to them. Garza's relatives have continued the fight to get justice for her, even more than 50 years after the crime . Tragic moment: Five days after her disappearance, Miss Garza's body was found in an irrigation canal; she was fully clothed buy missing underwear and with her blouse unbuttoned . De La Vina, who was 9-years-old when the crime occurred, said it was unthinkable to accuse a priest of such a horrific crime. 'We were accusing a priest that -- in those days priests were infallible, ' said De La Vina. Another relatives, Noemi Sigler, was only 10-years-old when Garza was killed. 'It was impossible for a priest to do such a deed. I mean, if you thought of it, that would be sacrilegious.' Sigler believes police protected Feit at the time because of his religious authority. 'I don't know whether it was out of respect for the church or anger or fear, I have no idea,' she said. Later, Noemi Sigler learned from her father, a deputy sheriff, that he had been ordered by his superiors to turn over the Garza case files and stop investigating her murder. Both cousins refused to let the case die even as Feit went to a monastery and the case grew cold. Garza's cousins, Noemi Sigler, left, and Lynda De La Vina, were both children when she was murdered but continued to investigate the case on their own until it was reopened by authorities in 2002 . When officials began their new investigation in 2002, two witnesses came forward to offer new evidence against Feit. One priest, Joseph O'Brien said he worked with Feit at Sacred Heart and told Sigler that Feit confessed to the murder. But the cleric has since passed away. The other witness was Dale Tacheny, who served as a monk and was Feit's spiritual adviser when he was in the Missouri monastery. Tacheny said Feit confessed to killing a young woman around Easter. Feit was immediately a suspect in Garza's death because he had recently been arrested for assaulting another young woman at a nearby church . Feit said he offered to take the woman to the rectory, Tacheny said, where Feit allegedly sexually assaulted her, bound and gagged her, fondled her breasts, and put something over her head. 'That's what he did,' said Tacheny, who said Feit more shocking details in his alleged confession. The former monk said Feit told him he took Garza to a separate location, where he was living, and hid her there, bound in a bathtub with a bag over her head, overnight. Tacheny recalled that Feit had allegedly told him that as he was leaving to go to church next morning, he heard Garza say, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe.”’ Garza died the next day when she apparently suffocated. This is Sacred Heart Catholic Church in McAllen, Texas where Feit worked when Garza was murdered . He asked Feit why he was living at a monastery and not in prison. ' ""The church protected me, the people in the church, my superiors, protected me,"" ' Tacheny quoted Feit as saying. 'I believe he killed her,' said Tacheny. 'I had no doubt about it because he said he did.' But District Attorney Guerra, chose not to arrest Feit because he did not find the two new witnesses credible. Guerra insisted that after more than half a century, the case against Feit is 'untriable.' In March 2004, Guerra assigned two prosecutors to handle the case, but Feit was never subpoenaed, and the two main witnesses were never called to give their testimony in person. That summer, the grand jury declined to indict John Feit for the murder of Irene Garza.","Irene Garza, 25, was found floating in irrigation canal in McAllen, Texas, in April 1960 .

A tinnitus sufferer whose problem was so bad that he was contemplating suicide has found his own cure - by emailing an expert 3,000 miles away in America. Retired radio presenter, Ian Turner, was at the end of his tether because the 'agonising' tinnitus was causing a constant a loud 'whooshing' sound in his right ear.

"By . Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 09:23 EST, 16 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:10 EST, 17 January 2014 . A condemned Ohio killer gasped, snorted and snored during a prolonged execution using a controversial, never-before-tried lethal injection this morning. Death row inmate Dennis McGuire took 15 minutes to die by the two-drug combination, a method adopted after . supplies of the state's previous drug dried up, and declared that he was going to Heaven before succumbing to the cocktail. 'I'm going to heaven, I'll see you there when you come,' he said in the small, windowless room in the Lucasville correctional facility. He was pronounced dead at 10:53 a.m., after one of the longest executions since Ohio resumed capital punishment in 1999. The 53-year-old's attorneys had argued against using intravenous doses . of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone, claiming the combination would cause 'air hunger' - where someone experiences immense terror and agony as they strain for breath during the execution. McGuire's snorts and gasps, and prolonged death, suggest he may have indeed suffered the medical phenomenon and could prompt Ohio officials to review using the drug cocktail. Previous executions with the former . execution drugs took much less time, and typically did not include the loud sounds that McGuire uttered. Scroll down for video . Execution: Death row inmate Dennis McGuire, pictured, became the first prisoner executed in the U.S. by the two-drug combination. His family are now suing, saying he was 'tortured' during the execution . McGuire thanked his 22-year-old . victim's family for a letter he received from them, referring to 'kind . words' that meant a lot. Joy Stewart's sister Carol Avery wrote in the . note that she had forgiven him but also insisted 'it is time - past time . - for him to pay for what he did to my sister.' He opened and shut his hands as if waving to his adult son, . daughter and daughter-in-law sitting a few feet away and a full minute . later he stood up and told them, 'I love you, I love you.' He was then still for five minutes before . emitting a loud snort as if snoring and continued to make this noise for several minutes. His stomach rose and fell several times as . he repeatedly opened and shut his mouth, making what the Columbus Dispatch described as 'deep, rattling sounds.' His family sobbed as they watched him slowly die. At one point, his . daughter exclaimed 'Oh my God' as she observed her father's final moments. A coughing sound was Dennis McGuire's last apparent movement, at 10:43 a.m. He was pronounced dead 10 minutes later. McGuire as first injected with the drugs at 10:29 a.m. McGuire's last meal yesterday consisted of roast beef, a . cream cheese bagel, fried chicken, potatoes two ways, butter pecan ice . cream and Coca-Cola. He skipped a shower and breakfast this morning . and had a final visit with his children before the scheduled execution. On Wednesday, he . arrived calmly at the death house and spent the night writing letters, phoning his . mother and sister and visiting with his son and daughter. McGuire's attorneys had warned the convicted rapist and murderer would likely . suffer from air hunger, which sees a person . experience immense pain and terror as they strain to catch their breath . before they die. They argued sentencing him to this manner of death was . unconstitutionally . cruel. Experimental: McGuire was executed at this facility by Ohio's untested execution method . Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio used intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death . Ohio has begun using lethal doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydropmorphone after the European manufacturer of the previous drug, pentobarbital, stopped allowing its use in lethal injections. Marketed in English-speaking countries and Mexico under the trade names Dormicum, Hypnovel, and Versed, midazolam is a short-acting sedative in the benzodiazepine class of drugs developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s. The drug is used for treatment of acute seizures, moderate to severe insomnia, and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures. It possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. Hydromorphone is a very potent centrally acting analgesic drug of the opioid class. It is a derivative of morphine. An expert in Dennis McGuire's case claimed the two drugs together in lethal doses would very likely cause what's known as 'air hunger' or simply an acute shortness of breath. The clinical definition of air hunger or dyspnea is an uncomfortable awareness of one's breathing effort. It is a normal symptom of heavy exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations. Reports from McGuire's death chamber suggest this may have in fact occurred. As such, the appropriateness of the drugs, and the extent to which they may be cruel, will likely be reviewed by Ohio officials before they are used in another execution. Ohio officials used intravenous doses . of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone to put . McGuire to death. The method has been part of Ohio's execution process . since 2009, though never used until now. The state presented evidence from its own . expert disputing the air hunger scenario, and saying McGuire waited far . too long to file the appeal, which came earlier this month. A federal judge sided with the state and gave the green light for the execution to proceed. At the request of McGuire's lawyers, . Judge Gregory Frost on Wednesday also ordered the state to photograph . and then preserve the drugs' packaging boxes and vials and the syringes . used in the execution. Richard Dieter, executive director of . the anti-capital punishment Death Penalty Information Center, told NBC . News after the execution that McGuire's gasps may lead the state or the . courts to rethink the new drug combination. 'This . doesn’t sound like it was a complete disaster but they don't want . anything that even has the appearance of someone suffering or a delay in . death being carried out,' Dieter said. 'This is going to be looked at . with good concern.' It is . not unheard of for an execution to take 15 minutes or even longer, but . Dieter told the network that if the prisoner was physically struggling . much of that time, it could be seen as cruel. 'This sounds like more discomfort than they would want in carrying out an execution,' he said. The . U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-minute request to delay McGuire's . execution on the grounds that a jury never got to hear the full extent . of his chaotic and abusive childhood. The court's denial Wednesday . included no explanation. McGuire was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. Stewart's . slaying went unsolved for 10 months until McGuire, jailed on an . unrelated assault and hoping to improve his legal situation, told . investigators he had information about the woman's February 12, 1989, . death. His attempts to blame the crime on . his brother-in-law quickly unraveled and soon he was accused of being . Stewart's killer, according to prosecutors. More . than a decade later, DNA evidence confirmed McGuire's guilt, and he . acknowledged that he was responsible in a letter to Governor John Kasich . last month. Victim: McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant . New drugs: Ohio officials used intravenous doses of the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone to put McGuire, pictured at an undated court hearing, to death . 'One can scarcely conceive of a . sequence of crimes more shocking to the conscience or to moral . sensibilities than the senseless kidnapping and rape of a young, . pregnant woman followed by her murder,' Preble County prosecutors said . in a filing with the state parole board last month. His attorneys argued McGuire was mentally, physically and sexually abused as a child and had impaired brain function that made him prone to act impulsively. 'Dennis was at risk from the moment he was born,' the lawyers said in a parole board filing. 'The lack of proper nutrition, chaotic home environment, abuse, lack of positive supervision and lack of positive role models all affected Dennis' brain development.' Documents obtained by The Associated Press show McGuire unsuccessfully sought a reprieve in recent weeks to try to become an organ donor. In November, Kasich granted a death row inmate an eight-month reprieve to let the prison system study his request to donate a kidney to his sister and his heart to his mother. Kasich said McGuire couldn't identify a family member who would receive his organs, as required under prison policy. Ohio lost its previous execution drug when the manufacturer put it off limits for capital punishment. Crime scene: The pregnant 22-year-old was found dead in a dark wood, pictured, in 1989 .

In the letter Joy's sister wrote, she described her 10-years-younger, adopted sister as the light of her family's life. 'She was born Christmas Day, 1966 but I haven't spoken to her in more than 24 years. Her voice was silenced on February 11, 1989 when Dennis McGuire brutally ended her life.' Avery said the soon-to-be mom was excited about the birth of her baby boy, who tragically died too the day of the murder. 'She never got to realize her dreams, never got to hold her baby boy in her arms, never got to kiss his soft cheek, never got to see him smile,' she wrote.

Regarding the contentious lethal injection McGuire was given, Avery wrote: 'There has been a lot of controversy regarding the drugs that are to be used in his execution, concern that he might feel terror, that he might suffer. 'As I recall the events preceding her death; forcing her from the car, attempting to rape her vaginally, sodomizing her, choking her, stabbing her, leaving her to bleed out: I know she suffered terror and pain. 'He is being treated far more humanely than he treated her.'","'I'm going to heaven, I'll see you there when you come,' were Dennis McGuire's final words before he succumbed to the lethal injection .

The widow of a slain Austin police officer read letters written by his heartbroken children in court after his killer was sentenced to death. Brandon Daniel, 26, was sentenced to death late Friday night for the April 2012 shooting death of officer Jamie Padron, but he was not permitted to leave without first hearing from his grieving children. ‘How the hell do I tell two little girls that their daddy is dead?’ Widow Amy Padron said in court she thought after learning of the veteran cop’s death, according to the Austin Statesman. 'Dear bad guy': Widow Amy Padron read aloud letters from her grieving daughters aged 10 and six-years-old . Beloved father: Six-year-old Olivia's note said her father was 'smart' and 'funny,' but most of all - 'important' ‘Dear bad guy, why did you kill my dad? My dad was important,’ she read from daughter daughter Olivia’s letter while crying, in video of the proceedings broadcast by TWC News Austin. ‘You deserve to be punished. Please be a good guy now. Circle yes or no. You made me have nightmares,’ the six-year-old’s letter continued. The heart wrenching scene saw Amy Padron alternate by bouts of hysterical crying and furious shouting at her husband’s killer. ‘Get a life behind bars, you will die behind bars....Why my dad? Why Walmart?’ Daughter Ariana’s letter asked. ‘Drunk or not, how stupid are you?’ The 10-year-old girl continued, her letter was 11 pages long. ‘You should be ashamed of yourself and your actions.’ Amy Padron thanked the jury when done, . telling them it was time to ‘go home and help rebuild my daughters' lives. You will be their heroes.’ Padron, a 17-year veteran police officer and former Marine, was gunned down by Daniel after responding early April 6, 2012, to reports of a drunken man shoplifting at an Austin Walmart, according to Officer Down. Daniel was tackled by Padron when he tried to flee, but shot him in the neck and vest in the ensuing struggle. The father of two was pronounced dead at the scene. Missed: Jamie Padron with his daughters Olivia (left) and Ariana (right) in the left photo, the younger Olivia is at center wearing pink in the right photo . 'You're a monster': Linda Diaz, the slain officer's sister, directly attacked Daniel from the witness stand after his death sentence was handed down . Linda Diaz, Jamie Padron’s sister, spoke to directly to her brother’s killer. ‘You are a monster,’ she said to Daniel. ‘You may have ripped my brother out of our lives, but let me tell you something, his spirit lives on, it's alive. ‘You don't get to come here, choose to do a crime and then choose your consequence. Do you understand what I am saying?’ She continued. ‘Yes ma’am,’ the convicted killer answered. The parting shot came from Johnny Padron, Jamie Padron’s brother. ‘I . respect our courts, so I won't speak my mind, but I will tell you I . think you're a coward and I hope you rot in hell. Thank you.’ He later said outside the courtroom that the family feels justice was served. Shattered: Johnny Padron, Jamie's brother, told the killer 'I hope you rot in hell' before the court session ended . The tearful confrontations came after Daniel was found guilty of capital murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection.. The former software engineer’s ex-girlfriend cried after the decision was handed down. Daniel shot Jamie Padron dead April with a .380 handgun during a confrontation at an Austin Walmart.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:17 EST, 1 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 16:58 EST, 1 March 2014 . A divorced couple's bitter rift took a twisted turn when a Connecticut woman allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill her ex-husband - and retained custody of their daughter. For more than a year Eric and Tiffany Stevens battled over the rights to the eight-year-old girl, and control of a $50 million fund that is linked to her custody. In July 2012 however, Mrs Stevens was arrested for allegedly offering a maintenance man $5,000 to kill her ex-husband. Custody battle: Eric Stevens delivers a complaint on Thursday in his legal efforts to regain care of his daughter . Now, almost two years later, Mr Stevens says he doesn't know exactly where his daughter is, only that the woman who tried to have him killed still officially has custody. 'I think it's unconscionable,' Mr Stevens, whose $50 million in real estate will go to whoever has custody of the child. A New York state police report said his ex-wife told officers when she was arrested that she was using cocaine and oxy condon, according to Fox CT. Mrs Stevens, whose father is a multimillionaire, was out on bail one day after her arrest. On Thursday, Mr Stevens filed a complaint with the Statewide Grievance Committee, which handles lawyer discipline cases, against the court-appointed guardian ad litem - or advocate - for his daughter in the custody case, alleging corruption and perjury. It was the latest legal maneuver in divorce and custody cases that have produced nearly 180 motions and rulings - and extraordinary allegations by both sides - since Mr Stevens filed for divorce in 2009 after less than six years of marriage. Three years later, police claim Mrs Stevens tried to have her former husband killed. The custody fight grew even more complicated a week after her arrest when her parents, with her support, filed a motion for custody of their only grandchild. Mr Stevens filed a motion for immediate custody of his daughter in September 2012, citing his ex-wife's arrest, and Hartford Family Court Judge Leslie Olear rejected it without explanation, court records show. Claims: Tiffany Stevens was arrested in 2012 on allegations that she tried to hire a hit man to kill Eric . His ex-wife's parents claim in court papers that he's unfit to be a parent, but Olear hasn't ruled on their custody request, either. A secretary for Olear said the judge would not comment on the case. A state Judicial Branch spokeswoman says the branch doesn't comment on pending legal cases. Mrs Stevens, 38, of Bloomfield, couldn't be reached for comment. She has pleaded not guilty and posted $1 million bail in the still-pending case. The lawyers in her criminal and Family Court cases didn't return messages seeking comment. The guardian ad litem, Mary Bergamini, also did not return messages seeking comment. Mr Stevens believes his daughter, who turns 9 in about two weeks, is living with his ex-wife, but says he can't be sure. He says the girl also could be with either of Mrs Stevens' parents, Edward Khalily and Diana Rabbani, who live in different towns in Long Island, New York. Mr Khalily is a principal of WEGO Chemical & Mineral Co, a large chemical distributor based in Great Neck. Ms Rabbani declined to comment. Mr Khalily called Mr Stevens a liar before refusing further comment in a brief phone interview. Mr Stevens said he hasn't seen his daughter since October 2011 because of Family Court orders. His ex-wife was granted sole custody of their daughter as part of their 2011 divorce agreement, which provided Mr Stevens with supervised visits. Now, he said there is only an order requiring that his daughter call him on weeknights. Mr Stevens said that when his daughter calls, the number shows up as blocked on his caller ID, preventing him from knowing where she is calling from. The case is rife with bitter allegations on both sides. Documents filed by Mrs Stevens' lawyers include a psychological examination of her ex-husband saying he has depression with 'psychotic features' and an apparent personality disorder. She also obtained a restraining order against him and accused him of threatening and harassing her and their daughter. Mr Stevens denies the claims in the psychological exam and his ex-wife's allegations. In August 2009, Mr Stevens was arrested for violating the restraining order by going to his daughter's school and unsuccessfully trying to buy a gun for $10,000 at a pawn shop, court records show. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless endangerment and was sentenced to probation. Mr Stevens accuses his ex-wife of being a long-time drug addict. Court records show Mrs Stevens had to undergo random drug testing as part of the child custody case. The case file in Family Court also includes a letter by the state Department of Children and Families saying officials had substantiated claims of physical and emotional neglect by Mrs Stevens against her daughter. Hartford Democratic state represenatatives Minnie Gonzalez and Angel Arce accompanied Mr Stevens as he filed the complaint Thursday, saying they're trying to reform the Family Court system. Meanwhile, Olear on Wednesday survived a close vote on her reconfirmation as a judge in the state House of Representatives, after parents frustrated with the Family Court system urged lawmakers to vote against her. The House approved Olear on an unusually narrow vote for a judge reconfirmation, 78-67. Olear later cleared the Senate on a 28-4 vote.","Eric Stevens believes eight-year-old is still living with her mother .

The kids' father, Troy Lewis, was able to rescue 9-year-old Shaca and 5-year-old Electra from their burning duplex; both children remain in a hospital, but are said to be on the road to recovery. Unimaginable loss: Troy Lewis, 60, leans over his daughter Mary's casket before the funerals for the five Lewis children, who were killed in a north Minneapolis duplex fire last month . Day of grief: Mourners pay their respects inside Shiloh Temple Church in Minneapolis, which hosted the funeral service for the five Lewis children . Outpouring of support: Some 200 people came out to pay tribute to the victims of the Valentine's Day fire . Mr Lewis, 60, dressed all in black, wept as he touched the plain white caskets bearing the photos of his dead children on the side, each topped with an arrangement of red roses. Troy Lewis was joined at Shiloh Temple Church Saturday by 200 relatives, friends and supporters, including Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, School Superintendent Bernadeia Johnson and Fire Chief John Fruetel. The Lewis family had already been dealing with the death of their mother, Kim Davis, 31, who passed away last fall. While the tragedy still hurts, there was some peace and comfort felt amid the tears. ‘It meant to me that I was sending my children home to their mother and to a better place,’ Troy Lewis said, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. The nearly two-hour funeral service ended with family members embracing one another and the children’s caskets. ‘Our hearts are exploding. ... There are no words to describe how we feel right now,’ said Lewis' sister, Debra Lewis, of Chicago. ‘How hard it is for my brother to have his five beautiful angels in front of him.’ Final touch: Mr Lewis wept as he caressed Gwendolyn's small coffin, but he was able to find some solace in the tjought that his children have joined their mother in heaven . Family decimated: Out of Troy Lewis' seven children, the fire claimed the lives of Mary, Christopher, Troy Jr, Fannie and baby Gwendolyn . Silver lining: Shaca (right) and Electra (left) are still recovering in a hospital from their injuries . Investigators still have not determined the cause of the fire but have said a space heater had been running for days and was located where the fire appears to have started. ‘You were there that morning, and we know you tried (to save them),’ Miss Lewis told her brother. ‘Now we have to stand fast.’ Troy Lewis revealed that the two children who did survive the February fire continue to heal both physically and emotionally. ‘One of my daughters is in shock, she just don't [sic] want to talk about it,’ Lewis said. In a rare moment of levity, Mr Lewis joked that one of the girls asked for McDoland’s food and the other requested M&Ms. Speaking from his hospital bed just days after the fire, Mr Lewis tearfully described how he had to choose which of his seven children to save from the flames. 'I wanted to get all of my babies,' Lewis told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'All of my babies. I wanted all my babies.' Regis Woodson and Chris Anderson embrace each other as they visit the home where a fire broke out Friday, Feb. 14, 2014, in Minneapolis . Blaze: Lewis managed to save two of his seven children before the flames, pictured, became too much . The . fire broke out around 4.30am February 14 on the top floor of the duplex. According . to the building's landlord, Lewis and his children had been living there . for the past six or eight months. The children's mother died in November from cancer. Lewis had to jump out of his second-story window to escape the blaze. He injured his back in the fall, but went right back into the house to save his children. First he grabbed Shaca who was gasping for air. Then he went for 8-year-old Christopher, but found his son already dead. 'He was dead,' Lewis told the Star Tribune. 'I saw him burned. I saw my baby burn.' Two . other children shared a bedroom with Christopher, 5-year-old Fannie and . 3-year-old Troy, so Lewis moved on to look for the other kids knowing . those two children didn't make it. Tragic: Five of Troy Lewis' seven children died in a duplex fire Friday morning . Cause: Authorities say the fire started on the second floor, and likely was caused by a space heater . 'I had a choice to make, a dead child here or...a live one,' Lewis said. After rescuing Shaca and Electra, Lewis again attempted to get back into the house but by then it was engulfed in flames. 'I ran back upstairs to get the third child, that's when I stopped. I couldn't do it no more. Out of seven, I have two. I have to be strong for them,' Lewis told WCCO. 'All I can say is that they were beautiful children,' Lewis added. Should have never moved into that house.' Landlord Paul Bertelson’s company identifies distressed . or foreclosed properties, refurbishes them and rents to low-income . families. He said the 102-year-old duplex had smoke and carbon monoxide . detectors. The upper unit is heated by permanent baseboard units. There were no current code violations on the duplex where 15 people lived. Lucky: A man living on the first floor of the building smelled smoke and evacuated the house with his family . Neighbors say the second and third floors of the home were occupied by a man and his seven children ranging in age from 1 to 9 . Minneapolis Fire Chief Fruetel said three children died at the scene. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office later confirmed the two additional deaths but did not release any information about the victims. Fruetel said firefighters encountered heavy smoke and fire on the second and third floors of the duplex as they searched for victims and survivors. It took firefighters about 2½ hours to put out the blaze. He said the building was up to code and smoke detectors were hard-wired and appeared to be working. He said he didn’t know if the smoke detectors went off before this fire. Gov. Mark Dayton issued a statement offering condolences to the family and friends of the victims, and thanking firefighters and other first responders 'whose heroism saved lives this morning.' City records show an inspection report last summer called for repairs to smoke detectors in the unit, among other violations. City spokesman Matt Laible said all of the violations were taken care of and that the unit’s rental license was renewed just a week ago.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:23 EST, 28 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:47 EST, 2 March 2014 . Attorneys for a former Montana teacher who raped a 14-year-old student have argued that his 30 days in prison were enough punishment and he shouldn’t serve out the rest of his term. Prosecutors want to send freed rapist Stacey Dean Rambold back to prison saying in an appeal that he should have served a minimum of four years after pleading guilty last year to sexual assault without consent. They suggested the girl bore some responsibility for the rape, and referenced sealed videotaped interviews with her before she committed suicide while the case was pending. Freed: Stacey Rambold, seen here in August 2013, was freed from a Montana jail after only spending a month in prison for raping his 14-year-old student, who has since killed herself . Victim Cherice Moralez was a freshman when she was raped; Rambold, then 47, was her business teacher. She committed suicide in 2010 before the case went to trial, an act her mother said was driven largely by the rape. In a legal brief that lays out their arguments against the state's appeal, lawyers for Rambold cited a 'lynch mob' mentality following the huge public outcry over the case. 'The citizens of Montana have determined that persons as young as 12 years of age will be held accountable and responsible for their actions in regard to certain types of sexual offenses,' Rambold attorney Jay Lansing wrote. 'There is no rational basis to conclude that if the person is 14 years of age, the person can only have responsibility if they are the offender.' Lansing also said the state missed its chance to appeal by not raising the issue during an August sentencing hearing. Horror: Cherice Moralez, pictured, shot herself dead in her mother's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail . The case gained notoriety after Judge G. Todd Baugh commented during Rambold's sentencing that the victim 'appeared older than her chronological age' and 'was probably as much in control of the situation as the defendant.' The judge also has cited the video interviews. Attorney Shane Colton, who represented the victim's estate in a wrongful death lawsuit, said the girl was too young to be complicit in the crime against her. 'It's my understanding that the state's law is at age 14 you cannot give consent, therefore you can't be complicit in any fashion,' Colton said. John Barnes, a spokesman for Montana Attorney General Tim Fox, said the state has 14 days to reply to Rambold's arguments and would have no immediate comment. The latest turn in the case was sharply criticized as 'more victim blaming' by Marian Bradley, president of the Montana chapter of the National Organization for Women. Fighting: Cherice's mother Auliea Hanlon has said that she does not feel that justice was served in the case and cites the scandal surrounding the case as the reason her daughter killed herself . Heartbreaking: Hanlon, seen here at rally in August, held a moment of silence for her daughter . 'They are comparing the victim to a sex offender, and that's not OK. She was a victim, not a perpetrator,' Bradley said. Outrageous: Attorneys for Rambold argue that the victim was complicit because she looked older than her age . The girl's death took away the prosecution's main witness, and Rambold initially avoided prosecution under a deferred prosecution agreement that included sex-offender treatment. He violated the agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives' children and having a sexual relationship with an adult woman, according to court documents. That re-opened the case and led to the sentence from Baugh of 15 years in prison with all but one month suspended. Rambold was released in September. Montana's Judicial Standards Commission said this week that Baugh should be censured by the Montana Supreme Court for imposing an unlawful sentence and blaming the child victim. The panel investigated the case after receiving hundreds of complaints about the judge. It's uncertain whether Baugh will have a public hearing. On Feb. 13, he waived his right to formal proceedings before the commission and submitted himself to justices for punishment. He has apologized for his comments about Moralez and said he plans to retire when his current term expires at the end of the year. Censure is defined by the commission as a public declaration by the high court that a judge is guilty of misconduct. It can be ordered in conjunction with other sanctions but does not require suspension or removal from office.","Stacey Rambold was released in September after being sentenced to spend only 30 days behind bars for raping his student .
The student later killed herself and her mother said that the 2010 rape was the cause .
Prosecutors now trying to appeal and make Rambold spend at least 4 years in jail for the crime .
His lawyers argue the month in jail was enough and the VICTIM was partially at fault for the rape because she looked older than her age ."
"By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 11:58 EST, 20 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:21 EST, 20 December 2013 . For most of us, tomorrow's Winter Solstice is little more than another chilly December day. But for Kevin Carlyon, 55, from St Leonards on Sea in East Sussex, it has a much deeper meaning. For Kevin is a white witch, and for him, and others like him, the shortest day of the year is one of the most important. The reason, explains Kevin, is because the day marks the turn of the season, the rebirth of the sun and the slow march towards warmer summer days. Nature: Kevin taps into the power in the atmosphere around him as he prepares for an outdoor ceremony . 'The main thing will be to celebrate rebirth . of the sun,' he explains. 'I will be lighting a big bonfire to welcome the sun back.' But Kevin's day won't end there. As the self-described high priest of British witches, his day will also involve another ceremony - a hand-fasting or pagan marriage. 'It's basically a nice little ceremony,' he elaborates. 'A circle . will be cast in my garden, although at moment with forecast, it looks like it will be in my living room instead, for the four elements of air, fire, earth and water. 'The couple will be . wearing robes and will be inside the circle with me. It's spiritually binding like a Christian marriage - the only difference is that there's no pagan divorce ceremony!' The handfasting will be followed by a feast for Kevin and 30 guests, complete with lashings of wine, to celebrate the Solstice. Important: Kevin is the high priest of British witches and also conducts hand-fasting ceremonies . Important: Candles are a favourite tool for spell-casting and are particularly precious at the Solstice . 'They range from policemen . to housewives,' adds Kevin. 'People bring what they . want to eat and we'll have a mini feast.' It's a far cry from Kevin's usual day, which involves channelling his power for the benefit of supplicants from all over the world with problems that only a white witch can solve. Most, he admits, involve mending broken relationships and finding lost pets, although he also reveals that there are some requests that he simply won't entertain. 'The most common request is to do with relationship break ups,' he explains. 'There are lots of women who are married to people having affairs. 'Quite a lot of them want to . make the man's willy stop working for anyone else. If I hear all . of the circumstances  and I feel that what I've heard is genuine, then I'll help but I'm very strict about it. 'I . won't help people who've been out and cheated on their partners and have decided they want them back or anyone who has been violent.' Most of the rituals he performs, all of which are unique to him, involve lighting candles or using crystals - both of which he has been doing since he was 16. 'The first spell I ever did was when I was 16 and it was . to find someones lost cat,' he remembers. 'The lady lived by the marina and was convinced the cat had died. Solstice: The Winter Solstice is celebrated by pagans like Kevin with bonfires to welcome the reborn sun . Service: Another part of Kevin's work is infusing crystals with energy aimed at tackling illness and infertility . 'I did my hocus pocus and lit a candle over a photo of the cat, and . three days later, she called me and said ""you have to come down here and see this"".' 'I went along to her basement flat and found eight to nine cats sitting outside - . including her own.' Other popular services include charms to boost fertility, the removal of jinxes caused by intense hatred or black magic, and getting rid of unwanted paranormal visitors. For now, Kevin is looking forward to the coming holiday, which he says, also shines a light on the origins of British Christmas traditions. 'In [pre-Christian] pagan . culture, people used to light fires and candles to celebrate the rebirth of the sun. 'Later, of course, the Christian church replaced the rebirth of the sun with the birth of Jesus but most of what we do at Christmas is pagan.' And what will he be doing on Christmas Day? 'I'll be chilling out and watching the telly like everyone else!' For more on Kevin and his work, visit kevthewitch.co.uk . 'It's a particularly good time to wish for improved relationships as well as help with fertility problems,' explains Kevin. 'And it's nice to put a bit of holly and mistletoe around your candle too.' WHAT TO DO . Get a brand new candle and place it inside a circle made from a piece of string or in a round bowl. Visualise your wish and light the candle just before 5.11pm on the 21st. As you light it visualise your wish and say 'As I make my wish, be it done, speed it well, power to the sun'. Blow out the candle and as the smoke rises, visualise your wish going out to the world.","Kevin Carlyon, 55, from East Sussex is a self-described witch .

Tragic: Kate Dixon, 41, was brutally stabbed after her boyfriend Jonathan Tebbs found she had met someone else on a dating site, a court heard . A jealous lover murdered his girlfriend over her affair with a man she met on a dating site for Oxbridge graduates, a court heard. Jonathan Tebbs, 46, stabbed dedicated town hall chief Kate Dixon 29 times with a Swiss Army knife, it is claimed, before reading an Oscar Wilde poem about a man who kills his wife. He stripped her clothes off and calmly carried her into the shower where he washed the blood from her lifeless body, it is alleged. The killer attempted to scrub the murder scene clean and then searched on the internet for Wilde’s The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which includes the verse: ‘Yet each man kills the thing he loves … The coward does it with a kiss, the brave man with the sword.’ Southwark Crown . Court heard that Tebbs denies the murder of Ms Dixon, 41, but has . pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished . responsibility. Miss Dixon, 41, a public servant at Islington Council, north London, endured a stormy relationship with Tebbs for more than 12 years after meeting on the Tube. But he was increasingly possessive as she became ‘more and more disillusioned’, the court was told. She began using Blues Match – a dating website for graduates of Oxford and Cambridge universities – and in March last year met a man called Mark with whom she began a relationship. On the night of June 30 she summoned the courage to tell Tebbs she was leaving him. He responded by attacking her so violently the blade pierced her heart and lungs. Prosecutor Gillian Etherton QC told the jury: ‘He took out what he later referred to [in interviews with] police as his Swiss Army knife and deliberately, purposefully, repeatedly and with severe force stabbed Kate to death. 'The multiple stab wounds are . distributed principally to the front of the chest, but also to both arms . and to the back of her legs. 'You will have little difficulty in coming to the conclusion, she must have tried desperately to defend herself.' Tebbs then attempted to remove the blood stains from Miss Dixon’s flat in Streatham, south London, before conducting internet searches about poetry and writing a will. The jury was told that Tebbs believed he and Miss Dixon – described by colleagues as extremely dedicated – were ‘meant to be together’. Southwark Crown Court heard Tebbs denies the murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter . The couple had been in an on-off relationship for 12 years at the time of her death in June, last year, having met on a Tube train. Although there is no evidence he was violent towards her before her death, the court heard, there were several occasions when she was left ‘fearful’ of him. Mrs Etherton said the victim wanted to end the relationship but was ‘frightened about what his reaction might be’. She added: ‘He was an intelligent . man, but a controlling man … whilst it is accepted there were good times . and Kate was very fond indeed of the defendant, it is clear that he . could be very controlling of her, possessive and very jealous. ‘When he didn’t get his way with Kate, you will hear, he would verbally bully and intimidate her.’ Jurors heard that Ms Dixon . began using Blues Match - an online dating site for Oxbridge graduates - . and in March last year met a man called Mark with whom she began . relationship. Ms Etherton told . the court: 'It seems that Kate's feelings towards Mark may well have . given her the strength she needed to end her relationship with Jonathan . Tebbs.' In the days before . her death, Miss Dixon exchanged text messages with Mark but Tebbs was . suspicious and accessed her phone. He also caught her speaking to him . via online video on Skype. After the killing Tebbs moved money into his sister’s account and wrote a five-page statement before confessing to police. Yet each man kills the thing he loves,By each let this be heard,Some do it with a bitter look,Some with a flattering word,The coward does it with a kiss,The brave man with a sword! from The Ballad of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde . He . was charged with murder the following day. Tebbs admits manslaughter on . the grounds of diminished responsibility but denies murder. Mrs . Etherton said: ‘He had been aware of Mark for the best part of a week. However upset and angry …  Mr Tebbs’s behaviour was brutal and . ultimately selfish.’ She . added: ‘After the brutal killing of his girlfriend he is clear-headed, . he is organised and he is putting his house in order.’ Ms Dixon's boyfriend threatened to kill her four years before he actually did so, a friend told the court. Dominic . Wynniatt-Husey, a lawyer who was advising the victim on her business . dealings with Tebbs, urged her to contact the police about the threats. 'My . only real recollection of anything that was said was that he threatened . to kill her,' he said. 'It was a very awkward moment, I wasn't . expecting this bombshell to be dropped'. Ramita . Navai - who first met Ms Dixon at Putney High School when they were . both aged 11 - said that Tebbs initially seemed 'nice and normal' but . had an 'explosive temper'. She said her friend had phoned her in 2003 saying 'I need to leave' and adding 'I'm scared he's going to come back'. A . colleague of Ms Dixon at Islington Council, where she worked with . vulnerable children, told the court that Tebbs had kicked in his . girlfriend's door and demanded her wages. 'I . would say he was quite intimidating in the sense that when she joined . the council he was on her case quite a lot about money,' Bianca Robinson . said. 'He sent her text messages asking her to come out to meet him. It was threatening and very intimidating for her.' The trial continues.

The first ever drag show performed at a US military base was hailed as a resounding success over the weekend - but predictably, some were outraged. On Saturday, six gay, straight and lesbian servicemen and women slapped on the makeup to dance and lip-sync their way through hits such as 'I Wanna Dance with Somebody' at the Rocker NCO Club at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa to raise money for the military's largest LGBT nonprofit advocate. Expecting to sell only 75 tickets, the organizers welcomed 400 people to the show, which has been criticized by former Republican Congressman Allen West, who attacked the Pentagon for worrying about 'hair and makeup for our gay military' while Russia overwhelms the Ukraine. Scroll Down for Video . On stage: One of the drag performers lip-syncs to their song during Saturdays 'variety show' performance at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan . Before: The drag show was the first ever time that a performance of its kind has been seen at a US Military base ever . The historic event, the first since the 2011 repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, is a step forward for the military which has hosted gay marriage ceremonies and dinners for LGBT servicemen and women, but never a drag show. On Saturday night, the Rocker club was rammed for performances by serving members with stage names such as Chocolate Sunrise and Artemis Faux. The event’s sole lesbian performer took the drag king name Manny Nuff. Raising money for the Okinawa chapter of OutServe-SLDN, the group were stunned weeks ago when the event starring drag kings and drag queens was approved - but as a 'variety show'. Watch Video Here: . Popular: The organizers of the show feared that they wouldn't sell more than 100 tickets for the performance but they ended up with a packed house of 400 people . Pioneering: The show has been hailed as a huge success by the organizers and by those who attended who said that sexual orientation is not an issue in the military for servicemen and women . The advocacy group agreed not to use the term 'drag show' on the base, but those who attended were left in little doubt that it was. 'We didn’t think there was much of a desire for an event like this on the island but it has actually blown up,' said Navy Lt. Marissa Greene, co-chapter leader of OutServe Okinawa to Stars and Stripes magazine. Expecting less than 100 people to arrive, Greene was stunned when they sold 400 tickets in ten days. Indeed, the unexpected success of the show highlights the changing attitudes within the military to its LGBT members, as gay civil rights reach a pivotal moment across the nation - with many states passing laws legalizing marriage. Former U.S. Congressman Allen West attends the Faith and Freedom Coalition Road to Majority Conference in Washington in June - the Republican politician was scathing of the drag show put on in Okinawa over the weekend . Make-up: The show was weeks in the planning for  the new Okinawa chapter of OutServe-SLDN, an advocacy organization for LGBTs in the U.S. military . It is also a huge moment for the American military. Just three years ago, a gay, lesbian or drag performance on a military base would have been unthinkable and could have led to dismissal from the armed forces. But the repeals of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, as well as the Defense of Marriage Act now mean that gay and lesbian people can be open about their sexuality and serve the military at the same time. However, all are not convinced by the openness the military is now beginning to display. Former Republican Congressman Allen West said that he was 'kinda at a loss for words' over the fundraiser for members of the military. On Saturday, servicemembers on OKinawa were the first to take to the stage and perform as drag queens on a military installation in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender troops . Songs: The show was a resounding success but carefully avoided any mentions of politics . In a post on his website following the show, which West called, 'Our Gay Military Dances in Drag in Okinawa', the politician seemed threatened and frightened for America's military past and future. Annoyed that the show took place on Okinawa, 'the scene of one of the most ferocious and protracted battles of World War II - a site of legendary valor and sacrifice on the part of American soldiers', West was withering in his surmising of the show. 'Some US service personnel stationed in Okinawa today are treating the world to another kind of display: Gay and lesbian service personnel performing in drag, to raise for their activities, to a sellout audience.' West goes as far to claim that the since the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the rate of sexual assaults in the military and especially male-on-male sexual assaults has 'skyrocketed'. Backing up West's scathing opinion of the show, Right Wing News called the performance 'disgusting' and went as far as to make very derogatory remarks regarding the performance. Tech. Sgt. Kristen Baker, who was among the crowd, said the show got a great reception and was important for civil rights. 'Everything is just accepted. It makes me really proud to watch it,' Baker said. In the military, 'we are all brothers and sisters no matter what.'","First ever drag show is performed at US Military base on Okinawa .

James Packer has branded his personal life a 'disaster' just months after being romantically linked to Miranda Kerr. The billionaire businessman, 46, split from his wife Erica in September and three months later was rumoured to be dating the former Victoria's Secret model following the end of her marriage to Orlando Bloom. (Neither commented on the claims.) In a new interview with Forbes magazine, he says: 'Business is good right now, but now my personal life is a disaster.' Marriage split: James Packer with ex wife Erica in 2009 . 'I had a marriage breakdown last year,' he continued. 'The last thing I think I am is perfect. I’m just trying to do the best job I can. I’m trying to be the best father I can to my kids. I’m trying to do the best job I can running my business.' Packer - who is increasing his billion-pound fortune by buying casinos - and former wife Erica were long-term friends with Kerr, 30, and Bloom. The newly-separated pair were rumoured to be spending time together late last year following their respective break-ups just 45 days apart. Teary-eyed: Billionaire businessman James Packer broke down in a TV interview last year when talking about his late father Kerry . Packer, who has three children with ex-wife Erica, has known Kerr for years - with the billionaire thought to have given the former Victoria's Secret model business advice when she launched her range of beauty products, Kora, several years ago. The two have also holidayed together in the past with their families, spending time in Bora Bora in May 2012. Kerr and ex-husband Orlando Bloom, along with their baby Flynn, also enjoyed the Packers' largesse during a seaside sojourn with the hosts and two of their three children, Indigo and Jackson. Romance rumours: Packer was linked to Miranda Kerr, seen here at Vanity Fair's Oscars party on Sunday, back in December . Kerr's mother Therese told The Australian Women's Weekly this month that she took the rumours about her daughter dating Packer 'with a grain of salt'. 'There are so many untruths,' she said. 'We take it with a grain of salt. If you were to take everything that's written as truth, you would get upset. We choose to ignore it.' When asked if there was any truth to the 'Kerr-acker' rumours that were circulating, she said: 'If there was, Miranda is not going to tell me. 'When the story broke, I said ""What's the go?"" She said ""Mum, don't believe everything you read. So, who knows?' It is understood Packer, 46, and Kerr, 30, met through their ex-partners.Erica was living and working in the UK over a decade ago when she first befriended Bloom. Bloom and the three-month pregnant model made their relationship official with a private wedding in 2010 - but they confirmed their separation last October after three years of marriage.Kerr has been linked to a number of high-profile men during the past year. She was linked with actor Leonardo DiCaprio in December 2012 and earlier this year similar rumours surfaced regarding actor Gerard Butler. Mr Packer has for years been associated with shapely brunettes, including model Jennifer Flavin, his former fiancee Kate Fischer and his first wife, bikini model Jodhi Meares.","Billionaire James Packer says his personal life is a 'disaster'

A farmer discovered the bodies of two other victims Lucasz Slaboszewski and John Chapman in a ditch on April 3. Cambridge Crown Court has heard how Dennehy, pictured, drove to Hereford soon after this footage and stabbed two random strangers . Gary 'Stretch' Richards, seen with his arm around the killer, denies two counts of attempted murder . Richards is accused of driving 140 miles from Cambridgeshire to Hereford, passing through Suffolk, Norfolk and Leicestershire, with Dennehy in search of victims after she told him: 'I want to have my fun.' Dennehy, of Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, has admitted murdering Mr Slaboszewski, 31, Mr Chapman, 56, and Mr Lee, 48. She has also admitted the attempted murders of Mr Bereza and Mr Rogers and preventing the lawful and decent burial of all three murder victims. Earlier this week, pictures of Dennehy, 31, posing with a knife while wanted by police were shown to the jury . In another photo the killer is pictured with her top lifted, exposing her underwear .

Two pornographic videos were uploaded to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources website after a member of the public 'accidentally' added them . The pornography clips appeared with a host of music files and other miscellaneous material. The mishap was caused by a glitch on the site, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Natural Resources said.

He's no stranger to filing lawsuits himself, once successfully stopping Playgirl from publishing some full-frontal naked photos. But now Leonardo DiCaprio has found himself the defendent for producing the 2013 film Out Of The Furnance - purportedly based on the Ramapo Mountain people of New Jersey - with members of the community saying they were wrongly portrayed as violent, drug-using 'inbreds' and 'hillbillies' and that the movie has caused them emotional distress. According to court documents obtained by RadarOnline, eight members of the Ramapo Mountain community filed a defamation lawsuit in early January over the film, which starred Casey Affleck, Christian Bale and Woody Harrelson. The film is about two hard-up brothers - Bale and Affleck - in Rust Belt Pennsylvania, with Affleck's character getting messed up with one of the most ruthless crime rings in the Northeast. Scroll down for video . Sued: Out Of The Furnace producer Leonardo DiCaprio - along with seven other people affiliated with the 2013 drama - are being sued by the Ramapo Community of New Jersey, who claim they are portrayed in the film as violent, inbred hillbillies. The claims in the lawsuit center mostly around a character played by Woody Harrelson named Harlen DeGroat, a psychopathic 'inbred' crime boss who deals hard drugs in the Ramapo Mountains . Out Of The Furnace also stars Casey Affleck as an unemployed Pennsylvanian who gets into trouble with a ruthless Ramapo drug ring . The suit specifically refers to Harrelson's psycopathic characer, Harlen DeGroat, the 'Ramapo ringleader' who deals hard drugs and is 'the most awful human being walking'. Documents says the movie uses characters with standard Ramapo surnames - such as a DeGroat, Van Dunk and Mann - with seven of the eight plaintiffs in the lawsuit carrying such names. The suit claims that 'by using DeGroat and Van Dunk surnames in an extremely negative manner and by making several negative comments regarding the Ramapo people in the movie which result in the negative association between the Plaintiffs and the movie'. The group claims they have been left embarassed and 'continue to suffer emotional and psychological damages'. 'Plaintiffs and their family members are harassed and discriminated against. The children are teased at school. The conduct of the defendants constitutes defamation,' the papers claim. Leader of the Ramapo - or Ramapough - Mountain community, Dwaine Perry, said Out Of The Furnace was a 'hate crime' upon his people when it was released late last year. However Perry is not listed as one of the plaintiffs on the lawsuit against the filmmakers . 'The Plaintiffs are not the worst people, do not live in trailer homes, are not involved in an underground bare-knuckle fight ring, and do not live in a self-contained world of drugs and violence.' The group are claiming the movie showed Ramapo Mountain people as 'inbred mountain folk from Jersey' who 'have fights' and are 'nasty' and 'crazy'. The New York Post has also been named as a defendant for a movie review that was published. They are asking for a jury to award them restitution in 'an amount to be determined by a jury'. After seeing the Out Of The Furnace - which has grossed $11.3 million - upon its release, Ramapough Indian Chief Dwaine Perry described the film as a 'hate crime' that 'stepped over the boundaries of decency', according to NJ.com. 'It eats up and destroys one's self-esteem, particularly for the children,' Chief Perry said. 'You can't really measure the destruction. It's a massive social humiliation. Not only is it a hate crime, it's an extremely violent crime.' DiCaprio, along with the seven other listed plaintiffs - including celebrated director Ridley Scott - are yet to comment on the suit. Out Of The Furnace, starring Christian Bale, was released in December last year and has so far grossed $11.3 million at the box office . According to a 2010 article in The New Yorker, the Ramapo people call themselves Ramapough Mountain Indians or the Ramapough Lenape Nation, referring to old spelling of the river that cuts through the Hudson and North Jersey Highlands. The Ramapoughs number a few thousand, marry largely among themselves, and are concentrated in three primary settlements: on and around Stag Hill, in Mahwah; in the village of Hillburn, New York, in the hollow below Stag Hill’s northern slope; and, west of Stag Hill, in Ringwood, New Jersey, in the remains of an old iron-mining complex. Despite spanning two states and three counties, the Ramapough settlements are essentially connected if travelling through the woods, by foot or by A.T.V, the article said.","Out Of The Furnace, a drama-thriller starring Christian Bale, Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson, was released in December .

Amanda Spencer threatened to kill a ten-year-old alleged victim of child prostitution if she didn't do as she was told, a court has heard . A baby faced female 'pimp' threatened to kill a ten-year-old alleged victim of child prostitution if she didn’t do as she was told, a court has heard. The girl, now 18, said she was just 10 or 11 when she met Amanda Spencer on the streets of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. Spencer, 22, is accused of luring nine young girls into prostitution after first plying them with drink and drugs. In a DVD played to Sheffield Crown Court, the girl said Spencer would invite her, along with other girls to homes around Sheffield, and get them intoxicated. Then, she said, Spencer would invite men to the properties, who would take advantage of the children. The court heard that on most occasions, the victims would get little or none of the money paid to Spencer for the sexual favours. The victim said: 'She would get us drunk, give us weed and then she would literally walk out of the room. 'The men would try it on, I would say no, but they would do what they wanted anyway. I don’t know how old [the men] thought I was but you could tell I was a baby.' She added: 'Amanda told me she would kill me if I told people what was happening. 'Intimidated and scared - that’s the way I felt.' Spencer is on trial alongside five men - Lee Unwin, 27, John McLachlan, 66, Kareem Ahmed, 30, Bashdar Hamadamin, 27, and a 68-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons. They are all accused of child sex offences. Sheffield Crown Court heard Spencer was 16 or 17-years-old when she first met the girl at the city’s Castle Market - and the girl was only 10 or 11. The woman would call the girls - some of whom were as young as 12 - her sisters or cousins, it is alleged . Spencer denies 28 offences relating to the prostitution of eight children and is jointly charged of trafficking a ninth victim within the UK . 'You could tell I was a kid,' said the witness. She said Spencer was 'dead nice' when they first met - but soon changed from friendly to controlling. 'She . started shouting at me, telling me what to do, what to wear and things . like that. She would put my make-up on to make me look older. 'I used to have to tell people I was 16.' The girl said one day Spencer took her on the 120 bus to see a man Spencer called 'uncle'. The prosecution allege 'uncle' is the 68-year-old man who cannot be identified. Lee Unwin, (left) who denies paying for the servies of a child and Kareem Ahmed, 30, who is co-accused with Spencer of trafficking a ninth victim within the UK for sexual exploitation . The teenager said that, while at his home, the man grabbed hold of her and touched her indecently. She said Spencer meanwhile was sitting on the sofa making 'funny eyes' at her. 'I was just about to find out what she was like,' said the witness. Asked what she meant, she said: 'That she wasn’t the nice girl I thought she was, and I felt scared of her.' She added: 'I thought she would stand up for me and say to him, ""don’t touch her"" - but she didn’t.' Spencer, of Canklow, Rotherham, denies 38 offences. Unwin, . of Nether Green, Sheffield, denies paying for the sexual services of a . child, while McLachlan, of Firth Park, Sheffield, denies two counts of . paying for the sexual services of a child.

Kent Police swooped at addresses across the UK during an early morning raid today after about £45,000 was seized at the port of Dover at Christmas. The money, which came from four UK-based charities, was taken by police who believed it could be used for criminal or terrorist activities instead of paying for food or medical treatment in wartorn Syria. Arrests: Britons have been donating thousands to help fund relief in Syria, like here in Damascus where people queue for food, but police arrested eight men today amid concerns cash could be being stolen and used to fund terrorism . Probe: Police say they want to ensure that donated funds to four charities are going to the intended place . Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Hogben said: 'Our investigation aims to ensure the funds given by the public reach their intended destination and are not used in connection with criminal activity. 'We will continue to ensure any large quantities of cash being transported through Kent's ports is checked against its purpose. 'It is now common practice for charities to transfer aid donations electronically, for auditing purposes, transparency, and to mitigate against theft of cash. 'We are working with our partners around the country to ensure money intended to help those in need in Syria is not used for criminal activity or in the terrorist arena. 'It is imperative that the public has confidence in the charities they support and in the money they are donating being used for the purpose it is intended.' Seizure: Border police at Dover took around £45,000 in pounds, euros and dollars, which has been linked to today's arrests .

Families are paying more on average for part-time childcare than they spend on their mortgage, according to a new report. It reveals parents are handing over more than £7,500 a year for childcare for two children, around 4.7 per cent more than the average mortgage bill. The report, by the Family and Childcare Trust, also suggests that some families may be spending more on childcare than they do on their weekly shopping. Families are paying more on average for part-time childcare than they spend on their mortgage, according to a new report . The study is based on information gathered by the Trust from local authority family or children's information services in England, Wales and Scotland. Each authority was asked to give the cost of 25 hours and 50 hours of childcare as provided by nurseries and childminders. They were also asked to give figures on the average cost of 15 hours childcare in an after-school club, or for a childminder picking youngsters up from school. It found that a family with one two-year-old child attending nursery part-time (25 hours a week) and a five-year-old in an after-school club will pay out £7,549 a year on average. This is higher than the UK average annual UK mortgage, which the report says is £7,207 according to official data. For a family with two youngsters in full-time childcare the average yearly cost is £11,700, the report adds, 62 per cent higher than the average yearly mortgage bill for a family home. The study says that since 2002, childcare costs have risen more than inflation each year and that international data shows that parents in Britain hand over more than a quarter of their salary (26.6 per cent), more than most other European nations. For a family with two youngsters in full-time childcare the average yearly cost is £11,700 . In the last five years alone, the price of part-time nursery care for a child under two has risen by 27 per cent, with parents paying around £1,214 more in 2014 than in 2009. The report concludes: 'Our research shows that the current childcare system is not working for anyone. 'Children are losing out on vital early education and families remain trapped in poverty because they cannot make work pay. 'Childcare providers struggle with debts. Women fail to return to the labour market after they have children and the economy loses their skills and their taxes. 'The state faces greater welfare bills and high administrative costs for delivering a complex support system.' The Trust's report warns that 25 hours in a nursery for a child aged under two costs an average of £109.89 a week - which it calculates is twice the average price of a weekly food bill (£56.80 a week). Overall, during the last 12 months, nursery costs for under twos have risen in all areas of Britain, it says, with an average increase of 3.3 per cent. It adds that the cost of after-school clubs has fallen in England and Scotland, but not in Wales. Anand Shukla, chief executive at Family and Childcare Trust said: 'When even part-time childcare costs outstrip the average mortgage for a family home - and many parents have to spend more than a quarter of their income on childcare - it's clear that our childcare system isn't fit for purpose. 'We need a childcare system that helps parents who want to work and contribute to the economy and gives children the best start in life. The Family and Childcare Trust wants to see all political parties commit to a long-term childcare strategy that delivers for parents, providers, and crucially, for children.' Labour's shadow childcare minister Lucy Powell said: 'Under David Cameron childcare costs are soaring, adding pressure to family life and shutting parents out of work. 'At the same time as sky-high costs, there are fewer places available and wages are down £1,600 a year. Rather than help families facing a cost-of-living crisis, this Tory-led Government has slashed tax credit support for childcare and hit family finances so that work doesn’t pay.'","Parents handing over more than £7,500 a year for childcare for two children .

Speaking . at an event in the West Midlands today, Mr Cameron said: ‘Obviously . when I heard these allegations I was profoundly shocked and I remain . profoundly shocked today. ‘In . terms of the release of this information, I don't think it would be . right to pre-emptively brief out a criminal investigation and that's why . we did not do that but as soon as questions were asked, as questions . would inevitably be asked, we have given very full and straightforward . answers,' he told ITV News. ‘I was told about . this issue pretty much as soon as it was discovered. I've been very . clear that we must handle this in an absolutely correct way and I'm . satisfied that that is what Number 10 Downing Street has done.’ Prime Minister David Cameron and his chief of staff Ed Llewellyn (standing), who was made aware of a sexual harassment complaint filed against Mr Rock . Born Patrick Robert John Rock de . Besombes to a family of European aristocrats, he has worked for leading . Tories for four decades. But . despite his impeccable social and political contacts, Oxford-educated . Rock has repeatedly failed in his ambition to become a Conservative MP, . despite being selected to fight safe seats. Rock, . 62 and unmarried, lives in a £500,000 flat in Parsons Green, West . London. He was born in Kensington in 1951, a year after the marriage of . his mother Gertrud and Egyptian-born father Robert John Rock de . Besombes. His paternal grandmother was a D'aigneaux, from a noble French family that originated in Normandy and boasts a coat of arms. As . a teenager, Rock boarded at the elite Jesuit Stonyhurst College in . Lancashire, winning a scholarship to Worcester College, Oxford, where he . studied history. After . graduation he worked as Margaret Thatcher's political correspondence . secretary in the then Prime Minister's Office and also as managing . director of the Retail Consortium. It . is not clear when he shortened his name to plain Patrick Rock, but he . used it while fighting the Woolwich East election in 1979, aged 28, . which he lost despite increasing the Tory vote. After . losing Crewe and Nantwich in the 1983 election he was selected in a . by-election to defend the seemingly impregnable safe seat of Portsmouth . South in 1984, which had a Tory majority of over 12,000. Rock . was 'absolutely . certain' he would win the seat, predicting Labour would finish second . and the Liberal SDP Alliance trail in third. But . after a 14 per cent swing against him, he was defeated by the . Alliance's Mike Hancock in what was labelled the 'biggest election upset . for years' and a 'great surprise' to Mrs Thatcher. Newspaper reports described the defeated Rock leaving the count 'pale with shock'. He . blamed the defeat on too many Conservatives staying at home and Mrs . Thatcher phoned him the following morning to assure him the defeat was . not his fault. The following year, he was appointed to the Conservative . Research Department. He . later worked as special adviser to Cabinet ministers in the Department . of the Environment and then the Home Office, where he met David Cameron. The pair are famously said to have repaired to the Two Chairmen pub on . the day of the death in 1994 of Labour leader John Smith, where they . agreed Tony Blair would take over, leaving their party 'f*****'. Rock again attempted to become an MP in 1990, applying for the safe Tory seat of Devizes, but failed to be selected. He . also worked in Brussels for EU Commissioner Chris Patten, with the . responsibility for the western Balkans, before becoming a policy adviser . at Downing Street. Colleagues . describe him as 'abrasive' and 'a commentator rather an a doer'. Another said his arrest over child abuse images was a 'terrific shock'. Today . Downing Street confirmed a separate sexual harassment complaint was . made against Mr Rock and had been dealt with ‘very seriously’. However, it is not thought to be connected to the more recent allegations linked to child pornography. Mr . Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘Downing Street was first made aware . of a potential offence on the evening of February 12. ‘It was immediately referred to the National Crime Agency and the Prime Minister was also immediately informed. ‘Mr Rock resigned and then in the early hours of the 13th he was arrested.’ He . defended the decision to contact the NCA direct, rather than the Met . Police, insisting it is ‘responsible for issues relating to child abuse . images’. However, at a briefing of journalists today Number 10 faced repeated questions about why it was kept secret. ‘This . is directly linked to a police investigation and I don’t think we would . pro-actively comment on this,’ the PM’s spokesman said. ‘When a question was put to us we responded, obviously subject to the constraints to there being a police investigation.’ He also denied that Mr Rock’s colleagues in the heart of government had been told he was ‘off sick’. ‘It . is not correct to say that Downing Street staff were told he was off . sick,’ he said, but he refused to say how his absence from Number 10 was . explained. Mr Rock was a . protege of Margaret Thatcher and has held a series of senior posts in . the Conservative Party. He has been close to Mr Cameron for many years. Described . as the Prime Minister's 'policy fixer', the unmarried 62-year-old had . been tipped as a leading contender for a Conservative peerage only weeks . ago. His arrest and . resignation from Downing Street, where he has worked since 2011, has . sent shockwaves through the party's high command. One . well-placed source said Mr Rock had also been the subject of a sexual . harassment complaint from a civil servant working in Downing Street, . which is understood to have been passed to Mr Cameron's chief of staff . Ed Llewellyn. The PM’s spokesman said: ‘I can confirm that a complaint around alleged inappropriate behaviour was raised. ‘The . matter was dealt with very seriously at senior levels in full . accordance with the Cabinet Office's human resources policy,’ the . spokesman said. However, Number 10 would not go into details about the outcome of the complaint. Mr Cameron's relationship with Mr Rock goes back to the Home Office, where they both worked under Michael Howard in the 1990s. Mr . Rock, who has repeatedly tried to become an MP, is known in Westminster . for coining the phrase 'Cows moo, dogs bark, Labour puts up taxes' used . by the Tories in the 1970s. The . Prime Minister brought him back into Downing Street in 2011, a move . welcomed by critics as heralding the return of a 'grown up' to the . centre of government. In the . No 10 policy unit, he has taken a particular responsibility for home . affairs issues and has also been involved in drawing up the Government's . measures against internet pornography and child abuse imagery. In . a crusade spearheaded by the Prime Minister, Downing Street brokered a . deal with internet firms which means that all 20million households . connected to the internet are being contacted and asked whether they . want family-friendly filters installed. Downing . Street also persuaded Google and other search engines to introduce . changes that will prevent depraved images from being listed in results . for more than 100,000 searches. Downing Street confirmed that Mr Rock, who lives in West London, had been involved in the policy. 'Patrick . Rock was one of a number of advisers and officials involved in dealing . with this issue – but the work was led by somebody else, and decisions . were taken by ministers,' a spokesman said.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . PUBLISHED: . 10:20 EST, 4 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:11 EST, 4 March 2014 . Two pet dogs which savaged and killed a six-day-old baby girl were killed by police yesterday. Eliza-Mae Mullane had been back from hospital just three days when she was mauled by her own family's animals - an Alaskan malamute named Nisha and Roxy, a terrier. Police seized the two animals - whom some speculated were jealous of the attention given to the newborn - but they were kept alive while forensic tests were carried out. Killed: Eliza-Mae was killed by dogs just six days after she was born. The attack happened on February 18 in Pontyberem, Wales . 'Destroyed': Defyd Powys police confirmed that the two dogs were killed yesterday after forensic tests had been finished. Pictured is an Alaskan malamute (file photo) Following a post-mortem on baby Eliza-Mae, of Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, officers decided the dogs were no longer needed, and could be humanely killed. Police sources, however, confirmed that the dogs were involved in the killing and that the parents were not being investigated - which suggests that the dogs are solely responsible for the killing. Following the incident on February 18, it was reported that Eliza-Mae's mother Sharon John, 42, ran to neighbours in shock shouting: 'The dog ate my baby’s head.' A police spokesman said: 'We can . confirm that the file concerning the death of Eliza-Mae Mullane has now . been passed to the Coroner for Carmarthenshire. 'We can also confirm the two family dogs taken into possession by the police at the time have now been destroyed.' Parents: Sharon John, 42, and Patrick Mullane, 35, said their daughter 'will always be in our hearts and thoughts' Probe: Police officers are pictured above investigating the scene in Pontyberem . Tributes: Eliza-Mae was killed at home, where tributes were left in the wake of the incident . Ms John and her partner Patrick Mullane, 35, said Eliza-Mae’s death 'cast the most horrible shadow' over the family. They said: 'Even though she was an important part of our family for such a short period of time, Eliza-Mae will always be in our hearts and thought. 'We will cherish the little time we were able to share with her. She was a dearly loved daughter, sister, grand-daughter and niece. 'She brought joy into our family, and losing her like this has cast the most horrible shadow over all of us.' 'There are no words we can use to describe what we feel at the moment, and we don’t think there ever will be.' Incident: Eliza-Mae and her family lived in Pontyberem, Wales . At the time neighbour Patricia Punter, 71, said: 'It was terrible - I’ve never heard anything like it. Sharon was in a state of shock and just screaming. 'She just kept on saying: “The dog ate my baby’s head. He’s blaming me for it - the baby’s gone.' Ms John had terrier Roxy for years before Mr Mullane brought the Alaskan malamute home after a night at the pub. Neighbours said the husky had been behaving strangely after the baby came home from hospital. Ms John also has two other children - Harley, five, and Lily-Rose, three. The family was yesterday planning a funeral service for little Eliza-Mae. A full inquest will be held later this year.","Eliza-Mae Mullane was savaged just three days after leaving hospital .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 09:11 EST, 3 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:08 EST, 3 March 2014 . The awkward interplay between 12 Years A Slaveâ€™s screenwriter and director at last nightâ€™s Oscars has sparked rumors of a rift at the heart of the movie that was the star of the night. Director Steve McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley looked less than pleased to see each other do well, with a series of apparent snubs to each other as the statues were given out. As Ridley was announced as the winner of best screenplay, McQueen gave a stilted slow hand clap as the rest of the room burst into applause. And  in return, Ridley gave McQueen a very clear cold shoulder as he bypassed the film's director completely when he went towards the stage. Moving right past: As John Ridley went on stage to collect his screenwriting Oscar, he did not stop and hug anyone related to the film who were all sitting in front of him, including director Steve McQueen (right) Clear slight: Rather than hug anyone related to the film, including star Michael Fassbender of mega producer Harvey Weinstein, Ridley went across the aisle and gave American Hustle director David O. Russell a hug . Rather than give a brief hug or handshake . to McQueen or anyone else related to the project who were all sitting . directly in front of him, Ripley gave his only hug (aside from his wife . Gayle) to American Hustle director David O. Russell who was sitting . across the aisle. He also gave Meryl Street a pat on the . back as he headed up the steps but his warmth ended there as he did not . mention McQueen in his acceptance speech. He paid respects to the film's producers 'Mr Brad Pitt' and Jeremy Kleiner. McQueen . should have taken acting cues from his cast as well, as the . British-born director did an unenthusiastic palm clap and failed to even . smile throughout the ordeal. When it was his turn to speak as the film won Best Picture, McQueen did not mention Ridley either. On the outside: Ridley stood at the back and didn't interact with any of the other members of the film's team during their Best Picture acceptance . Suggestions that a feud may be brewing between the two men were immediate. Entertainment . reporter Nikki Finke was the first to suggest a reason, hinting that . McQueen may have been vying for a screenwriting credit of his own. 'My sources attributing John . Ridley-Steve McQueen cold shoulder at Oscars tonight to dispute over . screenplay credit,' she wrote on Twitter. 12 Years A Slave is McQueen's third feature film, after Hunger and Shame. Walking right past: Ridley didn't acknowledge Lupita Nyong'o or producer Brad Pitt, but only giving Pitt a mention during his speech when he was on stage . Bizarre: Rather than smile, McQueen only gave Ridley an unenthusiastic open-palm clap, and it is now rumored that he wanted a credit as a co-writer for the film like he has received in his last two pictures . Stoic: McQueen was effusive when Lupita Nyong'o won Best Supporting Actress but showed no such love for Ridley, only giving this perfunctory clap as he walked towards the stage . Serious moment: While Ridley thanked the film's producers 'Mr Brad Pitt' and Jeremy Kleiner, he did not mention McQueen at all even though they had been working on the project together since 2008 . He . was credited as a co-writer and director in both of those films, and in . this latest one he was only listed as the director and one of the . producers. As Ridley mentioned in his speech, he . started his Hollywood career by writing for sitcoms including Martin . Lawrence's eponymous show and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. His first film was the poorly-received Sean Penn thriller U Turn that he co-wrote with director Oliver Stone. In . 1999, he wrote David O. Russell's film Three Kings, which may explain . why he went out of his way to hug his former collaborator on Sunday . night. He then took a thematic turn, writing the 2002 comedy Undercover Brother. At the back: Ridley was one of the last ones on stage when they won Best Picture and he hid behind the cast . Rolling his eyes? Photos show that he was not smiling nor enthused at what is widely considered the night's biggest award but may have even been making light of the win . Standing apart: Ridley physically removed himself from the group . Returning the favor: When McQueen gave a speech as the film won Best Picture, he did not mention Ridley at all either . More recently he co-wrote the World War II film Red Tails and then wrote and directed the Jimi Hendrix biopic All Is . By My Side which was released at the Toronto Film Festival in September . and will be on screens more widely this summer. Career high: Ridley started out by writing for sitcoms like The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air . Ridley has told how he and McQueen started talking about doing a slave-era project together in 2008 and he told IndieWire that it was McQueen's wife who found the Solomon Northup story to use as the baseline. 'Steve said, ""I really wanted to tell a . story about that time and place and the slave era in America but I . wanted to have a character that was not obvious in terms of their trade . in slavery, someone who had artistic abilities and who had station but . found themselves in a different geographical location. Something that . has scope and scale emotionally,""' according to Ridley. 'Working with Steve was difficult only . with the geography. He lives in Amsterdam and I live in Los Angeles and . in that time period ""Shame"" came together for him and ""All Is By My . Side"" came together for me but we both thought that this was something . worth doing.' In addition to . taking home three of the biggest Oscars, 12 Years A Slave also had a . successful night on Saturday at the Independent Spirit Awards winning . Best Feature, Director, Screenplay, Supporting Female, and . Cinematography. Distancing himself: McQueen looked as if he was actively trying to avert his eyes so as not to look at Ridley . What a difference: When they won for Best Picture, however, he was literally jumping for joy . Mixed reactions: Ridley did not seem happy to greet Angelina Jolie, whose partner Brad Pitt produced his film, but was much more interested in talking to Sidney Poitier backstage . Ridley was said to have become emotional during his speech and even went so far as to mention McQueen in his speech at the event, calling the director 'fun'. 'As much as I thought the memoir in Solomon's words was special I had no idea what I was a part of until I saw the film in Toronto,' he said. Ridley went on to give a shout out to Julie Deply, who was nominated as a co-writer for Before Midnight. For his part, McQueen chose to highlight the talents of Michael Fassbender, who has been in every one of his three movies including 12 Years A Slave- but showed no such love for Ridley.","Screenwriter John Ridley didn't mention McQueen once in his acceptance speech when he won for Best Adapted Screenplay .

'I do not think any government is going to have the cojones to do that and you may as well get on and devolve it to the cities.'

Hundreds of rogue landlords in one London borough are illegally renting out 'beds in sheds' to immigrants on an industrial scale. Harrow Council chartered a plane with thermal imaging to fly over streets picking up heat and found four times more 'suspicious' outbuildings than expected. Aerial photos revealed that instead of 75 suspected illegal developments at the bottom of gardens or in garages, there were actually at least 319. Welcome to Harrow: This is a thermal image of a street in the London borough. At the bottom of the picture is a road, and then a row of houses with heat escaping from windows. The circled building is at the bottom of a garden, and is believed to be a illegally converted outbuilding housing immigrants . Caught: A spy in the sky aeroplane with thermal imaging was chartered to find conversions. They can be seen because sheds and garages are generally not insulated, but houses are, so heat is seen in blocks of yellow . Officials believe more than 1,000 people could be living in cramped and squalid conditions costing around £55 per week, because they cannot afford a proper home. The results mean they are probably living there without planning permission or contributing any council tax. Beds in sheds - ultra basic accommodation used by 'exploited' immigrants paying reduced rents to rogue landlords who ignore planning laws - are believed to be an increasing problem nationwide, but especially in and around the capital. Harrow Council flew over their borough at 3,379 feet between 9pm and midnight in January to gauge the scale of the problem. They were looking for buildings with escaping heat - a tell-tale sign that it is an uninsulated 'shed' - as they are often hidden behind fences and cannot be seen by passers-by. The council found one case with a person paying £55 a week to sleep on a mattress in a tiny room with two other people. Concerns: Although many of the outbuildings are habitable, some are described as being unsafe, with little or no heating, or do not comply with building or fire safety regulations . The recent lift of immigration restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians on January 1 has led to concerns that more beds in sheds will spring up. And there was also a net increase in migration to the UK of 212,000 between September 2012 and September last year, according to Government figures. Harrow Council leader, Councillor Susan Hall, said: 'The pressures of migration in London, fuelled by recent waves of new arrivals from Eastern Europe, are creating new stresses on local authorities that we just haven't had to contend with before. 'What was once thought even just 18 months ago to be a problem for the centre of big cities is now rippling out to the suburbs. 'The beds in sheds phenomenon means there is a hidden community springing up in the back gardens of our cities - in our borough alone the thermal pictures we receive suggest there are four times as many as we first suspected. 'These are people who use council services - like bin collections - but for whom we receive no extra funding. 'In many cases the people in beds in sheds are at the bottom of a pyramid of exploitation. 'But we get complaints from their neighbours that we cannot ignore, and it is not fair on them that these houses should turn into cash cows for opportunist landlords.' Illegal: Councils want to crack down on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal and often substandard living accommodation, such as this conversion in nearby Slough . Cut backs: People living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them - so town halls use thermal imaging to find them . The planning enforcement department of Harrow Council is now investigating 319 suspect properties identified from aerial photos. Fergus Sheppard, of Harrow Council, added: 'It's a London-wide issue. 'Some of these properties are okay, but in some places people are holed up and it's an exercise to see how many people can fit into one property. 'You can go from the quite nice and well looked after to places which are fairly grim and actually dangerous, with exposed electric wires. 'The people in these buildings often come from abroad and they are at the bottom of a pyramid of exploitation.' A Bulgarian man who was won the . National Lottery - twice - has an illegal cabin in the back garden of . his home that he rents out for as much as £10,000 a year. George Traykov, . 46, right, a former member of the Bulgarian skydiving team, beat odds of . one-in-438 million when he picked up a £160,873 EuroMillions prize in . March to add to the £1million sum he won in the Millionaire Raffle in . September 2011. Now a home . he owns in Harrow, north-west London, has been investigated by council . staff after the cabin - which has a kitchen, toilet and bedroom - was . discovered, pictured below.

He wrote: 'It is understood from a source close to No. 10 that Prime Minister David Cameron made personal intervention to stop the MPS further investigating Nigella Lawson after her drugs admission. 'Cameron’s personal intervention is believed to be what influenced the MPS’s initial climb down of 27th January 2014.'

A spokesman for Downing Street told . The Telegraph: 'I think these decisions around prosecutions are always . and entirely and wholly a matter for the prosecuting authorities.' While a Scotland Yard spokesman added: 'We are not prepared to discuss the case.' Miss Lawson, 54, admitted in court last year that she had taken cocaine and used cannabis but Scotland Yard decided she would not face charges.

Wedding woe: Samantha Lewin, 24, and Adam Patrick, 26, have nowhere to marry after their venue went bust a week before their big day . A young couple could lose their life savings and now have nowhere to marry after their wedding venue went bust a week before their big day. Samantha Lewins, 24, and Adam Patrick, 26,  face a race against time to find a new venue and stand to lose up to £9,000 if they fail. The couple, from Ellington, Northumberland, were due to marry on Sunday and had paid £5,000 to Longhirst Hall in Morpeth with a further £4,000 on a photographer, hairdresser and flowers. But the venue went bust and they only found out when a friend told them on Facebook last Friday. They have been told they will not recoup the £5,000 they paid to Longhirst Hall but are hoping the remaining £4,000 will not go to waste if they can find somewhere else to get married before the weekend. Mother-of-two Miss Lewins said: 'We have been saving for our wedding for years. I was shocked and angry when I found out the news. 'They didn't even have the decency to call us, we found out from a friend on Facebook who used to work for the company. 'We had just paid our final bill and I had even emailed them a few changes and then next thing we knew they had gone into liquidation. 'We now have to find some way of getting things together so we can still have a wedding on Sunday. 'They promised me a stress-free and perfect day but that couldn't be further from the truth now.' The couple now risk losing it all if they cannot find a new venue to accommodate them in time. Longhirst Hall closed its doors last Friday after the company which operates the hotel went into liquidation and ceased trading. In the lurch: Describing itself as an award winning venue, Longhirst's financial problems have left several couples out of pocket and with nowhere to marry . Dozens of other couples were left in the dark after the company failed to tell anyone and even its staff had no idea it would no longer be open. Shattered dreams: Samantha with the venue's glossy brochure. She fears losing her chance to marry this weekend and a huge sum of money . Samantha, who has two daughters with her husband to be Adam, said: 'We went along to the hall to see what was happening and there was just loads of staff standing outside equally as shocked as we were. 'These people had lost their jobs without any notice but their main worry was what was going to happen to all the weddings that had been booked in. 'My two daughters were so upset when they found out after they had been so excited to be flower girls. 'I have family coming from Scotland and York and lots of people had taken time off work and made plans, I don't know what to tell them now because I just don't know what we are going to do. 'The invitations went out months ago and we had paid it all off, it was just a matter of waiting for a few days. 'This is every bride's worst nightmare and now I don't even know if our wedding can go ahead. 'We have lost all of our savings paying for this and we won't get it back.' Samantha and Adam are not the only couple to have their wedding day cancelled with dozens of other couples being booked up for months to come at the popular wedding venue. Laura Guthzeit and her partner Paul were left with only 24 hours to rearrange their wedding when the hotel closed the day before they were due to tie the knot. Laura, 29, had been getting pampered in Longhirst Hall's spa when the news broke. Staff scrambled together to accommodate the couple and their guests in an empty room for the vows and then transferred them to Beamish Hall for their reception, meaning they didn't have to cancel. Scott McGregor, director with Grainger Corporate Rescue & Recovery who are waiting to be appointed as liquidators, said: 'The company is in the process of going into liquidation at the moment. The company that operates the hotel at the moment, that company ceased trading and that's as much as we can say at the moment. The position appears to be that weddings are not going to take place, unfortunately. 'As of now the hotel is closed.'","Longhirst Hall in Morpeth shut leaving couples with nowhere to marry .

TV weatherman Fred Talbot has pleaded not guilty to a series of historic sex offences which were allegedly committed over a 15-year period. The 64-year-old stood in the dock, hands clasped in front of him as he repeated 'not guilty' ten times to each of the charges put to him at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. Talbot, who was a regular on the floating weather map in Liverpool's Albert Dock for ITV's This Morning, is accused of nine counts of indecent assault and one count of serious sexual assault.

Deep rooted problem: Historian Mary Beard believes that female broadcasters must lower their voices to sound like men if they want to be successful . Female broadcasters are forced to ape the deeper more 'authoritative' voices of men or be 'young and pretty' to be successful on radio and TV, historian Mary Beard has said. Criticising the lack of women in senior positions the academic said the power at the BBC and elsewhere lies 'with the men in suits and their deep voices'. 'It's not a coincidence that even on radio, the successful women presenters tend to have unusually deep (ie male) voices,' she wrote in the Radio Times. Discussing women on TV she said: 'There are still relatively few and . they tend to be young and conventionally pretty. 'The fact is that even now authority still seems to reside with the men in suits, and their deep voices; and those are the types we still assume we’ll see when we’re looking for words of wisdom on TV'. She said that the problem was deep . rooted, as 'most viewers accept, without a blink, the craggy, wrinkled . faces and bald patches of male documentary presenters, as if they were . the signs of mature wisdom, yet in the case of women presenters, grey . hair and wrinkles often signal ""past-my-use-by-date"" - or at least . glaring eccentricity and deficient grooming.' She praised the likes of former BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders and Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis but admits they are a rarity. Professor Beard also believes broadcasters must address the position of women across TV, not just on panel shows . Danny Cohen, the BBC's director of television, has vowed to end all-male panel shows, saying that the absence of female guests was 'not acceptable'. Professor Beard, 59, told the Radio Times that she gave 'two hearty cheers' to Cohen's promise but she added: 'It's not just about panel shows.' She criticised the 'niche roles for women in sitcoms' and females being placed 'next to the main (male) presenter on the breakfast TV sofa'. Successful: BBC presenters Emily Maitlis, left, and Stephanie Flanders, right, were praised by Prof Beard - but she said they are a rarity . 'And . there can be an outcry when women move into what are perceived as . traditional male areas. Remember the abuse directed at Jacqui Oatley . when she dared to 'leave the netball court' and become the first woman . commentator on Match of the Day,' she said. Promise: BBC director of television Danny Cohen has pledged to include more women on comedy panel shows . Professor Beard said that the 'underlying 'maleness' of all these shows' was 'more hard-wired in our culture than the presence of a few extra women is likely to solve'. The television classicist, who has been criticised over her appearance, added: 'Already in Homer's Odyssey, almost 3,000 years ago, we find a wet-behind-the-ears teenager telling his savvy mother not to speak in public. 'Of course, the Greeks and the Romans didn't have panel shows. But the kind of male banter and repartee that we still see in these programmes - its aggression, its 'wit' - does go back thousands of years to ancient dialogue and debate.' While quotas could 'help in the short term', the presenter said that she dreaded 'any idea of a fixed quota of women per programme', saying: 'It's likely to leave desperate producers ringing round all the women they can possibly think of to fill 'the woman's slot'.' She said: 'I don't think it would be much fun being the woman vilified in all the reviews as the one taking the quota place.' Female comedians, including Victoria Wood, have in the past criticised BBC panel shows for being a 'male preserve'. Her comments came after veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby hit back at claims by comic Dara O Briain that Question Time needs to tackle the gender balance of its panellists, saying he had picked 'the wrong target'. Under fire: Shows such as Would I Lie To You? featuring David Mitchell, Rob Brydon and Lee Mack have been criticised for all-male panels . Criticism: Victoria Wood has said in the past that BBC's panel shows are a 'male preserve' He defended the show's record for inviting women guests and pointed out the proportions were much higher than those for many areas of public life. O Briain turned on BBC1's political discussion show in an interview after being asked about the recent decision to ban all-male line-ups for comedy panel shows. 'It's remarkable that this amount of time is spent debating women on comedy shows rather than, say, Question Time,' he said.","Historian says power in TV and radio is 'with men in suits with deep voices'

Spy: John Bingham was an MI5 agent who tricked British fascists into revealing their allegiances in the Second World War . A Second World War intelligence agent who inspired fictional spy George Smiley 'hated everything' about how author John le Carré portrayed the secret services, it has been claimed. John Bingham, an MI5 agent, exposed Nazi sympathisers in Britain by convincing them he was a German double agent. After gaining the trust of undercover fascists, he convinced them to reveal secrets which were fed back to the intelligence services. Mr le Carré, whose works include The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, revealed in 1999 that Smiley was inspired by Bingham, who had been his boss at MI5. George Smiley features in eight of le Carré's novels and was played by Gary Oldman in the 2011 film adaptation of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. The true extent of Mr Bingham's espionage was revealed just days ago when the National Archives declassified a cache of documents 25 years after his death. The files show how he was able to root out traitors among the aristocracy and intellectual elite, including worrying links between Nazi sympathisers and a Cabinet Minister. Mr Bingham was also passed plans for a jet aircraft and even an amphibious tank by people who believed they were helping the Germans. But the spy, who went on to become a celebrated author himself, turned on his former colleague and friend Mr le Carré and grew to detest what he wrote about the British intelligence services, it was claimed today. Portrayal: Mr Bingham inspired fictional spy George Smiley, pictured right played by Gary Oldman in the 2011 adaptation of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy . Acclaimed: George Smiley is a central character in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy . Old colleagues: Mr le Carré, pictured above in 2008, worked under Mr Bingham in MI5 . Lord Lexden, a Conservative peer and historian, said that 'modest hero' Mr Bingham 'was not treated as respectfully as he deserved by his protégé  John le Carré... he was hurt by the portrayal of his secret world in the novels'. In a letter published today by the Daily Telegraph, Lord Lexden wrote that Mr Bingham once said that Mr le Carré 'was my friend, but I deplore and hate everything he has done and said against the intelligence services'. The declassified files do not refer to Mr . Bingham directly, but reveal the activities of 'Jack King', which was . the spy's pseudonym. The declassified files do not name John Bingham directly, but refer to 'Jack King'. Although the intelligence services would never confirm the true identity of its agents, the moniker would fit with an old tradition for MI5 operatives to chose pseudonyms which sound similar to their real names. This was done to protect the agents in case somebody accidentally used their real name - which they could pretend had simply been misheard. Reports on the files published earlier in the week tell how, from 1942, Mr Bingham had direct contact with six men and women who believed he was working for the Gestapo. They in turn passed on information on 'probably hundreds' of Nazi sympathisers int he country. He was also able to gather information on British Union of Fascists founder Sir Oswald Mosley. Diaries of Mr Bingham's MI5 superiors speaking of plans to take key British fascist figures to court on the basis of the evidence gathered, but the agency appears to have changed its mind when it became obvious that the trial could not proceed without calling on Mr Bingham as a witness, blowing his cover. Mr Bingham, an impoverished Irish aristocrat also known as the 7th Baron Clanmorris, also worked as a reporter and an author, penning 17 novels himself. He died in 1988.","John Bingham convinced British fascists he was part of the Gestapo .

Climbers wanting to scale Mount Everest will be forced to bring back eight kilograms of rubbish in a bid to clean-up the world's highest peak. The rule, one of several new measures covering mountaineering in the Himalayan nation, will apply to climbers ascending beyond Everest's base camp from April onwards, said tourism ministry official Madhusudan Burlakoti. Decades of mountaineering has taken its toll on Everest which is strewn with rubbish from past . expeditions, including oxygen cylinders, human waste and even climbers' bodies, which do not decompose in the extreme cold. A Nepalese man collecting rubbish left by climbers, at an altitude of 8,000 metres during a clean-up expedition at Mount Everest . Mr Burlakoti, who is joint secretary at the ministry, said authorities would take legal action against climbers who failed to comply with the new rule, although it was unclear whether this would involve a fine or the confiscation of their mandatory deposit. 'The government has decided in order to . clean up Mount Everest that each member of an expedition must bring back . at least eight kilos of garbage, apart from their own trash', he said. Last month Nepal slashed fees for individual climbers on the famed mountain and other Himalayan peaks to attract more mountaineers, sparking concerns of increased traffic and more rubbish. Everest, scaled for the first time by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953, is a key revenue-earner for the country, with hundreds heading there every year during the peak climbing season in April and May. Under the new rules Everest expeditions will have to take their trash to an office which will be set up next month at base camp. Tip: A group ascending the mountain with the aim of clearing up all of the rubbish left at Mount Everest . The office will also offer medical aid and resolve conflicts, with soldiers and police on duty to avoid a repeat of the brawl between European climbers and local guides last year which shocked the mountaineering community. Dawa Sherpa, expedition manager at Asian Trekking which organises an annual clean-up tour to Everest, said the proposal was 'an encouraging measure to try and keep the mountain clean'. The Eco Everest Expedition has collected some 15 tonnes of garbage, 600 kg of human waste and six bodies since 2008. He said local Sherpa guides could collect and deliver trash to base camp instead of returning empty-handed from acclimatisation ascents to set up tents for foreign climbers on the mountain. Dump: Rubbish hidden along the Mount Everest trail, just beyond the tourists' line of sight . 'Ultimately, the success of the regulation will depend on how strictly officials monitor its progress,' he said. Although expeditions currently have to fork out a $4,000 deposit, refunded once they show they have brought back everything they took up the mountain, enforcement has been a problem. 'Our earlier efforts have not been very effective. This time, if climbers don't bring back garbage, we will take legal action and penalise them,' tourism official Burlakoti said. The government is also considering plans to build toilets at base camp, where the shifting ice means structures are at risk of falling down. In an overhaul of security on the mountain, soldiers and police will be stationed at the new office at base camp so climbers can approach them with any problems, officials said last month. Environmental and climbing groups have long sought to focus attention on the mess left behind by expeditions while clean-up projects have also been organised.

Rita Cadman was prosecuted by Stoke-on-Trent City Council’s environmental crime unit after neighbours complained the rotting rubbish, inclduing three full wheelie bins, was gradually piling up. The 67-year-old was served with a warning telling her to clean up the driveway of her £110,000 semi-detached house in May last year. Dirty: Rita Cadman was fined after ignoring a warning by council officials to clear her garden of rotting bin bags . But Cadman was taken to court after she failed to remove the bin bags within two months. She was found guilty of failing to comply with the improvement notice issued by the council and fined £600 at North Staffordshire Justice Centre. Cadman was also ordered to pay a further £263 costs and magistrates warned her the fine could  increase if garden is continually left untidy. After the hearing, councillor Andy Platt, cabinet member for a clean city, said: 'This case shows how one resident can affect an entire neighbourhood by letting their property get into an appalling state. 'We can’t afford to let people pile rubbish up in their gardens which attract vermin and can lead to a rise in other problems, such as crime and anti-social behaviour. 'We gave the occupier numerous chances to sort this out, but nothing happened. 'We will continue to take whatever further action is necessary to ensure that she removes the rubbish from her property. 'We’ll . always try to help people overcome problems like this before they get . too serious, but if they won’t co-operate then we have to put the local . community’s needs first.' Neighbours also condemned Cadman, saying the rubbish attracted rats to the area. Vermin: Her neighbours in Stoke-on-Trent said the festering rubbish bags had attracted rats . Gwen Sutton, 76, said: 'I am aware of the house and as far as I know it’s been a problem for a while. It is a mess when I sometimes walk past it when I am on errands. 'I feel sorry for the neighbours who live closer to the property. 'We do have rats and vermin around here because of the nearby allotments but these rubbish piles just encourage more.' But one neighbour Julian Hilditch, 43, defended Cadman, saying: 'I have had no problems at all with Rita. 'I know people have been complaining about the house and it is a bit of a mess, but I know of many worse houses. 'I don’t think any of it is food because there’s no smell. But Rita is great and always helps me out with my bins when I am away from my property.' Cadman refused to comment as she left court. Warning: Officials from Stoke-on-Trent City Council's environmental crime unit said the pensioner's fine could increase if the driveway outside her home was continually left untidy .

Birmingham FC owner Carson Yeung is facing 14 years in prison after being found guilty of five counts of money laundering by a court in Hong Kong. The 54-year-old had denied laundering £55.4million through his bank account between 2001 and 2007. But judge Douglas Yau said he was 'self-contradictory' in his evidence and was 'making it up as he went along'. Guilty verdict: Birmingham City owner Carson Yeung could face 14 years in jail after being found guilty of money laundering by a Hong Kong court . Gasp: Yeung wearing a mask as he leaves court in the back of a police van . Denial: Carson Yeung denied he was guilty of money laundering but was convicted by a Hong Kong court . 'I find the defendant not a witness of truth,' Judge Yau told a packed court room. 'I find that he is someone who is prepared to, and did try to, lie whenever he saw the need to do so.' Yeung will be sentenced on Friday. The case shone a spotlight on how Yeung made his fortune but the judge said he exaggerated the amount of profit made by his hair salon business. The trial has also revealed Yeung's close links to Macau's casino world, both as an investor and gambler, and how that enabled business investments that helped him amass his wealth. He maintained that he built a fortune of hundreds of million of dollars through stock trading and business ventures in China. Millionaire: Yeung, who bought Birmingham in October 2009, resigned as the club's president and director lats month - he is still their majority shareholder . Tycoon: Yeung surrounded by the media at an earlier hearing in his money laundering trial back in June 2011 . But prosecutors said he was unable to show where £7.7million in his bank account had come from.

Protesters improvised masks out of plastic water bottles and threw Molotov cocktails in the eastern suburbs of the capital, Caracas, with between 20 and 41 detained - while residents elsewhere in the city celebrated Carnival on a national holiday. Around 1,000 protesters gathered again today in the Santa Monica neighbourhood, banging kitchen pans, honking car horns and carrying placards declaring: 'I'm swapping Carnival 2014 for a free Venezuela!'.

Russia has denied its troops have seized territory in strife-hit Crimea in a bizarre Twitter exchange with chick-lit writer and former MP Louise Mensch. As pictures of unidentified heavily-armed troops occupying airports and ferry terminals and surrounding a Ukrainian infantry base emerge, Mensch has been demanding answers of the Russian Embassy on the powderkeg situation. She initially tweeted: 'The only real ""red lines"" belong to Vladimir Putin. And they are marching west. #Obama #Ukraine #weak #tcot' Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has entered into a Twitter row with the UK's Russian Embassy over troop activity in Crimea . Mensch claims the armed men who have seized strategic parts of Crimea are Russian troops. The Russian Embassy claims the Russian President has not used the right to deploy forces abroad . The Russian Embassy's twitter account sent her a message directing her to a Russian government press release which they say clarifies the Russian position. In response, Mensch called their attention to an article written by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the New York Times on the civil war in Syria, in which he writes that 'decisions affecting war and peace should happen only by consensus'. The embassy shot back that it is . committed to seeking a political solution to the crisis, so Mensch . tweeted: 'Excellent. Withdraw your tanks.' Russia maintains it has not deployed troops throughout Crimea . The Russian Embassy tweeted back: 'The Russian President has not used the right to deploy forces abroad. We hope for a political settlement.' At this point, Jamie Glackin, the vice chair of the Scottish Labour Party, joins the conversation, asking: 'So who are these Russian soldiers in Crimea I’m looking at on TV right now?' Mensch also asks: 'He (Putin) has not? Am I to take it he considers the Crimea actually annexed?' An armed man stands outside the cabinet of ministers building in Simferopol today. Russia has started a build-up of armoured vehicles on the Russian side of a narrow stretch of water between Russia and the Ukrainian region of Crimea . Military personnel, believed to be Russian servicemen, walk outside the territory of a Ukrainian military unit in the village of Perevalnoye outside Simferopol today . The row comes as fears mount over Russia's intentions in the region. Ukraine’s acting prime minister, Arseniy Yatseniuk, said today his country would never give up Crimea. Russian forces have taken control of the . Black Sea peninsula, which is part of Ukraine, but Yatseniuk told . reporters: 'No one will give up Crimea to anyone.' The U.S. now believes that Russia has complete operational control of the pro-Russian area of the country, and has more than 6,000 troops in the region. President Vladimir Putin defended Russia's action against 'ultranationalist forces' - and told President Barack Obama he reserved the right to take any further military action. Russia claims its troops have not 'deployed abroad' Pro-Russian troops took over a ferry terminal on the easternmost tip of Crimea close to Russia on Monday, exacerbating fears that Moscow is planning to bring even more troops into this strategic Black Sea region. The seizure of the terminal in the Ukrainian city of Kerch about 20 kilometers (12 miles) by boat to Russia, comes as the West try to figure out ways to halt and reverse the Russian incursion. Early on Monday, soldiers were operating the terminal, which serves as a common departure point for many Russian-bound ships. The men refused to identify themselves, but they spoke Russian and the vehicles transporting them had Russian licence plates. Troops that Ukraine says are Russian soldiers have occupied airports in Crimea, smashed equipment at an air base and besieged a Ukrainian infantry base in this peninsula. Outrage over Russia's military moves mounted in world capitals, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calling on President Vladimir Putin to pull back from 'an incredible act of aggression'. Russian troops are also massing close to the Ukrainian borders across a wide area. For example, heavily armoured forces from Samara are heading for the border with the Kharkiv region. The same is seen at the border with Chernigov, which is only 120 miles from Kiev.","The chick-lit author was embroiled in a row over Russian troops in Crimea .

Cardiff City face a Premier League investigation after owner Vincent Tan offered his players a £3.7million bonus before Sunday’s defeat by Tottenham. Sportsmail can reveal Tan broke Premier League rules, which state every team must lodge their bonus schedule before the start of the season, when he gave his players a financialincentive to avoid relegation. It is understood Tan did not offer the Cardiff squad a bonus to avoid the drop before the campaign began because he did not believe they would be in a relegation fight after his significant investment. VIDEO Scroll down to watch VINCENT TAN: If Cardiff fans p*** me off again, I'm off . Under scrutiny: Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan made an illegal offer to players . More misery: Roberto Soldado's goal consigned Cardiff to another defeat on Sunday . Instead, the controversial owner . walked into Saturday evening’s team meeting at the Hilton Hotel on . London’s Park Lane and stunned the players with his extraordinary offer. Tan told the Cardiff squad they would ‘need to shoot more’ if they wanted the bonus at the end of the season. He . promised the squad, who were sitting open-mouthed, £3.7m to share . between them if they survived their first season in the Barclays Premier . League. At the start of . the campaign every club must register any bonuses not mentioned in . players’ contracts with the Premier League to protect the integrity of . the game at the highest level. The . regulation is designed to stop owners such as Tan using financial . inducements to motivate players and other staff outside of their . existing agreements. However, clubs were given a month’s grace this year because of the new TV deals. Dejected: Cardiff's players look gutted after Soldado scores for Spurs . No joy: Tan's team talk couldn't inspire Cardiff at White Hart Lane . Many . players believed they should take a bigger slice of the TV pool and . several clubs could not reach agreement with them before the first game. Premier League chiefs gave every team a month to settle their affairs . but they were not allowed to alter or make verbal agreements after these . had been lodged. Now the . Premier League are to investigate the Cardiff owner after sources close . to Tan confirmed he had made the offer to his players. Tan breached Premier League rules T12 and T13 by offering a financial inducement outside of the players’ contracts. According . to T12: ‘Full details of a player’s remuneration, including all . benefits to which he is entitled, whether in cash or in kind, shall be . set out in his contract.’ Looking glum: Cardiff boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer saw his struggling side lose again . Gutted: Fabio Da Silva looks to the ground as Spurs celebrate Soldado's winner . T13 says: ‘The terms of a contract between a club and a player shall be strictly adhered to. ‘According . to those players’ contracts, the bonus schedule agreed with the squad . at the start of a season and lodged with the Premier League cannot be . changed during  the season under any circumstances.’ Tan’s . offer did not have the desired effect on Sunday at White Hart Lane, . where Cardiff lost 1-0 to Tottenham following a first home goal in open . play from £27m striker Roberto Soldado. On Monday night the Premier League confirmed they would write to Tan to ask him for his observations. Unhappy: Disgruntled Cardiff supporters protest against Tan . Left for dead: Aaron Lennon ghosts past Cardiff defender Ben Turner . The Premier League board have a number of options available to them if they  find Tan guilty of an offence, including a fine. If . the matter is deemed serious enough, it can be taken to an independent . regulatory commission, where the sanctions - including fines and points . deductions - are almost unlimited.

He is one of Britain's greatest minds, whose day job is to contemplate and explain the very deepest mysteries of the universe. But by night it appears Professor Stephen Hawking is happy to take part in less intellectually challenging activities, having joined a group of men dressed as Bananaman on a stag do in Cambridge. Groom Chris Hallam, 29, and nine of his closest friends had gone out in the city in fancy dress when they bumped into the celebrated academic. Every time they eat a banana... Professor Stephen Hawking stopped for a picture with a gang of men dressed as Bananaman on a stag do in Cambridge . And they were stunned when the Brief History of Time author agreed to pose with them for a souvenir photo. Father-of-one Chris is due to marry fiancée Kizzy Davis, 34, on March 29 and says he will never forget his night out. The self-employed builder from Norwich, said: 'We only came across Professor Hawking because we were lost. 'We were just looking for a bar and spotted him getting out of his car. 'His son was with him and asking him ""Should we ditch the meal and go out with these boys?"" 'They could have just told us to carry on but they were all brilliant. 'It's been mad. People just keep saying ""I can't believe it, is it really him?"".' It is not the first time Prof Hawking has got involved in activities linked to a stag do. It emerged in 2012 the 72-year-old visited a swingers’ sex club in California and also stopped in at Stringfellows. Letting his hair down: Prof Hawking with Peter Stringfellow during a visit to the well-known strip club where he posed with fans and the girls . It was said that he arrived at the Freedom Acres club in Devore with an entourage of nurses and assistants . before paying for young, naked dancers to perform privately for him. A Cambridge University . spokesman said at the time: ‘It is not true that Professor Hawking is a “regular” visitor to the club in question. ‘This report is greatly exaggerated. He visited once a few years ago with friends while on a visit to California.’ During his Stringfellows visit he happily posed for pictures with the club’s dancers. Owner Peter Stringfellow even declared himself a fan of the professor. He said: ‘I am often asked during interviews of all the people I have met, who I am most impressed with. ‘Of all the film stars I have met, the . majority are really nice people, rock stars are a lot of fun and good . company, some of the richest men in the world can be surprisingly funny, . but when all is said and done Professor Hawking is The Man. ‘I remember asking him if he’d like to . have a conversation with me about the universe or if he’d just like to . watch the girls. The answer was quite simply, ""The girls"". Powerful symbol: As one of Britain's most iconic symbols of human triumph over adversity, Prof Hawking, 72, has lived with the debilitating illness motor neurone disease since the age of 22 . Genius: Stephen Hawking at his Oxford University graduation in 1962 - two years before his diagnosis with motor neurone disease . Professor Stephen Hawking, 72, has lived with debilitating motor neurone disease since the age of 22 but despite this cruel struggle he still became the world's most renowned astrophysicist. He is a sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - which has robbed him of almost all physical movement . He is an exceptional case, having survived for more than 40 years, despite doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed. In his incredible life his countless scientific papers, best-selling books and numerous . awards have earned him comparisons with Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac . Newton. But he is as much a celebrity as he is a scientist, . appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons, starring in Star Trek and . providing narration for a British Telecom commercial that was later . sampled on a Pink Floyd album. In the 1970s, already confined to a . wheelchair, he produced a stream of first class research, including . probably his most important contribution to cosmology. This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing. By . applying quantum mechanics to black holes, he had taken the first steps . to combining quantum theory and general relativity. One describes the . universe at the sub-atomic level, and the other at very large scales. Bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics.

Despite warnings of rainstorms for the fourth year in a row, revellers refused to have their spirits dampened at the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade in Sydney. Parade goers gathered from across Australia, as the 114 floats of the gay and lesbian parade made their way through the city. This year, the parade reprised its past as a protest march with several of the floats making fun of Russian leader Vladimir Putin's conservative views on sexuality, and the so-called 'anti-gay' sentiment in his administration. Many of the city's public officials and political hopefuls turned out to show their support, with many of the participants having a deeply personal relationship to the protest parades. The police in Sydney also made an increased effort this year, eager to not repeat the mistakes that happened at last year's celebrations, when the peaceful demonstration turned to brutality with the arrest of Jamie Jackson Reed. Director of the Hollywood picture 'The Great Gatsby' Baz Luhrmann designed the final float, which was strictly ballroom-themed, and both he and singer Ricky Martin watched from the stands.

Parade goers prepare for the start of the 2014 Sydney Gay & Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade. The participants all dress differently, but their costumes all follow a similar theme of extreme colour . While the weather was not quite bikini-hot, it didn't stop the most flamboyant crowd of Sydney from adorning themselves with sequins and g-strings in their scantily clad attire for the entire day . The parade also served as a great opportunity for a sounding board for those opposing the anti-gay policies put in place in Putin's Russia. These objections were clearly demonstrated by the giant Putin figures that were led through the streets during the parade . Ten Thousand marchers along with 144 floats entered in the 36th parade, with many of the floats decrying the anti-gay sentiments pushed by the Putin administration. The pride parade was a chance for objectors to voice their displeasure with many resorting to wry take-downs of Putin on floats . The party that originated from the beginnings of the parade carried on long into the night, with many public officials in the city not only endorsing the activity, but taking part in the festivities . Sydney police ordered a high-visibility operation to be launched, with officers vowing to work better with event organisers in order to avoid the brutality that occurred the in the same celebrations the year before . Last year, the gay pride demonstrations turned to brutality when teenager Jamie Jackson Reed was filmed being arrested and slammed to the ground by a police officer after accusations of violent behavior. An eventual lawsuit by Reed led to him getting $40,000 in compensation . The last sunny Mardi Gras Gay Pride parade took place in 2010, and every year since has been hit by rain and wet weather. But every year, the hundreds of people that turn out for the event refused to let the weather dampen their spirits, with this year being no exception . The parade travelled through the city of Sydney with over 100 floats, with either end dominated by scenes of partying, celebrating gay rights and protesting against subjugation . The party and parade was also used as a meeting place for the city's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, who came together to celebrate freedom in their country and protest anti-gay legislation in others .

British police have joined forces with Australian and US investigators to smash a paedophile ring which streamed live child abuse from the Philippines (file picture) The National Crime Agency has said it is investigating what it calls 'a significant and emerging threat', particularly in developing countries. Andy Baker, from the NCA, said: 'This investigation has identified some extremely dangerous child sexual offenders who believed paying for children to be abused to order was something they could get away with. 'Being thousands of miles away makes no difference to their guilt. In my mind they are just as responsible for the abuse of these children as the contact abusers overseas. 'Protecting the victims of abuse is our priority and that means attacking every link in the chain, from dismantling the organised groups who are motivated by profit through to targeting their customers.' So far 15 children aged six to 15 have been rescued after being identified as victims. In some cases their own relatives sold them for abuse. In the UK five of the 17 suspects arrested have been convicted, nine investigations are ongoing, one will face no further action and two are dead. The National Crime Agency has said it is investigating what it calls 'a significant and emerging threat', particularly in developing countries.

The use of web cams in the developing world to stream live abuse is a significant and emerging threat, claim the NCA. Hannah Bickers, an NCA spokesperson said: 'I think this is an emerging threat. It’s the first investigation of live streaming of extreme abuse, and it’s only scratching the surface. 'We hope there will be more arrests in the future. There’s a number of people who have been identified. 'There’s an element of extreme poverty and areas where people are more vulnerable to abuse. It appears to be going both ways - families who are poor sometimes exploit their own children. This is a world wide issue. 'Extreme poverty, the increasing availability of high-speed internet and the existence of a vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organised crime groups exploiting children for financial gain.' James Dinkins from the US Department of Homeland Security said: 'Thanks to this joint operation, children have been rescued from a living nightmare. 'The group responsible for these heinous crimes mistakenly believed that they could use technology to avoid detection, but they were wrong. 'We will continue to work tirelessly with our international law enforcement partners across jurisdictions and national boundaries to protect children anywhere in the world and bring criminals to justice regardless of where they live.' Tim Morris, of the Australian Federal Police, added: 'Every day AFP officers work with state and international counterparts to combat child sexual exploitation and to bring offenders to justice.

She admitted last year that she struggled with her day-to-day memory and could not remember whether she had made herself a coffee. Yesterday it emerged actress Prunella Scales has been diagnosed with ‘mild Alzheimer’s’. And the 81-year-old star, who is best-known for playing bolshie wife Sybil in Fawlty Towers, remained typically defiant over her diagnosis declaring it would not stop her from acting and that she hoped to die on stage ‘playing a reasonably good part’ during her ‘eighth curtain call’. Filming a series for More 4 documentaries with actor husband Timothy West, in which the couple embark on canal boat trips together, the pair opened up about how their lives have changed following Miss Scales’ diagnosis. Actor Mr West, 79, told how his beloved wife struggles to ‘remember things’ but admitted their canal boat lifestyle therefore allowed her ‘enjoy things as they happen’. Living life day-by-day with her doting husband, Miss Scales said in an interview with the Radio Times: ‘I always say I want to die on the eighth curtain call. Eight will mean the show’s been rather a success. I just hope I’m somewhere near the middle and have been reasonably good in the part.’ Speaking about their programme ‘Grand Canal Journeys’ which will see the couple tour four of Britain’s favourite canal journeys, Mr West admitted life on the boat helped cope him cope with his wife’s difficulties. Describing her condition as ‘a sort of mild Alzheimer’s’ in an interview with the Radio Times Mr West, said: ‘She can’t remember things very well, but you don’t have to remember things on the canal. ‘You can just enjoy things as they happen - so it’s perfect for her.’ Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, and currently there is no cure for the disease which worsens as it progresses. Although Alzheimer’s disease develops differently for every individual, there are many common symptoms which include short term memory loss, confusion, irritability, mood swings, trouble with language and long term memory loss. The 81-year-old, famed for her role as bolshie wife Sybil in Fawlty Towers, says she will die on stage . Though she struggles to remember if she has made her morning coffee, Mr West says, they are coping fine . Many early symptoms go undetected and are often mistakenly thought to be ‘age-related’ concerns or manifestations of stress. Miss Scales and Mr West have been navigating Britain’s canals on a slow boat ever since they sparked a passion for the hobby when they borrowed a friend’s boat for a fortnight in the 1970s. The devoted couple, who have two sons, celebrated their golden wedding anniversary last October with a trip down the River Thames on paddle steamer the Waverley. Speaking about her love of boats Miss Scales added: ‘It’s always Tim who steers. But I enjoy running up and down because of the wonderful wildlife on the towpath. And it keeps you fit.’ In January last Miss Scales revealed to the Daily Mail her short-term memory was fading to the point she could not remember whether she had made herself a coffee. She said she struggled to remember the year either of her two sons were born, nor when she married Mr West. She said: ‘My day-to-day memory is ludicrous, I can’t remember things about life, so you find ways of remembering by writing them down. What was I looking up? Mr West, seen here in Coronation Street, and Miss Scales celebrated their golden anniversary last year . ‘I don’t know my alphabet, that’s my problem. ‘Inside I feel about 48.’ The actress, CBE, was BAFTA award-nominated in 1991 for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in A Question of Attribution by Alan Bennett. She was famously close friends with the late actor Richard Briers who she supported while he battled emphysema. The actress, who lives in South-West London, stared in the sixties sitcom ‘Marriage Lines’ alongside Mr Briers, playing newlyweds George and Kate Starling. Speaking about Miss Scales’ diagnosis, Dr Alison Cook of the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘The Alzheimer’s Society would like to thank Timothy West for speaking out about his wife Prunella Scales’ dementia and raising awareness of the condition. 'Their recent adventure navigating Britain’s canals shows that it is possible to live well with dementia and plan to carry on enjoying life. 'We would urge anyone who is concerned about themselves or a loved one to speak to their GP today or contact Alzheimer’s Society for advice and support.’","Prunella Scales, 81, struggles with day-to-day memory, husband reveals .

First Minister Alex Salmond will use a major speech today to try to rescue his dream of independence. He will claim Conservative Chancellor George Osborne made a ‘monumental error’ by ruling out allowing an independent Scotland to keep the pound. However, polls show the co-ordinated warning from the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems in Westminster that a currency union would be blocked has not triggered the backlash in Scotland which Mr Salmond had hoped for.

Mark Diffley, director at Ipsos MORI Scotland said the ‘No’ campaign appears to retain a healthy lead. ‘The important recent debate over currency appears not to have shifted committed voters from their positions while undecided voters appear a little more inclined to vote ‘No’ as a result. ‘Having said that overall support for a ‘No’ vote has not changed since December. We are now into the final 200 days before the referendum takes place and both sides will be stepping up their efforts to win over those who yet to decide how they vote.

Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond will use a speech tonight to claim Conservative Chancellor George Osborne made a ‘monumental error’ by ruling out allowing an independent Scotland to keep the pound. Additional polling reveals the growing anxieties among Scots about the impact of independence on their lives. More than half – 52 per cent – of people in Scotland fear a yes vote would weaken the pound, compared to only 32 per of people in England and Wales, the Guardian reported. On spending, 49 per cent of Scots fear independence would trigger cuts in Scotland, while only 24 per cent in England and Wales predict more austerity south of the border. Almost two thirds of Scots (63 per cent) fear that independence would lead to a worsening relationship between Edinburgh and the rest of the UK. Only 50 per cent of voters in England and Wales feel the same. Nicola Sturgeon, Deputy First Minister, warned winning over women voters is the biggest challenge facing independence campaigners . Mr Salmond will use his speech today to accuse Mr Osborne's of ‘dive bombing’ Scotland with threats over the currency and the economy. In a lecture hosted by the New Statesman in London tonight he is expected to say: ‘In the last three weeks people in Scotland have seen an array of approaches from the UK Government - what they apparently call their Dambusters strategy. We were love-bombed from a distance by David Cameron, then dive-bombed at close range by George Osborne. ‘I believe George Osborne's speech on sterling three weeks ago, his sermon on the pound, will come to be seen as a monumental error. ‘It encapsulates the diktats from on high which are not the strength of the Westminster elite, but rather their fundamental weakness. ‘In contrast, we will seek to engage with the people of England on the case for progressive reform.’ However, Mr Salmond’s deputy Nicola Sturgeon has warned that winning over women voters is the biggest challenge facing independence campaigners ahead of the referendum. The Deputy First Minister said that women take a far more pragmatic approach to the issues and conceded that the SNP had yet to convince the majority to back separation. In a keynote speech, she said that women needed to be convinced that independence would make them better off but admitted that the argument had yet to be won. The scale of the Yes campaign's task was starkly illustrated by the IpsosMori poll which showed that only 27 per cent of women back independence, compared to 38 per cent of men. The survey also revealed that 59 per cent of women oppose independence, leaving Mr Salmond a major task with just over six months until the referendum. Support for independence was highest among 25-34-year-olds (45 per cent) and lowest among the over-55s (28 per cent). The survey also revealed stark differences in the views of voters depending on where they lived.

A cast of Napoleon Bonaparte's death mask has sold for almost £170,000 at auction after spending years stored in a family attic. The mask was made for a British chaplain shortly after the French emperor’s death on the South Atlantic island of St Helena in 1821, where he was exiled. The rare find went under the hammer at Bonhams Book, Map and Manuscript sale in Knightsbridge, central London, yesterday and sold for £169,250 - well above its estimate of £40,000 to £60,000. Under the hammer: The mask (cast, pictured left) was made for a British chaplain shortly after French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's (right) death on the South Atlantic island of St Helena in 1821, where he was exiled . Known as the 'Boys cast', it was made for the Reverend Richard Boys, senior chaplain of St Helena, two days after Napoleon's death - and when the Emperor's body was beginning to decompose. It was sold by Andrew Boys, a direct descendent of the original owner's brother, who was left it in a family member's will. After years of being stored in the attic of his home, Mr Boys decided to sell it. The cast is classed as the most significant example of its kind remaining in private hands. All but one of the other examples are in national collections in France. Andrew Boys said for years he did not know what to do the cast, adding: ‘At a family funeral I was rather surprised and taken aback, to hear that I had been left this mask. ‘After a while I realised its . significance but I was not sure what to do with it beyond ensuring its . safety.  To date it has been confined to an attic but I most definitely . did not want this to happen for another generation. ‘I came to the conclusion that the . best thing to do was to offer it for sale in the hope that, as a result, . it was something more people would then be able to see and enjoy’. Rare: Known as the 'Boys cast', it was made for the Reverend Richard Boys, senior chaplain of St Helena, two days after Napoleon's death - and when the Emperor's body was beginning to decompose . After . Napoleon's death, there was a protracted wrangle over whether his . physician, Francesco Antommarchi, or the British doctor, Francis Burton, . should make a death mask. Practical difficulties also meant this was not done until two days after the former Emperor had died. The mask was given to Rev Boys by the . portrait painter, J.W. Rubidge, who helped Mr Antommarchi to make the . mask. Rev Boys received it before Napoleon's entourage left the island. Napoleon Bonaparte, who was exiled to Elba, Italy, after defeat in 1814, escaped and returned to France before being beaten again at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and imprisoned by the British on St Helena. He was supported by South America, which was backed by him when it was trying to gain independence from Spain, and had ambitions of a new empire in Mexico or Venezuela. But Napoleon was one on the most closely guarded prisoners of all time, with a strong Royal Navy squadron of 11 ships patrolling the South Atlantic island where he was kept 1,200 miles from the nearest land. Plots to rescue him included those using yachts, steamboats and balloons - and one was said to have even involved a submarine. The escape plans were hatched despite Napoleon being confined to an astonishingly secure prison for the era, which was guarded by 2,800 men and 500 cannon on its handful of possible landing ports. He spent six years on the heavily-guarded island, in the refurbished Longwood mansion, where visitors were thoroughly questioned and searched, before dying in May 1821, apparently of cancer. It is inscribed 'Rev Mr Boys' on the inside of the cast - and comes with a note by Boys, reading: ‘This Cast was taken from the Face of Napoleon Buonaparte as he lay dead at Longwood St. Helena 7th May 1821 which I do hereby certify/ R. Boys M.A. Sen.r Chaplain/ By Rubidge.’ Revd Boys is recorded as having played chess with Napoleon and is said to have brought several mementos of the Frenchman with him on his return to England eight years later. He was a strict moralist who made himself unpopular by preaching sermons against the loose living of senior members of the British garrison. As a result he was said to have been viewed as something of a liability by the British authorities and well-regarded by the French contingent on the Island. This may explain why he managed to get hold of such an intimate memento of the Emperor as this impression of his death mask. Bonhams spokesman Matthew Haley said: ‘This mask is a fascinating reflection on the nature of power and its projection. ‘By the time the cast for the mask was made Napoleon's body had begun to decompose in the fierce heat and, as was noted at the time, his features had changed quite markedly. ‘The very last image we have of Napoleon, therefore, is more that of a saint than the man of action and resolution carefully engineered in the portraits painted during his lifetime.' Bonhams consultant Felix Pryor added: ‘Before the invention of photography, taking a cast from a person's face was the one way of producing what may be described as an objective likeness. These masks were most often taken after death. 'In this they became part of the funerary rites of the dead, the royal dead especially - royal death masks can be traced back to at least the time of Tutankhamun. ‘The present death mask of Napoleon can be seen as standing at the end of this long tradition - the world's first photograph was to be taken only five years later’.","Rare find went under the hammer at Bonhams sale in Knightsbridge .

An Ohio man claims to have been detained and interrogated by Department of Homeland Security officers for three hours at the weekend, accused of being part of a major film piracy ring, after wearing his Google Glass headpiece to the movies. The man, who wrote a detailed account of the incident to tech website Gadgeteer, said he was at the AMC cinemas in Columbus, Ohio, on Saturday night with his wife when the incident occurred. He was wearing Google Glasses - a 'wearable computer' shaped like eye wear that layers digital information over the real world - which he had his prescription lenses fitted into. About one hour into a showing of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, the man said some 'federal service' agents snatched the glasses from his face and asked him to leave the theater. Google Glasses are 'wearable computers' that were only recently released to a select market. They layer information over real life seen like a computer screen on one eye . The man said between five to 10 police were waiting outside for him and accused him of illegally taping the movie. He told them it was a 'misunderstanding' and that the glasses - which cost him a total $2100 and are capable of being used to record video - were turned off. The man and his wife were taken to a management office inside Easton Mall and interviewed separately. 'I kept telling them that Glass has a USB port and not only did I allow them, I actually insist they connect to it and see that there was nothing but personal photos with my wife and my dog on it,' the man wrote to Gadgeteer. 'I also insisted they look at my phone too and clear things out, but they wanted to talk first. 'They wanted to know who I am, where I live, where I work, how much I’m making, how many computers I have at home, why am I recording the movie, who am I going to give the recording to, why don’t I just give up the guy up the chain, ’cause they are not interested in me. The incident occurred at this AMC Theatre in Columbus, Ohio, where the man involved in the incident says he goes every week with his wife . 'Over and over and over again.' The man that 'after a long time' someone came into the office with a laptop and USB cable and searched through the photos on his glasses, which were all of his wife and dog. 'I asked why didn’t they just take those five minutes at the beginning of the interrogation and they just left the room,' he wrote. 'A guy who claimed his name is Bob Hope (he gave me his business card) came in the room, and said he was with the Movie Association and they have problems with piracy at that specific theater and that specific movie. 'He gave me two free movie passes “so I can see the movie again”.' The man said he and his wife were allowed to leave at about 11.27pm. The movie started at 7.45pm. In a statement, the DHS confirmed the incident, but maintained the interview was brief. Staff at the Columbus AMC Theater are thought to have reported the man to police are suspected his Google Glasses were a special camera that he was using to pirate the movie he was seeing . 'On Jan. 18, special agents with ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations and local authorities briefly interviewed a man suspected of using an electronic recording device to record a film at an AMC theater in Columbus,' the statement said. 'The man, who voluntarily answered questions, confirmed to authorities that the suspected recording device was also a pair of prescription eye glasses in which the recording function had been inactive. No further action was taken.' AMC cinema also confirmed the incident. 'Movie theft is something we take very seriously, and our theater managers contact the Motion Picture Association of America anytime it’s suspected that someone may be illegally recording content on screen,' they said in a statement. 'While we’re huge fans of technology and innovation, wearing a device that has the capability to record video is not appropriate at the movie theater. While this is a standard pair of Google Glass, the man involved in this instance had his prescription lenses fitted into the new technology so he could wear them all the time . 'At AMC Easton 30 last weekend, a guest was questioned for possible movie theft after he was identified wearing a recording device during a film. 'The presence of this recording device prompted an investigation by the MPAA, which was on site. 'The MPAA then contacted Homeland Security, which oversees movie theft. The investigation determined the guest was not recording content.'","Man in Columbus, Ohio, was on a movie date with his wife on Saturday at the AMC cinema they go to once a week .

A woman secretly cancelled her brother’s wedding because she didn’t like his bride-to-be, a court has heard. Ann Duffy pretended to be her now sister-in-law during a phone call to Plymouth Register Office in Devon and told them she wanted to cancel the wedding. She then phoned her brother and told him: 'I've saved you on the divorce.' Plymouth magistrates were told she made the call on November 5 last year, just 20 days before David and Sandra Greatrex were due to wed. The court heard that the day 50-year-old Duffy cancelled the wedding, she called her brother and said: 'You better put this on speakerphone. 'I have saved you on the divorce. I have cancelled your wedding. 'Would you like me to send you the confirmation email?' Mr Walden, prosecuting, said her brother’s fiancee then called the police. He said that the two women's relationship had been experiencing friction over the care of Duffy’s mother. Mr Page said because she called the pair and told them what she had done, they were able to re-book the wedding the next day. 'One offence doesn’t really constitute a harassment charge,' Mr Walden said. 'There were other incidents that had been reported to police which is why the charge was brought.' Duffy pretended to be her now sister-in-law during a phone call to Plymouth Register Office (pictured) in Devon and told them she wanted to cancel the wedding . But despite her best efforts, David and Sandra Greatrex managed to reschedule the wedding and have since tied the knot . The couple were able to call the register office and explain the situation . The court heard how during an interview, Duffy had explained about the strained relationship with her sister-in-law over her mother, who had moved in with the couple. In the interview, Duffy said she was trying to protect her brother from a marriage to someone she dislikes and who she believed was taking her mother away. Duffy said that she only wanted to cause her sister-in-law distress, and not her brother. Plymouth magistrates were told she made the call on November 5 last year, just 20 days before the couple were due to wed. She then called her brother and said: 'I have saved you on the divorce. I have cancelled your wedding' Roger Page, defending, said: 'What we have here is somebody that has pleaded guilty to harassment without violence. 'The defendant still takes the view that her brother is not suited to his wife. 'In desperation to avoid her brother from making what she regarded as a disastrous move she cancelled the wedding.'

David Cameron faces the humiliating prospect of the Conservatives being pushed into third place in May’s European elections. A damning new poll reveals the Tories are on course to come behind Labour and the UK Independence Party – the first time it would be outside the top two in election history. Leading Tory backbencher Liam Fox today piled pressure on the Prime Minister, admitting ‘anything could happen’ when voters go to the polls. The Conservatives are on course to come third in the elections to the European Parliament in May, behind Labour and Ukip. YouGov interviewed 1,893 adults for The Sun on January 14 and 15 . Ukip leader Nigel Farage predicts he will trigger a political 'earthquake' by topping the Euro elections, while David Cameron is under pressure from Eurosceptics in the Tory party see off the threat of Ukip . Ukip leader Nigel Farage has predicted he will trigger an ‘earthquake’ in British politics if his party tops the poll in May when MEPs are elected to the Brussels Parliament. Mr Cameron hoped to head off the threat from the anti-EU party with a pro0mise of an in-out referendum if he is Prime Minister after 2015. But a growing Tory revolt over Europe, demanding a veto for the British parliament to reject any Brussels law, has exposed deep divisions on the government benches. A new opinion poll today puts Labour on course to come first, with Ukip in second followed by the Conservatives. A Tory rebellion over Europe has descended into farce after Number 10 revealed it has never received a controversial letter from rebels. David Cameron came under intense pressure at the weekend over claims 95 Tory MPs had signed a letter calling for the UK government to have the right to veto any EU laws. It then emerged that some MPs included in the list had not actually signed it. Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie insisted his name had been included error, and at least six others were also mistakenly added. Now it has been revealed that the letter was never actually sent to Number 10, and does not actually exist. A response to a Freedom of Information request by The Times said: 'A search of our records has not identified that we have received the letter to which you refer.' Bernard Jenkin, the Tory MP who co-ordinated the letter, said he had passed the names to Mr Cameron's parliamentary aide Gavin Williamson, rather than send an actual letter. Liam Fox, a standard bearer of the Tory right, today refused to say whether he had signed it, but hinted at the confusion. Asked if had backed the letter, he told Radio 4: 'That is for me to know and the Prime Minister to know... or not know.' The YouGov survey for The Sun put Labour on 32 per cent and Ukip on 26 per cent, with the Tories trailing on 23 per cent and Liberal Democrats a distant fourth on 9 per cent. If the findings were repeated on May 22 with a uniform swing, they would see Conservative representation at the European Parliament slashed by 11 to 15 MEPs. Labour would have 28 (up 15), Ukip 23 (up 10), and the Lib Dems' 11 MEPs would be completely wiped out, according to The Sun's calculations. Mr Farage has predicted that Ukip will come first in May: ‘My ambition and my conviction is we could come first in those European elections and cause an earthquake in British politics.’ Tory strategists are working to limit the damage on Mr Cameron if the party loses MEPs. Today senior Conservative Mr Fox declined to say whether his party could beat Ukip. ‘I think pretty much anything could happen in May, because I think that voters will very much see the European elections as a referendum on a referendum,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘I think it's very important that the Conservative party is defined by the national interest, that we decide we have to have a rational and reasonable debate about our role in Europe and our role in the world, and also Europe's role in the world. ‘One of my biggest problems in this debate is not that it's just about Britain's relationship with Europe, it's where does Europe now stand in terms of a very competitive global economy.’ But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused the Conservatives of engaging in an 'unholy bidding war' with the UK Independence Party over who can sound most anti-European, which could end in Britain leaving the European Union. The Liberal Democrat leader insisted he will not tone down his party's pro-European message, following a poll suggesting his MEPs are set to be wiped out in this year's elections to the European Parliament, while Conservatives slump to third place behind Labour and the UK Independence Party. Mr Clegg said it would be 'economic suicide' for Britain to quit the EU, and that Tories and Ukip were indulging in 'silly political games' which could put millions of jobs at risk. He insisted the Lib Dems would campaign as the pro-EU 'party of in'. Asked how they would vote in a general election, 39 per cent of people backed Labour compared to 33 per cent for the Tories. YouGov interviewed 1,893 adults for The Sun on January 14 and 15 . Mr Clegg added: 'I really genuinely feel that we are . getting to the point in the debate where you've got this unholy bidding . war between the Conservative Party and Ukip as to who can sound more . breathless in their condemnation of all things European and, before you . know it, this country will find itself outside of the European Union. 'I think this will mean we will be less relevant and powerful around the world, we would have less influence around the world. 'But . crucially you would have fewer people in work, because being in Europe . at the end of the day means being in work. I am not going to stand idly . by while people play ever more silly political games and jeopardise . millions of jobs in this country.' However, in a sign that voters will use the European elections to inflict a bloody nose on the Tories, a separate poll on voting intentions for the 2015 general election was very different. It put Labour on 39 per cent, Conservatives 33 per cent and Ukip 12 further behind on 12 per cent and the Lib Dems on 10 per cent.","Damning YouGov survey reveals Conservatives will lose MEPs .

A soldier from the Royal Engineers who was killed in action in Afghanistan two days before Christmas Day was 'an exceptional young man' who 'embraced life to the full', his family has said. Captain Richard Holloway, 29, from County Durham, was named by the Ministry of Defence today after he was killed as a result of enemy fire while on operations east of Kabul on December 23. According to defence sources, Captain  Holloway was serving with the Special Boat Service on a secret mission. His commanding officer, who cannot be named for security reasons, said Capt Holloway died as a result of direct enemy fire while leading from the front, adding: ‘He was one of the best; a natural leader.’ He leaves behind parents Jaquie and Neil, brother Luke and girlfriend Sandy. In a statement, his family said: 'Our son Richard was an exceptional young man, a perfectionist in everything he did and a loyal brother and friend, who embraced life to the full.' They added: 'He was a dedicated and totally committed member of the armed forces, relishing the excitement and challenge but always serious and reflective about his duties and responsibilities to those with whom he served. 'The sense of adventure he experienced with the Royal Engineers was echoed in his love of travel to faraway places and physical activity including surfing, kayaking, canoeing, mountain-biking and climbing. 'Wherever the action was, he wanted to be part of it - and that is where our beloved son, of whom we are so very proud, lost his life.' Captain Ed Martin, from the Royal Engineers, said Capt Holloway, who was best man at his wedding earlier this year, was an 'inspiration to others'. 'There was never a second wasted with Rich, he always had a plan and made the most of every day,' he said. 'He lived life to the full and was an inspiration to others to do the same. 'I have never met a more trustworthy, loyal or dedicated friend, he had humility in spades and I would have followed him anywhere. Captain Holloway's commanding officer said he was 'revered' by the Afghans who he trained (file picture) 'I am very lucky to have known him and . feel exceptionally fortunate to have had him as the best man at my . wedding earlier this year, he will be dearly missed.

'His tactical ability commanded wide respect; his judgment was un-erring, his enthusiasm was infectious and his standards never dropped,' he said. 'He had a humble self-confidence that instinctively drew people to him. His own brand of selflessness and professionalism marked him out as a soldier, but it was the warmth of his personality that set him out as a popular and effective leader. 'It is hard to track, but at some point in the process Rich established himself not just as a highly respected troop commander, but one of the principal characters within the unit.

U.S. stocks tumbled on Monday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 320 points after reports of sluggish U.S growth added to investor worries about the global economy. It was the biggest one-day decline for the blue-chip index in more than seven months. And the drop followed the Dow's worst January performance since 2009. The market stumbled from the get-go, with U.S. stocks opening lower after declines in European and Japanese indexes. Then it quickly turned into a slide as a spate of discouraging economic data on everything from manufacturing to auto sales to construction spending poured in. Bad day: U.S, stocks dropped Monday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 320 points . By late afternoon, the sell-off accelerated further, bringing the Dow down more than 7 percent for the year. The S&P 500 index was down more than 5 percent for 2014. Some stock watchers took the market's decline in stride. They considered it a necessary recalibration following the market's record highs at the end of last year. 'It's a bit painful for investors to see the equities markets drop as they have, but this is healthy for this market,' said Chris Gaffney, a senior market strategist at EverBank. 'We've been almost 2-1/2 years without a 10 percent correction.' All told, the Dow dropped 326.05 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 15,372.80, its biggest decline since June 20, 2013. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 40.70 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,741.89. The Nasdaq composite dropped 106.92 points, or 2.6 percent, to 3,996.96. There were signs of worry throughout the market. The VIX index, a measure of stock market volatility, rose to its highest level since December 2012. Investors shifted into U.S. government bonds, pushing yields lower and extending their sharp decline since the start of the year. Staffing company Robert Half International declined the most among stocks in the S&P 500 index. CarMax and Pfizer were among the few stocks to eke out gains on the day. Cold U.S. weather emerged as common problem for the economy last month. Worried: Monday's fall has investors worried, as it was the biggest one-day decline for the blue-chip index in more than seven months . Investors were discouraged Monday by a private survey showing U.S. manufacturing barely expanded last month as frigid temperatures delayed shipments of raw materials and caused some factories to shut down. Construction spending rose modestly in December, slowing from healthy gains a month earlier. Automakers also piled on the disappointing news, as an icy January slowed vehicle purchases. Ford shares slipped 41 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $14.55 and General Motors shares fell 83 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $35.25 after the automakers reported a drop in U.S. January sales, hurt by harsh weather that kept customers away from dealerships. GM sales fell 12 percent, while Ford said sales fell 7 percent. Chrysler bucked the trend with U.S. sales gains of 8 percent, and analysts still expect U.S. auto sales to reach more than 16 million this year - a return to pre-recession levels. 'Investors had expectations going into 2014 of a much stronger U.S. economic recovery than actually what we're seeing and we've had to reset our expectations,' Gaffney said. In the tank: GM sales fell by 12 percent while Ford's sales fell by roughly 7 percent . Fresh signs of weakness in China also weighed on the minds of investors. An official Chinese manufacturing survey released over the weekend showed factory output grew at a slower rate in January compared with December. The report released on the weekend followed an HSBC survey that showed an outright contraction in manufacturing. Any signs of slowdown in China's economy - the world's second-largest - can spell bad news because it drives exports and is a key trading partner for developing countries such as South Africa and Indonesia that supply Chinese factories with raw materials. Investors have been looking for more pullbacks this year and possibly a correction, the technical term for when a stock market index like the S&P 500 falls 10 percent or more. Three months ago, analysts at Goldman Sachs said there was roughly a 60 percent chance that a correction would happen this year. Monday's slide moved the market closer to that possibility. Among other negative signs for the market: In 2013, the Dow had only one 300-point-plus down day. It's had two 300-plus drops in 2014, barely two months in. 'I think we are in correction phase and the bias will be to the downside for a while longer,' said Frank Davis, director of trading at LEK Securities. 'It would make sense to see a healthy pullback after last year. Air has to come out of the market.' Gains: CarMax and Pfizer were among the few stocks to eke out gains on the day . All 10 sectors in the S&P 500 index fell, and telecommunications stocks posted the biggest declines, weighed down by AT&T and Verizon Communications. Mattel fell $1.79, or 4.7 percent, to $36.05. The world's largest maker of toys reported on Friday that sales of Barbie and Fisher-Price preschool items dropped in its fourth quarter. Also among the decliners: Jos.

A bereaved and angered father has attacked the suspected drunken driver allegedly responsible for his son's death after following him into in a men's room inside a Florida courthouse. Juan Gonzalez Sr, 56, was arrested Monday and charged with two counts of battery for allegedly ambushing defendant John Powers and his friend. Powers, 54, emerged from the restroom after the beating with blood dripping from his left ear down his neck and onto his white button-down shirt. Bereaved dad: Juan Gonzalez, 56, is questioned at the Broward Courthouse after being accused of attacking the man allegedly responsible for his son's death in a 2011 car crash . The bloodied defendant at once reported the assault to Broward Circuit Judge Marc Gold, who then ordered the arrest of Mr Gonzalez. The father allegedly trailed his son's suspected killer when he left the courtroom to use the bathroom, struck him several times and knocked him to the ground. 'You killed my son,' Mr Gonzalez allegedly told Powers, according to Orlando Sun-Sentinel. 'I will be watching you.' The man's son, Juan Manuel Gonzalez Jr , was fatally injured June 12, 2011, after being involved in a collision at State Road 7 and Orange Drive in Davie. According to an arrest report, an inebriated John Powers attempted to make a U-turn from northbound State Road 7, forcing Gonzalez, who was riding his motorcycle southbound, to slam on the brakes in order to avoid hitting the vehicle. As a result, Gonzalez's Suzuki bike skidded and crashed into Powers' Jeep. The biker was rushed to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries the following day. Powers' blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was nearly twice the legal limit, according to the report. Grisly aftermath: John Powers, 54, is seen with blood on his face and shirt after he said Gonzalez followed him to the bathroom and punched him several times . The 54-year-old is facing DUi manslaughter and manslaughter with an unlawful blood alcohol level. He pleaded not guilty during his arraignment yesterday. During the hearing, Powers and his friend, 59-year-old Jay Israel, went to the men's room directly outside the courtroom, where they were confronted by Gonzalez. Israel later recounted to deputies that the angered man grabbed him by the throat before turning his attention to Powers, whom he punched several times in the head and knocked to the floor. Gonzalez was quickly apprehended and identified by Israel and Powers as their assailant. He could face up to a year in jail if convicted of the two misdemeanor battery counts. This was not Gonzalez’s first run-in with the law. According to records, the man was charged in 2006 with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, leaving the scene of an accident and reckless driving, and sentenced to three years of probation. Meanwhile, John Powers is due back in court in March in the fatal DUI case.","Juan Gonzalez Sr, 56, lost his son in a June 2011 collision in Davie, Florida .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:36 EST, 4 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:33 EST, 4 March 2014 . A 23-year-old Air Force trainee who was recruited as an undercover informant has been caught up in a nasty battle with her former supervisors as they have launched an effort to smear her reputation and possibly get her kicked out of the military after allegedly being raped. Jane Neubauer originally intended to go into the Air Force's meteorology program but was diverted after being asked to work for the secretive Office of Special Investigations, effectively using her connections to her peers to help root out drug rings. In a lengthy Daily Beast feature, Ms Neubauer describes how she has gone through months of logistical haranging with the organization that she thought would protect her, at points being left feeling 'straight up suicidal'. Turning on the turncoat: The Office of Special Investigations partnered with Jane Neubauer, who was 23 at the time, to work as an undercover informant but now they are building a case against her . The ordeal began on July 26, 2013 when Ms Neubauer went with a group of people she thought might have information about drug sales in and around Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Mississippi. She went with them to a party at a person's house that she did not know, and when she went upstairs to go to the restroom, she was raped by a man who claimed that he knew she was an informant. She went to the local hospital and asked for a rape kit to be performed but told police that she did not want them to pursue an investigation. In her mind, the OSI would carry out their own investigation since she was there as part of her undercover work. Her supervisors immediately said that they would come to her defense- that they saw her 'like a sister' and would hunt down the man responsible. As days went by, however, they stopped . picking up her calls and she began to understand that they were . building a case against her to charge that she made up her rape . allegations. The OSI is now . claiming that they had a discussion with her the night before her . alleged sexual assault wherein they decided that they would formally . 'cease' the informant partnership. Betrayed: Ms Neubauer was first told that OSI would investigate her alleged rape but now they are charging her with crimes and have made no progress on her rape investigation, eight months later . They issued a statement to that effect to The Daily Beast reporter last week in late February, but they never provided the paperwork that would have been filed at the time if that timeline were true. They went on to say that 'in like of the necessary investigative activities, her status as a victim' she had her role as a confidential informant formally terminated on August 7. This wasn't the first sign that they were going to go after her, however. Just 12 days after the alleged assault, she was arrested by OSI for using marijuana. Not long after, she was charged with DUI after marijuana was found in her car. Those weren't the only charges filed against her: she was written up for wearing an unauthorized nail polish while in her dorm room. 'Once you have that target on your back it's coming from everywhere. She’s causing them too much work, it's too many problems,' said Jennifer Norris, a assault victim's advocate who is also a retired Air Force veteran. Under watch: Neubauer was asked to dig for clues about the drug rings around the Air Force Base and her supervisors told her not to do any drugs but she could drink and break other rules; now they are charging her for that . According to Ms Neubauer, these are all steps that the OSI has taken to separate themselves from her and paint her in a bad light. The most important distinction is that she says she was not told to stop her 3-month-long informant career only after the alleged rape. As for the charges, she doesn't deny that they happened but does say that they are reneging on an earlier understanding by bringing them up. When she was first recruited to become an informant- which came after she went to report a different incident when another airman made an inappropriate sexual remark- she says that her supervisors said it would be okay if she partook in some typically banned behavior in order to gain the trust of the drug dealers. Secrecy: The OSI at Keesler Air Force Base near Biloxi, Mississippi has not revealed any evidence supporting their timeline of events, wherein they go against Ms Neubauer and say that they told her to stop her confidential work the day before her alleged rape . She told The Daily Beast that her OSI supervisor said: 'Just dirty yourself. Tell them you were a bad person before you joined the Air Force, tell them you miss smoking weed, tell them you miss doing pills.' The alternative timeline from the OSI is the latest twist in the ongoing saga, and Ms Neubauer is technically still enrolled in the weather program at Keesler Air Force Base but she also still has the investigation looming over her head- an investigation that is different and separate from the drugs charges, for which she was sent to rehabilitation program. Even though they have questioned her repeatedly, taken the rape kit results from the hospital and asked her for handwriting samples, they have still not told her what exactly they are investigating.","Jane Neubauer was allegedly raped while at a party trying to gather information about drug rings near Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi .

'We just wanted to have a good day together, spend some quality time with the love of my life,' she said, smiling as she added: 'It was the first time we actually agreed on a movie together.'

A West Texas man convicted of killing two people as a teenager in 1993 was released on bond Tuesday while he awaits a new trial ordered by the state. After spending nearly 20 years in prison for the killings of two teenagers in a drive-by shooting, Daniel Villegas stood in the morning sun outside the El Paso County Jail. 'I never thought this day would come and now it's here. It feels like a dream, like I'm going to wake up,' the 37-year-old told a crowd of reporters and sympathizers. Scroll down for video... Ready for new life: Daniel Villegas was 16 years old when he confessed to the 1993 drive-by shooting murders of two teens in El Paso. In 1995, he was sentenced to life in prison. Now, he's free . Overcome with emotion: Flanked by his legal team, Villegas had a bond hearing, at which he's was set free, since his case was vacated last month . Free at last: Bond for 37-year-old Daniel Villegas was set at $50,000 during a court hearing Tuesday. Here he is congratulated by his lawyer, Joseph Spencer . Villegas was flanked by his mother, Yolanda Villegas, and local businessman John Mimbela, who has supported his case. Villegas was released Tuesday after posting $1,000 of a $50,000 bond. 'This is too much for me. I get to hold him again. I've waited too long,' Yolanda Villegas said while tears rolled down her cheeks. Daniel Villegas first trial for the deaths of teenagers Armando Lazo and Robert England ended in a hung jury. He was found guilty in 1995 and sentenced to life in prison. But at hearings in 2011, Villegas' attorney, John Gates, said he hadn't had enough time to prepare for the second trial. The defense for the first trial had called 18 witnesses; Gates presented just one. The Texas Court of Appeals in December granted Villegas a new trial due to ineffective counsel. Villegas has claimed he confessed to the crime after an El Paso Police Department detective told him he would be raped in prison and face the death penalty. A private investigator hired by his supporters, a team from Northwestern University Law School's Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth and a pair of men exonerated after serving time for murder have backed up his claims of innocence. Twenty years lost: Villegas' conviction was based almost entirely on his one-page, dictated confession, which did not match the facts of the case in numerous ways . Happy days: Cheers erupted from the public gallery as Daniel received the news that he was to be set free . Bad reputation: Villegas was a 16-year-old high school dropout with ties to a gang when he signed a confession admitting to the murders . Most importantly, Jesse Hernandez, who survived the 1993 shooting, said that Villegas is not the killer. ‘I believe with all my heart he is innocent,’ Hernandez told FoxNews.com. ‘I always thought I knew who else might have done it from the beginning. I had never heard of Daniel before.’ 'Why did it take so long to get a new . trial? Money, I didn't have the money,' his mother said. She thanked . Mimbela for footing the legal bills and 'for putting up with me, I can . be annoying.' The Villegas . lost their house because of the debt they took during the first trial, . she added. 'I earn minimum wage. I didn't have the $20,000 to begin (the . process of getting a new trial), and even if I did, that was just to . start,' Villegas' mother said. The Texas Court of Appeals in December granted Villegas a new trial due to ineffective counsel. State District Judge Sam Medrano Jr. set a hearing for next week so the attorneys can tell them what they plan to do next. Villegas' attorney, Joe Spencer said he believes the prosecution 'has no evidence to go on with this case.' The . judge set bond at half of what Spencer had originally suggested. Prosecutors requested bond be set in the hundreds of thousands of . dollars. The district attorney's office declined to comment after the hearing. Villegas left jail in a 1960s red convertible provided by Mimbela. 'We're going to go to church real quick, to pray,' Villegas said. Then, 'it's steak, steak and lobster for my baby,' his mom said. Grave allegations: Villegas has claimed that a detective obtained his confession by force after hitting and threatening him . For Villegas, the chain of events that landed him behind bars goes back to 1993 when four men, including Hernandez, Juan Carlos Medina and murder victims Armando ‘Mando’ Lazo, 18, and Robert England, 17, were walking along Electric Avenue in El Paso, Texas. A car with three people inside pulled up, and one passenger demanded ‘Que Barrio?’ – a slang term which means ‘what gang are you with?’ In response, two of the men ran away, and two others were shot dead in a vacant lot. England suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and died on scene. Lazo was shot once in the abdomen and once in the thigh. His body was found outside a nearby home where he had desperately tried to seek help. Soon after, police investigating the murders focused on Villegas as a suspect. The 16-year-old boy was a high school dropout and a known gang member who had a reputation for telling tall tales in an effort to boost his street cred. Crime scene: Villegas was arrested in 1993 after two men were gunned down in El Paso in what appears to be a gang-related shooting . The teen was arrested in connection with the deadly shootings, and just hours later police got a confession penned in a third-grade level of writing. In the document, Villegas noted that a detective offered him a Coke, and he apologized to the families of the victims. According to Villegas’ team, then-detective Al Marquez used physical violence and threatened the frightened teen into signing the confession, which proved crucial during the trial since investigators had no evidence linking the 16-year-old to the scene of the crime. 'I'm not a saint, but even thought I'm not, you know, I'm not a killer either,' Villegas said in an interview with News Channel 9 in November 2011. The story of a forced confession rang true for Hernandez, who was also questioned following the murders. ‘They tried to do that to me, but I kind of put things together,’ he told Fox News. ‘They pushed him. They had other leads but they just dropped the ball and wanted the easy way out.’ Team effort: Villegas' supporters claim that he had inadequate legal representation during his trial and is innocent . Villegas’ first trial ended in hung jury, but in a second trial that took place in 1995, the panel came back with a guilty verdict, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Freddie Bonilla, the private detective who was hired by Villegas’ distant relative, has revealed that court-appointed attorney John Gates failed in his duties as a counselor, spending only 40 hours preparing for his client’s murder trial. Gates even signed an affidavit admitting that he had not done his best to argue Villegas' case. Family support: Villegas' parents have been fighting to get a retrial for their son where he would have a chance to prove his innocence . Joshua Tepfer, project director at the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth, told FoxNews.com evidence shows the murders were committed by brothers Rudy and Javier Flores, who allegedly told a witness Villegas was in jail for a crime they did. Javier Flores has since died and his surviving sibling is currently serving jail time on drug-related charges.","Daniel Villegas, 35, was convicted in 1995 of gunning down two men in a drive-by shooting .

The cash had been concealed in hidden compartments in eight separate suitcases that were stowed on a flight to Honduras from Toncontin airport in Tegucigalpa.

The money was found in concealed compartments in the eight separate bags, in an attempt to hide it from airport security . Part of the over $7 million haul from the drug money bust at Tocumen international airport, thought to have been headed for a major cartel . Honduran police have said that authorities have suspended dozens of officers during the course of the investigation.

Panamanian police described the suitcase stash bust bust as their biggest in years, with the amount seized being the largest ever.
