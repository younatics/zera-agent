Despite Spain's new King, Felipe VI, being sworn in on Thursday after his father Juan Carlos stepped down last week, the only abdication on the minds of most Spaniards was the one that took place in Rio's Maracana on Wednesday night. La Roja's reign is over. We have spent six years wondering how they managed it; on Thursday they were wondering how they managed to throw it all away. Coach Vicente del Bosque was confused enough following the game to mistakenly try to board the Chile bus. Predictably he led the early polls asking who was to blame. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Vincente Del Bosque get on the wrong bus . Shock: The world champions are out of the 2014 World Cup after two consecutive defeats . Won't need these again: Iker Casillas throws his gloves to fans after a poor display at the Maracana . Head bowed: Vicente Del Bosque got major decisions wrong throughout a dismal campaign for Spain . As Jose Mourinho, who described Spain's football as 'slow, sad and predictable' on his blog, is fond of reminding people when he loses: 'Victory has many fathers - failure only one'. The coach will carry the can and possibly pay with his job. He will not be pushed by the Spanish FA, and has a contract until France 2016, but Del Bosque may decide it is time to walk away. The coach was criticised for not doing enough to renew the team that won the European Championship two years ago; for not spotting the imminent decline. In his defence no-one had done more to bring Diego Costa into the fold and few questioned the 'signing' before the tournament started - only for the Brazilian-born striker to fail to score across 180 minutes. Horror: Casillas has been a walking mistake this tournament and was consoled by Sergio Ramos against Chile . Awful: Brazilian-born Diego Costa has been a huge disappointment for Spain in the first two games . Referring to his move to Chelsea after the game, Costa said: 'My future seems more there (in London) than at Atletico Madrid.' His new supporters will have been decidedly underwhelmed by his World Cup. Del Bosque might also have brought in Real Madrid striker Jese, Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago and departing Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes had they not all been ruled out by injury. Neither was he done any favours by the draw, with no team more desperate to face Spain than 2010's beaten finalists Holland. 'It was good while it lasted' was the headline yesterday in  Diario AS, and many wanted to dwell on the greatest six years in Spanish football. Others mourned the fact that two of their all-time greats had come to such undignified endings - Xavi sat on the bench and Iker Casillas sat helpless in his six-yard box, conceding seven goals in two matches. 'We didn't deserve it to end this way,' said the goalkeeper, while Xabi Alonso, who gave the ball away ahead of the first goal, gave a more brutal assessment when he said: 'We were not able to stay hungry.' Trouble: Fernando Torres looked more threatening than Costa despite struggling for form in recent years . Is that a captain's stance? Casillas looked bemused in the tunnel before going out for the second half . Out on their feet: The Spanish team looked tired in the second half, and were outrun against Chile . Not everyone was in mourning. Some celebrated the fact that €20million in bonuses had been saved.  That was the planned pay-out for landing a second consecutive World Cup which enraged many in a country with 25 per cent unemployment. In Catalonia, some were cruel enough to greet the final whistle with fire-crackers and car horns on Wednesday.  Barcelona immediately leaked news that they had agreed to sign Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo for €12m. The timing seemed opportunistic. Spain's success had always been tied to Barcelona's and there was always a chance that as Barça's star faded so would the national team's. Just as Barcelona fell from grace with a resounding thump - beaten 7-0 on aggregate two seasons ago by Jupp Heynckes' Bayern Munich - so did Spain. Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos led a small group of players who most Spaniards have decided are blameless. It was noted that he was one of the few to applaud Spain's 3,000 travelling supporters at the end of the defeat. Glum: Xavi (centre) could only watch on as his Spain side were utterly humiliated at the Maracana . They can't believe it! Spanish supporters watched on distraught as they were taught a footballing lesson . He will take the captain's armband from Casillas,who will surely now step down. A season spent as Real Madrid's No 2 goalkeeper has taken its toll. The miscontrolled back-pass, the feeble punch back into the crowded penalty area and the hopeless scrambling at the feet of Arjen Robben will be the nightmares he takes home with him. David de Gea's time has come. Optimistic voices were reminding  everyone that Spain remain European Under 21 champions and that players such as De Gea, Koke and Thiago have already stepped up. There is a basis for a new team, but not one that will go eight years without losing two consecutive matches, as this one had. Chile's Alexis Sanchez was gracious in victory saying: 'Nobody has done more than Spain for world football.' The  reality is that in seven days, six years of glory had been washed away. There are 10-year-old boys and girls in Spain who have grown up thinking their team winning was written in the rules. Today they know the truth. Football's crown never stays on one head for long. Six years was a record-breaking reign.","Coach criticised for not doing enough to renew the team that won the European Championship two years ago .

Arsene Wenger did such a good job of turning Cesc Fabregas into an all-action box-to-box Premier League midfielder that he never really fitted back in at Barcelona when he went home in 2011. The 27-year-old is now worth far more to an English club with aspirations of winning the Premier League than he is to Barca, desperate for a replacement for Xavi. Fabregas will replace Frank Lampard with goals and energy in midfield far more effectively than he could replace Xavi as the pass-master of the Catalans' midfield. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cesc sharing his 27th birthday with Barcelona team-mates . On his way? How Cesc Fabregas would look in a Chelsea shirt in our mocked-up image . Frustrated: Cesc Fabregas has found it hard to establish himself as a regular at Barcelona . The Spain star spent eight years at Arsenal where he signed as a 16-year-old and ended up as captain marvel in Wenger’s team. He thrived on the responsibility and the anarchy of so many top flight English games. There was less responsibility given him at the Camp Nou and there are fewer end-to-end encounters to bring out the best in him. A Barca midfielder needs to pick his way through a 10-man defence more than he needs to take advantage of the space that an open game naturally creates. Fabregas never shied away from admitting it was more of a culture shock to go home to Barcelona than it was to move to London at 16. When Barcelona bought him back they did so with the intention of making him the long-term replacement for Xavi but it was difficult to embrace that new role when Xavi’s continued presence in the team meant Fabregas often had to find a place elsewhere with another set of responsibilities. Often in big games, especially in his second season, he did not play at all. Main man: Fabregas found it hard to dislodge Xavi and get into the Barca team . Regular: Andres Iniesta is another main player in the Catalan side's midfield . On his way: Frank Lampard will leave Chelsea after 13 years and countless trophies at Stamford Bridge . ‘If you play one game, the next, and the next but then comes the big game away to Bayern Munich and we are losing 4-0 and you are not even warming up then it gets you down,' he told Sportsmail at the start of the season when asked about the disappointment of missing out on Barca’s 2012-13 Champions League run. ‘It’s all about continuity. It’s more mental than anything else. Everyone knows Xavi and Iniesta are very good. I know what I can do, but sometimes you think, ""Come on, give me a chance boss"".' Last season under Tata Martino it seemed he had become a first-team regular but Martino failed to land a trophy and fans were happy to blame Fabregas. He has always felt harshly judged by supporters who have perhaps never forgiven him for leaving as a teenager. ‘In England, you always have that extra bit of freedom as a player. You know that, if you misplace a pass, the fans are going to support you,’ he said. ‘And, in my case, it was a bit different because the supporters saw in me someone who had been at the club as a kid, left and then returned for a big fee.’ Coming of age: Fabregas grew up as a player and man at Arsenal and eventually became club captain . He has also struggled to come to terms with the demands of supporters sometimes not even happy when they win the league. ‘You win the league with 100 points and finish a record 15 points clear of Real Madrid but some people are not happy’ he said of Barcelona’s last trophy-winning campaign. ‘Barca are not just about winning leagues and lifting trophies. When we played Rayo Vallecano last season and won 4-0 people were not happy because they had slightly more possession than us. It’s incredible, it wasn’t as if we had won 1-0; we scored four!’ Those demands have taken their toll and as much as his heart will be heavy if ultimately he has to leave his boyhood club for the second time, he will know it will only help his career. There were tears from his proud father Francesc the day he was presented back at Barca but the homecoming has not gone to plan and just maybe the truth is the Premier League was where he belonged all along.

Most of England gathered in prayer to help mend David Beckham’s metatarsal in 2002 - now the whole of Colombia is willing star striker Radamel Falcao to make his own miracle recovery from injury. Colombia has been waiting for Falcao’s knee to improve since he damaged ligaments playing for Monaco in a French Cup tie in January. A final decision on whether or not he will go to the World Cup will not be made until Sunday, when the team’s Argentine coach Jose Pekerman finalises his 23-man squad. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Falcao trains with Colombia squad in Buenos Aires . Star man: The whole of Colombia are praying Radamel Falcao will recover from injury in time for the World Cup . Setback: England gathered in prayer back in 2002 after David Beckham broke his metatarsal playing for Manchester United against Deportivo La Coruna in the Champions League following a tackle from Aldo Duscher . Falcao, who scored nine goals in 13 . matches as Colombia finished  second to Argentina in the South American . qualifying group, said: ‘The reaction in Colombia to my recuperation . really made an impact on me. It has reminded me how important I am for . the country. I wouldn’t say it has put more pressure on me. It’s more a . case of an extra motivation - wanting to do things not just for me but . for all the people who willed me to get fit. ‘The closer the World Cup gets, the more I am thinking I don’t want to be just watching in Brazil. I have worked hard to make sure that is not going to be the case but with an injury it’s not just how hard you work, it’s also how patient and calm you can be.’ England fans will continue to watch his recuperation carefully. If Colombia emerge from Group C, which features Greece, Japan and Ivory Coast, they could face Roy Hodgson’s team in the second round. Comeback trail: Falcao has stepped up his recovery and trained with the Colombia squad on Wednesday . Trick shot: Falcao will be wearing the Puma evoSPEED Tricks boots in Brazil . It would be a repeat of the 1998 World Cup group game when Glenn Hoddle’s England brushed aside one of Colombia’s best-ever teams in the Stade Bollaert-Delelis in Lens. ‘I remember watching the England game with my dad,’ said Falcao. ‘Darren Anderton scored and David Beckham scored with a free-kick and we were going home early again. ‘We have paid the price in the past for not being as advanced in many areas of the game as other  countries. That has left us poorly prepared for big tournaments but now, with so many Colombian players playing in big clubs all over the world, that has changed. We have improved our mentality.’ Memory: Falcao remembers watching Beckham score against Colombia at World Cup '98 with his Dad . If his knee stays strong, Falcao could benefit from being sidelined for so long. ‘I don’t come into the tournament with the weight of a long season in my legs so that could be an advantage,’ he said. ‘Providing my knee is fine, the rest of me is well rested and fresh.’ Back of the net: Falcao celebrates scoring a penalty against Chile during World Cup qualifying . To get out of the group Colombia may have to get past the Ivory Coast and one of Falcao’s striking references, Didier Drogba. ‘It’s no surprise that he is still there at the top,’ said Falcao. ‘If you are as professional as he has always been and you look after yourself you extend your career at the top. ‘We have a real chance in this group because it’s even.’ Not that Falcao believes Colombia merit their shorter odds than England going into the tournament. ‘You underestimate yourselves,’ he said. ‘I see England as favourites with Germany and Spain in terms of the European contenders and obviously Argentina and Brazil from South America. I would put England ahead of ourselves in terms of favourites. ‘You have one of the best leagues in the world and it’s extremely competitive, so the players who play in it are elite players. Maybe they would benefit from a little emigration as well, to experience other leagues.’ Falcao shunned the Premier League for a lucrative contract at Monaco last summer, but the 28-year-old says he will end up in England one day. ‘I hope to be playing for many more years in Europe and I want to play in the English league at some time,’ he said. ‘I watch the Premier League and I see how competitive it is and how teams are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition’s goal. The football is very physical; it’s a very interesting league.’ Big-money move: Falcao, who joined Monaco for £51m, says he will end up playing in England one day . Time will tell if it is attractive enough to tempt Falcao; next season he will be playing for Monaco in the Champions League. ‘It is very important to be playing in this competition. I know that people want to see me competing in the Champions League,’ he said. He also understands why people questioned his decision last year to move to a club who average crowds of under 15,000. He scored 52 goals in 67 games for Atletico Madrid but justifies the switch to Monaco, saying: ‘Everyone decides what he wants for his own life. Everyone has to do what they think is best for them. When you are a professional sportsman you always want to win regardless.’ There must have been some regret at witnessing Atletico enjoy such a superb season. No regrets: Falcao says he was overjoyed to see former club Atletico Madrid win La Liga and reach the Champions League final this season . ‘I’m a little bit surprised at just how well they played and I’m overjoyed at what they have achieved,’ he said. ‘Diego Costa had an incredible season. He was decisive when he needed to be in the league. People say we are similar because we played the same position in the same team but they forget we also played together last season. He can play wide when necessary. He prefers to go out wide to look for space, I prefer to stay central.’ Costa looks set to move to Chelsea if Jose Mourinho does not act on his long-standing admiration for Falcao, who believes the magic will remain at Atletico as long as Diego Simeone stays. He was coached first at River Plate and then at Atletico by the manager who Fifa neglected to put in their top 10 coaches last season. ‘I think they forgot him,’ said Falcao. ‘He is one of those coaches who has everything. He knows how to motivate players but it’s a lot more than that. People think it’s all inspiration but there is an awful lot of work done, too. He knows how to analyse the games and he knows where to take advantage of the opposition’s weakness.’ Radamel Falcao will play in the Puma evoSPEED Tricks boot at the World Cup. It's been a while since we've seen Colombia. Where have they been? After success in the 1990s with midfielder Carlos Valderrama and his wonderful hair, Colombia have failed to reach the last three World Cups. They have a colourful past... Colombia were highly fancied for the 1994 World Cup but finished bottom of their group afterAndres Escobar’s own goal. On his return to Colombia, Escobar was shot dead. How did they qualify this time? Impressively. Colombia had the best defensive record in their group. They thrashed Uruguay 4-0 and got as high as third in the world rankings.","Falcao damaged ligaments whilst playing for Monaco in January .

The 33-year-old midfielder was an integral part of Diego Simeone’s side this season but his contract is up and Atletico Madrid feel they already have the next big thing in Spanish football ready to step into his place. Saul Niguez is an under-19 European Champion with Spain and Atletico already have him tied to the club until 2017. Last year they sent him out on loan at Rayo Vallecano but next season he will return to take his place in the centre of midfield ousting Tiago. Moving on: Atletico Madrid midfielder Tiago is set to leave the club on a free transfer next month . London bound? Tiago is keen on a return to Chelsea, where he spent one season under Jose Mourinho in 2004-05 . But the Portuguese midfielder who played for Jose Mourinho in the 2004-05 season could make an emotional return to West London having shown this season he still has plenty to offer. He was in tears when he left Chelsea for Lyon in 2005 for £6.5million having decided, against his coach’s wishes, to look for more regular first team starts elsewhere. 'Mourinho is someone who knows exactly what to say to his players in any given moment. He makes the decisions. He never consults the players because he is the one who takes responsibility; he is the figurehead and it’s a role he plays better than anyone,' said Tiago about his former coach earlier in the season as he prepared to face his old club in the Champions League semi-finals. 'There are a lot of similarities between him and Simeone. In fact in terms of the winning mentality that comes through every day they are not similar they are identical. Bright future: Atletico youngster Saul Niguez has been tipped to step up and replace Tiago next season . Reunion: Tiago would relish the opportunity to work under Jose Mourinho again . 'I had an unforgettable year at Chelsea. My departure was a little bit sad. It was my decision to leave. I felt it was best for me. It was a little bit against what Mourinho and the rest of the team wanted but Gerard Houlier in Lyon wanted me and was ringing me every day telling me to come to Lyon. It was a chance to go somewhere where I would be playing every week.' If Tiago does make a return to Stamford Bridge it could boost the number of Atletico Madrid players arriving at the club this summer to three with Thibaut Courtois likely to return from his loan spell and Diego Costa also wanted by Mourinho. Tiago has no doubts what Chelsea will be getting if they can take Courtois as their number one keeper for the next campaign. He said: 'He’s the best in the world at the moment as far as I’m concerned. He transmits an incredible sense of security to the team. He’s just a kid but you look at him filling the goal and it just puts you at ease.'

Atletico Madrid will fight to keep their best players this summer and hope their allegiance to the team and to their coach Diego Simeone will help ensure they stay. Chelsea loanee Thibaut Courtois spoke as if he wants to stay after the defeat by Real Madrid but it  is largely out of Atletico’s hands. ‘I don’t have an emotional link to Chelsea,’ said Courtois, 22. ‘I have nothing against them.

Leader: The Atletico players are hugely fond of their fiery Argentine manager Diego Simeone . ‘If I have to go back to Chelsea just to play FA Cup and League Cup games, I will have to look for a solution.’ Atletico’s chief executive, Miguel Angel Gil Marin, has meanwhile told striker Diego Costa the club will only sell him if he wants to leave. Gil said: ‘We’ll try and make sure that all of the relevant players stay here. We’ve made a very aggressive approach for Diego to stay and we want to keep this dream going but it all depends on him. ‘Our intention is not to sell anyone unless the player asks to be sold. Because of our run in the Champions League we have the money to mean we don’t have to sell.’ Wanted: Koke (above) and Filipe Luis (below) are also attracting interest from the Premier League . Midfielder Koke and left back Filipe Luis will be other Premier League targets. But Koke’s allegiance to the club he has always supported and Filipe Luis’s loyalty to Simeone could see both stay.

The image of Colombian football is a blur of colour and adventure, combined with the murky underworld of drug cartels and gangland killings. Even James Rodriguez, the World Cup's leading goalscorer, emerged from a shadowy start at Envigado, a club just outside Medellin. Eight years ago, drug trafficker Gustavo Upequi, the owner of Envigado and an influential figure in Rodriguez's early development, was murdered at his home. Here Colombia are trying to move on from their past and show the world that their football has some of the brightest talent in the game. The country's president, Juan Manuel Santos, is flying in for the match and he has declared a  half-day holiday for the country's 48m people. Even English football has an affinity with Colombia's past, from goalkeeper Rene Higuita's famous scorpion kick at Wembley in 1995 to Faustino Asprilla's antics at Newcastle and Carlos Valderrama and that unruly mop of hair. Pekerman's team cruised through the group stages before Rodriguez helped  knock out Uruguay.

Rodriguez, 22, could become the country's most celebrated player. The .

'I've said how much I respect  El Pipe (Valderrama's nickname) because he is our football legend,' admitted Rodriguez. 'He . was my hero as a boy and I wear the No 10 shirt he wore very, very . proudly. To have him say nice things about me is wonderful. 'Carlos . was one of the greatest Colombian footballers who has ever drawn breath. I loved sitting watching him play for us as a kid - every Colombian kid . did. 'If they are comparing me to him at the end of my career, . that's when I will be extremely happy. He has done a lot for our country . and he is a very good guy.

The . stadium is sold out and beating Brazil, for the first time since a 2-0 . group win in the Copa America in 1991, would be something special. That was the Escobar era, when talents such as Higuita, Valderrama and Freddy Rincon were coming to prominence. 'I . was just a young boy and I still remember how excited I was watching .

There will be a big shift in English football next season, with talk of Van Gaal’s formations at United dominating the storyline in the Barclays Premier League. It is an exciting new era for the game. During Holland’s march to the World Cup quarter-final, where they will play Costa Rica, his mind has been whirring away with thoughts about his first season at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United target Vermaealen trains alone in fitness bid . Numbers game: Van Gaal issues tactical instructions from the touchline during Holland's win over Mexico . Watching Holland at this World Cup, it is clear that United have employed a coach who operates with conviction. When he makes changes, as he did when he replaced golden boy Robin van Persie with Klaas-Jan Huntelaar against Mexico, he expects a positive impact. So far at this tournament it has worked. Van Gaal has been studying United’s personnel and he is tempted to make a radical switch to 3-4-3. If he does, it will be a bold move. The idea of a sweeper, a libero at the heart of the defence, has never sat easily with English football. Steve McClaren was the last man to play it with the national team, against Croatia in a Euro 2008 qualifier in Zagreb and it was an unmitigated disaster. It has rarely been seen since. Very few English teams, with the exception of Glenn Hoddle at Swindon and Chelsea, have been able to work out a way of successfully playing the system. Disaster: Wayne Rooney reacts after England are beaten 2-0 by Croatia in October 2006 . Visionary: Glenn Hoddle used a sweeper system while he was player-manager at Chelsea in the 1990s . When Van Gaal trials this formation later this month during United’s pre-season tour to the United States, the new coach intends to broaden the minds of his players. He wants them to become fascinated with tactics and the evolution of a game as it progresses in real time. As Zlatan Ibrahimovic notes in his brilliant autobiography, the Dutch ‘are obsessed with numbers on the pitch - “he’s a 10, he’s a seven, he’s a six, he’s a four’.” It is new territory for United’s players. They will have to adapt, to tune in to his obsession with the ability to make tactical adjustments in order to alter the outcome. This is football for thinkers. Van Gaal has identified his potential back three and much depends on the potential recruitment of Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal. On your bike: Belgium star Thomas Vermaelen is expected to be used as a sweeper if he signs from Arsenal . With the departure of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic after their long and successful United careers, Van Gaal has a blank canvas at the back. Phil Jones, a player Sir Alex Ferguson compared to the great Duncan Edwards in his final season at United, is expected to settle into a designated position in the team. Jonny Evans, a spare part whenever Ferdinand and Vidic weren't fit enough to be paired together, may yet have a tailored role in United’s defence. Van Gaal expects his teams to be flexible and the demands on his players, in training and in matches, will feel fresh and new. In his spare time at the tournament he has been exploring his options with United, deviating from the 4-2-3-1 system that is an established practice in English and European football. Luke Shaw, outstanding for Southampton last season and a member of England’s World Cup squad, has enormous potential on the left. Licence to roam: England full back Luke Shaw will be expected to get forward under Van Gaal . VIDEO Luke Shaw signs for Manchester United . Although he is a naturalised left-back, he is young enough to develop his role in the same way as Gareth Bale. If Van Gaal plays 3-4-3, Shaw will have licence to roam down that left-hand side and he is young enough to do the dog work to get back in time to defend. Tried and tested: Van Gaal lifts the Champions League trophy in 1995 . There will be a whole new look about United next season and the players will be encouraged to gain a greater understanding about their roles on the pitch. These are the principles of the school of science at Ajax, where Van Gaal took their famous young team to Champions League glory in 1995. He intends to transform United, with a new philosophy working its way into their Carrington training centre before the start of the season. Van Gaal wants a ball winner in the . centre of the pitch, a strong-willed character who can feed United’s . forward line when they regain possession. United’s coach is on the lookout for . someone like Nigel de Jong to provide that bite in the centre of the . pitch alongside former Athletic Bilbao midfielder Ander Herrera. It means Michael Carrick, who player who . has always divided opinion, faces a fresh challenge to keep his place in . the United team. The competition will do him some good. There is a big season ahead at United, . particularly for a complex frontline that includes Robin van Persie, . Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Juan Mata, Adnan Januzaj and Javier . Hernandez. Given the proximity of Van Persie’s relationship with his new manager, it seems inconceivable that the striker will be anything other than the main man up front. When Van Gaal arrives for his first day at United, there will be no doubt who is in charge.

Gary Neville took Wayne Rooney to one side for a five minute pep talk after England's final training session on Wednesday night. Rooney was last off the field again after he went through a series of dead ball drills at the end of England's short session at the Arena São Paulo. Before heading down the tunnel, he was stopped by Neville for what appeared to be an intense conversation for about five minutes which involved the England coach miming a few body swerves. Pep talk: Gary Neville spoke with Wayne Rooney for five minutes after training . The Manchester United striker listened intently and nodded in understanding. He has scored 39 international goals but is still waiting for his first in a World Cup tournament. Rooney is expected to start in his favoured No 10 role against Uruguay on Thursday night and is determined to enjoy this World Cup. He has yet to score in the tournament but is determined to succeed. Neville made a number of tactical observations when Rooney, again the last player off the pitch, spoke with him. Neville is convinced Rooney can crack it at this World Cup and the country need a performance from him in this tricky fixture. Sidelined: Rooney was deployed out on the left in Saturday night's defeat by Italy . Gearing up: Rooney stayed late at training on Wednesday to prepare for Uruguay . Asked on Wednesday night about the pressure on Rooney, England boss Roy Hodgson said: 'I am more than satisfied with Rooney's performance with Italy. It's interesting to see he ran more than any other England player, more sprints than any other England player. 'But Wayne, like Steven, and Frank Lampard who hasn't featured yet... they are the players with 100 caps, or 90-odd caps, with World Cups and European experience, so the focus is on them.

I’m very happy that they want me to continue. ‘I think there is an interesting group of players here to work with. I get no feeling that any of them will want me to resign. I have no reason to do so. I have no intention of doing so. I think I’ve stood up to the criticism, to the comments and that’s as much as I can do. ‘The reason I’m staying on is that I’m not a quitter. I believe in this team and that the FA seriously want me to keep doing this job, as do the players, therefore I’ll continue to do it and I’ll try to lead the team to Euro 2016 and try to get some good results.’ Impact: Hodgson also confirmed that psychologist Dr Steve Peters, speaking here with Steven Gerrard, will continue to work with the team going forward . Hodgson confirmed he will take psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters to Euro 2016 if England qualify for the tournament. ‘He’s been very, very good,’ Hodgson added. ‘He hasn’t played a major part in terms of global team talks — what he has done is he’s been very good with individual players.’","Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard will have option to be part-time players in European Championship qualifying campaign .

Anyone with a passing knowledge of England’s head coach Roy Hodgson would describe this genial man as a naturally conservative and cautious manager. He has built a 40-year coaching career off the back of it and you will do well to find anyone with a better working knowledge of the game’s tactics and systems. Whatever blows your hair back. VIDEO Scroll down to watch cheeky young lad tease England players about Italy defeat . Feeling down: England players look dejected as they lose their World Cup opener 2-1 to Italy on Saturday . Feeling the heat: England manager Roy Hodgson (left) looks on from the bench as his side lose to Italy . Hodgson has been in charge of England for 29 games and drawn 10, if you include the lop-sided 0-0 draw with Italy at Euro 2012. England knew who they were appointing when they offered him the top job after Fabio Capello limply walked away two years ago. Based on Hodgson's behavioural patterns over the years, he is not a guy who would instinctively jeopardise his team’s chances in the opening game of a World Cup in Brazil. We are unlikely to be back here in our lifetime and yet, last Saturday, he abandoned the principles that have served him so well and risked it all against Cesare Prandelli’s side. England are playing catch-up. In a varied coaching career, Hodgson is known throughout the world for getting the best out of limited resources. He is a pragmatist - that’s what he does and he does it well. His training ground methodology, which involves endless drills and work on positional play, is legendary among his players. When a mistake is made, it is not unknown for Hodgson to take the ball right back to the very beginning. Repetition built his reputation. These, undoubtedly, are the tools that got him the England job in the first place. In recent times Hodgson succeeded with West Brom and took Fulham on a magical run to the Europa League final against Atletico Madrid. At Liverpool, where the history of the club means the demands are very different, he was sacked after only six months in charge.

For some reason, with a defence that everybody knows is suspect at the very highest level, Hodgson tried to blow Italy away in the opening game. The question is, what possessed him? We now know, after assistant manager Gary Neville’s illuminating interview with 5 Live on Monday evening, that Hodgson abandoned his naturally cautious approach. The reality is that a draw, particularly after Costa Rica’s surprise 3-1 victory over Uruguay earlier in the day, would have done just fine. There was no pressure to beat the four time world champions in the opening game, none at all. His team selection, with Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Danny Welbeck playing just behind the goalscoring threat of Daniel Sturridge, felt like life or death. At one point during the 2-1 defeat in Manaus, Neville turned to England’s goalkeeper coach Dave Watson and compared the strategy to a World Cup quarter-final. It was boom or bust. Neville went on to praise England’s head coach for being bold and brave and introducing the element of risk. The reality is that Hodgson risked it all. On from the start: England's Raheem Sterling (right) controls the ball as Italy's Andrea Pirlo looks on . Side by side: Hodgson (right) and coach Gary Neville stand in the mixed zone after the defeat on Saturday . No-one can remember Hodgson, who is a solid, dependable and reliable man, being quite so gung-ho throughout his entire coaching career. James Milner, who has just won his second Barclays Premier League title with Manchester City, has been completely frozen out. This is a player with pedigree, a recent history of success and a man who finished the season strong with City. Arguably he was Manuel Pellegrini’s best player in the title run-in. After the game on Saturday night, Hodgson spoke of working hard on the training ground ahead of the clash with Uruguay to rectify some defensive frailties. The truth is that there is no time. England’s players were conditioned at their Portugal and Miami training camps during an intensive build up to the tournament. On the sidelines: England's James Milner (centre front) has been completely frozen out by Hodgson . Working hard: England players train on Monday as they prepare for the crunch clash against Uruguay . All set: Uruguay's Luis Suarez trains on Monday ahead of his return to the team . That’s when the hard work, the tactical preparation and organisation, was meant to be done. Here in Brazil it is too late. After a warm down day following a four-hour flight back to Rio from Manaus on Sunday, England’s players were put through a light session on Monday. On Tuesday there was some heavy duty tactical work based on the assumption that Luis Suarez will start alongside Paris Saint-Germain forward Edinson Cavani in the Arena Sao Paulo. Suarez’s presence is another example of Hodgson deviating from an accepted practice under intense, sometimes intolerable tournament pressures. On a whiteboard after England drew with Honduras at the Sun Life Stadium in Miami, the players were told not to talk about individual Italian players, namely Andrea Pirlo. They followed their instructions. A few days later, when Hodgson appeared drained in the mixed zone at the Arena Amazonia, he was asked whether Suarez was a genuine world class player. Hodgson responded by challenging the Liverpool striker to prove it, which can only have increased the Uruguayan’s motivation when he faces five of his club team-mates on Thursday. England cannot afford to lose this game and Hodgson knows that he has put himself in a tight spot at this tournament. Finding a way out of it will be some achievement.","Hodgson a naturally conservative and cautious manager .

Managers: Nigel Pearson (Leicester), Roberto Martinez (Everton) Head-to-head league record: Leicester wins 30, draws 30, Everton wins 36 . Team news . Leicester . Jamie Vardy and Marc Albrighton are injury doubts for Leicester ahead of their Barclays Premier League return against Everton at the King Power Stadium. Striker Vardy, who scored 16 goals last season to help the Foxes clinch the Championship title and end the club's decade-long absence from the top flight, has a thigh strain while midfielder Albrighton, a summer arrival from Aston Villa, is nursing a groin problem. Looking down: Marc Albrighton, who joined from Aston Villa in the summer, is nursing a groin problem . Anthony Knockaert has had an ankle injury recently but the French winger is expected to be fit while Matt Upson's ankle injury will rule him out.

Everton . Everton manager Roberto Martinez will make late decisions on the fitness of Seamus Coleman, Kevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku ahead of their Premier League opener at Leicester. Right-back Coleman sustained a hamstring injury in a friendly against Tranmere at the end of July while forwards Mirallas and Lukaku are a couple of weeks behind the rest of the squad in terms of overall fitness having returned to pre-season later after the World Cup. Just short of fitness: Romelu Lukaku (centre) stated pre-season training late for Everton following Brazil 2014 . Striker Arouna Kone, out since October with a knee injury, will not be fit for another month. Provisional squad: Howard, Coleman, Distin, Jagielka, Baines, Barry, McCarthy, Osman, Pienaar, Barkley, Lukaku, Robles, Hibbert, Stones, Alcaraz, Gibson, Besic, McGeady, Naismith, Atsu. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) The Foxes have won none of their last five fixtures on the opening weekend of the Premier League (D3 L2). Not since the opening game of the 2009/10 Premier League season has Roberto Martinez enjoyed a victory on the first weekend, drawing two and losing two since then with Everton and Wigan. Everton are unbeaten in their last nine Premier League clashes with the Foxes, although they have won just two of those games (D7). 11 of the 16 Premier League games between Everton and Leicester have been drawn (69 per cent) making it the highest percentage of draws in Premier League history of any fixture that has been played more than 10 times. Bad tempered: The last clash between Leicester and Everton resulted in Duncan Ferguson (right) being sent off for the Toffees after grappling Steffen Freund's neck during a 1-1 draw in March 2004 . Everton have lost three of their last five Premier League games (W2 L3). It’s been over three years since Romelu Lukaku scored a competitive goal for a club that owned him (August 5th 2011 for Anderlecht). Leicester City won more games (17) and points (55) at home than any other side in the 2013-14 Championship. David Nugent has averaged a goal every 399 mins in the Premier League (nine goals in 64 apps), a significantly slower rate than he has managed in the second tier (a goal every 217 mins). Leighton Baines (49) and Seamus Coleman (45) created more goalscoring chances than any other defenders in the Premier League last season. The Foxes scored the most goals (52) and conceded the fewest number of goals (15) in the second half of games in the Championship last season.","Everton to consider fitness of Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas .

"By . Neil Ashton . Follow @@neilashton_ . The day of reckoning has arrived for Wayne Rooney with England facing Uruguay here in a World Cup game they must win. With . Rooney set to move into his favoured central position after his . unsatisfactory role on the left against Italy, he must deliver the goals . which Roy Hodgson’s team desperately need. Uruguay . were defensively woeful in their opening defeat by Costa Rica and have . been weakened by the absence tonight of the suspended Maxi Pereira and . the injury to captain Diego Lugano. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Steven Gerrard say England will go on the attack again . Support: England boss Roy Hodgson has kept faith with Wayne Rooney for crucial game . Rooney, who has 39 goals for England, almost as many as the total number of goals scored by the rest of the expected starting XI, must repay Hodgson’s faith in him and fire England towards the knockout stage. The pressure is clearly on him yet a few weeks ago, when Rooney was training in Portugal with his England team-mates, he seemed determined to enjoy the World Cup. He was relaxed and refreshed after spending a few days working with England’s fitness coaches in the build-up to the tournament. This evening, when he takes to the field at the Arena de Sao Paulo in his No 10 shirt, the England forward will face further scrutiny. It will be that way until he scores his first goal at a World Cup. The Uruguay game will be his 10th attempt to get off the mark at this level. Under pressure: England striker Wayne Rooney must break his World Cup goal jinx . VIDEO Tubes: Uruguay v England - fan predictions . At the age of 28, he also declared on the . eve of the tournament that this was the last chance to ‘get the best . out of me’ at a World Cup. Every England fan wants him to score, to . retrace the magical steps that turned him into one of the world’s most . feared strikers when he first played for the national team. At Euro . 2004 he scored four times before he was forced off against Portugal . through injury in the quarter-final. During England’s World Cup . qualifiers, Rooney was always played in a central role. He responded . with seven goals. ‘He’s been our top scorer for the past two years and he has more goals and assists than anyone else,’ said Hodgson yesterday. Influence: Rooney set up Daniel Sturridge for England's goal against Italy on Saturday . ‘Were . it not for his wonderful header against Poland in the qualifiers we . might not even be here. We’ve got a clear perspective as to what Wayne . is and what Wayne can do. When you start talking about one man it’s not . healthy.He’s got broad shoulders and I think he will do well at the . tournament. Unfortunately, he just has to accept that it often happens . at a World Cup. At the moment he’s getting a lot of  support from those . around him.’ Against Italy on Saturday he was stuck out on the left . and asked to track back to help left back Leighton Baines. He provided . the assist for Daniel Sturridge’s first World Cup goal, clipping the . ball into the penalty area for the striker to score. That contribution, typical of Rooney’s selfless attitude, was largely overlooked in the analysis of his display against Italy. There were other areas, particularly in defence, that will have been of more pressing concern to the head coach. Rooney did more running than any other England player and seems to have done enough to satisfy Hodgson. Focused: Wayne Rooney during training for Thursday's crunch clash against Uruguay . ‘We’re . very happy with what the team did and Wayne worked very hard like the . rest of the team but we didn’t  discuss, even in the coaches’ debrief, . the individual players.’ Although it wasn’t vintage Rooney, he still has the ability to turn games in England’s favour.Yesterday, captain Steven Gerrard revealed that the attention is beginning to eat away at Rooney. ‘He is slightly frustrated being the centre of attention and everyone  talking about his position,’ admitted Gerrard. ‘In . training he has been fine and looking to the match. For me, against . Italy he had a big say in the match with an assist and I thought he did . exactly what the manager had asked him to do. On the ball: Rooney and Raheem Sterling during training at the Arena Corinthians in Sao Paulo on Wednesday . ‘For all the players it . is  frustrating that one player is getting spoken about more than . anyone else because we are all sticking together and trying to fight for . the same thing.’ Rooney has certainly been working hard and Gary . Neville, England’s assistant manager, wasn’t exaggerating when he told . BBC Radio 5 Live that he has to be dragged off the training pitches. On Tuesday, Rooney was restored to his favoured central position during an intensive 90-minute training session. The . signs are that he will operate behind Sturridge this evening. If that . is the case, Rooney will have got his way — forcing Hodgson’s hand for a . match that England must win.","Rooney did more running than any other England player against Italy .

"By . Pa Reporter . Defender Eric Abidal has followed Franck Ribery in announcing his retirement from the France national team. The 34-year-old, who this summer joined Olympiacos from Monaco, revealed his decision in an interview with Catalan radio station RAC1. Abidal recovered sufficiently from a liver transplant in April 2012 to return to the national team under coach Didier Deschamps but was not selected for this summer's World Cup. End of an era: Eric Abidal has closed the door on his international career with France . 'It is time to close this door,' he said. 'Not being at the World Cup was a disappointment because I wanted to finish on a good note. 'The way I struggled as I did until today (after the transplant) was so I could say goodbye to the national team at the World Cup. But that did not happen.' His announcement comes just a day after Bayern Munich winger Ribery - who missed the tournament in Brazil due to injury - confirmed the end of his international career, while Manchester City's Samir Nasri has indicated his international career could be over after his omission. New chapter: Abidal will be looking forward to continuing to get his career back on track after illness . Abidal has also represented Barcelona, Lyon and Lille in his 15-year professional career. He won 67 France caps dating back to his debut against Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2004 and was a regular feature of the side which reached the 2006 World Cup final. However, he was sent off in the first half of the Euro 2008 clash with Italy and also played a part in the dismal World Cup campaign of 2010. His final international appearance came in the World Cup qualifying play-off first leg against Ukraine last November. France lost that game 2-0 before winning the return leg 3-0 to qualify for the tournament.","Abidal has followed in the footsteps of Franck Ribery in calling time on his international career with France .

"By . Pa Reporter . Former World Cup winner Bradley Dredge produced a brilliant finish to take command of the inaugural Made in Denmark event at the halfway stage on Friday. Dredge has won twice on the European Tour - he shot a round of 60 on his way to victory in Madeira in 2003 - and partnered Stephen Dodd to victory for Wales in 2005, but has been hampered by illness and injury recently. The 41-year-old is playing on a medical exemption this season, but added a 68 to his opening 66 at Himmerland Resort & Spa thanks to four birdies in his last six holes. Enter the dragon: Welshman Bradley Dredge leads the Made in Denmark event after two rounds . At eight under par, Dredge led by four shots from England's Simon Wakefield, with Danish pair Thomas Bjorn and Thorbjorn Olesen another shot back alongside Scotland's David Drysdale and former Amateur champion Garrick Porteous. Bjorn was frustrated at following his opening 66 with a 73, the 43-year-old feeling players did not have enough notice of play resuming after a one-hour delay caused by the threat of lightning. 'It was down to fatigue a little bit, playing seven out of eight weeks,' said Bjorn, who is looking to make certain of his Ryder Cup place on home soil. 'The brain wasn't quite with it today. You have to just take it for what it is. I'm still in the golf tournament and I have to work from here. 'The delay shouldn't affect you, (but) I thought we were a bit quick to come back on though. You are sitting in the players' lounge and you get half an hour to restart and you are on the eighth tee, which is in a different county in this resort. Rolling back the years: Bradley Dredge has not won European Tour event since 2005 . 'I thought it was a bit quick so we got stressed about that. I had a bad drive on nine, but it was mostly down to putting today, which you can't blame that on the delay. You need to hole putts to be in contention and I couldn't do that today. If I can get it working and stay patient then it is still a good opportunity.' Wakefield is ranked 611th in the world and has yet to win a European Tour title in 333 attempts, but the 40-year-old carded a second round of 67 as playing partner and world number 1,160 Garrick Porteous returned a 68. 'I was on holiday last week and on Sunday I tinkered with the driver, which was silly as it is probably the strongest club in my bag,' said Wakefield, who lost his card at the end of last season, but regained it via the qualifying school. 'I changed the settings on it and on the 15th tee on Thursday I realised the settings were wrong, so when I got in I changed it and obviously drove it a lot better today. Testing times: Thomas Bjorn was frustrated after hitting a 73 as he chases a Ryder Cup place . 'I feel like I've played well this season. I missed (the cut) in Munich by one, French (Open) by one and the others by three. So I feel like my game is there. The last two weeks off were what I needed to recharge the batteries. I certainly needed that.' Massive crowds followed Olesen's group in the morning before switching their attention to Bjorn and the home players appreciated the excellent support. 'It's like playing a major championship out here, I've never seen anything like it,' Olesen said. 'It's just incredible and gave me a big boost. I just tried to keep on going and it was a great feeling to be out there in front of those crowds. 'Before the tournament I definitely felt a bit more pressure, but I try to deal with it in the best way and play my best golf. You feel pressure, but you also get that extra boost and confidence.' Try and try again: Englishman Simon Wakefield has not won a European Tour event in 333 attempts . Dredge said: 'I managed to play the back nine quite well and a birdie on the last is always nice. I'm delighted with the way I played. The wind wasn't quite as strong and in a slightly different direction and luckily I managed to make some putts. The chip in on 16 was nice and I think I took the chances when I had them. 'If someone had said I'll give you a four-shot lead after 36 holes you would take it. We're halfway through the tournament and I've been in similar positions to this before. I know a lot can happen and I've got to play really well over the weekend. 'There are some really good players chasing me so I have to keep playing the way I have been and convert the chances I get. Local lad: Thorbjorn Olesen claims home crowds made it feel like playing in a major . 'I feel as though the European Tour events I'm playing in this year are like majors to me, with my situation. I know that when I come out here I have to play well and perform. I don't know if that is added pressure, but it is certainly added motivation. 'I feel very motivated when I come out and play and I'm looking forward to this weekend. It will be a challenge.

The 36-year-old, who played for Belgium at the World Cup in Brazil, was released by Bayern Munich at the end of last season but, despite attracting interest from Brussels club Anderlecht, he has decided to call time on his career. In an open letter published in Belgian newspaper La Derniere Heure, he wrote: 'Important decisions are often difficult to make. I have realised that over recent days. And reason often trumps emotion. Calling time: Daniel Van Buyten wanted to play for Belgium at the World Cup before retiring . 'My final goal was to play at the World Cup and to give something back to my country. 'Since January I worked hard and prepared for the big event with the utmost professionalism. My body has certainly suffered for it. 'I was honoured when various proposals arrived while I was in Brazil. In particular, Anderlecht's efforts touched me deeply. 'But those who know me well know that when I engage in a project, I do so at 100 per cent. I have tried over the past few weeks but my body tells me it's impossible. I don't want to disappoint a club like Anderlecht and its supporters. German engineering: Daniel Van Buyten (2L) was released after a successful spell with Bayern Munich . 'That is why I have reluctantly decided to decline Anderlecht's offer. A new life begins for me and I want to spend more time with my wife, my children, and the people I love.' Van Buyten's senior career began at Charleroi in 1998 and, after spending two years with Standard Liege, he signed for Marseille in 2001. He moved to Premier League club City on loan in January 2004, making five league appearances before returning to Marseille briefly ahead of his switch to the Bundesliga with Hamburg. Fleeting visit: The Belgian defender made five appearances for Manchester City in 2004 . In 2006 he joined Bayern and, across his eight years in Munich, won the German championship four times and the Champions League in 2013.

"By . Pa Reporter . West Brom captain Chris Brunt has signed a new three-year contract with the Barclays Premier League club. Earlier this summer, the Baggies had activated a 12-month option on the 29-year-old midfielder's previous contract, but he has now agreed improved terms until 2017. Albion head coach Alan Irvine said: 'I'm delighted we have extended Chris' contract by a further two years. Star man: Brunt has been an inspirational leader since taking the armband in 2010, serving four managers . Up for the challenge: The midfielder has extended his stay at the club by two years with improved terms . 'He's our captain, has great quality and experience and is clearly a very, very important player for us. 'Chris is an influential figure both on and off the pitch. He has the respect of all the players and staff and is a top class professional.'

The Eredivisie club claim they have not received 30 per cent of Vorm's transfer fee, which they allege was part of a sell-on agreement between them and the Swans when he moved to Wales for £1.5million in 2011. Fair: Swansea state Michel Vorm's move to Tottenham was 'conducted correctly under Premier League rules' Dutch international Vorm, who was a member of Holland's squad at this summer's World Cup in Brazil, moved to White Hart Lane last month for what Swansea described as an undisclosed fee.

Birmingham: Randolph, Eardley, Hall, Grounds, Robinson, Shinnie, Edgar, Gleeson, Thomas, Novak, Gray. Subs: Gunning, Duffy, Donaldson, Cotterill, Doyle, Brown, Caddis. Referee: Graham Salisbury (Lancashire) A new-look Birmingham, bolstered by 14 summer recruits having dramatically avoided relegation on goal difference in May, entered the game brimming with confidence after winning all five of their pre-season fixtures. But Lee Clark's men were found wanting versus better opposition, their woes best summed up towards the end of the first half when Ayala was left unmarked in the area to head his side into the lead. It was an advantage Middlesbrough never looked like relinquishing, with Kike capping a fine debut when finishing coolly midway through the second period. The game began in inauspicious fashion for the hosts as Ben Gibson suffered an injury inside 30 seconds and was forced off. Kenneth Omeruo, the returning Chelsea loanee deemed too unfit to start following his participation in the World Cup for Nigeria, deputised. Undeterred, Boro pressed forward with confidence and Lee Tomlin sent a fizzing volley just over the crossbar. Birmingham were suddenly camped inside their own area, Karanka's men again going close as Tomlin's through-ball fed immediate fan favourite Kike - whose first-time effort just missed the target. The Blues continued to defend resolutely, although Tomlin again nearly unlocked the door when striking narrowly wide. Pulling away: George Friend clashes with Demarai Gray during a deserved victory for the hosts . Middlesbrough finally got a reward for their efforts in the 33rd minute, however, as Darren Randolph failed to keep out Ayala's powerful header from Grant Leadbitter's corner. Not content with one, Boro continued to press forward and almost doubled their advantage when Albert Adomah hit straight at the onrushing Randolph just after half-time. The goalkeeper had to be on high alert again moments later, parrying George Friend's header wide as Birmingham almost paid the price for further dreadful set-piece defending. Suddenly awakened, the visitors began to put together some attacks of their own. Yet they looked vulnerable to the counter, too, as the increasingly-influential Kike played through Adomah - who failed to beat Randolph from close range for the second time. Kike would have no such problems when his chance came, slotting a controlled volley into the corner after Tomlin's initial effort had been blocked. The Spaniard later missed a golden opportunity to add another following a brilliantly worked set-piece with Tomlin, although few in attendance were holding that against him when the full-time whistle sounded.","Daniel Ayala puts home side 1-0 up in first half .

"By . Pa Reporter . Ronny Deila admits Celtic's dramatic reinstatement in the Champions League despite losing 6-1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw in the third qualifying round has left him feeling 'very strange.' UEFA awarded the Scottish champions a default 3-0 win in the second leg of the tie after it was discovered that the Polish club, managed by Deila's fellow Norwegian Henning Berg, fielded substitute Bartosz Bereszynski near the end of the 2-0 second-leg win at Murrayfield on Wednesday night while he was supposed to be suspended. Consequently, Celtic went through on away goals after a 4-4 draw and were drawn against Slovenian side Maribor in the Champions League play-off. Mixed emotion: Celtic boss Ronny Delia has described their Champions League reinstatement as 'strange' Down and out? Celtic were thumped 6-1 on aggregate by Polish outfit Legia Warsaw . Speaking at the club's Lennoxtown training complex Deila said: 'It is very strange, I have to say that. 'First of all I feel very sorry for Legia, and my friends from Norway there. 'It is tough to think of that and now we are in the Champions League. 'That is what UEFA said, we haven't been involved in anything. 'I am a football manager and I have to go with it and now we are preparing for Maribor.' Suspended: Defender Bartosz Bereszynski came of for the final few minutes of Celtic's defeat . Deila confirmed he had not spoken to Berg but he swerved a question about him possibly feeling embarrassed by the extraordinary circumstances in which his side were handed a reprieve. The former Stromsgodset manager said: 'Legia played well against us, they put in good performances but this is nothing to do with Celtic. It is about UEFA. 'It is not my business. It is a club thing and a UEFA thing.' The Hoops boss also claimed that it was difficult to consider UEFA's decision as another opportunity for the Parkhead side to make the group stages of the competition. 'It is very hard to think of that today because it is a tough decision and I really feel sorry for Legia,' he said. 'But we have to go into the game and prepare for Maribor. 'The players want to play in the Champions League. It looks like we have been given another chance and I think it will be no problem to get the players up for the game.' Deila did concede that the continuing possibility of Champions League football could be influential in recruiting new players to Celtic and keeping those who might be thinking of leaving. On the move? Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster (right) has been linked with a transfer to Southampton . So far, only former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Craig Gordon has been signed and Jo Inge Berget has arrived on a six-month loan deal from Cardiff City, while many are expecting keeper Fraser Forster to depart, with Southampton heavily linked with the England international. 'We are working really hard now to get players in for the next stage, 'said the Parkhead manager.

The 26-year-old Holland international endured a miserable debut campaign at Carrow Road after his club-record transfer from Sporting Lisbon, scoring just once in 27 appearances.

"By . Hamish Mackay . Follow @@H_Mackay . Norwich manager Neil Adams has backed his squad to illustrate why they are one of the promotion favourites. The Canaries begin life back in the Championship with a trip to Wolves - last season's League One champions - on Sunday. Adams was handed the Carrow Road post on a permanent basis this summer which brought a mixed reaction from the fans. However, his vow to play flowing, attacking football certainly raised his stock following many monotonous displays under previous boss Chris Hughton. With playmaker Wes Hoolahan signing a new two-year contract this week and the summer captures of Lewis Grabban and Kyle Lafferty, goals should not be in short supply, unlike last season. Performance: Neil Adams said Norwich's performances must live up to people's expectations this season . So far only Robert Snodgrass (Hull) and Ricky van Wolfswinkel (on loan to Saint Etienne) have departed, with Leroy Fer - who will be absent at Molineux following his World Cup exploits with Holland - still being heavily linked with a move. Adams told the club's official website: 'We can't stop people tipping us to go back up but we have to make sure we go and perform. We have to show people we are as good as they think. 'We have to be ready to handle that along with the other two relegated teams because no one is just going to let us go back up, that is for sure. Wolves are not going to roll over and let us do what we want to do. Disappointment: Ricky van Wolfswinkel signed for the club for close to £10m but has been loaned to St. Etienne . 'We have a good core group who are capable of competing really well in this division. The key thing for us is you respect the opposition but they have to respect us equally because we are going to be positive in every game to try and get as many points and victories as possible. 'To do well in this division you need to score goals but of course that doesn't mean you throw caution to the wind and risk losing games before you have a foothold. 'You have to get the balance with the emphasis on attacking, scoring goals and dominating the ball. But you have to be ready to defend as and when because we will be tested. 'Wolves are a good side, well organised, they have a style of play and a philosophy that suits them. It will be a tough game but I am anticipating 46 tough ones.' Wolves: Norwich's opposition on the first day of the season will be League One champions Wolves . Opposite number Kenny Jackett admits an opening-day clash with one of relegated teams from the top-flight is an ideal test for his Wolves side. He told his club's official website: 'It is a terrific opening game, live on TV and because of what has happened to the clubs in recent seasons and now seeing where they are in this new season and what standard they are at. 'These are the games we want. We want to be in these games, testing ourselves - and we do early on. We've got some really good games.'

"By . Press Association Reporter . Striker Callum Wilson scored twice on his debut and midfielder Marc Pugh after just 24 seconds as Bournemouth got their season off to the perfect start with a 4-0 rout of Huddersfield. Wilson, a £3million buy from hometown club Coventry, first barged Town's Joel Lynch out of the way and coolly netted after 32 minutes. The 22-year-old played on as Huddersfield tried to claim a foul by the right touchline before cutting inside and drilling low past keeper Alex Smithies. Wilson's second goal, from a Pugh cross, saw a weak close-range shot after 64 minutes squirm under Smithies. Between Wilson's two strikes Yann Kermorgant had scored in what was already a miserable afternoon for Terriers fans. Wilson joined the Cherries as a replacement for star striker Lewis Grabban, who was sold to Norwich in the summer. His second goal prompted a walk-out by some home fans, who booed and chanted 'you don't know what you're doing' at boss Mark Robins during a woeful display. WATCH Scroll down for 'Mark Robins on his delight at signing Conor Coady, just days ago' Clinical: Callum Wilson makes it a debut to remember with his second and his team's fourth in the 4-0 rout . Wilson even fluffed the chance of a hat-trick when he missed a penalty on 76 minutes after Smithies brought him down. Lynch left Smithies in trouble with a poor back header and the keeper caught Wilson in the box with his trailing leg. Huddersfield: Smithies, Lynch, Peltier (c), Crooks; Dixon, Hogg (Coady, 69), Majewski ( Lolley, 57), Norwood,  Hammill (Scannell, 46); Ward, Wells. Bournemouth: Camp, Francis, Cook, Elphick, Daniels, Ritchie, Arter, O'Kane, Pugh (Stanislas 90), Kermorgant (Rantie 81), Wilson (Gosling 81). Goals: Pugh 1, Wilson 32 & 64, Kermorgant 50 . Att:  12,371 . Smithies was booked for the foul but redeemed himself by diving to his left to hold on to Wilson's tame spot-kick. Bournemouth, beaten 5-1 by Huddersfield a year ago, made an electric start to the season when Pugh struck before the season was one minute old. Charlie Daniels put Matt Ritchie in down the right and his cross was first controlled and then dispatched past Smithies by Pugh with two touches from close range. Slick Bournemouth, whose team featured three of the same back four humiliated a year ago, never looked back. Wilson took his two goals and in between Kermorgant had made it 3-0 on 50 minutes. Smithies parried a headed from Pugh but Kermorgant lashed in the rebound from close range. Huddersfield's only had two real chances in the game. The first came on 39 minutes when Oliver Norwood rattled the bar from 35 yards from Jonathan Hogg's pass. The second came from home debutant Matt Crooks, a 20-year-old academy product, who forced keeper Lee Camp to tip over a header from a Norwood corner on 62 minutes. Other than that Huddersfield, who played an unfamiliar 3-4-1-2 formation, were hardly in the game. In fact it could have been worse for the Terriers. Ritchie twice went close early in the game and then nearly scored with a spectacular 75-yard lob on 41 minutes after a mistake by Smithies.","Bournemouth had an emphatic start to the season beating Huddersfield 4-0 .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Derby took the first step towards easing the pain of their play-off final defeat to QPR with a hard-earned victory over Sky Bet Championship newcomers Rotherham at the iPro Stadium. The Millers were looking good value for a point until a quality finish from Republic of Ireland midfielder Jeff Hendrick floored them eight minutes from the end, although they twice went close to equalising in stoppage time. Derby went into the game with nine of the team that started the opening game of last season and one of those men, Johnny Russell, made a surging run in the first 30 seconds that took him into the Rotherham penalty area before the ball was scrabbled clear. Leaving it late: Derby County's Jeff Hendrick (right) celebrates after scoring the winning goal . Hot shot: Derby County's Will Hughes takes control in the opening match at the iPro Stadium . Derby: Grant, Christie, Keogh, Buxton, Forsyth, Bryson, Hughes (Mascarell 53), Hendrick, Dawkins (Best 79), Martin, Russell (Ward 64). Subs Not Used: Eustace, Whitbread, Sammon, Roos. Goals: Hendrick 82. Rotherham: Collin, Broadfoot, Morgan, Arnason, Skarz, Agard, Frecklington, Green, Pringle, Revell (Bowery 58), Derbyshire (Swift 70). Subs Not Used: Loach, Brindley, Wood, Hall, Tidser. Booked: Skarz. Att: 30,105 . Ref: Kevin Friend (Leicestershire). Rotherham were struggling to cope with Derby's passing and movement and they were opened up again in the 16th minute when Craig Forsyth made a powerful run down the left but his cross just evaded Chris Martin. But Derby were given a warning a minute later when a free kick from the left dropped invitingly to Kieran Agard 12 yards out and his shot on the turn was blocked by one of the home side's new signings Cyrus Christie. Former Derby midfielder Paul Green shot wide from the edge of the box in the 21st minute but Simon Dawkins had a 20-yard drive deflected just past a post three minutes later. It needed a brilliant reaction save by Adam Collin in the 26th minute to keep out Russell's close-range header. Rotherham went close five minutes later when a Ben Pringle corner was met by a diving header from Karl Arnason, but the ball was cleared off the line by Will Hughes. The visitors had come back into the game but Derby started the second half strongly with Christie fizzing the ball across the six-yard box with no white shirt able to apply a touch. The home fans got their first sight of Real Madrid's on-loan midfielder Omar Mascarell when he replaced Hughes in the 53rd minute. Heated: Tempers flare between Rotherham Paul Green (left) and Derby's Richard Keogh . Rotherham made their first change when Jordan Bowery replaced Alex Revell in the 57th minute but it was Matt Derbyshire who had the chance to open the scoring when Pringle crossed from the left, but he headed wide from eight yards. Some of the fluency had gone from Derby's game but an excellent pass from Mascarell released Christie down the right and his cross was bundled away before Martin could pounce. But Derby finally broke Rotherham's resistance in the 82nd minute when they broke up the right and Christie played the ball inside to Hendrick, who swept a first time shot into the top-left corner from just inside the area. Rotherham felt Pringle had been fouled by Christie but they responded impressively and Green had a header saved by Lee Grant in stoppage time before Agard's shot was cleared off the line by Forsyth.

Done and dusted: Froch saw off rival George Groves in their re-match with an emphatic knock out . Champion: Froch could fight DeGale or Julio Cesar Chavez in his next fight . Domestic dust up: Froch and DeGale could fight later this year or early next . DeGale, 28, earned his right to fight Froch with an impressive stoppage of Brandon Gonzalez on the undercard at the national stadium. The Nottingham Cobra is obligated to fight his countryman by February or relinquish his IBF belt. DeGale, the 2008 Olympic champion, has battled back from a contentious defeat to former gym-mate Groves in 2011. And Froch told Sky Sports: 'James DeGale is mandatory for the IBF title but I've just had two mandatory defences. 'But everyone knows I don't shy away from any fight. 'We've got to sit down with Eddie Hearn but there's no reason why this fight can't happen.' Froch's preferred option is a Las Vegas superfight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr but Hearn revealed in his Sportsmail column last week that negotiations have stalled. 'I have had exploratory conversations with Bob Arum who would like the fight to happen in October so we will see how that plays out,' he added. 'I think DeGale would be a huge fight. It is a domestic fight between a legend of the sport and an Olympic champion who is looking to make history and become the first British gold medalist to go on and win a world title. 'I think that a fight with Carl and James could be made either this winter, in November or December, or possibly in the Spring. 'It is all in Carl’s court but what I do know about him is that he will not willingly vacate a title. He worked hard for his titles, he won’t just give them up.' Next up?

Bellew faces the big-hitting Brazilian in his second fight at cruiserweight, with bitter rival Cleverly clashing with Alejandro Valori on the same bill also in his second bout at 200lbs. Should the two prevail, they are set for an explosive rematch later this year. Scroll down for video... Stepping stone: Tony Bellew (R) wants to set up a rematch to retire Nathan Cleverly (L) Bellew said: ‘It will happen and when it does happen I am going to retire him. Whether it be this year, next year or whenever, I will retire him. ‘I need to focus on Saturday’s fight and not give him a second thought. In the back of my mind the carrot is being dangled in front of me and when this fight is over he will be on my mind, but for now it is all about Dos Santos and getting the job done. ‘When his time comes he will understand and he will know what is coming. ‘When I get in the ring with him I am not losing two stone, I am not killing myself to do the weight, and he is going to know that. ‘It doesn’t need a World title. It is personal. The fight does absolutely nothing for my ranking because he is ranked below me. I will be fighting him purely for personal reasons, because I want to get rid of him. It is personal and that is the only reason I will fight him. ‘I am all about becoming world champion . but I will be fighting him to purely please a personal satisfaction. I . believe I won the first fight, but I didn’t officially get the decision. I am pretty confident I will get it next time – I won’t need decisions, . referees or judges. I will just need a pair of gloves and him in a . ring, and I will do the rest of the job.’ Boy from Brazil: Tony Bellew must first defeat Julio Cesar Dos Santos (L) in his second fight at cruiserweight . Dos Santos brings an ominous looking record of 23 KOs from 26 wins to Merseyside, and Bellew insists the carrot of a clash with Cleverly has not distracted him from a tough second task at a weight he is still settling in to. ‘I am going in with a top class cruiserweight in Dos Santos who gives out good tests,’ he added. ‘I expect an extremely durable fighter, somebody who is maybe a bit stronger physically than me, but I am pretty confident he will get a shock when I hit him for the first time. ‘Everyone goes the same way, they look at me across the ring and they think tall, skinny, he isn’t going to be able to punch much. I hit them for the first time and just look at their face when I nail them clean, they have been hit with something they haven’t been hit with before. It was the exact same with [Valery] Brudov. When I hit these guys, they think twice about coming in. Fight night: Nathan Cleverly, with promoter Eddie Hearns (C), meets Alejandro Valori on the same bill . ‘I have nothing but respect for Valori and I am sure he will go on to give people some tough tests but he came up against the new me – a huge-punching cruiserweight. ‘I didn’t have that kind of power at light heavyweight, and if I threw more than three or four power shots in a round at I would be tiring, so I had to limit myself to how many power shots I could throw and also to what I was taking back. ‘I couldn’t take many risks at because my durability just wasn’t there, I couldn’t sustain any punishment and I was feeling every single punch.

A preliminary investigation shows that she either had a heart attack or fell into the water, WWJ reported. Scroll down for video . Cars were stranded along a flooded stretch of Interstate 696 near Detroit on Tuesday morning. Police divers had to search for people trapped inside their vehicles . Her death was the second blamed on storms that dumped 5.2 inches of rain on Warren on Monday. A 30-year-old woman suffered seizures and died after her vehicle became trapped in high water. Roughly 1,000 vehicles had been abandoned in floodwaters in the suburb where many roads were closed. 'This is going to go down as the great flood of 2014,' Fouts said. Fearing more drivers could become stranded after a storm dumped more than 6 inches of rain in some places in and around Detroit, the state warned commuters against driving in affected areas Tuesday morning.

On her way home, Gatewood's Jeep stalled on a flooded entrance ramp to Interstate 696 and she had to swim to safety. 'I've never seen anything like this,' the 27-year-old said.

In a horrific case of animal cruelty four months ago, Colin, a Staffordshire bull terrier, was scalded, left in ‘burning agony’ and dumped in a canal in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. His skin and fur were completely burnt off his neck and back in the attack which rescuers believe could have been done with hot water or oil. But the seven-year-old’s life has been turned around, thanks to animal charity Rain Rescue and a caring new owner. Staffordshire bull terrier Colin, pictured with wounds from the cruel burning he received still clearly visible . A much happier Colin pictured at his new home in Morecambe, where he wears sunscreen and a special vest to protect his scarring before he heads out in the sun. He is also trained to sit in the shade when possible . He now spends his days raiding kitchen bins, scoffing blackberries, and larking around in Morecambe with new owner Mari Preston. The former nurse, 55, was touched by Colin’s plight after seeing an appeal to help pay for his vets’ fees in a dog magazine. She said: 'I was horrified, this kind of thing seems to be happening all the time. Colin was on my mind all the time, and I couldn’t get him off it, so in the end I said I would take him. 'I’ve always had Staffordshire bull terriers so I know the breed really well, and as I am also an ex-nurse I was able to give him continuing care. 'In the first couple of days he was a bit stressed, especially at night, but I bought him a ThunderShirt which is like a big hug and then there was no problem.' Colin was picked up from Rain Rescue in June after staff there helped him to recover. He now has a new playmate in fellow Staffordshire bull terrier Safi and has been trained to sit in the shade to keep the sun off his scar where he was scalded.

'He raids bins and basically emptied the kitchen one, so now I put everything outside. But that’s the only bad thing I have come across in him. 'Colin also loves blackberries.

Jacquie Nielson, who runs the Rain Rescue centre in Sheffield and Rotherham, said she had never before seen a case of animal cruelty as bad as Colin's. 'Colin was in absolute burning agony because the burns were so severe, I don’t know whether they were third degree burns, but they had taken all the layer of skin off. 'It isn’t just this one dog, we are rammed full of neglect and cruelty cases. 'South Yorkshire is a cruelty hotspot and rescue centres are collapsing all the time.

"By . Associated Press . An Army veteran who hurt his back during the Iraq War is worried a citation will result in him losing his 14 pet ducks, which he says are therapeutic. Darin Welker said officials in the village of West Lafayette, Ohio told him to get rid of the ducks in May and cited him for a minor misdemeanor on June 23 for failing to comply. Welker is scheduled to appear in Coshocton Municipal Court for a hearing Wednesday and could face a $150 fine. Iraq war veteran Darin Welker, 36, holds one of his cherished ducks at his home and tells reporters he hopes the judge will let him keep his 14 pets . Welker, 36, says the ducks help him with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and keep him more active. West Lafayette, about 80 miles east of Columbus, banned residents from keeping fowl and other farm animals in 2010. Mayor Jack Patterson declined to comment on Welker's predicament and referred questions to village police Chief Terry Mardis, who couldn't be reached for comment. Welker told the Coshocton Tribune that he's had the ducks since March. He said they motivate him to get out of the house so he can feed and clean up after them. 'They're quite a relaxing animal, and they help comfort me in different situations,' Welker recently told the Tribune as he held one duck like a baby and stroked its neck. Welker, 36, says the ducks help him with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and keep him more active . '(Watching them) keeps you entertained for hours at a time.' Welker . served a year in Iraq with the Army National Guard in 2005 and said he . came home with a major back injury that required surgery in 2012. The Department of Veterans Affairs paid for the back surgery but declined to pay for physical therapy recommended by his surgeon and did not provide him with counseling, he said.

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Roberto Martinez says the speed of Arouna Kone’s recovery from a long-term knee injury will determine whether he moves for another striker before the transfer window closes. Everton’s manager shattered the club transfer record to land Romelu Lukaku for £28million earlier this month and he also has Kevin Mirallas, young forward Chris Long, as well as Kone, as striking options for the new season. However, Kone – who has not scored for Everton since his £5m move from Wigan in June 2013 – hasn’t played since last October after sustaining knee ligament damage and though he is around four weeks from being fully fit to start again, a relapse would force Martinez to make adjustments. Fit? Arouna Kone's long-term knee injury will decide whether Everton go for another striker for this season .

There's £60,000 in prizes including £1,000 up for grabs EVERY WEEK! While he is happy with the shape of his squad going into Saturday’s opening clash with Leicester City, Martinez recognises that if Kone were to suffer a relapse, it would change the dynamics, particularly with a Europa League campaign to juggle. ‘A lot will be down to how Kone adapts,’ said Martinez, who insists there is no truth in morning reports that he is looking to offload the Ivorian. ‘I want Arouna to be in a position so that we can make a good decision going forward to January. ‘I don’t want to be bringing players just for the sake of it. It is difficult to say when he will be fully fit and, when he is, we will be really strong in that position. The squad is well balanced. I’m very happy with the balance we have in the squad. ‘I would say now that we are desperate to see how the team reacts, but you always have to try and use the window to your advantage. In terms of squad that we have I am delighted what we have achieved. Better times: Kone and Martinez celebrate winning the FA Cup during their time together at Wigan Athletic . ‘In terms of being desperate to bring someone in, the answer is no but we will use the period to see how strong the squad is and if we need to make alterations.’ Martinez unveiled his latest addition to the squad at Finch Farm on Thursday. Christian Atsu has arrived on a season-long loan from Chelsea and big things are expected from the Ghana international. ‘He is that player that you want to see him involved with the ball,’ said Martinez. ‘He is quite rare in what he is as a winger. We saw signs of what he could do at Porto, he has been successful at Vitesse and I know I see a young man with potential who is hungry to do well. ‘This is a really good opportunity for him. We want him to develop unforgettable memories. I expect a little bit of an adaptation period. I just feel that because he has been working at a Premier League club will make it smooth.’ Atsu, who spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem, added: ‘I’m very happy and proud to be an Everton player. It is a good move for me. They play good football. This is my first season in Premier League and this is a big opportunity. ‘The World Cup helped my confidence to play here. I want to help the team, enjoy myself and play good football. I believe at the end of the season we will all be happy.'

"By . Damien Gayle . Patients in a taxpayer-funded rehab centre were sent rake leaves in one boss's garden and hand wash his wife's knickers and bras, it is claimed. Murray Kaplan, court liaison for the J-CAP programme in Queens, New York, had former junkies over to his Westhampton home to do chores, sources told the New York Post. Now New York's office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services has launched an investigation into the allegations after hearing of them from the paper, which described the incidents as amounting to 'slave labour'. The shop front for J-CAP's Admissions Office on Sutphin Boulevard, Jamaica , New York: The drug-rehab organisation has been mired in controversy over claims that one worker asked addicts to do his housework . 'You have identified issues which we will now investigate,' an agency spokesman told Post reporters. The allegations come from former workers and patients at J-CAP, which offers residential care for up to 400 addicts to help them kick their drug habits. One worker told The Post of a veteran who lived at J-CAP who often visited Mr Kaplan's home. Then one day she turned up back at the clinic in tears, claiming she had been told to handwash Mr Kaplan's wife's lingerie. Another veteran resident of J-CAP told the post that Mr Kaplan asked him to rake leaves around his house, then paid him off with some hotdogs, $20 and a pack of cigarettes. Citing its sources, The Post claimed that Mr Kaplan had other recovering addicts for 'favours'. They included asking one to help move clothing from Manhattan to the home of Joseph Strasburg, head of the Rent Stabilisation Association. Mr Kaplan said he brings patients from J-CAP over to his house to enjoy the pool and have picnics, but he denied claims that he gets them to do his housework or any other chores. He told The Post: 'We have plenty of help in the house. We have gardeners. Certainly, nobody came over to do any work.' Mr Strasburg would not comment, The Post reported. MailOnline contacted J-Cap for comment, but nobody was available. J-CAP's New Beginnings Teen Parenting Program facility on South Road, Jamaica, NY: Murray Kaplan, court liaison for J-CAP, had former junkies over to his Westhampton home to do chores, sources told the NY Post . J-CAP is a taxpayer-funded residential drug treatment programme for adults founded in the early 1970s. Its website says its facilities can cater for as many as 400 patients in a group therapy setting. Patients are expected to contribute to the daily operation of what it calls 'the community', sharing in tasks such as housekeeping and meal preparation. The non-profit organisation, whose name stands for Just Caring About People, also runs a special programme for veterans, who are often at greater risk of alcohol and drug abuse. Patients are often referred to J-CAP by the courts, although the organisation says it accepts referrals 'from a variety of sources'. Its website says: 'We value our human and civil rights to education, health, dignity, privacy, confidentiality, and a desire to achieve real freedom from exploitation and harm.' But its future could be in doubt. The Post reports further reports that J-CAP has closed its biggest unit and is curtailing other programmes.","Lawyer Murray Kaplan had junkies over to his Westhampton home .

"By . Sally Lee For Daily Mail Australia . A Melbourne paramedic is lucky to be alive after experiencing first hand how life can change in an instance just two weeks ago. Ben Dalton and his ambulance partner were dispatched to a woman's home after a mental health assessment said she needed to be taken to hospital. But the 27-year-old had no idea he was about to face off with a near death encounter when he knocked on that very door. Scroll down for video . Melbourne paramedic Ben Dalton had a knife swung just 10cm away from his throat by an aggressive patient . 'The woman was verbally aggressive when she answered the door,' Mr Dalton told Daily Mail Australia. 'Then she suddenly pulled out a knife - it must of been up her sleeve - and she charged at me with it and just swung it at me, aiming for my throat.' It was Mr Dalton's quick reflexes that saved him from becoming a casualty. 'I arced my head back and the knife was about 10cm away from my throat,' he said. 'Then I remember calling out ""knife, knife"" as I fell back into my colleague and the police who were behind me.' From that moment, a 90 minute siege ensued as officers - including Mr Dalton and his partner - backed into a corridor behind a glass door. 'The police had their pistols drawn and were trying to hold the door shut because it didn't have a lock on it,' Mr Dalton said. 'The woman was still shouting at us, threatening to kill us, then she walked over with a pot of boiling water and told us she was going to pour it through the cracks of the glass panel.' Mr Dalton said about 30 police arrived at the scene and were eventually able to verbally de-escalate the situation. The 27-year-old says this isn't an isolated incident as paramedics are increasingly experiencing violence and aggression . However, the incident has left Mr Dalton traumatised. 'At the time I was in work mode but after it ended, I remember saying “what the hell was that? I nearly lost my life"",' he said. Then came the aftermath. 'After going back to the branch and debriefing, when I was finally alone I felt a huge amount of grief,' he said. 'There are times I feel waves of emotion like a tsunami force where I get smacked down and would just break down in tears. 'My sleeping patterns are getting better and the nightmares are decreasing but I'm still not sleeping well.' But Mr Dalton says his recent confrontation isn't an isolated case. 'It's not just me and mine isn't a unique situation,' he said. 'Hundreds of paramedics go through similar incidents. This happens to ambos across the board.' Mr Dalton says paramedics are increasingly experiencing violence and aggression when they're called out to jobs. He believes the high prevalence of mental illness and the growing amount of drug use in society is a huge contributor. 'It's just ridiculous the amount of violence we encounter,' Mr Dalton said. 'But no one is talking about it so that's why I've decided to speak out so I can raise awareness about the kind of risks we as paramedics face on a daily basis.'","Ben Dalton was dispatched to a woman's home two weeks ago .

"At a glance this plain bowl could be mistaken for something you would use to heat up your beans in the microwave without a second thought. But the simple light blue glaze with fine crackling and indents in the rim resembling a flower tell the expert observer that this is actually a 900-year-old Chinese dish. And after a fierce bidding war between eight desperate buyers, it sold for £17million at auction in Hong Kong, smashing the record for Chinese Song dynasty ceramics sold at auction. Recordbreaker: This Chinese Song Dynasty ceramics Ruyao Washer was sold for more than £16million . Sotheby's said that it took just 15 minutes for the rare Ruyao bowl to sell for triple the estimate. Several records have been set recently for elaborate vases from the Ming and Qing dynasties. But the Song dynasty is even older, ruling in China between 960 and 1279, which makes it all the more desirable. The dynasty was the first government to issue regular paper money in the country. Fine example: The piece is held by Nicolas Chow, Sotheby's Asia Deputy Chairman . Ru ceramics are named after  one of five large kilns that operated at the time and are the rarest in China. It surpassed the previous record set . in April 2008 for Song dynasty ceramics, when a vase sold by Sotheby's . went for £5.5million. The auction house said the delicate . bowl was sold by a private Japanese collector and was 'arguably the most . desirable piece of Ru official ware remaining in private hands'. Nicolas Chow of Sotheby's Asia, added: . 'It is a piece of Ruyao which is probably the most fabled type of . Chinese ceramic ever to have been created.' Newly wealthy Chinese collectors have driven the prices of ceramics and antiquities to astonishing levels in recent years.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Hot-headed Alec Baldwin has been arrested so many times, he needs to issue a press release even when he's not involved in a dispute. The actor released a statement this week, following an arrest an at his apartment building in New York's Greenwich Village. 'In recent history, when the cops are called to 28 East 10th Street, you could likely guess it’s about one particular person,' Baldwin told the New York Times. Not involved: Alec Baldwin says a recent arrest at his New York apartment building had nothing to do with him. Pictured above in front of his Greenwich Village building this past May . But this time it was Baldwin's neighbor Jaime McKeown, 56, who was arrested on charges of hitting another tenant with a frying pan in a noise dispute. Baldwin's housekeeper and personal assistant witnessed the dispute as they were taking an elevator down from his apartment. The doors opened on the fifth floor, where they saw the assault taking place. According to cops, McKeown beat and dragged the unidentified neighbor, who was then taken to the hospital. McKeon allegedly 'struck the victim on her head with a metal drying man, causing her to fall to the floor, lose consciousness and suffer great swelling and substantial pain.' Baldwin says other people in the building say the two tenants were fighting about noise in the victim's apartment. Arrest: Baldwin's neighbor Jaime McKeown was arrested last week for hitting another tenant in Devonshire House with a frying pan . 'As a prosecutor would say, he was lying in wait, crouched down,' Baldwin said. 'And then he cracks the woman with a frying pan. What is that? He waited for her to show up and — Bam!' Baldwin described the vitcim as a quiet and shy person who is 'nothing but a lovely woman' and McKeown as 'wound very tight'. McKeown was arrested and charged with second-degree assault. He has not commented on the arrest. Baldwin added that he thinks it might be best that his building install security cameras in case a similar incident happens again. The actor's building, Devonshire House, has been the backdrop of many of his arrests - notably when he got into a fight with paprazzi who wanted to snap wife Hilaria with their new baby last year. Devonshire House has been the backdrop of Baldwin's previous arrests, and he once assaulted a photographer who waited outside to catch pictures of his wife with their new baby.

"By . Gavin Mccafferty, Press Association . David Millar likened the excitement around his first Glasgow 2014 experience to a Tour de France stage after finishing eighth in the time trial. The Scot goes into Sunday's road race with greater expectations for himself but the atmosphere on roads in Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and East Dunbartonshire exceeded his wildest dreams. The 37-year-old came into the Games looking for a special experience to help bring the curtain down on his career and the welcome did not disappoint. Similarities: Scot David Millar compared the Commonwealth Games time trial to a Tour de France stage . Excited: Millar came eighth in Thursday's time trial and says the Glasgow experience has been amazing . Millar said: 'It was like a Tour de France stage out there, it really was. 'The amount of people out there with Scottish flags and my name being cheered, I have never experienced anything like it. I think it's going to be more of the same on Sunday. 'There were moments out there when it was just deep with people, and the noise was incredible. It really was like a Tour de France stage. 'I was very proud and everyone else can be. It was blurs of Saltires, it was pretty impressive. It was quite strange seeing so many Scottish flags out there.' Millar had not held out much hope of retaining the title he won in Delhi four years ago and he was never in contention, eventually finishing two minutes and 14 seconds behind English winner Alex Dowsett and almost two minutes behind Welsh bronze medallist Geraint Thomas. 'I had pretty low expectations and I fulfilled those,' he said. Dream finish: Millar hopes to claim a medal for Scotland in Sunday's road race . Familiar: Millar came third on the same course around Glasgow last year in the British national championships . 'I just wanted to get through it. I was super-realistic about today, I know where my forte lies now and it's not so much in time trials these days at my old age. So I'm looking forward to the road race.' Millar believes home support can be much more of a weapon on Sunday. The Maltese-born Scot finished third in the same course around the city centre and the west end of Glasgow in the National Championships last summer, and led coming into Glasgow Green before being overtaken in the home straight by sprint specialist Mark Cavendish, who misses these Games through injury. 'The road race is a lot different,' he said. 'You have time to soak it up and you have to go pretty deep and tap into all your resources. So I think having the home crowd on Sunday is going to make a big difference. 'I know what to expect, which is good, but I also know how hard it is. And it doesn't matter what the course is, every race is different. 'I think we have a real quality field there and it's going to be really aggressive from the gun. 'It's not going to be a boring race, that's for sure.' Punishing: Millar put in a solid performance in the gruelling time trial as he finished in eighth place .

"By . Mark Duell . Gambler: Elliott Short (pictured today arriving at court) claimed he was able to place successful bets on races and make large sums of money . A gambler who allegedly conned family friends out of  £620,000 through a bogus betting scheme spent thousands of pounds shopping for designer clothes at Harrods and Ralph Lauren. Elliott Short, 26, who lived in Chelsea, central London, was said to have claimed he was able to place successful bets on races and make large sums of money using a layered betting scheme. But the horse racing expert lost more than £1million of his own money and cash given by investors through unsuccessful gambling and lavish lifestyle, Southwark Crown Court heard. Christopher Antoniou allegedly invested £200,000 in Short’s betting system, hoping for huge profits - but he never saw the cash again and began to become suspicious after reading an article about the scheme in a newspaper. The story in the now-defunct News of the World, which claimed Short had made £21million from his scheme, was rubbished by Betfair - which said the figures given by Short were impossible. Mr Antoniou often visited Short to talk over his investment and said he saw him placing bets by phone while watching races on TV and marking wins by chanting: ‘Who is the Betfair King?’ After becoming friends Mr Antoniou and Short met socially, and Short would go out to trendy clubs and bars in Chelsea and Knightsbridge, a few times each week, the court was told. Short would ‘typically pay for everything and anyone, showing off his supposed wealth’ and ‘the bills he would run up were usually in excess of £1,000’, Michael Hick prosecuting, said. The court also heard how Short spent thousands of pounds on designer clothes and hotels. Bank statements show during 2009 he spent £4,549 at a Hilton hotel and £460 at Christopher Louboutin. The documents also showed a £7,015 spend at Ralph Lauren and £1,825 at Brinkley’s Wine Gallery in Chelsea. He also allegedly splashed out on a chauffeur-driven Mercedes, jetted off on holidays to Marbella, stayed in plush hotels and frequented top clubs including exclusive Eclipse in Chelsea. ‘Some smaller sums were going to Betfair, whilst bigger sums were going to places like Harrods and the Hilton,’ Mr Hicks said. ‘The money was in fact being spent on maintaining an extravagantly lavish lifestyle. Trial: Southwark Crown Court (pictured) heard the horse racing expert lost over £1million of his own money and cash given by investors through unsuccessful gambling and lavish lifestyle . ‘What Mr Short’s bank statements do show is that this money was in fact spent on maintaining a lavish lifestyle - spending money in exclusive clubs, eating out, shipping in various luxury brand shops and going on a holiday to Marbella.’ When the article appeared in 2009, Mr Antoniou confronted Short, who alllegedly said the Betfair statement had been issued by the firm at his request as he wasn’t happy with the story and publicity. Mr Hick said: ‘This was another false story, made up by Mr Short to make him appear successful, and no doubt to convince his investors to keep providing him with money and to attract new investors. ‘However the story prompted Betfair to release a public statement countering the article, stating the claims made were not possible. As a consequence, the News of the World was forced to make a retraction.’ Equestrian aficionado: Christopher Antoniou had often visited Elliott Short to talk over his investment and saw him watching races on TV before chanting: 'Who is the Betfair King?' (file picture of horse race) As a result, Betfair allegedly cancelled all of Short’s accounts with them so he could no longer trade. Short, of Chester, Cheshire, is accused of defrauding James Crawford out of £400,000, Mr Antoniou out of £200,000 and Melinda Barrett out of £20,000 between September 2008 and August 2009. Mr Crawford, who met Short via his mother and step-father, Rosemary and Tom King, handed over £400,000 after mistakenly believing he was trading successfully, the court heard. He was allegedly told he would receive monthly dividend payments of £70,000, but they allegedly never materialised. Short is charged with 13 counts of fraud and one count of making or supplying an article for use in fraud. The trial is expected to last three weeks.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Stunning X-Men star Famke Janssen claims the secret of her ageless looks is never drinking water out of plastic bottles. Many people fear chemicals  can ‘leak’ into the water, causing  a toxic build-up in the body, but there is no scientific proof of that. Now the 48-year-old Dutch actress has revealed her fitness regime. She also hits the gym regularly, has been seen shading herself from the sun with a parasol while strolling in New York and follows a strict vegan diet. Scroll down for video . Healthy living: Famke, pictured in X-Men, does not eat meat, avoids dairy and tries not to drink water out of plastic bottles . Famke, who plays Olivia Godfrey in Netflix’s supernatural drama Hemlock Grove, says: ‘I drink a lot of water, but try not to drink out of plastic bottles. I work out whenever I can and I don’t eat meat or dairy.’ Famke says she quit eating  meat because of her affinity with animals – especially her dog Liquorice. She said: ‘When you  get that close to an animal, things change and it doesn’t seem to matter if it’s a dog or a chicken or a cow – they all have feelings and all have emotions.’ nMillions of British women are . living with chronic incontinence because they are too embarrassed to . seek medical help, according to new research. About three-quarters of . five million British women who develop the condition after giving birth . fail to contact their GP, despite it being easily treatable. Many . have never spoken to anyone – even their partner – about their problem, . according to the poll of 2,000 mothers commisioned by Netmums, and . carried out for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the Royal . College of Midwives. Six . in ten felt the subject was ‘taboo’ and 56 per cent said they were . embarrassed. A further 16 per cent felt ashamed. Simple physiotherapy . exercises can solve the problem with the pelvic floor – see . csp.org.uk/pregnancy. No clot: The Geko device delivers tiny electrical impulses to the back of the knee . NHS hospital patients are to be offered a drug-free way  to treat post-surgical blood clots, a condition that kills 25,000 Britons a year. The Geko device is a thin, 6in strip that attaches to the leg and delivers tiny  electrical impulses to the  back of the knee. It was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence this month. Developed at Bart’s and the London NHS Trust, it has been designed to help those who are unable to take blood-clot dissolving drugs – the first-line treatment – due to other health problems. The device stimulates the muscles in . the leg and foot which then increase blood flow in the veins of the . lower leg. This may help reduce the risk of blood clots forming. Doctors have discovered a way to . treat an uncommon – yet distressing – condition that makes patients . belch up to 20 times a minute. Supragastric . belching is thought of affect thousands of Britons and is due to . excessive swallowing, meaning air is taken into the oesophagus. Digestive problems such as  irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic . acid reflux – or heartburn – are also thought to increase risk of . developing it. High . levels of anxiety have been found in patients, and it has been linked . to stress. Some patients say it started with them deliberately belching . to ease feelings of bloating or abdominal discomfort, but it then became . a habit. Now, . German and Swedish experts have used a combination of the muscle . relaxant baclofen, and pregabalin, an anticonvulsant used to treat . seizures and anxiety, to control the problem. The . treatment resulted in a greater than 90 per cent drop in the rate of . belching, and doctors believe the combination works by reducing . sensitivity at the junction between the oesophagus and stomach. Phobias may be best treated in the early morning. People who had therapy for fear of spiders at 8am had a greater reduction in symptoms than those treated at 6pm, in a study at Saarland University Hospitals, Germany. The reason may be that natural levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, peak in the morning. Specific phobias are among the most common anxiety disorders, affecting more than one in ten of the population, with fear of spiders one of the most common. Exposure therapy, where patients are increasingly exposed to spiders, can help, but not everyone benefits. Drugs have been used to boost the effects of the therapy, and one of the most effective is synthetic cortisol, with a Swiss study showing that those given it had double the reduction in symptoms seen in those prescribed a placebo.","Actress Famke Janssen avoids drinking water out of plastic bottles .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . A primary school has transformed its pupils’ achievement after introducing a compulsory nine-hour day. Older children at Great Yarmouth Primary Academy are required to start at 8.55am and stay until 6pm to take part in a free programme of activities and complete homework under supervision. The school – previously one of the worst-performing in the country – introduced the 45-hour week to give pupils the same opportunities as those from private schools and wealthy backgrounds. Remarkable: Great Yarmouth Primary Academy in Norfolk (pictured) has won favour from inspectors with its 45-hour weeks for over-nines - introduced to rival the standard offered by private schools . In a dramatic turnaround in less than two years, it has now earned a ‘good’ rating by Ofsted – the second-highest. The watchdog highlighted the extended day as a key factor in the school’s success, praising its ‘outstanding leadership’ and remarking that the timetable was improving pupils’ life skills and commitment to education. In its former incarnation as Greenacre Primary, the Norfolk school was among the bottom 200 performers out of 15,000 nationally and was condemned by inspectors as failing in 2010. The extended week was introduced in 2012 as the school became an academy sponsored by millionaire businessman Theodore Agnew. Under the controversial timetable – longer than a standard working week – school starts at 8.55am, although pupils are free to attend a breakfast club from 7.45am. Lessons finish at 3.30pm but those aged seven to 11 stay until 5pm for activities including horse-riding, cookery, cello lessons, first aid, dance and trips to Cambridge University. Long day: The extended timetable at the primary school applied to all pupils over the age of nine . Those aged nine to 11, the final two years of school, then spend a further hour on homework or reading under supervision. Education Secretary Michael Gove supports longer school days, but many in education oppose the idea. Dr Tim Hands, chairman of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents leading independent schools, says it undermines a ‘proper childhood’. But Bill Holledge, head of Great Yarmouth, said: ‘This is certainly not some Gradgrindian regime. Pupils are happy and engaged and bounce out of school at the end of the day.’ The extended timetable is funded partly through the pupil premium, and donations from Mr Agnew. Mr Agnew, who has been touted as a possible successor to Baroness (Sally) Morgan as chairman of Ofsted, said: ‘I am determined to end the apartheid in education so commonplace in this country.’ The longer day initially was controversial among parents who were concerned it would eat into family time and exhaust pupils. But Mr Holledge said: ‘Parents have been convinced by the views of their children.’ Education Minister Elizabeth Truss praised the school’s transformation as a ‘brilliant example’.","Lessons at Great Yarmouth Primary Academy run from 8.55am to 6pm .

"Posing for a holiday picture surrounded by his daughter and girlfriend, Roman Seleznev looks nothing more than an ordinary family man. But U.S. federal prosecutors believe the 30-year-old Russian national is in fact a criminal mastermind responsible for one of the biggest credit card hacking scams in history. Seleznev was allegedly seized by American secret service agents while . returning to Moscow from a vacation in the Maldives before being bundled onto a plane and flown to Guam where he was arrested. An undated family photo shows Roman Seleznev posing with his partner Anna Otisko and their daughter. Seleznev was arrested in Guam on bank fraud charges after allegedly being seized by American secret servicemen . Authorities allege that he hacked into computers at . hundreds of retail businesses including the Phoenix Zoo collecting credit card numbers. But family members insist he is innocent and fear incarceration will kill him. Seleznev's father Valery, a prominent Russian lawmaker, . told a news conference today that his son, who was left . brain-damaged after a 2011 bombing in Marrakech, will die without his . medication. 'There are no medical services there at all, treatment is not available,' Seleznev said. When asked how his son is going to manage without prescription drugs the lawmaker said: 'He will die.' Seleznev's father said a lawyer has spoken to his son and that he is 'in good spirits'. Seleznev's . girlfriend, Anna Otisko, said she was with him when he was grabbed by . unknown men at the airport in the Maldives and put on the plane out of . the country. The . Russian foreign ministry has accused Washington of kidnapping the man. U.S. officials have declined to say how or where he was apprehended. Fears: Seleznev's father Valery Seleznev, a prominent Russian lawmaker, said his son, who was left brain-damaged after a 2011 bombing in Marrakech, will die without his medication . Tearful: Seleznev's girlfriend Anna Otisko, cries as she listens to a question during a news conference in Moscow . The . man's relatives insist that Seleznev was arrested because of a . 'horrendous mistake' and was neither mentally nor physically able to . engage in the intricate hacking schemes. The charges, however, date back . to the time before he was injured. According to an indictment unsealed Monday, Seleznev, known by the underground name 'Track2,' carried out a scheme to hack into retailers' computers, install malicious software and steal credit card numbers from 2009 to 2011. He is accused of marketing and selling those stolen credit card numbers on 'criminally inspired websites' and using servers in Virginia, Russia, Ukraine and other parts of the world to help carry out the scheme. In March 2011, a grand jury in Washington state indicted Seleznev on charges of bank fraud, obtaining information from a protected computer, aggravated identity theft, trafficking in unauthorized access devices and possessing stolen credit card numbers. Seleznev's targets allegedly included several small businesses like Broadway Grill, in Seattle, where he could steal credit card information . The . Washington indictment accuses him of hacking into computers at the . Broadway Grill in Seattle and stealing 32,000 unique credit card numbers . between December 2009 and October 2010. Seleznev . is also accused of stealing credit card data from 'hundreds of retail . businesses' throughout the U.S. They include several others in Western . Washington, along with Schlotzsky's Deli in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; Mary's . Pizza Shack in Sonoma, California; Latitude Bar and Grill in New York; . and the Phoenix Zoo, according to the indictment. The . indictment says Seleznev stole more than 200,000 credit card numbers and . sold more than 140,000, generating more than $2 million in profits. It . was unclear whether consumers or banks were notified that the card . numbers had been stolen. A call to the Secret Service on Tuesday . afternoon was not immediately returned. The . Russian Foreign Ministry in a statement Tuesday described Seleznev's . arrest as 'yet another unfriendly gesture' of the United States. Neither . are we notified of charges against our compatriots, nor were Russian . consulate offices informed of Seleznev's arrest,' the statement said. U.S. security officials allege Seleznev is behind attacks compromising thousands of consumer credit cards . The ministry said it was waiting for the U.S. to explain the incident and allow Russian consulate staff to visit Seleznev. Moscow . also blamed Maldives officials for ignoring 'international legal norms' and allowing 'intelligence services of another state to kidnap a . Russian citizen and take him out of the country.' In . Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki disputed the . Russian Foreign Ministry description of the matter, saying, 'Certainly, . no kidnapping took place.'

"By . Suzannah Hills . and Leon Watson . Preacher: The guide was written by Samir Khan who was killed by U.S. airstrikes in Yemen . A bizarre 'must-read' English language manual for Westerners wanting to become a terrorist has been published by Al Qaeda, it emerged today. The glossy 16-page guide includes rules that recruits must follow as well as recommendations on how to cope with the hardships and dangers of life as a jihad. It includes everyday advice on taking showers, camping and how to avoid difficult questions - but also suggests new recruits target the U.S.. The guide was written by Samir Khan, an American who served as the top propagandist for the Yemen-based branch of Al Qaeda, who was killed by US Hellfire missiles during a drone attack. He died in September 2011, along with the U.S.-born radical cleric Anwar al Awlak. It starts by saying: 'For those Muslims coming from the West, this is a must read document as it includes an invaluable information which will enable them to appropriately understand the importance of their role in the scale of this battle and provide them with a visibility to aptly choose their next step.' The first section of the guide is titled 'cleanliness' and states: 'In some cases, you will be staying with a few brothers in a tight room or house. 'In order to avoid unnecessary problems, encourage yourself and your brothers to clean the room(s) on a regular basis. As for yourself, a daily shower is ideal but not possible in many cases.' Khan then goes on to offer advice on how to cope with the life of a jihad. He says: 'If you feel terrified close your eyes and imagine yourself inside paradise. Think of your hoor [virgins] that are awaiting you as well as meeting the prophets.' Another section urges Western recruits to stay on their home 'sand, rocks or grass' and attack 'America in its own backyard'. The guide continues: 'The effect is much greater, it always embarrasses the enemy, and these types of individual decision-making attacks are nearly impossible for them to contain.' Bizarre: The front page of the jihad manual Expectations Full written by Samir Khan . The guide includes a section on bringing your family to jihad training with terrorists . Khan states: 'In al-qa’idah, we don’t care about the size of your muscles, how fast you run, how strong your legs are and so on - although these things will be strengthened - but we put a special focus on ""lasting long"" and outdoing the enemy in patience. 'In short, prepare for the worse, and hope in the best.' The manual, which also praises cleanliness, says secrecy is one of the pillars of modern day jihad, advising recruits not to reveal their place of birth to other jihadists and to refrain from asking them too many questions. The guide also urges 'brothers' to attack America. Pictured here is the Brooklyn Bridge in New York . On involving family members in acts of terrorism, it says: 'If you have a family that you want to bring to jihad, it may or may not be possible depending on the logistics of the mujahideen. 'In Yemen for example, it's extremely difficult to bring your wife and kids to live amongst the mujahideen. In other lands, this may not be a problem. 'So if you know that the land you are going to is tight on this, then what you can do is bring your family to the land, but keep them in a city where they will be safe and protected by friends. Samir Khan was a top figure in Al Qaeda in Yemen, where soldiers pictured above are still regularly fighting Al Qaeda-linked militants in the southern province of Abyan . Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, pictured in Afghanistan . 'You don't want to risk them being captured by the murtadeen and witnessing them getting raped and tortured in order to extract information about you.' The manual also gives a quick guide to camping: 'Living outdoors will be the most difficult of bases to stay in. In some bases, it won't be too bad since the mujahideen will erect tents and there might be some basic comforts. 'It is possible though that there will be incidents were none of this will be available and you will have to sleep on sand, rocks or grass. They may or may not have blankets and sleeping bags available. 'As for the weather, you should do some research into the country before arriving as to what it’s like during the day and night, especially in deserts, mountainous regions and forests. 'You will want to wear your boots/sneakers/sandals most of the time in the outdoors, but you should get used to taking it off everyday or at least every 3 days to avoid running into foot problems. 'A brother in Afghanistan sticked to taking his boots off every 3 days but didn’t do a good job of washing his feet thoroughly; after some time, he developed a strange foot disease where his small toe was pushed underneath his foot. 'After that, he could no longer walk. Take good care of your feet and wash them properly.'","'Must-read' guide to jihad written by terrorist who died in September 2011 .

"By . Kate Gardiner, Press Association . Scotland's Dan Keatings put his London 2012 heartbreak behind him by winning Commonwealth gold on the pommel horse in Glasgow's SSE Hydro. The 24-year-old produced a stunning routine in front of his home crowd to score 16.058 and see off the challenge of the returning Englishman Louis Smith and triple Commonwealth gold medal winner Max Whitlock. Whitlock claimed the silver medal with a score of 15.966, while Smith took away bronze in his first major competition since the Olympics two years ago with a mark of 14.966. Podium: Dan Keatings (centre) wins Commonwealth gold ahead of Max Whitlock (left) and Louis Smith (right) Victory: Keatings' score of 16.058 was enough to hold off the English challenge from Smith and Whitlock . The highly anticipated final had been billed as a showdown between Olympic silver medallist and comeback king Smith, England and Great Britain's brightest new all-around star Whitlock and Scotland's Keatings, who has battled back from a series of injury setbacks to compete at his home Games after missing out on selection for the London Olympics. Smith was not chosen for May's European Championships, where Whitlock saw off the challenge of Olympic pommel horse champion Krisztian Berkhi to claim gold after Keatings missed out on the showed by failing to qualify. It meant, however, that the stage was set in Glasgow for a battle of Britain's best on the apparatus, with more than just pride at stake. Pipped: Smith is continuing his comeback to the sport and he won a bronze medal in the pommel horse . New kid on the block: Whitlock holds up his silver medal as he continues to improve as an athlete . Canada's Anderson Loran opened the final with a steady routine, but one which lacked the difficulty for a place on the podium with Wales' Clinton Purnell also not hitting the heights required. Keatings was up next and punched the air after he nailed a routine which achieved a huge score with a 7.200 difficulty rating to throw down the gauntlet to his opponents. Wales' Jac Davies scored 14.800 before Smith took to the horse an pulled out all the stops with a slight hesitation before his dismount to move into silver medal position with 14.966. Scotland's Dan Purvis went clean but his 14.516 placed him in fourth before it was Whitlock's turn on the apparatus. The newly crowned Commonwealth floor and all-around champion produced a clean routine but, despite having a higher start score than Keatings - 7.4 - his execution was not judged to be as good, leaving the Scot to take the glory. Pride: Keatings holds his arms aloft and screams with delight as he celebrates his pommel horse gold . Next up was the women's bars final where England's Becky Downie won gold ahead of Australia's Larrissa Miller in silver while England's Ruby Harrold took bronze. A fall ended the medal hopes of Wales' Elizabeth Beddoe but Downie hit her routine and was awarded a score of 14.666 to move into gold medal position at the early stage in the final. Miller slotted in behind Downie with 14.566 before Canada's Black went into bronze medal position. It meant Downie led at the halfway point and the Beijing Olympian held on as Wales' Rear Theaker came off to finish last in the rankings, with Harrold making a late charge to bronze with a score of 14.366.","Keatings put London 2012 heartbreak behind him to win gold .

"By . Damien Gayle . A television programme is out to test whether innocent people can be brainwashed in becoming unwitting assassins as in the plot of political thriller The Manchurian Candidate. In the 1959 novel, a man is brainwashed into becoming an unwitting sleeper assassin as part of a Communist conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government. The novel and its film adaptations have intrigued many, and related conspiracy theories have long-held that the U.S. government and others have tried to develop techniques to control the minds of individuals. Programmed to kill: Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey in a scene from the 1962 cinema adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate, in which a man is brainwashed into becoming an assassin as part of a communist plot . In one famous case, the assassin who killed presidential candidate Bobby Kennedy, Christian Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan, later claimed he was hypnotised into carrying out the killing. Likewise, Patty Hearst, the newspaper heiress kidnapped by the left-wing revolutionary group the Symbionese Liberation Army, claim the gang brainwashed her into taking part in a bank robbery. There have been government-sponsored studies into the possibility of mind control. Between the Fifties and Seventies, the CIA conducted controversial experiments to develop behavioural engineering that many believed aimed at brainwashing subjects. MKUltra was the code name for a covert CIA human research program run by the CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence. The program began in the early Fifties and continued at least through the late Sixties, using mainly U.S. and Canadian citizens as its test subjects. The published evidence indicates that Project MKUltra involved the use of many methodologies to manipulate individual mental states and alter brain function, including the surreptitious administration of drugs and other chemicals, sensory deprivation, isolation, and verbal and sexual abuse. It was first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by Congress, through investigations by the Church Committee, and by a presidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission. However, investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms ordered all MKULTRA files destroyed in 1973. The Church Committee and Rockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of direct participants and on the relatively small number of documents that survived Helms' destruction order. In recent times most information regarding MKULTRA has been officially declassified. It was first made available through a FOIA request in 1977 that uncovered a cache of some 20,000 documents relating to project MKULTRA and led to Senate hearings. In July of 2001 some surviving information regarding MKUltra was officially declassified. Investigative efforts were hampered by the fact that Richard Helms, director of the CIA, ordered many files related to the programme - known as MKUltra - destroyed in 1973, years before any investigation into it began. It was nevertheless found that the remit of the project was to develop mind-controlling drugs and techniques, with the CIA especially interested in being able to manipulate foreign leaders. Now a Discovery Channel documentary aims to see if it is indeed possible to persuade unwitting, law-abiding subjects to become cold-blooded killers who will shoot someone to order, Today's Clicker blog reports. Experimental psychopathologist Cynthia Meyerburg, who oversaw the study, says in a trailer for the documentary: 'Science has only begun to understand how the brain works, and one of the things we don't yet understand is whether it's possible to control someone else's mind.' The programme will show work with a group of test subjects who gave their consent to take part in a hypnosis study for television. They were not told that the ultimate objective of the study, as described in its trailer, is 'to take a mentally healthy, law-abiding individual and program them to shoot and kill a complete stranger'. Not all experts are agreed on whether the goal is possible to achieve. Oxford University neuroscientist Matt Stokes, who also contributes to the film, said: 'What we're trying to do here is strip away someone's sense of free will and see if they can carry out extreme acts. 'Can it be done? Well, I'm not so sure that it can.' Curiosity: Brainwashed will be broadcast on Sunday night at 9pm on the Discovery Channel.

"By . Ruth Styles . With just 300 people, the El Molo might be Kenya's tiniest tribe but they certainly know how to pack a punch - as the local crocodile population is all too well aware. For this band of hardy men and women are the original Crocodile Dundees and survived for centuries on a diet of the flesh of two of Africa's most dangerous beasts - the hippo and the Nile crocodile. Sadly for the El Molo, times (and stiff anti-poaching laws) have changed and the tribe is now forced to make a living from fish, although as photographer Eric Lafforgue explains, occasionally, one or two of Lake Turkana's 10,000-strong crocodile population do still fall prey to their harpoons. Tough guys: The 300-strong El Molo tribe is Kenya's smallest but also one of its toughest thanks to their penchant for fighting crocodiles and even hippos . Bleak: They live on the shores of Lake Turkana, a semi-salty body of water surrounded by volcanic rocks and where temperatures reach up to 45 degrees Celsius . Drinking water: Although salty, the El Molo continue to drink Lake Turkana's water although they do now have fresh water tanks built for them by the government . Changing times: The El Molo are famous for their bravery within Kenya and many are still animists, although some (right) have converted to Christianity . 'Unlike neighbouring tribes such as the Turkana and the Samburu, the El Molo are against killing people and . raiding tor cattle,' he explains. 'They live almost exclusively on . fish and occasionally some crocodiles from the lake, as the . environment is too arid to raise cattle.' Their fishing methods, which involve using small rafts made from doum palm trunks and harpoons, are more than 3,000 years old and usually result in the capture of one of the enormous 2ft catfish that live in the lake, or smaller tilapia. Large though the catfish are, they're small fry compared to the beasts the tribe used to take on - hippos. 'Before Kenya introduced anti-poaching laws, . they hunted hippos,' explains Lafforgue. 'The hippo hunter used to be celebrated as a hero and was given a special earring and a necklace to wear.' Hippos, who kill more humans each year than any other creature in Africa, are also one of the most dangerous to hunt and as a result, the El Molo are famous for their bravery. Other animals on their menu include the crocodile, a favoured food for honoured guests, and although crocodiles are also officially protected, the El Molo still occasionally kill one or two. Tasty: The El Molo used to be famous for their hippo hunts but are no longer allowed . Dangerous: Hippos are one of the most dangerous animals in Africa and kill many humans . Creative: Hunting and fishing is always done by the men while women are in charge of cooking . Not allowed: Despite having made a living from hunting hippos for centuries, the animals are now protected by law and the El Molo are not allowed to hunt them . Thirsty work: With hippo eating banned, the tribe lives mostly on the 2ft catfish that lurk beneath the lake which they turn into a salty broth using lake water . Traditional: Their fishing techniques are more than 3,000 years old and involve using canoes made from doum palm trunks and handmade harpoons . Ageing: El Molo people have a maximum life expectancy of 45 and consider 40 to be old (left). They also suffer from bone problems thanks to their protein only diet .

But while their diet is high in protein, the lack of fruit, vegetables and carbohydrates has led to health problems for the tribe, as has their penchant for drinking the salty water of Lake Turkana. 'You see many people with bone deformities, even in the kids,' explains Lafforgue. 'Some adults . are unable to walk because of painful bones. The situation is made worse because until recently, the tribe always married among themselves, which contributed to inbreeding. 'They . also suffer from a high fluoride intake, which makes their teeth discoloured, and they won't go to clinics because years ago, one of their people died in one. 'Because of that, they usually only live until the age of 45. 40 years old is considered old in the tribe and they can look about 70.' And it's not just the El Molo themselves who are under threat, but their unique culture too. Younger members of the tribe are starting to swap traditional clothes for western ones, while their language is now extinct and has been replaced with Swahili. 'The . last man to speak it died in 1974,' explains Lafforgue. 'They had eight words just for the wind.' Other parts of tribal culture, such as the clan system and a taboo that says it's bad luck to speak the name of the dead remain. 'They . mix their traditions with Christianity,' adds Lafforgue. 'It's not unusual to see an El Molo . women wearing a tribal necklace and a cross at the same time.' Despite embracing Christianity and the modern world, with oil recently discovered close to Lake Turkana and its salinity increasing, the outlook looks bleak for the El Molo, once Africa's bravest tribe. Dusty: Because of the arid conditions, the El Molo spend a lot of time removing dust from each others eyes - as demonstrated here by two friends . Culture: Although many still embrace traditional dress, many more are starting to wear western clothing, while the El Molo language became extinct in 1974 . Small: The El Molo tribe is so small, there are now only two villages - Anderi and Illah - where homes are still made from dried reeds and doum palm leaves . Beautiful: . The El Molo live on the shores of Lake Turkana in an area dotted with . volcanic rocks and where the land is too poor for agriculture or cows . Tasty: . Although they aren't really allowed, one or two of the 10,000 . crocodiles living on Lake Turkana falls prey to El Molo fisherman each . year . Banned: The El Molo are no longer allowed to hunt the hippo which live in Lake Turkana - a feat that earned them a reputation for bravery among other Kenyan tribes .","The El Molo live on the shores of Lake Turkana in northern Kenya and live exclusively on fish and the odd crocodile .

"By . Hannah Roberts . He has cast a shadow over the craggy Transylvanian Alps for centuries. But the remains of the real-life Dracula are today to be found not in the Romanian Alps but in Italy, according to new research. Count Vlad Tepes, the so-called Dracula, was thought to have died in battle. But scholars from the University of Tallinn say they have discovered documentary evidence that he was in fact taken prisoner, ransomed to his daughter - by then safe in Italy - and buried in a church in Naples. The remains of the real-life Dracula are today to be found not in the Romanian Alps but in tomb in Italy (pictured), according to new research . Born in 1431, Count Vlad Tepes was part of a noble family that was itself part of the Order of the Dragon, which was engaged in fighting the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into Europe. His father was nicknamed Dracul, meaning 'Dragon' so the young Vlad became Dracula, or 'son of Dragon'. In 1476 Dracula disappeared in battle. While some sources have claimed that he died, the researchers claim he was in fact imprisoned by the Turks, who hauled him away in chains. His daughter Maria was meanwhile brought to the Neapolitan court, whose ruling family was allied with her own family, where she was adopted and eventually married to a Neapolitan nobleman. Documents show that Maria in fact paid a ransom to the Turks for her father, who was then brought to Naples, the historians say. And a newly uncovered headstone in Naples' Piazza Santa Maria La Nova, in the same graveyard as his daughter and son-in-law, could be his final resting place, they say.

"By . Wayne Gardiner, Press Association . After returning to competitive action to take two Commonwealth medals, Louis Smith will go back to the small screen before launching an assault on the Great Britain squad next year. The Glasgow Games have been Smith's first since he took a silver and bronze at the London Olympics, with the 25-year-old enjoying the subsequent fame since. He won the popular television show Strictly Come Dancing and later this year will star in a new gymnastics-based show called Tumble as he continues to enjoy his own legacy. Screen: Former Strictly Come Dancing winner Louis SMith will return to TV in Tumble later this year . Double: Smith won Commonwealth gold in the team even and bronze in the pommel horse final . But a gold for England in the team event on Tuesday and a bronze in Thursday's pommel horse final showed he still has what it takes to live with the best in his day job and he intends to show that in 2015. When asked if he will be seen in the sport again, he said: 'I hope so. I have a lot more work to be doing to get in the British squad. I am not going to be competing again this year - I have other media commitments with Tumble and everything. 'But 2015 will be a year when I can hopefully get back into the Great Britain team. I will keep on training.' That means Smith will not be putting himself up for selection for the World Championships in China later this year, although if he is true to his word then the same event in Glasgow in 2015 and the subsequent Rio Olympics could be on the agenda. Shiny: Smith (right) won BBC's Strictly Come Dancing in 2012 with partner Flavia Cacace (left) Olympic joy: Smith won a silver and a bronze medal at London 2012 before taking a break from gymnastics . His performance on Thursday showed he still has enough to mix it with the big names, despite effectively being a part-time competitor. He attempted a new and more difficult routine to the one he normally performs which, had it come off, could have earned him a score higher than 14.966. As it was, he showed signs of rust and took third, behind compatriot Max Whitlock in second and popular runaway home winner Daniel Keatings. 'It was nice to medal. I was happy I got up there, did a new routine,' Smith added. 'I wasn't as fit at that routine as I could have been. I was a lot more stable with my other one. I was standing there, just as I was about to do my routine, thinking about whether or not I should do it or not. Aiming high: Smith hopes to make the Great Britain team for gymnastics again in 2015 . 'I could have played safe. Me, Dan and Max are in a league of our own, not being big-headed, and I could have done my easier routine and got a medal. I wanted to see where I was at, how my mind was, and I kind of almost did it. 'It's just brilliant, nice to test it out, see where I am, I had great fun.' Tumble - which features other big sporting names such as Carl Froch - will now occupy his mind, but he intends to keep training and keep pushing the boundaries of his skill set in order to have a tilt at future glory. 'I think I have proved I have got a lot more in the tank,' he said. 'I have a bit more fitness to work on but I am excited, 2015 is going to be a big year. From what I have got in my head, I know what routines I need to do, I'm doing a few more apparatus now and hopefully I can break back into the British squad.'

He said: 'I was blown away by the otherworldly landscape, everything was white as far as the eye could see. Everything was frozen. 'It was incredible to see how ice would form on top of every free surface. 'Even my snow shoes and fuel bottles would be covered in ice if I left them outside my tent during the night.' Mr Bonfadini, an environmental engineering student from Monza, Italy, sustained himself on powdered freeze-dried food during his trek and slept in his tent. He said: 'I loved what I was doing. I love to go deep into nature alone, to feel the majesty and beauty of Nature. It is absolutely what makes me happiest.

"By . Deborah Arthurs . When Mike Tindall bid £12,000 for a racehorse with an unproven track record at an auction his wife called him 'an idiot'. But Zara Phillips was forced to eat her words when the horse, bought after a boozy dinner without knowing anything of its history, won the Welsh Grand National in January this year and saw its value rocket to £200,000. And today, when the horse took to the starting line for the 3.20pm Gold Cup Steeple Chase, Tindall may have allowed himself to believe victory could be his once more. But sadly, disappointment reigned as Monbeg Dude failed to finish. The 11-4 favourite Bobs Worth was placed first, with Dir De Champs in second and Long Run in third. Monbeg Dude pulled up before the end. Disappontment: Mike Tindall admitted losing almost bet he placed this week - and would certainly have lost one more when Monbeg Dude failed to finish in the Gold Cup Steeplechase this afternoon. RIGHT: Zara looked stylish in grey at the event today . Also ran: Despite showing early promise when it won the Welsh Grand . National today, Mike's horse failed to impress at Cheltenham today . Zara, dressed in fur-collared taupe coat and a feather-trimmed hat, joined her husband, smart in a three-piece suit, to watch the race. The Dude, who at noon today had odds on Betfred of 50-1, is co-owned by Tindall, fellow rugby players James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson and Michael Scudamore – son of champion jockey Peter. Following the surprise win at the Welsh Grand National along with a win at The Henrietta Knight Handicap Steeple Chase in November last year, the Dude's value soared. Optimistic: Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall at the Gloucestershire race course yesterday . The former England rugby star explained of his spontaneous buy: ‘I like to bid at auctions without meaning to actually win things. I only went for a bite to eat and a night out. No horse had gone for less than £28,000 so I thought my first bid of £10,000 was pretty safe, likewise when I upped it to £12,000. ‘I knew nothing about the horse, hadn't checked the brochure and couldn’t even see the Dude, as I was sitting with my back to the sale ring.' Fortunately Scudamore, Simpson-Daniel and Robinson agreed to share the burden of the cost - and even with today's loss to contend with, they will no doubt still be pleased that they did, as pundits say we haven't yet seen the best that The Dude has to offer.

"By . Andy Dolan . Updated: . 11:16 EST, 29 November 2011 . When Pat Oates's dog vanished from the driveway five years ago she soon gave up hope of seeing the pet again. As the days went by without any sighting of seven-year-old T-Bone, Miss Oates concluded the Staffordshire bull terrier had been stolen. So she was astonished and overjoyed to be told last week that the dog had been found five years on – riding on her local bus. Rover's return: Pat Oates (pictured with relatives) was stunned when she received a call saying her beloved Staffordshire bull terrier, T-Bone, had been found riding the Birmingham City Centre to Solihull route . The bus driver took the animal to a . local veterinary surgery, where staff were able to reunite Miss Oates . with her long-lost pet, now aged 12, after scanning his microchip. Yesterday Miss Oates, 48, a delivery . driver, said: 'We couldn't believe it when we got the phone call. I . thought the vet was winding me up. I broke down crying. I wanted to get . there as soon as I could. 'He vanished from the driveway in 2006. We put up posters and made some appeals in the press, but didn't have any luck. 'T-Bone is like one of our children.  When he went missing, I couldn't sleep - it was a nightmare.  The whole family was upset. 'We're over the moon to have him back, we thought he was gone for good.' The mother-of-three, who lives with . partner Tony Wellington, 50, near Solihull, West Midlands, said it was a . mystery how the dog came to be travelling on the number 37 bus, . operated by Travel West Midlands. The bus travels between Birmingham . City Centre and Solihull. But she said it was no surprise he had been found on a bus, as the dog always enjoyed going on car journeys with the family. She added: 'No one saw who T-Bone was . with. We will try to see if there's CCTV on the bus, but the trouble is . the person could claim they'd only just picked him up.' Home again: Pat Oates, from Solihull, West Midlands is delighted to have T-Bone back. Right, she holds the poster after her pet went missing in 2006 - when she feared T-Bone had been stolen to order by a callous gang looking to use him as a ferocious weapon . Miss Oates said T-Bone had been . neglected and was suffering with a cyst on his leg and hearing trouble. 'The vet said to let him settle in first, but he will need treatment in . future. It's a small price to pay, we are just glad to have him back,' she said. Miss Oates, who has daughter Kelly, . 28, and sons Elliot, 18 and Matthew, 25, from a previous relationship, . says she plans to spoil T-Bone rotten this year. 'We have bought him a collar, as he . didn't have one. He likes squeaky toys and balls. He likes pigs . trotters, so we will get him some for this year.' After five years without a dog, the . family were reunited with T-Bone just a month after Miss Oates bought Mr . Wellington a new puppy, Wrinkle, also a Staffordshire bull terrier, as a . 50th birthday present. Leigh Fisher, of 608 Vets, in . Birmingham, where the dog was taken by the bus driver, said the case . illustrated how important it was for owners to get pets microchipped. 'It also highlights the importance of . taking any stray animal to a vet to have them scanned before choosing to . adopt them,' she said. 'There may be a worried owner out there somewhere praying for their pet's safe return.' According to the Dogs Trust, since . microchipping was first introduced in 1989, more than four million dogs . and cats have been fitted with a device.","Staffie T-Bone was found on the Birmingham City Centre to Solihull route .

The coast guard said a problem with the ship's steering and propulsion system caused the delay of the Norwegian Breakaway, which had just arrived from a weeklong Caribbean cruise. Coast Guard officials said the ship became stuck about 7:45a.m., and Captain of the Port Gordon Loebl ordered the tugboat to to haul it in. The ship finally docked at Pier 88, at West 48th St., at around 10 a.m. Stuck: The 'Norwegian Breakaway' cruise liner, pictured in March 2013, was stuck in the Hudson River on Sunday . Spokesman Frank Iannazzo Simmons said the vessel was supposed to dock at 7a.m. 'They pulled in and tied the vessel up to the pier,' said Iannazzo-Simmons told the New York Daily News. Passenger Frank Fasulo said tempers flared as hundreds of people waited in line for hours to disembark. 'It got a little hostile because people are coming the elevators and trying to cut the line,' he said. 'Meanwhile, it's already 200 deep, so they had to get some security guards to close down the elevators and direct the people where they were going.' Ashley Hernandez, 30, told the Daily News. 'It got a little chaotic. It was really unorganized. There were people fighting when we got off the ship.' Huge: The coast guard said a problem with the ship's steering and propulsion system caused the delay of the Norwegian Breakaway, pictured in Germany last year, which had just arrived from a weeklong Caribbean cruise . One man, Roy, was waiting anxiously at the dock after he received word that his father had a heart attack aboard the ship. 'It's been nothing but problems,' he said. Other passengers said the crew handled the situation well. Norwegian Cruise Line spokeswoman AnneMarie Mathews described the glitch as a minor incident. 'The ship was slightly delayed because of strong currents in the Hudson River,' she said. 'We thank our guests for their patience and understanding.' She said a scheduled cruise to Bermuda on the Norwegian Breakaway would depart this afternoon at 5 p.m. It was not clear how many passengers were aboard. According to the company website, the 1,063-foot Breakaway holds more than 4,000 guests.","The coast guard said a problem with the ship's steering and propulsion system caused the delay of the Norwegian Breakaway .

"By . SIMON JONES . Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood is leaning towards a 'buy British-based' recruitment policy. Despite a continental flavour to the club's current squad, underpinned by the £100million summer outlay spent on Paulinho, Christian Eriksen, Erik Lamela, Vlad Chiriches, Nacer Chadli, Etienne Capoue and Roberto Soldado, Sherwood is understood to be looking for players who have a better understanding of the Premier League.

"By . Eleanor Harding . Professor Cox said BBC bosses told him he could not attempt to listen to a newly discovered planet . The quest to discover life on other planets knows no boundaries. Apart from BBC health and safety guidelines, that is. Professor Brian Cox has told how corporation bosses blocked his plans to try to make contact with a newly discovered planet – just in case some aliens happened to answer back. The physicist and TV host claimed they were worried the experiment, to be staged live on air during his hit BBC2 show Stargazing Live, might pick up a signal from ‘an alien civilisation’ – which is apparently a breach of corporation guidelines. He had hoped to point a radio telescope at Threapleton Holmes B, the planet discovered by amateur stargazers during a project publicised on his show. The telescope, based at Manchester University’s Jodrell Bank Observatory, picks up radio emission from planets. But the experiment never went ahead for fear it would breach health and safety regulations, Prof Cox claimed yesterday in a radio interview on BBC6 Music. ‘We decided that we’d point the Jodrell Bank telescope at the planet that had been discovered by these two viewers and listen because no one had ever pointed a radio telescope at it and you never know,’ he recalled. ‘The BBC actually said, “But you can’t do that because we need to go through the regulations and health and safety and everything in case we discover a signal from an alien civilisation”. ‘(I said), “You mean we would discover the first hint that there is other intelligent life in the universe beyond Earth, live on air, and you’re worried about the health and safety of it?” It was incredible. They did have guidelines. Compliance.’ An artist's impression of Threapleton Holmes B - where BBC bosses feared potential inhabitants might breach health and safety . BBC6’s breakfast show host Shaun . Keaveny was incredulous at his guest’s claim. ‘The idea that intelligent . life could be discovered and it might swear and that’s why we wouldn’t . broadcast it – it’s such a brilliant BBC thing, isn’t it?’ he said. Prof Cox also said he had a second . bizarre encounter with BBC bosses during the show when he suggested . asking volunteers to scour pictures of Mars for signs of geological . activity that computer scrutiny might have missed. ‘Someone from the BBC . said to me, “Would there have to be a prize if someone discovered it?” ‘(I said), “What do you mean? You’re . going to say to someone, you discovered the first evidence for alien . life beyond Earth – and here’s a book voucher as well?

"By . Sean O'hare . A daughter has been jailed after stealing £60,000 from her widowed mother - leaving her with 89p in the bank, and then trying to frame her brother for the crime. Claire Lyon, 29, would use her mother's card and PIN number to take out spending money for her. But what mother Patricia Lyon, 63, did not know was that her daughter was also helping herself to £60,000 of her late father's pension payout, faking bank statements and even trying to frame her brother to cover her tracks. Ms Lyons, 63, from East Hull, had no experience with banks when her husband died suddenly in September 2009 and asked her daughter Claire for help. Hanging head in shame: Claire Lyon (left), 29, was jailed for 18months after pleading guilty to stealing £60,000 of her late father's pension from her mother, Patricia Lyon, 63, (right) from East Hull . The pensioner only discovered the deception after trying to withdraw spending money for her first holiday abroad in decades - and realising there was less than a pound left. Ms Lyons said 'I used to trust my daughter. 'She came round every day with her kids and brought them round for breakfast. 'The effects of what my daughter has done are more devastating than I possibly imagined. To put it bluntly, Claire financially ruined me.' The thefts began one month after after Ms Lyon's husband Robert died at home following a car accident. He had always looked after the couple's finances and after his death Ms Lyons trusted her daughter to help. 'My daughter came to see me every day and she knew I didn't like banking,' Ms Lyons said. 'She took me with her sometimes to withdraw money but she left me in the car while she went to the bank.' Claire Lyons falsified bank statements to keep her mother in the dark and as things got worse she told her it was impossible to get money out because of problems with the cash machine. 'The . effects of what my daughter has done are more devastating than I . possibly imagined. To put it bluntly, Claire financially ruined me,' said Ms Lyon . Patricia said: 'She was being so sly. My statements were altered with Tipp-Ex. 'Every statement I got said I had £80,000 left but I didn't connect it because I didn't spend much money.' To prevent her mum becoming suspicious, Claire phoned her pretending to be a bank worker called Becky Day. She tried the same trick again as Patricia's worries grew and called up claiming to work for the fraud squad. This time, pretending to be a woman called Yvonne, Claire said police were investigating Patricia's son Andrew over the theft. Patricia said: 'She told me the police had been down to his house and I believed it. 'I was getting phone calls from the fraud squad and all sorts but it was all her.' The lies unravelled when Ms Lyons tried to withdraw spending money for a holiday in Spain with her twin sister Anne. It was to be her first holiday abroad since before she was married and the only break since a wedding trip to Dorset with her husband. Patricia called her bank and found out the money was gone and her daughter was arrested in January 2012. Claire Lyons, from East Hull, was sentenced at Hull Crown Court to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to theft. Passing the sentence on Monday, recorder Julian Smith said he was taking into account letters of reference, Claire's previous good character and her young children. A report by the Probation Service said she was remorseful and had offered to pay her mum back. But the judge told her: 'Your mother condemns herself for her naivety in allowing you free access. 'She's harsh on herself, because many would say she's entitled to the trust of her daughter. 'It's naive in the extreme to believe you will be able to repay the £60,000 you've taken. That money is lost.' Recorder Smith also ordered confiscation hearings to begin to see if any of the money could be reclaimed.","Claire Lyon, 29, would use Tipp-Ex to falsify her mother's bank statements .

"By . Richard Shears . The former lover of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has been executed by machine gun amid claims that she had been appearing in pornographic videos. And the brutal killing of singer Hyon Song-wol – and 11 other entertainers said to have performed on the videos – immediately led to speculation that Kim’s jealous wife was to blame. Hyon was among a dozen singers, musicians and dancers from two pop groups who were machine-gunned to death on August 20. Hyon and Kim knew each other as teenagers then had an affair when he was leader . The singer was reported by South Korean newspapers to have been  brutally executed by machine gun on August 20 from order's directly from the South Korean leader (pictured above with his wife) Because Kim’s wife, Ri Sol-ju,  was . once a member of the same group as the executed singer, North Korea . analysts suggested that she might have given her consent to the . execution. Fuelling the speculation, there have been rumours that her husband was still seeing Hyon. A . source in China, the only ally of the secretive Stalinist nation, told a . South Korean newspaper that the entertainers were arrested on August 17 . for violating laws on pornography. Kim Jong-Un¿s ex-girlfriend, Hyon Song-Wol, was recently seen delivering a speech at a national art workers rally on national television, despite rumours she had been executed . It was reported that they were accused of making videos of themselves performing sex acts and then selling the recordings. Some . of the musicians were also reported to have had Bibles, which are . banned in North Korea, when they were detained and all were treated as . political dissidents. Without . facing trial Hyon, said to be 28, and other members of North Korea’s . most famous pop groups were marched in front of a firing squad and . gunned down while their families and other members of the groups were . ordered to watch. The victims’ families and friends were then taken away to a labour camp, having been found ‘guilty  by association’. Married: Kim with his wife Ri Sol-ju, who apparently played alongside Hyon in the Unhasu Orchestra . North . Korea has very little contact with the outside world and it is unlikely . that the reason for the execution will ever be confirmed. But . Professor Toshimitsu Shigemura, a Japanese expert on Korean affairs, . said it was ‘simply not believable’ the entertainers were executed for . making pornography, as they could simply have been made to ‘disappear’ in the prison system. He said: ‘As Kim’s wife once belonged to the same . group, it is possible that these executions are more about Kim’s wife.’ Kim, . 30, who succeeded his late father as supreme leader of North Korea in . 2011, met Hyon ten years ago when he returned from studying in . Switzerland. However, his father, Kim Jong-il, disapproved of the . relationship and ordered the friendship to end. Hyon was rumoured to have been accused of featuring in a pornographic film alongside dozens of singers and dancers . Hyon went on to marry an officer in the North Korean military and is believed to have had a baby. But . rumours circulated that Kim was still secretly seeing her, which might . account for reports that he was seen with a mystery woman in the months . before his marriage to Ri, which was disclosed last  July. Ri and Kim . are said to have a baby daughter. Such . is the secrecy surrounding Kim’s life it was initially reported that Ri . was the singer who performed a series of bizarrely titled patriotic . songs that had, apparently, stirred the nation. However, . it was really Hyon who had recorded Footsteps of Soldiers, I Love . Pyongyang, She is a Discharged Soldier and We are Troops of the Party. Ri . was also given credit for Excellent Horse-Like Lady – also known as A . Girl in the Saddle of a Steed – another of Hyon’s songs. Kim . has already displayed the ruthlessness that has made his family the . world’s only communist dynasty, beginning with grandfather Kim Il-sung . at the end of the Korean War in 1953. He . is said to have purged his stepmother from her position as a senior . official in the ruling party to show his absolute power and had a . minister executed by mortar round for showing disrespect by drinking . during the official mourning period after Kim Jong-il’s death.","Hyon Song-wol executed amid claims she appeared in pornograhic videos .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . People born blind have more accurate memories than those with sight, scientists say. Those with no visual experience at all had the best verbal and memory skills in tests. Researchers compared those born blind, others with late onset blindness and sighted people. Participants listened to a series of words and was then asked to recall what they had heard. Skills test: Researchers have found that blind people have better memories than those with sight . The results showed that congenitally blind people remembered more words. They were also less likely to create false memories of what they had heard. Research has shown we often recall words related to those we actually hear. For example, hearing the words chimney, cigar and fire could trigger a false memory of the word smoke. Dr Achille Pasqualotto, who led the study for the University of Bath, said: 'We found that congenitally blind participants reported significantly more correct words than both late-onset blind and sighted people. 'Most of the congenitally blind . participants avoided unrelated words, therefore congenitally blind . participants can store more items and with a higher fidelity.' Results: 'Visual experience has a significant negative impact on accuracy of semantic memory' Fellow researcher Dr Michael Proulx said:  'Our results show that visual . experience has a significant negative impact on both the number of items . remembered and the accuracy of semantic memory and also demonstrate the . importance of adaptive neural plasticity in the congenitally blind . brain for enhanced memory retrieval mechanisms. 'There is an old Hebrew proverb that believes the blind were the most trustworthy sources for quotations and that certainly seems true in this case. 'It will be interesting to see whether congenitally blind individuals would also be better witnesses in forensic studies.' The University of Bath team worked in collaboration with a research assistant from Queen Mary University of London. Sighted and late blind participants remembered fewer words that were said, and more that were not. Distortions and illusions within human memory are well documented in scientific and forensic work and appear to be a basic feature of memory functioning. Several studies previously suggested that blind people - especially those with no visual experience - possess superior verbal and memory skills.

"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter For The Daily Mail . The Government should do everything possible to support the family, David Cameron said yesterday in a speech reiterating his support for marriage. He said families should be at the heart of everything politicians do, as he announced that online music videos would receive film-style age ratings to help protect children from sexual and violent content. The Prime Minister also said that in future, all government policies will have to pass a ‘family- friendly’ test. His comments came after an official study found 500,000 troubled families cost taxpayers £30billion a year. Singer Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke perform sparked controversy over their 'Blurred Lines' performance at the  2013 MTV Video Music Awards in New York . Mr Cameron said politicians were often . reluctant to talk about relationships because they did not want to . appear judgmental. However, he insisted the issue was too important to . ignore. He admitted that splitting up is the right course of action . for some couples, and acknowledged that many single parents do an . ‘amazing job’ – but repeated his support for marriage. ‘For me, . nothing matters more than family. It’s at the centre of my life and the . heart of my politics ... that’s one of the reasons why I feel so . strongly about supporting marriage,’ he said. ‘I’m not saying that . marriage is the only way to make such a commitment, and we certainly . shouldn’t judge people who feel marriage isn’t for them ... but neither . do I think we should shy away from standing up for marriage in our . society. I think it’s important that government sends a strong signal . that we back marriage.’ In a speech to the Relationships Alliance . group in London, Mr Cameron announced music videos appearing on the . websites YouTube and Vevo will carry age ratings from the British Board . of Film Classification. The move follows concerns about racy videos from the likes of Miley Cyrus and Rihanna, who are popular with young children. Scroll down for video .

Louise . Casey, the Government's Troubled Families Tsar, has claimed many . families are 'off the barometer' in the number of problems they have . ‘But that is part of what being a parent is about: . being able to deploy the use of the word “no”, and even sometimes to . deploy the use of the off switch on the television, as unpopular as that . might be, and sometimes ineffectual, because they find another screen . somewhere that is switched on.’ From October, he said families’ interests will become an explicit element of policy impact assessments, . alongside issues such as equality, the environment and value for money. Mr Cameron also said the Home Office is looking at including details of mothers on marriage registers, as well as fathers. Explaining . that the rules had not changed since Victorian times, he said: ‘This . clearly does not reflect modern Britain and it is high time the system . was changed.’ He said he was ‘proud’ that the Coalition was . recognising marriage in the tax system, and had taken action to ensure . people of all sexualities could wed.

And surprise, surprise, the offers have already started arriving thick and fast from men all over the globe. Scroll down for video . Dismissed nuptials: Lesbian Gigi Chao, left, has laughed off her father Cecil Chao's efforts, right, to find her a husband after he offered £40million to any man who could convince into a heterosexual marriage . Refusing to accept the gay union, the . property and shipping tycoon pledged the fortune to any potential male . suitor able to walk Gigi down the aisle at a traditional wedding. But his daughter, a 33-year-old . University of Manchester graduate said she thought the HKD500 million . Hong Kong dollar offer - the equivalent of £39.8 million - was 'quite . entertaining'. ‘War veterans from the US, someone from Ethiopia, from Istanbul, South America, Portugal, really just from all over the world,’ she said. One American suitor wrote: ‘I’m interested in the offer. I am a male person, who also happens to be gay.’ Another put up his brother, a  body double to George Clooney  in the 2008 film Leatherheads, as a potential mate. Spat: Cecil Chao, right, is said to have been upset when his daughter Gigi, left, announced at an event in Beijing that she had tied the knot with her long-term lover, Sean Eav, five months ago . The hopefuls, however, seem to be wasting their time. Miss Chao insists she will not be ditching her partner – no matter the quality of man her father’s millions can buy. Hong Kong billionaire Mr Chao, 76 – who claims to have slept with 10,000 women – has refused to accept his daughter’s sexuality, hence his  ‘marriage bounty’. ‘My father has an interesting interpretation of me,’ said Mrs Chao, a Manchester University graduate. ‘Homosexuality is still an uncomfortable issue for many people.’ She refused to confirm reports of her nuptials on April 4, stating: 'I'm not afraid to admit anything. But I do want to respect my parents. 'Let time be the witness.' In denial: Hong Kong billionaire Mr Chao, who claims to have slept with 10,000 women, still wants his daughter to marry a man - although he won't force her . Definitely not single: Gigi Chao, right, and her partner Sean Eav, have been together for nine years and married in Paris in 2012 . ‘I don’t mind whether he is rich or . poor – the important thing is that he is generous and kind-hearted,’ he . said of the ideal husband for his daughter. ‘Gigi . is a very good woman with both talents and looks. She is devoted to her . parents, is generous and does volunteer work,’ he told the South China . Morning Post. Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Hong Kong. According to reports, the spat between Mr Chao and his daughter erupted last week when she announced at an event in Beijing that she tied the knot with her long-term lover, Sean Eav, five months ago. A regular on the city’s social circuit and in celebrity magazines, Mr Chao has never been married. Gigi is the oldest of his three children with three mothers. In addition to the dowry, he has also offered to start his potential son-in-law up in his own business. He said the prize money was ‘an inducement to attract someone who has the talent, but not the capital, to start his own business’.

"By . Lillian Radulova For Daily Mail Australia . What better way to enjoy yourself on World Orang-utan Day than with a celebratory drink. Willow and Jantan, Taronga Zoo's resident Orang-utans, did exactly that in their Sydney enclosure on Tuesday morning. The hybrid primates were given an array of warm herbal teas to get them through the miserable rainy morning, according to their keeper Katie Hooker. 'It's not something Orang-utans would normally get in the wild, but it's just herbal, non-caffeinated tea and it’s part of the enrichment program we have for them, to make sure they get a lot of different things out of each day. We give it to them more so in winter,' Ms Hooker told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Willow and Jantan, Taronga Zoo's resident Orang-utans, celebrated World Orang-utan Day with some warm herbal teas on Tuesday . Their keeper, Katie Hooker, said they were given non-caffeinated tea as part of an enrichment program 'to make sure they get a lot of different things out of each day' 'They love it. We have lots of different flavours for them and they love the raspberry tea the best, but chamomile and ginger too.' Ms Hooker went on to describe the practical joke that Willow, the 29-year-old female Orang-utan, recently played on her keeper, saying that like little children, 'they always try to push the boundaries'. 'She's incredibly intelligent. We run training sessions with them every day and as part of them we teach them to present different body parts to us which helps with medical treatment if they ever need it. 'When I train, I use a target stick, so if I want Willow to give me her shoulder I put it on her shoulder and say ‘""shoulder"", reinforce her good response with my food and then I slowly start moving the stick further away. 'Recently in a session, I asked for her shoulder and she gave me every other body part - her nose and her foot and her hand - and eventually she went and got a stick and came back and decided to target my shoulder, so she decided she was going to train me.' 'They love it. We have lots of different flavours for them and they love the raspberry tea the best, but chamomile and ginger too,' Ms Hooker said .

Taronga is also working to promote World Orang-utan Day, which falls on August 19 each year and aims to raise awareness for the endangered species. 'They are facing a great threat from the palm oil industry,' Ms Hooker said. 'About 300 football fields worth of natural forests are being cut down every hour to plant palm oil and it’s found in a lot of products, about 8 out of 10 products on supermarket shelves including chips and cookies right through to shampoos. 'Farmers like to clear the primary forest [rather than re-planting] because they can get money for the timber they clear – and unfortunately the animals that are found end up on the black market.' The greatest threat to Orang-utans around the world is the unsustainable palm oil companies, which clears up to 300 football fields of their natural habitat every hour . The Sumatran Orang-utan is considered 'critically endangered', with less than 6,600 left around the world.The Bornean species are also declining dramatically, with less than 54,000 left in the wild . Ms Hooker recommended that Orang-utan and other wildlife lovers encourage the use of sustainable palm oil and sustainable wood, while avoiding buying wooden products made with Indonesian Teak . The devastating clearing of their natural habitat has led to the endangerment of the two Orang-utan species, with the Sumatran Orang-utan being labelled at a 'critically endangered' level with less than 6,600 left around the world. The Bornean species are also declining dramatically, with less than 54,000 left in the wild. Ms Hooker recommended that Orang-utan and other wildlife lovers encourage the use of sustainable palm oil and sustainable wood, while avoiding buying wooden products made with Indonesian Teak. 'Another thing that we can do is to write to the government to try and get them to encourage companies to label their products if they're using sustainable or non-sustainable palm oil,' she said. 'Currently, palm oil can just be listed as a vegetable oil, so as consumers we don’t have the right to make a conscious choice.'","Taronga Zoo's resident Orang-utans, Willow and Jantan, celebrated World Orang-utan Day with a warm drink of tea .

"By . Jennifer Smith . Derek Snow was sacked from his post at Aberdeen Crematorium last month following an investigation at the crematorium . A crematorium boss has been sacked amid an investigation into the historic practice of secretly burying babies' ashes across Scotland. Derek Snow left his post at Aberdeen Crematorium last month after it was revealed the facility, and several others, were being looked into amid accusations of malpractice. The probe comes after it emerged staff at Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh mixed the ashes of stillborn babies with those of adults before unceremoniously burying them in the garden without their families' consent or knowledge. A national investigation into Scottish crematoria was launched by Dame Elish Angiolini in light of the accusations. Snow was suspended last month following an investigation into practice at the crematorium in Hazlehead, Aberdeen, last year. The independent audit by Pricewaterhousecooper found the remains of children aged five or under had been scattered in the crematorium's Garden of Remembrance. But in as many as 40 cases between 1984 and 1985, this had been done without parents' consent or knowledge. It is not clear whether the families knew the ashes existed at all. No ashes had been offered to relatives of dead babies from the crematorium over a five year period, it was also revealed. The council maintained burners used at the facility were so strong that the remains of any child below 18 months would not survive cremation, a claim which has been rubbished by scientific investigation. In June the council's chief executive Angela Scott announced an investigation would be launched following claims that the ashes of babies and adults had been mixed together. The ashes of as many as 40 babies were scattered in the crematorium's garden of remembrance . An independent audit found dozens of cases in which families were not consulted about the scattering of their child's ashes and may not even have known if they existed . Today, a council spokesman refused to comment on Snow's suspension, but confirmed they were looking to refill his post. 'We do not comment on individual staffing matters. We can confirm that we are advertising for a crematorium manager. 'The Council will of course co-operate fully with Dame Elish and her investigation team. It is not Aberdeen City Council's intention to duplicate the national investigation.' Lawyers representing families in the area affected by the baby ashes scandal say the removal of Mr Snow is a sign of acceptance that 'serious mismanagement' had taken place. At Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh, distraught families reeled as they were told there was nothing to take home of their beloved baby. For 45 years, staff at the facility told parents and relatives the infants' fragile bones had not survived the strength of its furnace. They went home unsatisfied, and longing for a memento of the babies' brief lives. Then in 2012, after a change in management, the crematorium's lies were revealed. Edinburgh City Council admitted staff at the facility had been disposing of the remains of stillborn babies or infants who died days after their birth in this way since 1967. They claimed revealing to the child's parents that ashes had in fact been produced would be 'too distressing.' Instead the ashes were boxed up in cardboard and buried in the garden. Forty-seven years after the cruel practice at Mortonhall Crematorium began, an investigation was launched into the facility. Spearheaded by Dame Elish Angiolini, a former Lord Advocate, the report interviewed bereaved families and staff at the crematorium as well as others across Scotland. The 600 page report identifies and examines the cases of more than 200 babies whose cremations may have been mishandled. Concluding her report, Dame Elish wrote: 'There is overwhelming evidence that foetal bones do survive cremation, at least from 17 weeks gestation. 'The apparent belief at Mortonhall that the bones of foetuses and even stillborn and neonatal babies could not survive the cremation process continued, despite the exposure of the Superintendent and other staff to evidence and information to the contrary. There was, additionally, a longstanding and wholesale failure to comply with the local authority’s duty to keep accurate records of the cremation of stillborn and neonatal babies. The evidence in this Investigation discloses a comprehensive and long-term failure to provide an acceptable service to some of society’s most vulnerable next of kin.'

"By . Sarah Dean For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . An albino-headed crocodile named Michael Jackson has been held responsible for killing a man at the Adelaide River on Monday afternoon. A 57-year-old man was attacked and killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while they were fishing at the river, about 60km east of Darwin. The unusual crocodile, that was shot and killed, was 'one in a million', a tour operator said. The man was taken when he got into the water to unsnag his fishing line. Scroll down for video . Police said a half-albino crocodile called 'Michael Jackson' killed the 57-year-old man on Adelaide river . Police and rangers scouring the crocodile-infested river by boat on Monday night shot and killed a 4.5m crocodile around 9.30pm and the man's body was recovered later that night. His wife was treated by paramedics at the scene for shock. The Adelaide River is well known for its Jumping Croc tours, where boats travel the river and crocodiles jump for meat attached to hooks. 'Michael Jackson was one in a million, and unfortunately being an albino would have been picked on by all the others, its a big pecking order,' said Rob Marchand, owner of Wallaroo Tours, which runs Jumping Croc cruises across the river from where the man was taken. A 57-year-old fisherman has been killed by a crocodile in the Northern Territory . The man was standing on the bank of the river east of Darwin trying to retrieve a fishing hook when he was taken by the crocodile. Signs near where the man was attacked show warnings about fishing near crocodiles . He told the ABC on Tuesday that the crocodile had been in that part of the river for several years, and that the crocodiles had been fighting a lot recently, jockeying for position and preparing to breed. He said only the strongest and most aggressive crocodiles reached four metres or longer. 'The croc has only been doing what nature intends it to do, and that's survive,' Mr Marchand said. 'They know how to do three major things: eat, reproduce and aggression ... if you're not going to look after yourself, you'll find yourself being eaten.' Crocodiles shouldn't be blamed for their natural behaviour, he said, and rejected the suggestion that the Jumping Croc tours were encouraging predatory behaviour on the Adelaide River.

"By . Becky Barrow . The average couple who get divorced are hit by a total bill of around £44,000, a cost which has increased nearly two-thirds in just eight years, a report reveals today. The report, from the insurer Aviva, lays bare the crippling financial consequences of separating before the emotional turmoil, particularly for any children, is taken into account. It reveals how the cost of divorce for a married couple, or a separation for a couple who were living together, has 'soared' since it carried out the same investigation eight years ago. A study, from the insurer Aviva, has laid bare the crippling financial consequences of separating . In 2006, the average bill for a couple was around £28,000. By 2014, it has jumped to around £44,000 per couple, a rise of 57 per cent. The bill does not just come from the standard costs of legal fees, if a couple cannot separate amicably, setting up a new home and buying a new car. A common extra bill is the cost of childcare as a result of separation, typically costing £4,300 a year, such as a mother needing to return to work or take a second job. One in eight women said they 'worked longer hours or took a second job' following a break-up. One in ten, who did not work before the split, got a job. The report reveals how separating couples are also prone to 'splashing out' on items to treat themselves during such a difficult period in their lives. One in eight 'took a holiday to celebrate their newly-single status', typically spending nearly £2,000 on the trip. Others buy 'new clothes, jewellery and have a makeover' to try to cheer themselves up or sharpen up their look if they are feeling downcast about their appearance, typically spending £1,500. The report was based on interviews with 616 adults who have been married or co-habited with a partner within the last decade, but subsequently split up. Louise Colley, a director of Aviva, said: 'Two-thirds of couples who are married or co-habiting have some shared finances. 'These arrangements can take some time to unravel if a relationship unfortunately breaks down.' The latest figures, from the Office for National Statistics, based only on divorces in England and Wales, revealed how it is most likely to strike when people are in their early to mid-forties. Of the 118,140 divorces in 2012, the average age at which a man gets divorced is 45, while women typically get divorced at the age of 42, it said. Nearly one in five people who got divorced in 2012 were doing so for the second time, it said. The percentage of so-called 'double divorcers' has almost doubled since 1980. A typical marriage which ended in divorce in 2012 had lasted for 11 years and six months, a figure which suggests the infamous seven-year itch is rather pessimistic about a couple's long-term chances. The ONS also added up the number of children whose lives are disrupted by the divorce of their parents. Around half of couples who got divorced in 2012 had at least one child under the age of 16 who was living with them, it said. More than 20 per cent of these children were under the age of five, an age at which many will grow up to have little, or no, memories of their parents living together as a married couple.","Report lays bare the crippling financial consequences of separating .

"By . Oliver Todd . Pepe Reina has penned an emotional farewell to Liverpool fans as he leaves the club after nine years at Anfield. The Kop favourite is heading for Bayern Munich in a £2million deal after a year on loan at Napoli having fallen behind Simon Mignolet in Brendan Rodgers' pecking order. And for the second year running he has poured out his heart to the Liverpool fans as he leaves Anfield and Melwood for the last time before his move to Germany. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some great footage of Pepe Reina over the years . New adventure: Reina has ended his nine-year association with Liverpool to link up with the German champions . Thumbs up: Reina will be hoping to stake a claim for a first-team spot at Bayern this season . Cheerio: Pepe Reina is leaving Liverpool to join German champions Bayern Munich this summer . Success: Reina was able to celebrate FA Cup and Carling Cup success during his nine years at Liverpool . Still sharp: Reina was out with the Reds on their US tour but he said he knew his time at Anfield was over . In a letter headlined 'Once a Red Always a Red' the former Liverpool 'keeper addresses the fans and signs off with 'You'll Never Walk Alone, Pepe.' He says that he knew his time at the club was over before the last campaign and updates the fans from last year's letter on what he calls 'an honour and a priviledge.' The move to Munich reunites Reina with his former captain at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola, and he says he wants to enjoy his time with the German champions as much as his time at Liverpool. Finally, he tells fans that he now counts himself as a Liverpudlian and he looks forward to returning to Anfield as a fan. Loan spell: Reina spent a year with Rafa Benitez's Napoli after Liverpool made it clear he wasn't No 1 anymore . Quality: Reina made one appearance for Spain in their dead rubber game at the World Cup in the group stage . Around this time last year, I wrote a letter to say goodbye to Liverpool and the fans after I joined Napoli. Some people asked why I was doing it when I was only going on loan for a season and would be back within twelve months but the reality was that it was already clear to me that my time at Anfield was over. Liverpool had signed Simon Mignolet to be their new number one and I was being allowed to go out on loan so I wanted to take the opportunity to offer my thanks and bid farewell because I knew that I would not be back. I suppose this is a bit of an update now that my departure has been confirmed and I want to take the opportunity to thank everyone at Liverpool – and I mean everyone – for everything that they have done for me over years. Last time, some of my words were misinterpreted and taken out of the context in which they were meant but it would never be my intention to leave Liverpool on anything but good terms so hopefully this will put that right once and for all. I have been extremely fortunate to spend so many years at what I consider to be one of the greatest clubs in world football. It has been an honour and a privilege. The memories I have of Anfield, my team mates, the supporters and the people of Liverpool will stay with me forever. I am disappointed that I am leaving but only in the sense that I enjoyed being at the club so much and it is always difficult to say goodbye to something that is special to you. I will always be grateful to have played for Liverpool and my time at the club was always going to come to an end so we move on with no hard feelings. All I can do now is look forward to a new adventure at Bayern Munich and being reunited with Pep Guardiola, who was my first captain at Barcelona. Hopefully I will enjoy being with them as much as I enjoyed being with Liverpool and again, I am fortunate to be going from one great club to another. I will return to at Anfield some time soon, though, only next time it will be as a fan rather than a player and I hope that when I do come back Liverpool will be challenging for the biggest trophies like they always should. The final thing for me to do is to express my gratitude to everyone who has supported me in any way since I joined Liverpool in 2005 – all of the managers who I have played under, all of the players who I shared a dressing room with, all of the staff who helped me in so many ways and every single one of the fans who gave the team and myself the kind of backing that others can only dream of. I count myself as a Liverpudlian and I will be one for life. You’ll Never Walk Alone, . Pepe .","Spanish 'keeper is Bayern-bound in a £2million deal from Liverpool .

"By . Alasdair Glennie for the Daily Mail . When Alba the labrador was diagnosed with a mysterious illness that has been killing dogs around the country, she was given just hours to live. Her devastated owners were handed one last hope, however: an eight-hour operation that vets warned might kill her. But they agreed, desperate to save their beloved pet. Scroll down for video . Vets saved 11-month-old labrador Alba after she contracted mystery illness New Forest Syndrome, which killed dozens of pets, by filtering her blood . Clinicians used a treatment called plasmapheresis, which involved draining Alba's blood, pumping it through a machine to filer out the mystery disease, then pumping it back into her body again . Now following treatment, Alba, pictured, is back to normal . Owners warned to watch out for the killer bug . Now the 11-month-old has become the . first dog to survive New Forest Syndrome, which causes catastrophic . kidney failure, thanks to the pioneering treatment. Vets at the Queen . Mother Animal Hospital in Hertfordshire cured Alba by pumping her blood . through a dialysis machine which filtered out the pathogens that were . attacking her body. The . procedure, known as plasmapheresis, has been carried out on humans since . the 1950s, but had never before been tried on a dog with New Forest . Syndrome. The procedure was . risky because the machine also removes the clotting agents in the blood . that would allow the wound to heal, meaning Alba risked bleeding to . death. Yesterday, Alba’s delighted owner Rebecca Magee, 49, thanked the vets for saving her beloved pet. ‘It . was a terrifying experience,’ said Mrs Magee, who lives in Bristol. ‘It . wasn’t an easy decision. But they made it clear it was her only chance . of survival, so that made my mind up for me.’ Mrs . Magee said the procedure cost £6,800 in total, only £4,000 of which was . covered by her insurance. ‘We were lucky we could afford it,’ she . added. ‘Even then, it meant we can’t take a holiday this year. If it had . gone on much longer we would have had to stop treating her eventually. But it is hard to put a price on your pet.’ Alba’s case was featured on the BBC2 series Young Vets, which started last night. She . first fell ill in April, when she developed lesions all over her legs. Within a day her kidneys started to fail, and she was soon transferred . to the Queen Mother Hospital for expert care. There vets diagnosed her . with New Forest Syndrome, so called because it was first reported in . 2012 in the forest in Hampshire. After eight hours hooked up to the machine Alba made a full recovery and is believed to be the first dog in the UK to survive New Forest Syndrome . Vets are still unsure what causes New Forest Syndrome. Symptoms include lesions on the skin which won't heal, depression, loss of appetite and vomiting followed by kidney failure . Before surgeons treated Alba using the technique, no dog had been known to survive the illness . Since then the mystery disease has spread to Cornwall, Surrey, Worcestershire and County Durham, killing more than 40 dogs. Dan . Chan, the vet who treated Alba, said he has already seen six cases at . the Queen Mother Hospital but had not managed to save any of them. ‘These . are very early stages of understanding what the disease process is,’ he . added. ‘Alba was very lucky because her kidney was not yet completely . destroyed, and she was young and healthy enough to recover.’ Young Vets continues tonight on BBC2 at 7pm.","Alba, 11-month-old labrador, contracted illness called New Forest Syndrome .

"By . Paul Bentley . Tragedy: Daniela Ruggiero, 18, and a 17-year-old girl yet to be named died in the accident . A talented dancer was killed when her car exploded after she hit a deer on a  country road. Daniela Ruggiero, 18, who only passed her driving test in January, was travelling with a female friend when the animal ran in front of them. As she fought to control her yellow Citroen C1 it veered across the road, struck a Volvo and burst into flames, leaving Daniela and her 17-year-old friend trapped in the inferno. The identity of the second girl has yet to be formally released because not all of her relatives have been informed. Last night, friends and family paid tribute to the ‘beautiful and talented’ girls as they tried to come to terms with the shock of the sudden deaths. Miss Ruggiero, who was training to be a dance teacher at a college in Royston, Hertfordshire, had spoken to friends of her excitement at passing her test earlier this year and tweeted pictures of herself and her new three-door car. The accident happened on the rural A10 in nearby Puckeridge. The Volvo driver, a man in his fifties, suffered leg injuries as he desperately tried to rescue the girls from their burning car. He was later taken to hospital for treatment. Emergency services teams recovered the bodies from the wreckage.

"By . Daniel Mills For Daily Mail Australia . Melbourne has edged out three other Australian cities and world renowned destinations Vienna, Vancouver and Toronto as the globe's most liveable city for a fourth time. Ranked against 140 cities worldwide, Melbourne scored top of the list for its lifestyle challenges ahead of Adelaide in fifth, Sydney in seventh and Perth in ninth, which were the three other Australian cities ranked in the top 10. Brisbane finished 20 places below the Victorian capital which was given perfect scores out of 100 for health care, education and infrastructure and high scores of 95 for stability, culture and environment. Scroll down for video . Melbourne scored 100 for infrastructure and 95 for the environment category . The number one city also ranked top well for culture, scoring 95.1 for culture .

Sydney, Australia8. Helsinki, Finland9. Perth, Australia10. Auckland, New Zealand. The Economist Intelligence Unit Survey considered any city with a rating of 80 or more had 'few, if any, challenges to living standards' while the lowest rating of 50 or less meant 'most aspects of living are severely restricted.' Melbourne has remained top of the list since first taking over the number one ranking from Vancouver in 2011, which has slipped to third in the last three years. The Austrian capital Vienna finished second to Melbourne, averaging 97.5 out of a possible 100. Each of Australia's top four cities ranked scores of 94 or more for the five categories - Stability, Healthcare, Culture and environment, Education and Infrastructure. The survey considered a score of one to be 'intolerable' while at the other end of the scale 100 was considered 'ideal'. Adelaide, also known as the City of Churches, finished in fifth spot in the world rankings . The Syrian capital Damascus was ranked at the bottom of the list due to ongoing conflict in the war torn zone. It scored just 109.6 out of a possible 500, an average of just 30.5 for each of its five categories, and dropped a massive 28 per cent over the last five years. One of the key trends of the survey, according to its editor Jon Copestake, is the decline in living  standards for the lowest ranked cities. He said while it is unsurprising to see little or no movement among the top ranked cities, a period of 'destabilisation' over the last five years has hit other cities hard. Some 50 of the cities surveyed have seen declines in liveability over the last five years. 'Liveability trends tend to move slowly, so it is unsurprising to see little or no movement among the top ranked cities, but destabilisation has had a catastrophic impact for some cities with a possible knock-on effect in neighboring countries.' Recent conflicts in Ukraine, Iraq, the Palestine and North Africa - as well as the recent global financial crisis - are all issues which have affected livability, the report stated. Sydney was ranked seventh, ahead of Perth which came in at ninth . Perth was given an overall ranking of 95.9 beating Auckland, in New Zealand, for ninth spot .","Melbourne ranked the most liveable city by the Economist Intelligence Unit .

"By . Jack Doyle For Daily Mail . Ministers have indicated they are not prepared to block the controversial appointment of an Australian to a senior £200,000-a-year post in the House of Commons. Despite growing cross-party anger over the selection of Carol Mills as the next clerk, Downing Street is reluctant to become involved for fear it could trigger a constitutional crisis, the Mail understands. Blocking the appointment – made by a panel led by Commons Speaker John Bercow – would be ‘extraordinary’ and ministers believe there are no grounds for doing so, a source said. Carol Mills is head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in the Australian Senate in Canberra – a job which involves managing catering and other facilities . The decision means that unless Mrs Mills withdraws her candidature or the Speaker has second thoughts, the appointment could go ahead within weeks. Currently she is head of the Department of Parliamentary Services in the Australian Senate in Canberra – a job which involves managing catering and other facilities but does not involve detailed understanding of the Australian Constitution. As Commons clerk in Westminster, Mrs Mills would be required to give the Speaker detailed advice on parliamentary procedure and law, as well as acting as the ‘chief executive’ of the House. Speaker's choice: John Bercow wants to appoint Carol Mills; Labour MP Kate Hoey wrote on Twitter that she had asked Number 10 to block the appointment . That is despite serious questions about her suitability for the job – and allegations that her department was involved in ‘spying’ on a senior Australian politician in an effort to identify a whistleblower. Yesterday veteran Labour MP Kate Hoey wrote on Twitter that she had asked Number 10 to block the appointment. And Tory MP Rob Wilson wrote to Leader of the Commons, William Hague, expressing concerns at claims that Mrs Mills’s department ‘oversaw the CCTV spying on a senior Labour senator’s office for the purpose of unmasking a whistleblower and also recorded a senator’s movements’. The investigation into the claims is not due to report until next year. He called on Mr Hague and Mr Cameron ‘to use your good offices to find a way to block the appointment of Mrs Mills, at least until such time that matters become clearer’. Leader of the House William Hague (left) has been on to find a way to block the appointment of Mrs Mills; Robert Rodgers (right), the outgoing clerk, is not only much respected in Westminster but he is also the author of two best-selling books about parliamentary arcana: Order! Order! and Who Goes Home? He said the appointment could be ‘extremely damaging’ to Parliament. Yesterday a Whitehall source said he ‘would not expect’ Number 10 to intervene. ‘For the Government to overturn the decision of the Speaker and the Speaker’s panel would be extraordinary,’ he added. Former Speaker Betty Boothroyd has warned that Mrs Mills would be ‘totally out of her depth’. She said Speaker Bercow may have made the appointment because he wants to get his own way and ‘not refer to anybody or not take anybody’s advice’. Outgoing clerk Sir Robert Rogers has had a difficult relationship with Mr Bercow. His deputy, David Natzler, was a leading candidate for the role, but was not selected. He has reportedly asked for documents relating to the selection process, raising suspicions he may launch a legal challenge. A Cabinet Office spokesman said they would not be drawn on the issue, adding: ‘This is a matter for the Speaker of the House of Commons.’","MPs from all sides want to stop Carol Mills getting the £200k-a-year job .

"By . Daniel Mills For Daily Mail Australia . Ray Hankin's pelicans follow him around the shop for hours a day . They're often Ray Hankin's first customers through the door and the last to leave at the end of the day, but they aren't people, they're pelicans. Mr Hankin's bait and tackle shop at Forster, on the NSW mid-north coast, three hours north of Sydney, is anything but you're ordinary fishing store. Not only is the Red Spot Boat Shed constantly inundated with keen anglers looking to buy the bait to their next catch, it's also being overrun by some eager and inquisitive pelicans eyeing off the delicious smorgasbord of tasty treats. Mr Hankin said the pod of four pelicans have been walking through his door off and on ever since he began nursing an injured pelican, 'Heather,' back to good health a few years ago. 'She now follows me around the shop for hours each day,' he said. 'She might follow me in to the kitchen or just look outside the window to see what's going on.' 'Heather turned up crook and I nursed her back to health. Scroll down for video . Heather - one of Ray's regulars - surveys the bait list on the board of his tackle shop before being fed . And she's not the only 'movie star' walking around in the bait and tackle shop, co-owned by Hankin and his ex-wife and business partner, Pi Sjostrom-Hankin. The 57-year-old, whose business has become somewhat of a sanctuary for injured pelicans, also nursed a Pelican with a clipped wing back to health which had a 'sort of grey looking texture.' Over the years there has also been 'Pat,' who had a bent nose similar to a friend of Mr Hankin's who died, and another with a broken wing he had to amputate. Mr Hankin said when he saw 'Pelican Pat' turn up on his doorstep he thought it was a reincarnated version of his friend. 'We thought he had reincarnated as a pelican when he came to see me.' A pod of pelicans walk in for a look and to escape the rain during a wet day at Forster on Tuesday . Mr Hankin's visitors often squabble over who is going to be fed first . Mr Hankin, originally from Sydney, settled in Forster 30 years ago because he loved its laid back lifestyle, surf and was a mad fisherman. 'We used to always holiday in Forster, before I started the partnership in the business with my wife.' 'I always liked it here, always surfed and spent a few years travelling and surfing around the place.' He said only in recent years has he invited pelicans to 'waltz into the shop'. 'They're sometimes just there waiting for me when I open the shop.' Once through, they gaze at the smorgasbord of available baits as if looking at a menu in a restaurant waiting to be fed. 'Mullet is their favourite.' he said. Asked if he ever gets sick of them walking around, he said: 'they can be like a child sometimes, they're a bit naughty'. 'The only time I really can keep them away is with the dogs, but I can assure you I do nothing to hurt them.'","Ray Hankin has a pod of pelicans visit him in his fishing store .

"By . Michael Zennie . A set of mastodon tucks and a stone-age tool dredged together out of the Chesapeake Bay by fishermen suggest that human could have settled in North America thousands of years before previously thought, according to a controversial new study. The mastodon remains are 22,000 years old, according to radio-carbon dating - up to ten thousand years older than the Clovis culture, thought to be the first settlers in the Western Hemisphere. Most researchers believe the first humans inhabited North America between 13,000 and 16,500 years ago after crossing the Bering Strait land bridge from Asia. This flint tool, which was found with a 22,000-year-old mastodon skull in the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay. It could be proof that humans inhabited America up to ten thousands years before previously thought . The mastodon tusk that was hacked off a skull found in the Chesapeake was carbon-dated to 22,000 years old . Despite the incredible claims, much of the archaeological community remains skeptical, Live Science reports. 'The bottom line is, there simply is no context for these discoveries,' University of Arizona-Tuscon archaeologist Vance Holliday told the site. He added: 'There's absolutely no DNA evidence.' Just because the two items were found together, he argues, doesn't meant that they were from the same time frame. There is no way to prove the flint tool is as old as the mastodon skull, Dr Holliday said. The incredible archaeological find was discovered in 230 feet of water 60 miles off shore in 1974. Fishermen who were dragging their scalloping nets across the bottom of the bay snagged a massive mastodon skull and dragged it to the surface. Also in the net was a flint knife. The skull of the giant ice-age beast was too big to carry back to shore, so the crew cut off the tusks and teeth and threw the rest back in the water. The captain of the boat donated his artifacts to the local Gwynn's Island Museum in Virginia, where the sat unnoticed for near 40 decades. These are the teeth hacked from the mastodon skull in 1974. They suggest the beast was less than 30 years old when it died . They were re-discovered by a University of Delaware geologist, who alerted Dennis Stanford, an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Institution. Dr Stanford believes that the tool shows wear - proof, he says, that it was used before it was submerged in water. The Chesapeake has been underwater since the last ice age ended 14,000 years ago - meaning the tool is at least 14,000 years old. Dr Stanford, however, believes it was used to butcher the mastodon, which would make it 22,000 years old, according to Live Science.","A flint knife was found with a mastodon skull in the Chesapeake Bay in 1974 .

"By . Jill Reilly . Harpal Singh, 51, made £5,000 each time he set up bogus marriages between East European woman and Asian students . A ringleader in charge of organising sham weddings across Britain was jailed today after being caught at his own fake marriage. Harpal Singh, 51, made £5,000 each time he set up bogus marriages between East European woman and Asian students whose visas were running out. Singh, from Forest Gate, east London, set up weddings with Czech women living in Britain - because their EU citizenship would allow their new husbands to live in the UK. But a court heard his criminal network was uncovered by police when he was stopped from going through with his own fake marriage. And he was discovered carrying a bag full of other people's identity cards and 'marriage packs'. Prosecutor Andrew Davies said: 'Singh would arrange marriages for Pakistani, Indian and Nepalese men who were either about to have visas run out or had overstayed. 'He would arrange for them to marry Czech women who had EU residency and therefore could confer this to any husbands. 'As far as we can ascertain he arranged four sham weddings - one of which was his own. 'The men would pay him to facilitate the marriage and the Czech women would be paid to get married to provide EU citizenship.' Cardiff Crown Court heard Indian-born Singh entered Britain in 2006 on a six month visa with his wife and three children. Czech woman Romana Nistrova, 23, agreed to enter into a sham marriage organised by Singh after getting into financial difficulties . But after two failed immigration applications in 2009 and 2011 he was caught trying to marry a Czech woman at Cardiff Register Office in May last year. Singh was caught out after registry officials did not believe his divorce documents were genuine - and he was arrested on the morning of his sham marriage. Mr Davies said: 'He had two bags with him which had a number of other people's documents and passports in them. 'Some were related to sham marriages we could identify and others we could not. 'He retained the ID documents and cards of participants to encourage them to pay the money and go through with the sham marriages.' Pakistani student Haider Ali, 23 who had paid Harpal Singh £4950 to arrange a sham marriage 11 days before his visa ran out - he was jailed for 12 months. Right,  Romana Nistrova, who is currently four months . pregnant, was given a 12 month suspended prison sentence . The documents in his bag led to the arrest of two Pakistani students and a Czech woman who were planning to enter into sham marriages organised by Singh. They sat next to Singh in the dock and all four defendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to avoid immigration enforcement action by deception. The bogus marriages were due to go ahead in registry offices around the UK - in Cardiff, Leeds and Motherwell. The court heard Pakistani student Haider Ali, 23, had paid Singh £4,950 to arrange a marriage to take place 11 days before his student visa ran out. Ali, from Surrey, was due to marry a pregnant 19-year-old Czech woman called Jesika Horvatova who has since gone on the run. Another Pakistani student Awais Ahmad, 23, had been in the UK for four years when his student visa was running out. At Cardiff Crown Court Judge Neil Bidder QC told the four: 'These actions are an attack on the proper system of immigration control and also the institution of marriage' Ahmad from south London, was due to enter into his sham marriage a month before his visa ran out. Czech woman Romana Nistrova, 23, agreed to enter into a sham marriage organised by Singh after getting into financial difficulties. Nistrova, from Birmingham, came to the UK with her mother and five siblings in 2006 and is currently four months pregnant. Judge Neil Bidder QC told the four: 'These actions are an attack on the proper system of immigration control and also the institution of marriage. 'You, Singh, planned to make money by exploiting people's desires to remain in the country and preyed on women's financial hardship. 'Ali and Ahmad deliberately intended to avoid immigration controls to remain in the UK when lawful efforts had failed. 'And it is really very surprising to most people that women could contemplate going through a marriage ceremony for financial gain. 'It is a shameful thing that you did - a truly shameful thing.' Judge Bidder gave Nistrova a 12 month suspended prison sentence and ordered she complete 100 hours community work. He sentenced Ahmad and Ali both to 12 months in prison - and they walked free from court after serving six months in custody while waiting to be sentenced. Judge Bidder jailed Singh for four years and 20 weeks. He told Singh: 'It is my view that you should be deported.'","Harpal Singh, 51, made £5,000 a time setting up bogus marriages .

"By . Mario Ledwith . Chris Huhne has landed a high-profile job with an energy company three months after leaving prison. The former Energy Secretary is expected to earn around £100,000 a year despite working only two days a week for an American company. Mr Huhne, 59, and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce were both jailed for eight months in March for perverting the course of justice after he admitted passing speeding points to her. Cashing in: Chris Huhne has secured a new job advising an energy firm for £100,000 a year . They were both freed and later fitted with electronic tags after serving just two months of their sentences. A profile on the website of his new employer, Zilkha Biomass Energy, describes Mr Huhne as ‘one of the pioneers in calling for political action to deal with global warming’. But it makes no mention of his conviction, instead focusing on his political roles and work as an ‘award-winning journalist’. Mr Huhne has been given the job as the company’s European chairman despite leaving his post as Lib Dem Energy Secretary only last year, and potentially having a detailed knowledge of sensitive Government dealings. However, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, a public body that considers applications for new jobs from former ministers, is believed to have given permission for him to take the role. Ex-wife: Vicky Pryce was jailed alongside her estranged husband for perverting the course of justice . The committee is reported to have said that Mr Huhne had ‘not been involved in the development of policy, award of grants or regulatory work that might have impacted on ZBE’. A spokesman told The Sun that the ex-Cabinet minister ‘was not aware of any contractual relationship between his former department and ZBE and had no access to commercially sensitive information about any competitors’. After his release from HMP Leyhill, an open prison in Gloucestershire, Mr Huhne returned to his £1.2million home in Clerkenwell, London, where he lives with his partner Carina Trimingham. He said after his release: ‘I would just like to say once again, as you know from the night I was sentenced, I said that I was very sorry for what I had done. ‘It has been a humbling and sobering experience. I would like to thank all of those who have written to me – hundreds of letters that I have had – and all my family and friends who stood by me. ‘And I would also just remind you that I have served only part of my sentence and therefore it is not appropriate to say more. I would now like to get on, get back to home, and continue with my life.’ Jonathan Aitken, another former minister who has spent time behind bars, said Mr Huhne found prison ‘fascinating’.","Former Energy Secretary employed by Zilkha Biomass Energy for £100,000 .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . Mandi O'Rourke died in a swimming pool at a friend's house in April . A nurse died after collapsing into a swimming pool at her friend's house while four times the legal drink drive limit. Mandi O'Rourke was suffering a heart disease when she was invited back to the property of a friend in April for a swim. The 47-year-old from East View, Cramlington, had been drinking when she collapsed into the water at the property in Kenton, Newcastle. Toxicology reports found the nurse who worked at Nuffield Hospital would have been four times over the legal drink drive limit when she died. Pathologist Jennifer Bolton said she had died from a combination of the effects of alcohol and her disease. 'She died from heart disease and the effects of alcohol. It just so happened she was in a swimming pool at the time it occurred,' she said. The inquest heard how Miss O'Rourke had been drinking with friends at the Jubilee Pub in Kenton when they went back to the property. 'From the CCTV you see all of them in the pool having a drink,' said Detective Constable Dave Croskery of Major Crime. 'Mandi got upset with her boyfriend and left the pool in a swimming costume.' 'She came back about 20 minutes later wearing her bra and knickers when two others were still in the pool. They left, leaving Mandi in the shallow end. 'You see her having an event and she goes face down and drifts towards the deep end and tries to grab the end. 'The footage then shows her sink to the bottom.' Assistant coroner Andrew Hetherington recorded a conclusion of natural causes. Speaking after the inquest at Newcastle Civic Centre, Miss O'Rourke's family said she will be 'greatly missed'. 'We are very distraught and we still haven’t recovered,' said her father, Michael O'Rourke. 'Grieving takes a long time, particularly when it’s your daughter. You don’t expect to see them go before you. 'You expect them to see your lifetime through. You expect the shoe to be on the other foot. She’s going to be a great miss.' 'She used to come to mine most Sundays for lunch and I still look out of the window to see where she is. I know she won’t be there but it would be nice if she did come.' The 67-year-old said his daughter was committed to her job as a theatre nurse, and that her heart disease had come 'out of the blue'. 'She came from a family of nurses - both myself and her mother were nurses.' A coroner concluded natural causes as the cause of death. A pathologist added the woman died of the effects of alcohol and heart disease and that she happened to be in a swimming pool at the time of her death . CCTV footage shows the woman 'having an event' in the swimming pool before sinking to the bottom . Paying tribute to his daughter, Michael O'Rourke (right) said she would be 'a great miss' and that her heart disease had come 'out of the blue' 'At 18 she started to train at the Freeman Hospital as a nurse and she then worked at the Nuffield in Jesmond. 'She enjoyed her job as a theatre nurse and she was very good at it. 'She had suffered problems with her back and had discs removed and she was on the sick at the time of her death.' 'The heart disease was totally out of the blue.' 'She worked in an operating theatre and was working all day with other doctors and nurses and no one picked anything up because there was nothing to pick up. 'Anyone could be suffering from it and unless we have regular check-ups we don’t know.'","Mandi O'Rourke had a heart disease and had been drinking when she died .

The video, which has not been verified, appears to show fishermen being murdered as they struggle to stay afloat. The horrific footage, which is too violent to publish in full, lasts for 10 minutes and 26 seconds. A Fijian police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: 'We can confirm that we have seen the video and are investigating it.' Scroll down for video . At least four men appear to have been murdered at sea in a shocking video that appeared on YouTube. Here one man is seen clinging to an overturned boat as gun shots hit the water around him . Three fishing boats appear in the water, including a Taiwanese tuna longliner, as a man aboard another boat films the shootings in the sea. Heavy gunfire can be heard at the beginning of the video and around three minutes in the first men floating in the choppy water appear. Voices coming from the boat that the video is filmed on, translated by ONE News, appear to yell in Vietnamese: 'If you see anyone, just kill'. Over the tannoy another voice shouts: 'Look ahead there, one and two.' Three large fishing vessels are seen in the water near the boat where the shots seem to be fired from . Left to right: A man was seen clinging to an overturned boat in the sea. Shots were fired at him and bullets splashed in the water when they missed. After around a minute of shooting he appeared to be killed. Another man swam away from the overturned boat but was also shot. The footage shows a man's body sinking into the water surrounded by red blood. Afterwards the men who appear to have carried out the attack posed for photos on their boat (top picture). Shots ring out as they repeatedly fire at the men in the sea until they are killed and a cloud of red blood spills out into the water. Then, around four minutes into the video, a man is desperately seen clinging on to the debris of a small overturned boat. Having spotted him, the men shoot continuously until more blood appears and he begins to sink under water. A man appears to put his hands up in a sign of surrender while floating in the water but he is later shot . A man was shot while clinging to the boat and after around a minute of gunfire aimed at him he was killed (left). Another man in a red and white striped t-shirt was also killed as he tried to swim away from the boat (right) The camera pans away but returns when they seem to realise he hasn't died and they continue shooting at him until he finally looses his grip on the debris and sinks into the sea. The camera then zooms in on the seemingly dead floating bodies of the four men in the water, one of whom is wearing a red and white stripped top and another appears naked, as men aboard the boat can be heard cheering. At the end of the video they turn the camera on themselves and pose together for selfies on their mobile phones as they appear to congratulate themselves. It is currently unclear when or where the video was taken but police are reportedly looking for the university student in Suva, Fiji, who uploaded it for more information.

"By . Sarah Gordon . A young boy filmed a shark swimming in the shallows of a popular tourist beach in Corsica. Grabbing his father's mobile phone, the boy dashed to the water's edge to capture the footage, showing the shark swimming just metres away from him. The sighting comes just days after beaches were closed in both the South of France and Spain - near Barcelona - following blue shark sightings. Referring to himself simply as Chihab, the father of the boy told Le Parisien newspaper: 'Its body was very thin. It looked a bit listless and really disorientated. It wasn't at all aggressive.' Hi wife Annabella added: 'The Corsicans couldn't believe us at first. Fortunately we had the video as proof.' The animal has been identified as a blue shark, the same species that has also closed other beaches in both France and Spain in recent days. Spanish lifeguards shut six beaches in and around Barcelona after spotting three blue sharks of up to 1.5m long swimming close to the shore. Swimming was also banned at several beaches in the South of France last Wednesday, including Canet Plage near Perpignan, after a number of blue shark sightings. Holiday spot: The blue shark was spotted near the beaches on the popular island of Corsica . Dramatic footage: The young boy grabbed his dad's mobile phone to video the shark in the shallows on a Corsica beach . Attacks on . humans by blue sharks are very rare and of the nine that have been . recorded, most involved divers who had been fishing and had attached . their catch to their belts. However, . it is considered extremely unusual to spot the sharks so close to the . shore and experts are concerned they could have followed fishing boats . into the shallows, which would mean they are in feeding mode. Richard Peirce, chairman of the Shark Trust, told The Telegraph: 'If I had a beach full of people I would probably close it.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond wants to hold a referendum on independence by autumn 2014 . Scotland could break away from the UK within three years under plans unveiled today. Alex Salmond hopes to declare independence within 18 months of a ‘yes’ vote in the referendum due to be held in autumn 2014. A countdown to becoming a standalone nation would culminate with Scotland Independence Day in March 2016. Two months later an election to a new parliament would be held, with lawmakers chosen to draw up a new constitution, which could outlaw ‘weapons of mass destruction’ in Scotland. But critics said accused the ruling Scottish National Party of having ‘hopelessly underestimated’ the scale of creating a new country, renegotiating 14,000 international treaties and agreements. The Holyrood government launched its Transition to an Independent Scotland today, claiming it would ensure a smooth transition to a new nation. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon the paper ‘provides the people of Scotland with a clear road map as to how Scotland would make the journey from a devolved system of government with the levers of power retained at Westminster, to a nation in which the powers of our national Parliament are complete and in which the people are sovereign’. Last week the independent Electoral Commission rebuffed attempts by the SNP to use a ‘leading’ question in the referendum, warning that asking voters ‘do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country’ was designed to secure a yes vote. Instead the question will be: ‘Should Scotland be an independent country?’ Ms Sturgeon repeated her call for talks about the process of potential independence but the UK Government has insisted there will be no pre-negotiation. The most recent poll put support for independence at 32 per cent, while opposition stood at 47 per cent. Scottish Secretary Michael Moore, a Liberal Democrat MP, accused the Scottish Government of creating a distraction from substantive issues. Mr Salmond and Deputy Nicola Sturgeon, published the timetable for Scotland becoming an independence nation but opponents accused them of underestimating the scale of the task . He said: ‘Once again, they are devoting their energy to the picture-frame when they don't have a painting to put in it. ‘We haven't even got a date for the referendum, let alone any detail on what independence would mean for people in areas like the economy, welfare, energy and financial services. ‘People in Scotland appreciate the benefits of remaining part of the United Kingdom family and that is why they remain strongly opposed to independence.’ Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added: ‘The SNP have hopelessly underestimated the scale and complexity of this. They would have to negotiate over 14,000 international treaties, a currency, the division of assets, membership of Nato and the host of international organisations. ‘To say they will bang all this through in just 16 months is absurd. This will give most people in Scotland the shivers and fuel suspicion that the SNP are just making it up as they go along.’ However, the SNP said the paper ‘puts pressure’ on the pro-UK campaign group, Better Together, which includes the Lib Dems, Labour and Conservatives. Annabelle Ewing, an SNP MSP on Holyrood's Referendum Bill Committee, said: ‘The No campaign so far has done nothing except say 'No' to every positive thing that is proposed for Scotland - that is why its support has slipped since the new year, and why we now require a swing of just over 7.5 per cent for Yes to move ahead in the polls.’","Scottish government publishes timetable for independence if public votes 'yes' in autumn 2014 referendum .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Britain is facing an 'autumn chill' over the coming days as temperatures are predicted to drop into single figures in some parts of the country. Wind from Scandinavia and the Arctic will send the mercury as low as 2C in parts of Scotland while the Lake District and Cumbria could hit lows of 4C. Forecasters have even warned there could be a chance of sleet in hilly areas as summer draws to a wet and cold close. Gloomy: A grey cloud develops over Brighton as residents look to make the most of the last signs of summer on the beach . Brave: The Brighton and Hove Sea Swimmers wade into the water below the pier for their daily swim. Parts of the South Coast experienced highs of 18C today . Relaxed: A woman reads her book while reclining on a deck chair on Brighton pier, enjoying what could be one of the last days of sun this summer . The conditions look set to remain unsettled until next weekend, with showers expected alongside the blustery conditions. Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, told The Daily Express: 'Temperatures are really backing down over the next week, right down into single figures or freezing in places bringing some frosts. 'There will be some thick early morning mists and chilly winds as air comes into Britain from the Arctic region. There is a real autumn chill on the way, feeling more like October than August for at least a week.' The cold snap comes after former hurricane Bertha unleashed a week of sudden heavy downpours and extreme weather. However, in some parts of the South East today, highs of 18C prompted people to visit the beach, with sunbathers making the most of the glimpse of sunshine in Brighton. Music fans also arrived at Hylands Park in Chelmsford, Essex, and Western Park in Staffordshire for the first day of V Festival under relatively clear skies. Around 90,000 people are expected to descend on the two sites over the weekend - and face the prospects of showers tomorrow. Fans will however try and not let the rain spoil the acts, with the likes of Justin Timberlake, The Killers and Paolo Nutini set to take to the stage. The Met Office has confirmed the UK saw almost the entire normal rainfall for August during the first half of the month with 3.4ins so far. However the average temperature is slightly above average at 15.2C, but the cold snap could bring that down.

"By . Ruth Styles . From battling commitment phobes to making time for long distance lovers, finding love in the digital age isn't always the easiest of tasks. But that could all be about to change if Danielle Waller, 30, gets her way. Dubbed 'the UK's number one matchmaker', the Australian has brought more than 40,000 couples together. So what's the secret of finding a long term love? According to Waller, it's all about trying new things and being open to romance - even when it comes in the most unlikely form. Scroll down for video . Expert: Danielle Waller has brought together a grand total of 42,000 couples during her matchmaking career . 'I think the biggest mistake is sitting back and expecting love to stroll on over and high-five you,' insists Waller, who also works as a dating guru for Speeddater.com. 'It’s a very romantic idea to trust in fate but it’s a mistake not to be proactive with your love life.' Instead, she says, it's better to work on getting out and about and finding new ways to meet people, whether that's in a bar, a class or even online. Not that she's ready to recommend Tinder. 'Everyone seems to be on Tinder to find love in their pants,' she laughs. 'I think the chances of finding love on there are pretty low.' While Tinder might be out, everywhere else is, in Waller's world, a happy hunting ground. 'There is so many places to meet people,' she enthuses. 'On the tube, at a gig, at a housewarming party, singles event and even . online. Mix it up – if you approach dating in the same way you always . have you will get the same results, which is often no results. Hard at work: Danielle puts her talents to the test and brings a potential pairing together at dating event . Matchmaking the modern way: Danielle compares notes on participants at a singles event . 'Always be . open to the possibility of meeting new people as you never know where . it could lead.' So how do you know when you're onto a winner? While Waller says looks undoubtedly do play a part, making sure you're both 'on the same page' is key to making things work. 'All sorts of things factor in here but . it mainly comes down to chemistry and compatibility,' she explains. 'Chemistry is . unexplainable but compatibility is very much based on whether you are on . the same page or not. 'Sharing the same values, interests and objectives . in life means you'll still be compatible in the long term.' She also suggests not setting too much store by 'lists of qualities' and instead being open to people who tick most - as opposed to all - of your boxes. 'I think being a little picky can be a . positive as no one should ""settle"" for someone but I would say that dating with a checklist eliminates all the fun. Modern romance: According to Danielle, dating should always be fun and (ideally) as relaxed as possible . Shared interests: Mutual passions, whether dogs or books, boost the chances of long term love . 'It’s perfectly fine to insist on being with someone who is loyal, caring . and so on but it’s important not to sweat over the small stuff.' If you do decide to take the plunge and go online, Waller suggests using photos to share a glimpse of your interests, on the grounds that very few suitors will have the time to trawl through dull lists of personal qualities. 'The most important aspect to a dating . profile is your profile picture,' she explains. 'I would add extra images which say something about you and your . personality - they make a great conversation starter. 'So, if you spend . every bank holiday in a different city or are crazy about rock climbing . you should show this off. The aim is to attract people with similar . interests who you could potentially hit it off with.' Your biography should be kept short, sweet and snappy and ideally avoid tired cliches (think 'live, love, life') while conveying a sense of who you are. 'Don’t fall into the trap of being generic,' adds Waller. 'Listing a . bunch of qualities can seem empty so try showing these qualities instead. 'Don’t say you are fun with a good sense of humour and then write a dull . profile - you have to sell yourself.' Waller herself is happily coupled up but says when she was single, similar tips came in handy and ultimately helped her find her own boyfriend. 'I spent a few years happily single as I . was content in my life and then I . went on a dating spree,' she chuckles. 'I did everything, including online dating and downloading . apps, and attended singles events. I met some great guys, went on lots of dates and also committed to a few . relationships. 'Several months after my man-mission started, I went . snowboarding and ended up meeting the love of my life.' And with a little help from Waller, so could you. She's brought more than 40,000 couples together but while Danielle Waller says there are no hard and fast rules, there are ways to boost your chances of finding long term love. From ditching your emotional baggage to getting out and about, here are her top five tips for finding long lasting love. LEAVE YOUR BAGGAGE BEHIND . Always feel ready to date. Not because you are lonely, but because you are ready to make your life even more awesome. STOP DATING YOUR SOFA . Be . proactive, try out different classes; go to singles events and online . date until you get RSI from typing.  If you are serious about making . love happen you need to try every avenue and make the most of each . opportunity. BE OPEN-MINDED . Give people a chance, not everyone experiences love at first sight. DON'T STICK TO YOUR 'TYPE' Knowing . what you do and don’t want is a great thing but why not mix things up. You might just surprise yourself, because if your ‘type’ hasn’t worked . out so far, then maybe you need to be realistic about what your ‘type’ should be. BE POSITIVE . Smile. Laugh at the bad dates. Write a blog about it.","Danielle Waller, 30, has brought more than 40,000 couples together .

"By . Daniel Mills For Daily Mail Australia . A downhill mountain biker who careered into a young boy at high speed said he could have killed the child had he not been wearing a helmet. Professional rider Nick Van Lier, 20, was hurtling down the dirt track at the Black Hill bike park in Ballarat when he suddenly noticed a young boy, aged about four or five, running across his path. The quick thinking rider made very effort to avoid making contact with the child, who yelps on impact before his head makes solid impact with the ground. Scroll down for video . The rider went in the wrong direction to avoid the boy and ended up hurtling into him at high speed . The boy braces for impact and Mr Van Lier turns his wheel at the last moment to avoid hitting him front-on . The young boy was running across the path when the quick thinking rider slammed on his brakes . Other screams can also be heard coming from a nearby child as the rider comes to a halt and rushes to the boy's aid. The footage, taken from a camera mounted to the rider's helmet, was uploaded to YouTube where Mr Van Lier commented on the incident. An experienced downhill racer, he wrote that he was travelling to fast to avoid the boy and had 'no doubt' that the child's helmet saved him from a serious head injury and possibly even death. 'I have no doubt that the little fella's helmet saved him some extensive head injuries, and possibly his life,' he said. 'The force of that impact, though reduced as best I could, would have easily been enough of a 'king hit', if he had not been wearing a helmet I dare say he'd be in a hospital or worse.﻿' Mr Van Lier's YouTube channel is filled with videos of him riding along similar circuits to the Black Hill bike park, in Victoria - the track he was riding on when he hit the child. He says he is a rider for Knolly Bikes, a brand of mountain bike specifically designed for downhill racing. The boy was hit by the bike before being completely run over . Miraculously he escaped unhurt despite hitting his head hard on impact . The whole incident was over in less than five seconds from the time Mr Van Lier first noticed the boy . After letting out a yelp, the boy managed to pick himself up from the incident . Worried by the impact of the collision Nick Van Lier went to his aid to see if he was OK . Describing the event, Mr Van Lier said he was on a 'practice run' the day the incident happened and everything 'was going awesome' until he came to the top of the jump. 'Practice run was going awesome until I got over the top of this blind drop to find a small child standing on the landing,' he said. 'Unfortunately we both chose the same way to avoid each other, luckily he had a helmet on and was OK. Gave me a heart attack though!' The video was originally uploaded to the social media site Reddit by user Otiotori. 'It's my buddy Nick he was out training for a race at a well signed and official mountain bike park,' the poster wrote. 'This is a VERY blind drop so Nick had no chance. You can (only) see the trail once you're airborne.' Thankfully, both rider and boy escaped the incident unharmed.","Nick Van Lier careered into a young boy while travelling downhill .

Reeves has advanced-stage Alzheimer's disease. 'My dad has been my hero my entire life and I know that if he was well, he would be at my wedding front and center,' Miriam Davis, 31, told The Blade before the ceremony. 'And I thought, 'Why not move it there and it would be more of a special event?' Davis and her fiance had been planning to marry at their church in Ypsilanti, Michigan. But she worried that her father might wander off if he were away from his nursing home. The nursing home was enthusiastic about hosting the ceremony, she said. Davis said her father still knows who she is but rarely talks and can't care for himself. Reeves, a Vietnam War veteran, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2006 and moved to the Toledo nursing home two years ago when his symptoms worsened. Reeves also was a police chaplain for a time. Most recently, he was a pastor at the New Creation Church in Detroit.

"By . Alex Gore . Killed: French photographer Olivier Voisin was killed by flying shrapnel while covering operations of armed opposition groups in Syria . A French photographer has been killed by flying shrapnel in Syria while covering operations of an armed opposition group. The French government said today Olivier Voisin had been working for Reporters Without Borders near the northwestern city of Idlib. Mr Voisin, who was born in 1974, was taken to the international hospital in the Turkish border city of Antakya on Friday but died from wounds to his head and arm. He was a freelance photographer and had also covered events in Libya, Somalia, Haiti and Kenya. His death came as rebels backed by captured tanks launched a fresh offensive on a government complex housing a police academy on the outskirts of northern city of Aleppo today. The assault prompted government forces to respond with airstrikes in a bid to try and protect the strategic installation. If rebels capture the complex, it would mark another setback for President Bashar Assad's regime. In recent weeks, it has lost control of key infrastructure in the northeast, including a hydroelectric dam, a major oil field and two army bases along the road linking Aleppo with the airport to its east. Rebels have also been hitting the heart of the capital Damascus with occasional mortars shells or bombings, posing a stiff challenge to Assad's regime in its seat of power. Yesterday, opposition fighters in the east province of Deir el-Zour overran a site known as al-Kibar, which was home to what is believed to have been a partly built nuclear reactor that Israeli warplanes bombed in 2007. Bloody: Opposition fighters in Idlib, where French photographer Olivier Voisin was hit by flying shrapnel . A year after the strike, the UN . nuclear watchdog determined that the destroyed building's size and . structure fit specifications of a nuclear reactor. Syria never stated . the purpose of the site. After the bombing, the regime carted . away all the debris from the destroyed building and equipment from the . two standing structures, analysts said, adding that the rebels were . unlikely to have found any weapons in the abandoned complex. Mustafa Alani, an analyst with the Gulf Research Center in Geneva, said: 'It's more or less a shell because the Syrians decided to remove everything inside the buildings. I don't think there's anything left really of any value for the rebels.' Rebels have been trying for months to storm the government complex west of Aleppo in the suburb of Khan al-Asal, according to Rami Abdul-Rahman, director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. War-torn: The ruined buildings of Aleppo, where rebels have launched a fresh attack on a police complex . The facility also includes several smaller army outposts charged with protecting the police academy inside the compound. Retaliation: Syrian President Bashar Assad, whose forces responded to the latest rebel assault on an Aleppo police building with airstrikes . Aleppo has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of Syria's nearly two-year-old conflict. In July, rebels launched an offensive on the city, Syria's largest and one-time commercial capital, and quickly seized several neighbourhoods. The battle has since devolved into a bloody stalemate, with heavy street fighting that has left whole districts in ruins and forced thousands to flee. Rebels have also been trying for weeks to capture Aleppo's International Airport. There were no reports of fighting for the airport today, but there have been battles around a section of the road the army has been using to transport troops and supplies to a military base within the airport complex. On Friday, regime forces fired three missiles into a rebel-held area in eastern Aleppo, flattening several buildings and killing 37 people, according to the Observatory. It said the strike apparently involved ground-to-ground missiles. A similar attack on Tuesday in another impoverished Aleppo neighbourhood killed at least 33 people, almost half of them children. The Observatory reported a similar . attack today on the town of Tal Rifat, 20 miles north of Aleppo. There . was no immediate word on casualties. Also today, a French freelance photographer Olivier Voisin, who was wounded on Thursday in Syria and taken to Turkey for treatment, died of his wounds at an Istanbul hospital, the French Foreign Ministry said. Conflict: Armed rebels in Aleppo, where the government has lost control of two army bases . The United Nations says at least 70,000 people have been killed since Syria's uprising against Assad's authoritarian rule began nearly two years ago. Efforts to stop the bloodshed in Syria so far have failed, leaving the international community at a loss of how to end the civil war. A senior Syrian opposition leader said that his umbrella group has suspended participation in meetings with its Western backers and their Arab allies because of their indifference over the regime's attacks on the Syrian people in Aleppo and in other cities. George Sabra, vice president of . the Syrian National Coalition, told reporters in Cairo after . meeting the Arab League chief Nabil Elaraby: 'Assad has reached the stage of real genocide amid Arab silence and we renounce that. In Washington, the State Department condemned rocket attacks on Aleppo, saying the strikes are the 'latest demonstrations of the Syrian regime's ruthlessness and its lack of compassion for the Syrian people it claims to represent'.","Olivier Voisin had been covering operations of an armed rebels in Idlib .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . It seems almost an oxymoron: a blind marksman. Yet there are dozens of men and women across America who have been trained to shoot handguns and rifles without being able to see a foot ahead of them. One such shooters is Carey McWilliams, who was holding his guide dog's harness when he boldly walked into the sheriff's office in Fargo, North Dakota, seeking a gun permit. A skeptical clerk told him he'd need to pass a shooting test. 'So then she took a picture of me, and my application then went up through the ranks,' he told BBC. 'It got the signature of the chief of police of Fargo, the sheriff and the state attorney general's office, and they kept calling me and calling me, saying, ""There's a shooting test, there's a shooting test.""' Then the day of the test came up. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Care McWilliams is completely blind, but that doesn't mean he is unable to hunt. In 2012, he made this 120-yard neck shot with a 270 bolt action rifle . Bull's Eye: Whether they're animals or targets, McWilliams listens in carefully to determine where to shoot . McWilliams shot this 11-foot alligator with a 44-magnum bang stick at point blank range in the heart of the Florida Everglades . One by one, McWilliams took out the half-size cutouts of assailants, firing the targets from about seven yards away with a .357 magnum. All of his shots landed near the center. 'The deputy sheriff said: ""Well, you have all these stickers here telling me that you're blind, but you passed the test, so you got your permit,""' McWilliams told BBC. The sheriff added: 'Expect a lot of grief because you're a test case for the whole system, no-one's done this before.' McWilliams shot the targets by listening to the sound of the cutout being wheeled back and forth. He picked up the technique when he was 18 and begged a trainer to take him on a pistol marksmanship course run by the Reserve Officer's Training Corps. The training group, which trains military officers, had no requirements that students be a part of the armed forces. The instructor took him on reluctantly but later was aghast: McWilliams shot better than two-thirds of his class. From there, he continued to perfect his art. And once he was ready, in 2008, McWilliams moved on to hunting. Jim Miekka is one of the dozens of blind people that McWilliams taught to shoot . McWilliams listens to ducks fly across the sky, tracing the sound of wings with the barrel of his rifle, picking up on their sounds as if it were bicycle tires on a pavement. For elk, a companion will whisper general directions to him, much like a sniper's spotter would in a combat situation. 'In the beginning I thought it was a joke, that somebody was blind and wanted to go on alligator hunt,' Mark Clemens, who a hunting business in Florida, told BBC. 'Then I sent an email back and I guessed he was serious,' he added. 'And once I got him on the phone, you know, he said that he was having a hard time finding anybody that would take him. That's what the sad part was. Everybody thought he wasn't capable of doing it. He was definitely capable of doing it, if he had instructions.' Miekka uses a sonic scope of his own design, which translates visual information into audio cues so he knows where the target is . McWilliams, who once shot a black bear, owns about nine guns, including an AR-15. He says he has mentored nearly 100 blind people on how to shoot. One of his students, Jim Miekka, uses a sonic scope of his own creation to shoot. 'I found out that it worked best with a telescope,' Miekka, who invented a device that translates visual information into audio cues, told BBC. 'At about the same time my best friend Bill was getting into target shooting, and he said, ""Why don't we try mounting it on a gun and seeing how it works?""' Miekka takes pride in his marksmanship. He is quick to point out that searching on Google for the term 'world's best target shooter' returns a video of him on his range. But he doesn't go around boasting . 'I learned from Carey that you want to be somewhat discreet,' Miekka told BBC. McWilliams shot this whitetail buck with crossbow in Missouri in 2010 . For many of the people McWilliams teaches, carrying a gun is not just for sport. 'Being blind you're naturally more vulnerable to the criminal element,' McWilliams told BBC. 'You're naturally more a pedestrian. You can't avoid a dangerous situation or run from one if an attack occurs. 'So you're going to have to stand and fight with whatever means you have available. For me, that's a 9mm pistol.' Permits to carry guns are issued at the state level, and each state has its own rules on who can get a weapon. McWilliams had no problem getting a permit in North Dakota, where the statute has no language preventing a blind person from qualifying for one. In Florida, however, he could be denied one because the law says 'physical inability to handle a firearm safely' could be a reason for denial.","Carey McWilliams won't let his disability keep him away from his passion for guns .

"By . Julian Robinson For Mailonline . Abdul Rashid, pictured, and his brother Abdul Majid, have been jailed after providing a 'bespoke travel service' out of Britain for illegal immigrants . Two brothers who provided a 'bespoke travel service' for Pakistani nationals who had overstayed their student visa have been jailed for people smuggling. Abdul Rashid, 54, and Abdul Majid, 51, arranged for people to leave the UK under false identities on coach trips to Europe, according to Kent Police. Some of those who travelled were Pakistani students in the UK on expired visas - or visas due to expire, and who faced deportation back to their home country, a force spokesman said. Rashid and Majid, from Peterborough, would charge the students thousands of pounds each to book them on to commercial coach trips, following in their own vehicles with their customers' luggage, Canterbury Crown Court was told. The luggage would be handed back to the customer on the other side of the Channel and rather than board their return coach trip, the students would travel on into Europe, police said. The people who took up on the scam would then go into mainland Europe - avoiding the prospect of deportation from Britain. Detective Constable Nicky Holland-Day said: 'The defendants provided a 'bespoke travel service' for Pakistani nationals who had overstayed their student visa. 'It is an offence to facilitate the entry of a non-EU national into the territory of another EU state unless a visa has been granted permitting entry into that country. 'Furthermore, Rashid and Majid were getting rich at their victims' expense. 'They were holding down day jobs while depositing tens of thousands of pounds in cash into their bank accounts over several years. 'At the same time, Majid was telling HMRC (revenue and customs) he was a low-paid taxi driver and was claiming working tax credits from the UK taxpayer.' The scam unravelled following routine stop-checks on suspect vehicles leaving the Port of Dover. The men each pleaded guilty to breaching UK immigration law and a further charge under the Proceeds of Crime Act in June this year before being jailed at Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) Between October 2011 and February 2012, Kent Police built up a portfolio of evidence suggesting an illegal people smuggling operation was under way. Officers from the Kent Police Special Branch, in co-ordination with Cambridgeshire Constabulary, searched addresses in Peterborough in May 2012 and Rashid and Majid were arrested. The men each pleaded guilty to breaching UK immigration law and a further charge under the Proceeds of Crime Act in June this year. Rashid was jailed for three years and Majid for one year at Canterbury Crown Court on Friday. DC Holland-Day added: 'Rashid and Majid were able to grow wealthy by flagrantly breaching UK immigration laws. Their motivation was obviously financial reward.'","Abdul Rashid and Abdul Majid arranged travel abroad for illegal immigrants .

"By . John Stevens For Daily Mail . David Cameron has accused the First Minister of ‘desperate’ tactics over his claim that separation will protect the NHS from privatisation. The Prime Minister stressed health is devolved to Holyrood and controversial changes at Westminster cannot be imposed on Scots. Alex Salmond, who went green bowling in Arbroath with Scotland's Commonwealth medallists today, has argued that NHS budget cuts south of the border would be replicated in Scotland – despite the fact Holyrood has received an extra £1.3billion from Westminster over five years. First Minister Alex Salmond visits Abbey Bowling Club in Arbroath, where he played a game of bowls with Commonwealth Bowling gold medalist Darren Burnett and Sport Minister Shona Robison . Mr Salmond celebrated his first attempt at bowling - but it later emerged that he had been practising beforehand . He has persisted with the argument despite claims of hypocrisy after it emerged the Scottish Government’s own spending on private contractors rose by almost a quarter last year to more than £80million. Mr Cameron said: ‘Health is a devolved issue. So the only person who could, if they wanted to, introduce more private provision into the NHS in Scotland is Alex Salmond. ‘I think this is a desperate man recognising the argument is going away from him making a pretty desperate argument. ‘Actually because of the protection on NHS spending that the UK Government has given that we would not cut NHS spending while we have had to make difficult decisions elsewhere - that has actually made sure under the Barnett formula that money is available for Scotland as well. ‘So I think that argument does not stack up at all.’ Mr Salmond has even claimed he would legally protect Scotland’s NHS from privatisation in the constitution in an attempt to woo left wing voters. And the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign say the message is winning over voters on the doorsteps. Campaigning in Glasgow yesterday, chief executive Blair Jenkins said: ‘There are real threats and risks if we stay in the UK. ‘People in Scotland are really waking up to the extent to which the NHS in England is being privatised, that’s coming up a lot. ‘People know if we stay in the UK the austerity agenda, the pressure on public services, budget cuts, and all of that will continue. ‘There’s no doubt this is touching a real emotional nerve with people, particularly women. They can see there is a really strong argument on that front for voting for independence.’ The Prime Minister attacked Mr Salmond's claim that the NHS would be safer from privatisation after independence . First Minister Alex Salmond and the Scottish Cabinet hold the last  Cabinet meeting before the referendum on Scottish independence next month . Scottish spending on private sector healthcare rose by 37 per cent in the first five years after the SNP came to power in 2007. In 2012/13, the most recent Audit Scotland figures available, private spending had reached more than £80million – that was 23 per cent higher than the previous year alone. Unaudited figures for 2013/14 show a slight dip to £79million, but is still far higher than all previous years. Mr Salmond has argued privatisation south of the border will lead to a cut. In fact, the budget for England’s NHS is expected to increase from £105.6billion in 2013-14, to £110.4billion in 2015-16.","The Prime Minister said health is already devolved to Holyrood .

"By . Julian Robinson . A suspected burglar perched in a tree overhanging a railway line caused 17 hours of travel misery for commuters. The strong-willed fugitive climbed the tree near Charlton station in south-east London in the early hours of yesterday, and refused to come down throughout the morning rush hour. He had been chased by police after an alleged attempted burglary at a nearby retail park shortly before 2am, in a pursuit involving the Metropolitan Police helicopter. Emergency services spent hours trying to coax the man, pictured left, out of the tree . Delays caused by the incident sparked fury among passengers with a number of London-bound trains diverted or delayed. British Transport Police (BTP) sent specialist officers to try to persuade him to come down from the tree near Barney Close, but rail operator Southeastern was forced to close the track during the morning peak. Chief Inspector Jenny Gilmer said: 'Shortly after 7pm on Wednesday 13 August, a man was talked down from a tree near to the rail line at Charlton. 'The man had been in the tree since the early hours of the morning and his return to the ground marked the end of a difficult and lengthy operation involving British Transport Police, Met Police, London Fire and Rescue, Network Rail and Southeastern Trains. Delays: The strong-willed fugitive (left) climbed the tree near Charlton station in south-east London and refused to come down throughout the morning rush hour despite attempted to coax him down (right) 'The 32-year-old man was subsequently arrested on suspicion of burglary and obstruction of trains with intent and he remains in police custody. 'I'd like to thank all those who have worked tirelessly throughout the day to bring this operation to a safe conclusion and would also like to thank the local community and travelling public for their continuing patience and understanding during what was an extremely sensitive process.' Southeastern said that the tree overhangs the London-bound track and so it was not safe to run services while the man refused to come down - although trains out of London were able to run normally after an initial closure. London-bound services were diverted or delayed, and tickets were accepted on the Underground and buses. The incident unfolded close to Charlton station (pictured) in south east London and caused chaos during morning rush hour . But the delays angered passengers, many of whom took to Twitter to vent their frustration. Adam Martin-Lawrence wrote: 'How many people does it take to drag a burglar out of a tree at Charlton - apparently many, but none of them can lay a finger on the guy.' Another Twitter user, Jess Williams, posted: 'So just found out the reason my train was cancelled this morning was because a man running from the police was hiding up a tree at Charlton. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'Police were called to reports of an attempted burglary at a commercial unit on the Stone Lake Retail Park, SE7, at 1.50am on August 13. 'On arrival, officers identified a suspect and began a pursuit which also involved the Metropolitan Police's Air Support Unit, during which the man was observed running close to rail lines. 'The suspect subsequently climbed a tree next to the rail lines off Barney Close.'

"By . Martin Robinson . A Facebook tribute to the little boy . A toddler was killed in front of his mother after a television toppled onto his head as he tried to fetch a ball, an inquest heard. McKenzie Birkett-Waddington, who was 22-months-old, had spotted his toy in the bottom drawer of the chest which had a heavy set on top. But as he pulled at the drawer, the chest began to shake and the TV crashed down onto him leaving him with fatal head injuries. The freak accident happened in Burnley, Lancashire, as McKenzie's mother Jade Birkett, 21, looked on in horror as she tended to her youngest son Kian who had just woken up. An inquest at Burnley Coroners Court was told that prior to the accident on January 7 the TV had been on the floor in . Miss Birkett's bedroom whilst awaiting an internal ariel before being placed on top of the drawers. The television was described as a 'heavy old fashioned TV' and not secured to the wall. The inquest heard how Miss Birkett had moved into the property three weeks prior to her son's death with her two other boys, Mason, now five, and Kian 15 months. The three-drawer chest had been given to her whilst at her former address and the same television had sat on it 'pushed up against the wall' without problem. She had said that she thought it was 'firm and stable'. Much loved: McKenzie with his mother Jade Birkett, who has described him as a 'little diamond' Bereft: McKenzie's have been left devastated by his death, which a coroner called a 'dreadful accident' In a statement read to the court Miss Birkett described the events of the fateful morning whilst describing her middle son as a 'very lively, healthy and inquisitive lad'. She said: 'I was in bed at home and Kian was asleep in his Moses basket. I could hear that McKenzie had woken up and went to his room and got him out of his cot, Mason was sleeping at his grandmother's. I took McKenzie downstairs and waited until Kian woke up. 'At around 9.30 am I heard him wake up and me and McKenzie went back upstairs and I sorted Kian out.' She told how she put McKenzie on the floor at the foot of the bed where the chest of drawers stood whilst she tended to her other son. 'I put McKenzie down on the floor at the bottom of the bed and went round to deal with the youngest. 'I could hear McKenzie chatting away to himself and I turned to have a look at him and saw he had gone up to the chest of drawers and was standing in front of the chest of drawers. I could see he was pulling at the bottom drawer. 'It was only open very slightly. Before I could do anything the chest of drawers simply dropped forwards and the TV fell on top of him. The drawers did not fall over they just rocked.' The court heard that Miss Birkett went to his aid and removed the TV but her son was unconscious. She added: 'I could see when I looked that his toy ball was in the bottom of the chest of drawers, I think he must have been trying to get it. It happened so quickly I did not expect it to happen. I have always had the TV on there before without any problems.' Miss Birkett called an ambulance and McKenzie was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital before he was transferred to Manchester Royal Children's Hospital where he sadly died. As evidence was read out Miss Bitkett sobbed whilst being flanked by her parents. Describing her son in the statement she said: 'He started to walk when he was 16-months-old and was how they are at that age - into everything. 'He didn't like being told what to do and didn't pay much attention to me, I suppose normal for a lad his age.' Home Office pathologist Dr Charlie Wilson said that McKenzie had been a 'healthy, normal, 22-month-old boy who had suffered serious head trauma'. Following the accident, McKenzie was to undergo emergency neurosurgery at the Manchester Royal Children's Hospital but his brain was swollen and he suffered a large hematoma. He was to suffer a cardiac arrest and could not be revived. The pathologist ruled the cause of death as being head injuries.

"By . Sarah Michael For Daily Mail Australia . They came from different worlds – she a former premier's daughter who grew up on Sydney's eastern suburbs and he a long-time drug user living in a halfway home in Sydney's west. But Harriet Wran, 26, and boyfriend Michael Lee, 35, were united by their abuse of the highly-addictive drug ice. The pair had reportedly been together for just two weeks when they, along with 29-year-old Lloyd Haines, allegedly entered Daniel McNulty's Redfern unit on Sunday and stabbed him to death in a botched $70 drug deal. Scroll down for video . Charged: Michael Lee (green jumper, left) and Harriet Wran (right) are both accused of taking part in the murder of Daniel McNulty . Police tape covers Mr McNulty's apartment on Walker St in Redfern where he was allegedly stabbed to death on Sunday . The drug ice is commonly bought and sold in the housing commission block on Walker St in Redfern . Police will allege Wran knocked on the door of unit B30 at the notorious Walker St housing commission block, as Lee and Haines waited wearing balaclavas and armed with two knives and a stonemason's hammer. Investigators will claim Lee and Haines had stormed McNulty's apartment once before, and again burst into the unit on Sunday where Haines demanded 'Where is it?'. Wran, a self-confessed ice addict, told police she was 'numb on ice' desperate for a hit when she went to suspected drug dealer Mr McNulty's unit and was 'frozen' with fear during a fight which saw Mr McNulty killed and a second man, Brett Fitzgerald, wounded on his neck. In the time leading up to the alleged murder Wran was sleeping rough in Sydney's inner-city Surry Hills and Redfern, a source said. Lee, who police say has a long history of drug abuse, lived in a halfway house in Fairfield in Sydney's western suburbs. One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said she had seen a woman come and go from the house in past month but could not confirm that it was Wran because she only saw her in the dark. Used syringes are strewn across the ground outside the apartment block in Sydney's inner-city . Police will allege Wran knocked on the door of unit B30 at the notorious Walker St housing commission block on Sunday, as Lee and Haines waited wearing balaclavas and armed with two knives and a stonemason's hammer . The neighbour, who has lived next door for just over a year, said new people were always moving in and out of the home. She added that residents of the house had knocked on her door 'covered in blood' after a fight, asking for detergent to wash their clothes and police had also knocked on her door to question them about disturbances. Other neighbours said men were 'coming and going all the time' and they usually left early in the morning and returned late at night. Meanwhile Wran, heiress to her late father and former NSW premier Neville Wran's multi-million dollar estate, was living off a Centrelink payment of $560 a fortnight and had been on the dole since as early as 2012. Following Wran and Lee's arrest at Liverpool train station on Wednesday the fact they came from separate worlds was again made clear. Ex-premier's daughter Harriet Wran is 'addicted to ice' and had been living rough in the weeks before a man was stabbed to death in run-down Sydney unit .

The halfway house in Fairfield in Sydney's west where Michael Lee lives . During a brief court hearing on Thursday, Wran was represented by a team of lawyers including high-profile defence barrister Winston Terracini SC, who has successfully argued the innocence of many defendants in high-profile murder cases. Mr Terracini appeared in Liverpool Local Court on her behalf on Thursday where he did not apply for bail and said Wran would plead not guilty to the charges of murder, attempted murder and break and enter. Meanwhile Lee was represented by Legal Aid lawyer Gary Anderson, who also appeared in court on his behalf and did not apply for bail. Both are due to reappear in court on October 8. Wran started high school at all-girls private school Ascham in Edgecliff in Sydney's eastern suburbs. In Year 9 she moved to a different private school, Sydney Church of England Girls Grammar School (SCEGGS), in inner-city Darlinghurst and graduated there in 2006. In 2007 she began a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Sydney. Neville Wran died in April this year. He is pictured here with his wife Jill and his two children, Harriet and Hugo .

A friend, who wished to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia she used drugs including cocaine and ecstasy while at university but she became more focussed when she started working as a producer at Foxtel's Weather Channel. 'It really surprised me she had fallen off the rails because she seemed to have herself sorted out when she got a producer job at The Weather Channel,' he said. 'She partied pretty hard at uni but it was just pills and coke. 'But when she got her job she was really career focussed and worked very long hours.' By 2012 Wran was sharing a rented flat in Hunters Hill with another man. Her landlord said large groups of men would visit the house often during both the day and night, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Police came to the property to arrest the man she was living with three months after she moved in. The landlord said when he inspected the property it was dirty and looked like a 'crack den' with pipes and cigarettes strewn around. Ms Wran (right) was by her father Neville's bedside when he died in April this year at he age of 87 . Glamorous life: Photographs of Harriet show her in more carefree times before drug addiction took over her life . Wran had been on a days-long drug binge before the killing and had been living rough in Sydney's inner suburbs . Following her alleged murder charge other friends have described her as a 'good person'. 'Harriet was and still is, to the best of my knowledge, a kind, intelligent, thoughtful, insightful and caring woman,' another friend told Daily Mail Australia. 'I know nothing of her recent involvements and reserve my assumptions till proper proceedings have taken place.' It is understood Ms Wran had a drug problem for years and was in recovery, but suffered a relapse shortly after her father's death. At the time she was living in the family home in Woollahra but she ran away. Her father Neville Wran was one of Australia's most celebrated politicians. The Labor Party icon was the New South Wales Premier from 1976 to 1986 - he died on April 20 this year, aged 87. Harriet Wran was by her father's side when he died in April. She and younger brother, Hugo, accompanied their mother Jill to the public memorial at Sydney Town Hall. But his death would spark a bitter family battle over the estate; which included a $10 million mansion in Woollahra, as well as multi-million-dollar properties in Woolloomooloo, Palm Beach and the Yarramalong Valley.

Russian media said the 280 trucks had left Moscow and it would take a couple of days for them to make the 620 mile journey to Ukraine's eastern regions, where rebel fighters seek union with Russia. Western countries believe Russian President Vladimir Putin - who has whipped up nationalist fervour in Russia through the state-controlled media since annexing Crimea in March - might be spurred to fresh action since separatists in their main redoubt of Donetsk are encircled by Kiev forces. Rossiya 24 TV showed a 1.8 mile long . line of containers and trucks loaded with crates of water stretched . along a road with workers in a light summer wear of shorts and shirts . loading sacks of aid.

Defence force: Ukrainian government soldiers from the 'Donbass' battalion pose for a photo in the village of Mariinka, near Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine this afternoon . The U.S., French and Australian governments voiced concern that Russia - the sole international supporter of pro-Kremlin rebels in Ukraine's Russian-speaking east - could use the humanitarian deliveries to carry out a covert operation to help fighters who appear to be on the verge of defeat. Today French President Francois Hollande took up the issue directly with Putin, saying 'he emphasised the strong fears evoked by a unilateral Russian mission in Ukrainian territory.' Hollande told Putin that any mission must be multilateral and have the agreement of the Red Cross and Ukraine, according to a statement in Paris. Discussions: Russian President Vladimir Putin (front right) and Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi (front left), are seen during a meeting in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi this morning .

A Malaysian airliner was downed on July 17 with the deaths of all 298 people on board, after apparently being shot down by rebel forces. Kiev and its Western allies say Russia, which opposes Ukraine's new leadership, has been funnelling tanks, missiles and other heavy weapons to the rebels for months. Moscow denies these claims.","Convoy of 280 lorries have left Moscow bound for Ukraine's eastern border .

"By . Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia . Paying extra money for private school fees does not guarantee a better paying job out of university, new research has shown. The study has found there is no long-term employment advantages for private school students, with public school graduates earning just as much in equally prominent jobs. A Canberra University research fellow, Jenny Chesters, found that even though private school students were more likely to attend prestigious Australian universities, it would not lead to a higher income. Scroll down for video . A study has found there is no long-term employment advantages for private school students, with public school graduates earning just as much in equally prominent jobs . A Canberra University research fellow, Jenny Chesters, found that even though private school students were more likely to attend prestigious Australian universities, it would not lead to a higher income . 'If a parent wants to pay to send their child to a private school, I don't have a problem with that but they should know that if they think paying for an education is an investment and you will get a monetary return on it, you probably won't,' Dr Chesters told the Sydney Morning Herald. The basis of the study analysed data from the Melbourne Institute's Househould Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia report. Dr Chesters examined data for more than 2,000 people aged between 24 to 35 in 2012. About 70 percent went to public schools, while 17 percent attended Catholic schools and 13.5 percent to independent schools. While the students more likely to have graduated from high school in year 12 attended Catholic or independent schools, public school students were not disadvantaged when it came to getting a high paying job out of university. 'There has been an explosion in independent schools since (former Prime Minister) John Howard changed the funding formula so, if you are aged 25 to 34, an independent school is a very different place than it was if you are 45,' Dr Chester said.

"By . Wills Robinson . A giraffe made a bid for freedom when it escaped from a circus and went on the run down a busy road in Mexico. Drivers were forced to pull over to avoid the animal, called Bingo, after it slipped out of its enclosure at Barley Circus in the town of San Nicolas de los Garza near Monterrey.

The giraffe slipped out of its enclosure at Barley's Circus in the town of  San Nicolas de los Garza in central Mexico before heading down the road . Escaped bid: Mobile phone footage taken by a driver shows cars pulling over to avoid the animal as it ran down the road . She said: 'I don't know if I would have believed it myself if I hadn't taken the video.' A spokesman for the circus confirmed that the animal had briefly left the enclosure where it had been sunbathing after a keeper left a gate open. But they initially denied that the giraffe had gone very far until confronted with the video. A taxi driver complained to local media that he had almost run into the giraffe. He doubted his insurance company would have believed him had he made a claim for any damage. The circus spokesman said: 'We usually allow the giraffe into an open enclosure to enjoy the sun but on this occasion it did briefly leave the enclosure when the door was left open. But unfamiliar with the area, it quickly returned to the enclosure without any problems.'

"A wealthy boss has been forced to pay his PA nearly £35,000 in damages after sacking her when his wife found out about their affair. The woman was kicked out of the luxury flat in Belsize Park, Camden, east London, her chief executive lover had installed her in and sacked from her £40,000 a year job at the property company, which had a £2.6 billion portfolio. During the couple's affair the PA was also bought a car and taken on luxury holidays to Australia, Cuba and Mexico. A wealthy boss has been forced to pay his PA nearly £35,000 in damages after sacking her when his wife found out about their affair. For legal reasons, neither can be identified . The 32-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said her sacking left her suffering from depression and anxiety and too ill to look for a new job. She told the Central London Employment Tribunal: 'In December 2010 he told me his wife had received a letter from somebody telling her about our relationship and about various details like the flat, and that we had gone on holidays. 'After that he started asking me to leave. He said that his wife was putting pressure on him to sever all ties with me and didn't know why I was still working there if the relationship had finished.' Although they continued to sleep together he had become rude and dismissive in the office, it was said. A PA sacked by her wealthy boss after his wife found out about their affair has been awarded nearly £35,000 in damages at Central London Employment Tribunal . She wept as she said: 'I did feel at certain times that if I didn't sleep with him then he would get very angry. 'There were times I felt if I didn't really have a choice in the relationship. I didn't know how I could break out without losing my job and my career, which I didn't want to do. 'His attitude was it was his company, he could do what he wanted and if staff members didn't like it ""they could f*** off"".' He then offered her a £50,000 tax free redundancy package as his children would no longer speak to him because of his cheating, but she refused. Two months later in a heated phone call in February 2012 he told her she was sacked telling her 'don't you f***ing come back'. The boss bought sex toys for colleagues as a 'practical joke' and once put a sex aid in a woman's suitcase just before she went on holiday. File picture . During the hearing she said her lover routinely called female staff 'slappers' and 'tarts', had a preference for hiring pretty, blonde PAs and admin staff and had asked her to try and persuade an Australian blonde to have a threesome with them and in return he would sponsor her visa application. The boss bought sex toys for colleagues as a 'practical joke' and once put a sex aid in a woman's suitcase just before she went on holiday. Even after his 'distasteful behaviour' was exposed during the hearing he continued to bring sex toys into the office. The PA sued the firm for unfair dismissal, harassment and sex discrimination and the tribunal ruled in favour of the PA's claim for unfair dismissal, although the sex discrimination charge was dismissed. Judge David Pearl awarded the PA £28,428.62 for loss of earnings and future loss of earnings, as well as £1,720 for unfair dismissal and £4,000 for harassment for shredding an appraisal, leading to a total of £34,195.21 including interest. Deciding the level of compensation to award, Judge Pearl said he was satisfied the claimant's crippling depression, sleeplessness and low self-esteem had left her unable to look for work. Mr Pearl said: 'The claimant has by her own evidence and the additional medical evidence satisfied us that she has had moderate to severe depression at all times since her dismissal and that the symptoms have for much of that period been disabling. 'We consider that her evidence is genuine and that the doctors have made careful and documented diagnoses, the effect of which is that she has been unable to work. 'We do not consider she exaggerated her symptoms or sought to mislead us in order to enhance her compensation.' The judge decided not to take into account the culture of sexism in the office when awarding damages, saying it did not amount to harassment. However he condemned the employer's 'complete disregard for modern employment law' which puts him in line for 'future litigation.' He said: 'The claimant has found evidence that one of the practical jokes that we have referred to in the liability decision (putting sexual objects in the suitcase of an employee who was shortly to go on holiday) has occurred again in 2013. 'This appears to indicate that the respondent considers anything that the tribunal wrote about the culture of the firm in the last set of reasons can be completely ignored. 'We agree that it is very distasteful to see the same behaviour being repeated again.'","The unnamed woman received nearly £35,000 in damages for sacking her .

"By . Gavin Mccafferty . Kris Boyd hit a hat-trick as Rangers thrashed Clyde 8-1 on Monday night but the striker felt his team-mate Lewis Macleod was a stand-out man of the match. Boyd also had a goal disallowed for a contentious offside decision but his analysis was spot-on as Macleod produced a creative midfield display that Clyde could not cope with. The 20-year-old also scored twice in the Petrofac Training Cup second-round game, curling home a right-footed shot from 25 yards before firing home with his left foot. Boyd, whose goals were his first since returning to Rangers in the summer, said: 'It was great to get off the mark again. You become frustrated when you're not scoring but I've shown over my career that I'm not going to hide away from the fact that I've missed chances. I keep coming back for more. Three and easy: Kris Boyd scored a hat-trick against Clyde in the Petrofac . Hammered time: Kris Boyd and Lewis Macleod celebrate with Lee McCulloch during Rangers' 8-1 thrashing . 'I think it all clicked. I thought Lee McCulloch was fantastic getting about the pitch and breaking up play. 'And I thought Lewis Macleod was by far the man of the match. He took the game by the scruff of the neck right from the first whistle and took it right to Clyde. He was fantastic. He got a couple of goals and he was brilliant.' Boyd had sympathy for former team-mate Barry Ferguson, whose managerial return to Ibrox could not have gone much worse. Ferguson set up with a 4-3-3 formation throughout in a bid to attack Rangers but it was not until the final minute that they notched their solitary goal. At the double: Lewis Macleod scores his second goal of the evening against Barry Ferguson's side . 'It's always difficult when you are managing a part-time team coming to a club this size and trying to get a result,' Boyd said. 'I think a lot of those guys would have been working during the day as well. 'We knew we had to put on a performance. We know it's not been good enough and I think we put that right. We started the game at a high tempo, stopped them playing and got in their faces right up the pitch. It was a joy to play out there.' Meanwhile, Rangers manager Ally McCoist is hopeful that Cammy Bell's shoulder injury is not as bad as first feared. Bell missed the visit of Clyde after damaging his shoulder during the 2-0 win at Falkirk on Friday. McCoist told the club's official website: 'I'm not sure Cammy has actually dislocated his shoulder. There is a problem with it though and he has seen the specialist about it. 'He was reasonably happy with him and he's going for scan. He seems a lot better and has a far greater range of movement than he had. Homecoming: Clyde manager and former Rangers star Barry Ferguson did not enjoy his return to Ibrox . 'Cammy will give me a call once he has been in and I'd be hopeful of good news rather than anything too bad. 'Considering we've not had a report on the scan yet, we don't know how long he'll be out for but we'll have a far better idea of where we are later on. 'I know from Cammy's view, having spoken to him this morning on the phone, that he feels a whole lot better. CLICK HERE to start picking your Fantasy Football team NOW!

"By . Mia De Graaf . A property tycoon nicknamed 'Mr Fastcash' and a professional gambler have been jailed for their roles in a £6.8million mortgage racket. Marshall Joseph, 56, and Alick Kapikanya, 45, were part of a housing crime gang which 'stole' luxury homes across Britain and then illegally used them to obtain loans. Joseph, who got his nickname due to his firm Fastcash Property, joined forces with Kapikanya, who in turn used the scam to fund his own life of casinos, residencies at top class hotels and homes in millionaire rows. Marshall Joseph, 56, (left) and Alick Kapikanya, 45, (right) have been jailed for their roles in a £6.8m mortgage racket . Chauffeur driven businessman Kapikanya helped Joseph recruit a team of conmen including a crooked conveyancing agent to acquire the title deeds of houses then use fake passports or driving licences and utility bills to pose as the real homeowners, Manchester Crown Court heard. The gang would go to solicitors' offices throughout Britain using the fake documents to sign over the properties to Joseph so he could take out loans with a number of financial institutions - securing the mortgages against the 'stolen' homes. The true owners of the ten properties involved in the scam knew nothing about the illegal loans secured on their homes. Police only uncovered the fraud after Joseph defaulted on secured loans repayments and it emerged he was involved in a string of scams. Some of the money from the scam went on gambling sessions at the Ritz Hotel Casino in London. Joseph, Kapikanya and their accomplices grabbed £3.5m and were about to get a further £3.3m from their racket when they were stopped. Joseph, who lives in a £750,000 double fronted detached home named 'The White House' in the village of Hale, Cheshire, has now been jailed for four-and-a-half years after he admitted conspiracy to defraud and a bankruptcy offence. Kapikanya admitted conspiracy and was jailed for six years yesterday. Joseph lives in a £750,000 double fronted detached home named 'The White House' in the village of Hale, Cheshire . In August 2007 Joseph was tied up and stabbed in the thigh during a vicious raid on the house. Five masked men stormed the property and held him, his wife, then aged 23 and her sister aged 21 and left them bound as the thugs ransacked the property for valuables. The robbers escaped in the family’s blue Mercedes 320 with a Rolex watch, pearl necklaces, a diamond engagement ring and a wedding ring. Joseph was treated for his wounds and it is thought the robbers were never traced. Kapikanya, who was the director of a string of property firms, acquired a £1.2m lakeside mansion in Mere near Knutsford and later a £650,000 apartment in Hale with the help of his scamming. Police said the mortgage fraud began in . 2007 when Joseph and Kapikanya focused on different scams which involved . properties in Worsley, Greater Manchester, Altrincham, Holmes Chapel . and Malpas, Cheshire and Sleaford, Lincolnshire. Joseph (left) has been jailed for four-and-a-half years after he admitted conspiracy to defraud and a bankruptcy offence. Kapikanya (right) admitted conspiracy and was jailed for six years . Working in tandem, the pair arranged for property titles to be transferred from real homeowners to themselves before money was electronically transferred into the accounts of the gang - with the loans secured against those properties. Kapikanya, who owed £100,000 for the hire of luxury cars, arranged for the unwitting lawyers to transfer £60,000 into a casino account he held at the Ritz. He used the money to pocket £82,000 on the roulette wheels only to gamble away £8,000 later. Victims of the fraud included an elderly doctor and his wife who were considering selling their recently closed nursing home and their family properties for £3m. Another house in Hale worth £3m was illegally used as security for two loans totalling £800,000. In another scam Joseph hired a surveyor to value an £850,000 country house set in a 1.5 acre paddock whilst the unwitting owner was on holiday. Myra Trigg, 57, (left) was given eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years. Co-conspirator Bruce Robertson (right), was jailed for 30 months . He was arrested in February 2010 but . made no comment in police interviews. It emerged he had been declared . bankrupt in December 2008. Detective . Constable Craig Moylon, of Greater Manchester Police Major Fraud Unit, . said: 'This was a meticulously planned series of frauds . which involved different people playing different parts all for a common . purpose with no regard for the devastation they were to have on many . innocent parties. 'Kapikanya . used the funds he raised to gamble heavily at many of the most . exclusive casinos in the country while driving very expensive cars and . staying in the finest hotels, sometimes for months at a time. 'The . offenders carried out their actions with no regard for the lending . organisations or the innocent homeowners who aside from the traumatic . experience of fearing they had lost their homes or were potentially . liable for loans of hundreds of thousands of pounds were forced to . instruct solicitors to have their homes put back in their name and the . secured loans removed from their titles.' Bruce . Robertson, 51, and Irene Perciful, 50, both of Cambridge, were . found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Robertson got 30 months and . Perciful 12 months. Peter Tanner was given 15 months suspended for two years, plus 140 hours unpaid work . Peter Tanner, 54, of Pampisford, Cambridge, and Myra Trigg, 57, of Moss Side, were given a 15 month sentence suspended for two years, with 140 hours unpaid work, and a 32 week sentence suspended for two weeks, with eighty hours unpaid work, respectively, after admitting fraud. Chris Campbell, 31, of Banstead, Surrey, was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years, plus 140 hours unpaid work, after admitting acquiring criminal property. Ben . Southam, Senior Crown Prosecutor for North West Complex Casework Unit . said: 'This was a complex three year investigation. When the defendants . were arrested they had succeeded in defrauding various financial . institutions of £3.5million, and had attempted to raise a further £3.3million. 'I . have the satisfaction of seeing some of them go to prison. But I think . they should all have got 100 years’ hard labour with no remission' - Victim Gwyneth Cooke . 'Each of them had . their own specific role to play in this fraud, and all were fully aware . of their actions. The mortgages and loans were obtained against houses . they did not own, and without the knowledge of the real home owners. 'The . true owners knew nothing about the loans being secured against their . homes and were caused considerable distress and inconvenience to prove . to the lenders that they knew nothing about the loans.' Speaking after the conviction, widowed victim Gwyneth Cooke, 59, described her ordeal. Mrs Cooke, whose husband John died in 2000, was diagnosed with breast cancer just weeks before the trial. She . discovered the scam when a solicitor told her she owed money on the . home she had lived in for 27 years in Worsley, Greater Manchester. Devastated: Widowed Gwyneth Cooke, of Worsley, Greater Manchester, was one of the victims . She said: 'I was absolutely horrified. 'All they had were a few utility bills and documents and someone was able to get a loan on my house pretending to be me. 'I would never ever forgive them for as long as I live.

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . A surgeon has rendered a patient infertile by giving him a vasectomy when he went into hospital for a minor operation. The patient was the victim of what hospital chiefs have called a 'never event' - a medical mistake that should never happen. The man, who had the original procedure at Broadgreen Hospital in Liverpool earlier this year, has been told that an operation to reverse the vasectomy was unsuccessful. He could now be entitled to more than £100,000 in compensation. The urology department at Broadgreen Hospital (pictured), part of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, has admitted the error was just one of five botched operations - and two 'never events' - in the last 12 months . It is understood that the surgeon who performed the surgery has since been fired, according a report. The urology department at Broadgreen Hospital, part of the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, has admitted the . error was just one of five botched operations - and two 'never events' - in the last 12 months. Another mistake involved a medical swab being left inside a patient during an operation. The Royal Liverpool Hospital 'apologised . unreservedly' to the man when details of the mistake, which they termed . 'wrong site surgery', emerged earlier this year. The vasectomy - and the failed reversal - means that the patient will not be able to conceive naturally. Ian Cohen, clinical negligence lawyer at . Slater & Gordon, said the vasectomy patient could be eligible for more than . £100,000 in compensation, but it would depend on how old he is and . whether or not he has been left infertile. The Royal Liverpool Hospital 'apologised unreservedly' to the man when details of the mistake, which they termed 'wrong site surgery', emerged earlier this year. (Stock image) Mr . Cohen said: 'This is a truly shocking and worrying case. From what we know there has . been a catastrophic breakdown in procedure, as simple checks designed to . ensure the correct operation is carried out on the right patient seem . to have failed. 'If a 25-year-old who wants a family is told he won’t be able to father children, it will be devastating.' Hospital bosses say the blunders have been reported to NHS chiefs and . that investigations are under way to establish how they happened. Dr Peter Williams, medical director at Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen .

"By . Sam Cunningham . Follow @@samcunningham . They say you need two hearts to play for him. They say that Monday to Friday he is hated by his squad but come match-day they love him. Mauricio Pochettino has risen from a manager barely anyone in England had heard of 18 months ago to take charge of one of the biggest clubs in Europe. Appointed by Tottenham in May, he faces the biggest challenges of his relatively short managerial career: a chairman with an itchy trigger finger, fans with high expectations and a squad of disjointed, expensive stars. VIDEO Scroll down for Mauricio Pochettino praises his team after Schalke friendly . Hard task master: Mauricio Pochettino works his players hard in order to get results . Pochettino is one of five Latin American bosses to grace the Premier League. Ossie Ardiles (Tottenham — Jun 93 to Oct 94): Couldn’t replicate past success at the club and was sacked in his second season. Luiz Felipe Scolari (Chelsea — Jun 08 to Feb 09): Axed after a post-Christmas slump in form. Manuel Pellegrini (Man City — Jun 13 -): Won the league title and League Cup in his first season. Gus Poyet (Sunderland - Oct 13 -): Dragged club from drop zone and led them to League Cup final. Southampton supporters were furious when their former chief executive Nicola Cortese sacked local hero Nigel Adkins and brought in this unknown Argentine from Espanyol. But he staved off relegation and a quarter of the way through last season the club stood third in the table. It was not down to luck. During last pre-season Pochettino often demanded triple training sessions from his players. They would train from 10am-midday, from 2pm-4pm and from 6pm-8pm. One club source said: ‘The main change when he joined Southampton was that the intensity was stepped up.’ Pochettino will arrive at the training ground at 7am and won’t be gone until 7pm at the earliest. During the season he lightens the load but is still unrelenting in his pursuit of fitness. In a typical week Monday is a rest day, but then on Tuesday and Wednesday he expects hard training again, often with double and occasionally triple sessions. On Thursday it is lighter training and on Friday Pochettino does tactical work, looking specifically at the team’s next opponents. Dedication: Adam Lallana and the Southampton team followed boss Pochettino over hot coals . Leading the way: Pochettino walks over hot coals . At Espanyol he fitted each player with GPS to detail their movement in training and would use an iPad to view a wider angle of games being filmed. Maverick striker Dani Osvaldo played for him at Espanyol and then Southampton. ‘He makes you work like a dog,’ he said. ‘Sometimes you feel like killing him, but it works.’ One criticism, however, is that he does not hide his preference for certain members of his squad. ‘He has a tendency to have favourite players,’ said one source. ‘That worked OK at Southampton because they were a growing team. But at Spurs, where the players are more high-profile, that’s dangerous.’ Pochettino’s teams are energetic, constantly closing down their opponents. The players are like attack dogs set on the scent of the ball. He usually plays one up front with three attacking midfielders or forwards behind. In possession they adhere to a strict passing philosophy. At goal kicks the centre halves drop wide around the penalty area, the full backs push 40 yards up the pitch and one of the two central midfielders moves to the edge of the box, giving the goalkeeper options to pass everywhere. Midfielder James Ward-Prowse said: ‘It does feel like you need two hearts to play like that.’ Pochettino invests in youth, particularly young English players, something which attracted Levy to his appointment. At Southampton he consistently played Ward-Prowse, 19, and gave first-team Premier League debuts to defender Calum Chambers, 19, striker Sam Gallagher, 18, and midfielder Harrison Reed, 19. Giving youth a chance: James Ward-Prowse and Calum Chambers both got opportunites at Southampton . Southampton’s Jay Rodriguez flourished last season under Pochettino. He netted 17 times, earned a first England cap and was on the verge of Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad until a knee injury ruled him out. ‘He brought the best out of me and gave me self-belief,’ Rodriguez said. ‘To work with him was brilliant, it was hard work but the lads loved it and we got results. ‘His tactical awareness gave you confidence, you wanted to go out for him because he’s such a great guy. You can talk to him. The players respected him so much.’ At Southampton they were prepared to walk over hot coals for him. Quite literally. Pochettino brought in motivational speaker Xesco Espar. As the culmination of the session the Southampton squad were told to walk over hot coals. Pochettino led by example and went first. The players all followed him. VIDEO Pochettino wants belief from players . Getting down to work: Pochettino with his Spurs squad during pre-season training . Making his mark: Pochettino speaks to his sqaud ahead of the new season . But Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has sacked eight managers in his 13 years at the club. Why will Pochettino be any different? The Argentine shared a strong working relationship with Cortese. When the former Southampton chief executive threatened to leave the club last summer, Pochettino vowed to follow him out the door. When the Swiss-Italian resigned in January this year, Pochettino was prepared to honour his word. But, over a glass of wine, Cortese persuaded him to stay. Men in charge: Pochettino was brought to England by then Southampton chairman Nicola Cortese and now works for Daniel Levy at Spurs . One thing is very different for Pochettino in his new job. He will finally be speaking English in public, something he very rarely did at Southampton. But he always spoke to his players without any problem, and on Saturday, when Spurs open the new season away at West Ham, we will find out whether the message got through.","Mauricio Pochettino is known for working his players hard in training .

"By . Ronnie Esplin, Press Association . Jo Inge Berget is hoping his double in Celtic's 6-1 Scottish Premiership thrashing of Dundee United on Saturday signalled that his Parkhead career is up and running after a false start. The Norway international was surprisingly pitched into the first-leg of the Champions League third qualifier against Legia Warsaw in Poland last month by manager Ronny Deila only a couple of days after signing a six-month loan deal from Cardiff. The 23-year-old forward looked out of sorts along with his equally hapless team-mates and was eventually substituted after just an hour of the 4-1 defeat. Get in: Berget celebrates scoring his first goal for the club as Celtic ran out 6-1 winners against Dundee United . He was left out the starting line-up in the next two games but returned against United where his brace washed away his Warsaw woes which he put down, in part, to not knowing the names of his team mates. 'As a footballer you always want to play,' said Berget. 'The manager asked me and I told him I was ready for it, and I was. 'I don't think anybody really had their best game there (Warsaw). 'So it is easy to say the new guy had only trained a couple of times, but things could have gone the other way as well. 'I thought I was ready for it but of course it is easier when you know the names of the players you play with.' Berget certainly looked more comfortable against United, defensively hopeless as they were, and indeed he was only thwarted by the crossbar from grabbing a hat-trick. Friends now: The Norwegian is embraced by Charlie Mulgrew, and says he now knows he teammates' names . The former Stromsgodset and Molde player said: 'It's a long time since I scored twice. 'It was the second game I have started, I feel I'm getting into it. I know all the boys now and I've settled well. 'I knew Stefan (Johansen) from before so that is an easier way into the group but the boys have been good, all of them, so I've settled in fine. 'I have already played more games here than I did in Cardiff so that's a good thing, and scored two goals so that is great. 'You can't say I've proved myself with one game but it is definitely a step in the right direction and hopefully I'll get many more goals.' It is back to the drawing board for Jackie McNamara's side who contributed massively to their own downfall. Benched: After his disappointing debut Berget had to sit out two games before getting another chance . Their troubles started in the third minute when Celtic debutant Jason Denayer, the 19-year-old Belgian defender who arrived on a year-long loan from Manchester City, put the home side in front when United failed to deal with a Kris Commons corner. Further goals by Commons and Johansen, both also avoidable from the visitors' point of view, had the points tied up by the interval and stand-in skipper Charlie Mulgrew claimed a fourth with a nick although that was disputed by Anthony Stokes who curled in the free-kick. Berget scored either side of a deflected drive by United captain John Rankin which left McNamara wondering if the early goal had frightened his team. The former Hoops defender said: 'Maybe losing a goal after three minutes spooked a few of our players who have been on the end of it before. A bit of fear creeps in. 'But I'll make sure the players watch footage of the set-pieces and the goals.'","Berget had a difficult debut against Legia Warsaw after loan move from Cardiff .

"By . Ian Laybourn . Wigan's England winger Josh Charnley grabbed an injury-time try to deny Hull KR a victory and snatch a point from a dramatic finish to an error-strewn Super League match at the KC Lightstream Stadium. The Robins, who led 14-4 after 72 minutes, will feel hard done by after dominating most of the match but Matty Smith's failure to convert Charnley's try from the touchline at least salvaged them a point which keeps their play-off hopes alive. Wigan missed the chance to go top of the table but will feel grateful to avoid a sixth defeat in seven trips into Yorkshire after producing a flat performance. It was a largely unhappy return for former Hull KR favourite and playmaker Blake Green, who was back in the Wigan side after a three-month absence with a ruptured bicep but produced a moment of magic to create a try for skipper Sean O'Loughlin that sparked the late fightback. Injury-time: Josh Charnley scores a late try to snatch a point for Wigan, but Matty Smith missed the conversion . It was one of their best performances of the season yet the Robins could hardly have made a worst start, with prop forward Adam Walker dropping the ball on his own 20-metre line inside the first set of tackles. Wigan immediately took advantage, with Smith and Green combining with full-back Matty Bowen to get centre Dan Sarginson slithering his way over for the game's first try, with just 84 seconds on the clock. But the home side's response was superb as their forwards took the game to their opponents and created a host of scoring opportunities. Charnley conceded a goal-line drop-out to save one try and second rower Joel Tomkins, making his first start since his return from rugby union, threw Neville Costigan back from the line when he looked a certain scorer. The equalising try eventually came on 18 minutes when Charnley only managed to get one hand to the ball as it sailed over his head and Hull KR centre Craig Hall, preferred to the out-of-touch Kris Welham, touched it down inches from the dead-ball line. It was nothing more than the home side deserved as they began to dominate. Right winger Ade Gardner could have had a hat-trick of tries with steadier finishing but his inability to take a poor pass from Liam Salter with a two-man overlap summed up the misfortune of the former St Helens man. Super League: Wigan missed the chance to go top of the table but will be glad they didn't lose . However, Gardner brought the crowd to its feet with a shuddering tackle on Sarginson that halted a rare dangerous Wigan attack and breathed fresh belief into his side. The turning point came six minutes before half-time when Charnley had a try disallowed for offside and Rovers immediately took play upfield and took the lead for the first time. Half-backs Keating and Travis Burns demonstrated quick hands to get second rower Jason Chan over for a try and Burns' conversion put his side 10-4 ahead. That gave the Robins just the confidence they needed and they continued to make the champions look very ordinary in the second half. Their spirit and determination was illustrated in Graeme Horne's tackle on Bowen which forced him to spill the ball. Chan went 70 metres after swooping on it and, although he was halted 20 metres out from the Wigan line, Rovers maintained their composure this time and left winger Ben Cockayne accepted full-back Greg Eden's pass to cross for a third try. Burns was off target for the second time, leaving him with one success from three kicks at goal, and Wigan gave themselves hope with Green carved out a try for skipper Sean O'Loughlin eight minutes from the end. Matty Smith added the conversion to cut the gap to just four points and in the tense finish centre Anthony Gelling squeezed out a pass for Charney to produce a devastating finish and claim a point.","Hull KR 14-4 up on 72 minutes .

"By . Mark Wilson . Celtic could be edged out of a £2million move for Cameron Jerome by rival interest from Norwich City. The Parkhead outfit are understood to have made an offer for the Stoke City striker that his current club would be happy to accept. As it stands, however, Jerome is thought to have a preference to continue his career in England.

VIDEO Scroll down for Celtic manager Ronny Deila wants to build a new team . Wanted: Celtic are keen to sign Stoke's Cameron Jerome who spent part of last season with Crystal Palace . Preference: Jerome is thought to want to stay in England and is wanted by Championship side Norwich . Celtic are also working to finalise a season-long loan deal for Ghana winger Wakaso Mubarak ahead of the deadline for their Champions League qualifier against Maribor. The Rubin Kazan midfielder has emerged as a leading target for Parkhead boss Ronny Deila, with discussions taking place between the two clubs over the weekend. Celtic hope to tie up the agreement on Monday, which would enable the 24-year-old — part of his nation’s World Cup squad — to be available for Wednesday’s first leg against the Slovenian champions. Mubarak moved to Russia in a £4.5million switch from Espanyol last summer and his acquisition would provide Deila with a significant boost. Inter Milan, Swansea and Everton were reportedly interested in the player before he joined Rubin. Primarily left-sided, he is known for his pace — but also for some past disciplinary issues that delivered a spate of yellow cards during his time in La Liga. Interest: Celtic have also been linked with a move for Rubin Kazan wideman Wakaso Mubarak . And the Norwegian’s need for another wide player could increase if he receives unwelcome news about James Forrest. The Scotland winger came off the bench in Saturday’s 6-1 rout of Dundee United but appeared to suffer a hamstring injury as he helped create the final goal. Deila admitted he expected Forrest to miss Wednesday night’s Champions League qualifier against Maribor but is hoping the damage may not be as bad as initially feared. Celtic are also monitoring Adam Matthews after the Welsh full-back tweaked a calf muscle during the warm-up on Saturday and was replaced in the starting line-up by Efe Ambrose. Regardless of those fitness concerns, newcomer Jason Denayer is confident an improving Parkhead side will not spurn the second chance they have been handed in Europe’s elite tournament. Hopeful: New Celtic signing Jason Denayer is confident the Bhoys will not spurn their second chance in Europe . The young Belgian centre-back, on loan from Manchester City, scored on his debut against United as Deila’s men warmed up in style for their scheduled first leg against the Slovenian champions. Celtic were given a reprieve after Legia Warsaw were kicked out for fielding the suspended Bartosz Bereszynski in the second leg of a 6-1 aggregate win in the previous round. Unless the Court of Arbitration for Sport orders a dramatic u-turn on Legia’s punishment on Monday, Celtic will face Maribor in a £15m shoot-out for a place in the group stage. And Denayer believes they are now in a far better position to make the most of their good fortune. On target: Denayer shoots and scores on his debut during Celtic's 6-1 victory over Dundee United . 'We are now all feeling confident,’ said the 19-year-old. ‘We are going to play with a style of football which we hope will win the tie against Maribor. ‘We believe the defence will be more solid than against Legia. It’s not about me. I think you have to look at the last round as being at the start of the season. The coach was still new and some players are new. But now I think the team know each other better and it will be better in the games against Maribor. ‘There is a real sense among the players that we want to make the most of this. What has happened with the Legia tie is now in the past as far as we are concerned. ‘Now we are looking further, to try and win over two games against Maribor and get into the group stage.’","Celtic understood to have bid for Stoke striker Cameron Jerome .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Celtic's Derk Boerrigter has accepted a two-match ban after an SFA investigation into his apparent dive during the 3-0 win over St Johnstone last week. The Dutchman tumbled theatrically to win a penalty after a challenge from Saints captain Dave Mackay, who was red-carded in the incident. The Perth side were left fuming after the decision by match referee John Beaton and even Celtic manager Ronny Deila admitted he would speak to his player should he feel he was guilty of simulation. Unfair dismissal: Celtic's Derk Boerrigter has been punished for his alleged dive against St Johnstone . Reprieve: St Johnstone captain Dave Mackay could now have his red card rescinded by the SFA . The SFA probe into the incident concluded at the end of last week with their compliance officer offering a two-match ban — or the chance to fight that decision at a fast-track appeal on Thursday. Celtic announced on Monday that they would not contest the ban and Boerrigter will now miss league games against Inverness Caley Thistle and Dundee. The development is a boost for Mackay, whose appeal against his red card will be heard on Thursday. Mackay said: ‘I’ve got to wait to hear officially but surely my red card will be rescinded now. ‘I’ve not heard a thing yet but I think it was the right decision to cite Boerrigter. It doesn’t help us though. The game is done. ‘Taking action after games has happened before. I remember Sone Aluko getting done when he was up here. So people know this can happen. ‘We had a meeting with the referees just before the start of the season and we were told they would be looking at people they think might have dived. ‘If they weren’t punished at the time, they warned they would go back and take a look at it and give them a two-game ban where it was a dive. ‘So they have stuck to their word with the Boerrigter one. ‘I assume my appeal will be upheld now.

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Stuart Pearce was serenaded with a chorus of ‘Psycho’ from adoring Nottingham Forest fans as his return to the City Ground finished in a comfortable victory over ramshackle Blackpool. Michail Antonio and Chris Burke scored the first-half goals that made this afternoon bathed in sunshine a walk in the park against a team able to name a squad of only 15 players. In an humiliating indictment of all that is wrong at Blackpool, brought about by a chairman in Karl Oyston who appears averse to opening his wallet and a manager in Jose Riga who refused to budge on transfer targets, only one outfield player with senior experience was named on the bench. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Al Hasawi promises to not interfere with Pearce's team in April' Easy pickings: Chris Burke celebrates with Matty Fryatt after scoring Forest's second goal . Nottm Forest: Darlow, Hunt, Mancienne, Fox, Harding, Burke (Osborn 78), Cohen, Reid, Antonio (McLaughlin 57), Fryatt, Assombalonga. Subs: Lichaj, Veldwijk, Paterson, Hobbs, De Vries. Goals: Antonio 25, Burke 30 . Blackpool: Lewis, McMahon, Daniels, Clarke, Perkins, Lundstram, Mellis, Cywka, Zenjov (Telford 87), Orlandi, Delfouneso. Subs: Parish, Dunne, Waddington. Att: 28,028 . Irate Blackpool fans chanted ‘We want Oyston out,’ before kick-off as his shambolic reign revealed its consequences with Riga’s team selection. The Belgian named only four substitutes, two of whom, in Mark Waddington and Dominic Telford, were teenagers promoted from the youth team with no senior matches. Only Charles Dunne, a 21-year-old defender with 50 league games to his name at Wycombe, offered Riga an outfield option with any experience. In the end Telford did make his debut late on. All this despite a flurry of transfer activity since it became clear a fortnight ago that having eight players on the books would be suicidal. Riga was hampered yesterday by having seven players out, two through work permit issues, while striker Ishmael Miller, released by Forest this summer, was not registered in time despite signing on Wednesday. Commendably, Miller decided to watch the match from the stands with his fans. It would be laughable were it not so serious. It meant nine debutants for the visitors, all signed for nothing or on loan. Captain Tony McMahon is a player who only signed in January. The Seasiders are a club built on foundations of sand right now. Pearce named six debutants himself, although these were players bought for significant fees with a tilt at promotion to the Premier League in mind. Britt Assombalonga cost a club-record £5million fee. It is doubtful that much has been spent by Oyston on recruitment since Blackpool fell from the top-flight in 2011, pocketing more than £70m in parachute payments in the process. These clubs do share a common theme of course; Pearce has not seen eye-to-eye with his hierarchy either. The manager who runs a mile from a euphemism, went public when Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles were sold to Newcastle behind his back this week. Tap in: Michail Antonio slides home the opening goal for Stuart Pearce's side against depleted Blackpool . Homecoming: Pearce applauds the crowd at the City Ground ahead of the opening day victory . Trouble: Sergei Zenjov looked a dejected figure as he walked off at half-time with Pool 2-0 down . Absolute shambles! Jose Riga had five new signings unavailable after the club didn't register them . But he subsequently clarified that his issue was less with Kuwaiti owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi and more the financial people for failing to keep him informed. Forest got £7m and both players loaned back for the season. ‘Very good business,’ Pearce concluded. Darlow started this match in goal. What Riga would do for such problems. Amid such circumstances, a 2-0 defeat for Blackpool is not an embarrassment. They were surprisingly well-organised and stifled Forest for decent periods. Indeed, the first clear chance went their way when John Lundstram’s inswinging free-kick found the head of Nathan Delfouneso. But the former Aston Villa man put it wide with the goal at his mercy. Forest’s quality and preparation told in the end, and Pearce will be warmed two of his summer signings scored the goals. In the 25th minute Andy Reid advanced will the ball and unleashed a trademark strike from ards that clipped the inside of the post with Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis stranded. Antonio, signed for £1.5m this week from Sheffield Wednesday, arrived at the perfect moment to slot home the rebound. Pearce, a legendary figure here after 12 years as a player, celebrated with a fist-pump. Blink and you'll miss it! Joe Lewis was powerless to stop Burke's effort flying over him . Tussling for possession: Antonio tries to skip beyond Blackpool striker Nathan Delfouneso . Five minutes later the tally was doubled. Burke, who moved from Birmingham on a free, cut in from the right and curled a delicious strike from the angle of the area that flew into the far corner. ‘Psycho, give us a wave,’ the jubilant home fans chanted. He duly obliged. Antonio could have added another but his shot, after excellent work from Matty Fryatt, was held by Lewis and after the break Assombalonga did everything but score. His pace offered Forest an outlet from the back and his presence a focal point for crosses into the box. Blackpool, an assorted bunch who were mostly strangers to each other before the past week, kept their shape admirably and Lundstram went close with a shot curled round the post. But as the match ebbed away the travelling contingent once more chanted: ‘We want Oyston out’. The Blackpool chairman could not hear, he was not in attendance – rumoured to be abroad in even sunnier surroundings.","Jose Riga named just four players on the bench for the visitors .

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . Arsene Wenger can cement his place among English football's greatest managers by leading Arsenal to Barclays Premier League glory this term, according to Aaron Ramsey. Wales playmaker Ramsey's first-half finish helped drive Arsenal to 3-0 Community Shield victory over Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday. And the 23-year-old believes long-serving Arsenal boss Wenger has been revitalised by last term's FA Cup final victory. Back of the net: Aaron Ramsey (left) scores in Arsenal's 3-0 Community Shield win against Manchester City . Confident: Ramsey believes Arsenal can go all the way and win the Premier League title next season . Ramsey believes Arsenal's first major trophy in nine years could now pave the way for a first league title since 2004. 'I definitely think we can win the league - we were top of the table for the most amount of time last season,' Ramsey said ahead of that win. 'The only thing we need to improve is our away record against the so-called bigger teams: if we had managed to nick the odd point or win in those games it would have been a lot closer last season, and maybe even we would have won. 'So that's something we can really focus on to work hard to improve. 'It's great news and extremely pleasing for us as players that he (Wenger) signed that new contract, he's done so much in this game and for the game, and for this club too. 'We're delighted that he's committed his future to the club again, and we're all looking forward to working with him for the next three years. 'Winning the league again would put him up there with the best managers ever in this league, no doubt. 'He's been very successful, he's built some great teams, helped some great players and hopefully now we can go on from last season and be successful again.' More to come? Winning the league would make Arsene Wenger one of the best managers of the Premier League era, according to Ramsey . Silverware: Arsenal players (from left to right) Mathieu Flamini, Tomas Rosicky, Santi Cazorla, Olivier Giroud, Naco Monreal, Ramsey, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere pose with the Community Shield inside their Wembley changing room . Ramsey's strike and goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud helped Arsenal blitz last term's title-winners Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday. Despite finishing second and ending their trophy drought with the FA Cup, the Gunners failed to stay the league course last term - but Ramsey does not expect a repeat. Wenger signed a new three-year deal at the end of last season, leaving 30-cap Wales star Ramsey delighted the Frenchman will add to his 18 years in north London. 'I think stability is vitally important for success,' said Ramsey, speaking at the launch of McDonald's four-year community partnership with the home nation football associations. 'He's the longest-serving manager in the Premier League now and he's going to add a few more years to that . 'He's as excited as anybody about the new season, with the new players we've got coming in. Proud: Captain Mikel Arteta lifts the Community Shield after a convincing 3-0 win against champions City . 'He realises what this team can do and what he believes we can achieve, so we're all looking forward and excited to be a part of that. 'It's a big attraction to be at the club and be a part of things, in the way that he thinks the game should be played. 'He's a great man-manager, he knows how to handle players and what's best for them. 'The way that he believes the game should be played, his philosophy on the game is extremely exciting and gives players licence. 'He's very approachable and will always let players know how you can improve, or what you're doing well and things like that. 'So he's a great manager and all the players enjoy working with him and playing under him.' Aaron Ramsey was speaking at the launch of McDonald's new four-year community partnership with the home nation football associations. McDonald's is giving more than 7,000 accredited junior football clubs one free kit every season for the next four years with the potential for more than 250,000 kits to be distributed across the UK, as part of their work supporting grassroots football clubs.

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . It’s fair to say that it’s not exactly car-horns and fireworks on the streets of Barcelona at the news that the club are signing Thomas Vermaelen. ‘Not as good as Mats Hummels’ (who they were never likely to get anyway) and not as young as Marquinhos (ultimately far too expensive) summed up the immediate reaction. This was tempered by the fact that the former Ajax man is a year younger and probably a better option than Liverpool’s Daniel Agger. But the worst thing about the signing is that he joins from Arsenal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Thomas Vermaelen unveiled as a Barcelona player . Another Gunner: Barcelona have completed the £15million signing of Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal . Failure: For a combined £32million, Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars flopped following their 2000 arrival . Happier times: Petit and Overmars were a key part of Arsenal's double winning campaign in 1997/98 . Never mind an intelligent assessment of how he might fit in, history says Barca shouldn’t be going within 10 buyout clauses of the Gunners after a string of big money acquisitions in recent years. They did wonders for Arsenal’s accounts and nothing for Barcelona’s trophy-winning chances. In 2000 Arsene Wenger sold Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit to the Catalans for a combined £32m. Overmars stayed for four trophyless, injury-plagued years. Petit was gone in one season sold back to Chelsea for £7m. Gio Van Bronckhorst arrived too and fared far better but he is a blip on the chart. In 2006 Barcelona wanted Thierry Henry but Wenger made sure they waited a full season and still paid £16m when they signed him a year later. Henry at least fared better on the pitch than Overmars and Petit but he still took a year to get going and Arsenal had clearly already long since had the best from him. Top of the flops: Barcelona put a £70million release clause on Alex Hleb, but the midfielder would later struggle to break into Birmingham's first team while on loan back in the Premier League . Not needed: Alex Song was bought to play in midfield or defence but has hardly featured at the Nou Camp . VIDEO Excited Vermaelen relishing Barca challenge . Cesc Fabregas was perhaps Wenger’s greatest victory. He signed him for £500,000 and eight years later sold him back to Barcelona for £35m. Fabregas failed to fit back into the club he had left aged 16 and never saw out the five-year contract he signed. At least on this occasion a large part of that original outlay is understood to have been recouped by his ‘undisclosed fee’ signing for Chelsea. And at least Fabregas and Henry thrilled the Nou Camp scoring goals and winning trophies. The worst – or best, from Arsenal’s perspective – of business between the two clubs comes by way of Alex Hleb and Alex Song. Captain fantastic: Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas were both captains and star players for Arsenal . Best times have gone: Henry won the Champions League at Barca, but Arsenal got the best out of the striker . Misfit: Fabregas was courted by Barca for long periods but failed to settle once arriving at the Nou Camp . Hleb signed a four-year deal in 2008 and Barca somewhat optimistically put a £70m buy-out clause on him. They ended up terminating his contract six months before it was due to expire after he failed to fit in, or persuade any of the clubs he went on loan to – Stuttgart, Birmingham City and Wolfsburg – that they should pay to sign him. The club are currently trying to find a new home for Song. After paying £15m for him in 2012 and giddily announcing that he could also play at centre back he has been largely peripheral – not really needed in holding midfield where Barca already have Sergio Busquets and not able to play at the back, despite the billing given in his presentation. So now it’s over to Vermaelen. He rejoins former Ajax team-mate Luis Suarez and with his club history should certainly need no period of adaptation. His recent injury record is a concern but if he can overcome that he might be able to turn the tide of disappointing arrivals from Arsenal. He is a least a ‘proper’ central defender, not something Barca have signed for five years.","Thomas Vermaelen joined Barcelona from Arsenal for £15million .

The Spanish left-back made just nine appearances last season before undergoing knee surgery in November that brought his campaign to a premature end.

'I'm still getting my fitness back but I feel really good and confident that I can play soon. 'It's little by little, and not just me, everyone is getting their fitness. If the manager wants me to play in the first game of the season, I am ready of course.' Enrique's fitness is a boost to boss Brendan Rodgers, who was left without a specialist left-back last season and has not been able to strengthen in that area. The Reds have been heavily linked with young Spaniard Alberto Moreno but so far he has stayed with Sevilla. Rodgers has still been busy in the transfer window, spending significant money on Southampton duo Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren, Belgium World Cup star Divock Origi, Benfica's Lazar Markovic and Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen.

'But we've spent a lot of money on good players as well, we have a very good team. Hopefully we can do the same thing as last season.' One advantage for Liverpool may be that the former Southampton trio are all experienced Premier League players. 'It depends on the player but normally (it's an advantage),' said Enrique. 'It's a different league, a completely different type of football. This one probably is the hardest in terms of fitness because in the Premier League you run a lot, going wide and back more or less all the game.

"Luke Shaw admits it will be a dream come true to step out at Old Trafford as a Manchester United player for the first time when Louis van Gaal’s side face Valencia in their final pre-season friendly on Tuesday. The occasion also marks Van Gaal’s first home game in charge before United host Swansea in their Premier League opener next weekend, and Shaw is under no illusion that the deposed champions need to put a disastrous season behind them and get back to winning trophies under the Dutchman. The England defender, signed from Southampton for £27million this summer, said: ‘As a kid, it’s a dream to play at Old Trafford. It’s one of the biggest arenas in the world, you would say. Scroll down for videos... Luke who's talking: Luke Shaw admits it will be a dream come to true to make his Old Trafford debut . Dutch of class: Every game is serious for new manager Louis van Gaal (L), reveals Luke Shaw . ‘To know it’s going to be my home ground is something special. I can’t wait to get my first touch on the pitch just to relish it. ‘You have got to be positive and, for me personally, I have come here to win trophies and it is something everyone wants, not just me. Everyone in that dressing-room is looking to do it. ‘We want to win the Premier League. Obviously there is no Champions League for us this season so the main focus is on the Premier League and we all cannot wait to get started.’ Van Gaal is taking the game so seriously that he sent coach Marcel Bout on a 7,500-mile round trip from United’s training base in America to watch Valencia play Monaco in the Emirates Cup at Arsenal last weekend. Shaw believes that is typical of the manager’s determination to hit the ground running this season after implementing a new 3-4-1-2 formation that sees the 19-year-old operating as a left wing-back. Back to winning ways: United claimed the International Champions Cup on their pre-season tour of the US . ‘Every game is serious,’ added Shaw. ‘We want to improve as a team and the way we can do that is going into the game properly by using the scouts to discover what they are like and see how we are going to play against them. I think it will help us. ‘The main thing is obviously the first Premier League game against Swansea for the first match of the season, but we want to keep improving as a team and getting used to the formation so we will be flying when the season starts. ‘It has been a crazy few weeks for me. I got back from the World Cup and came up here to get everything sorted with the medical. Then I had a couple of weeks off and it has been crazy but I’m glad I am back now and getting fit for the season. ‘I managed to get away and see what it is like on tour. I’d heard a lot of things about how crazy it was and I witnessed that. It was great to win the tournament (International Champions Cup) at the end as well. ‘Until you have gone out there, you don’t know what it's like. That surprised me but I have heard it (the fanaticism) is even worse in Asia so I was quite glad we were in America. It was really nice to see how many supporters United have got out there.’ New signing Ander Herrera (C) was overwhelmed by Manchester United's support in the States . United’s other summer signing, Ander Herrera, was also surprised to see how popular the club are Stateside following his £29m move from Athletic Bilbao. ‘My first surprise was we went to the stadium in LA and there were 80,000 people there singing Glory, Glory Man United, I really enjoyed seeing that,’ said Herrera. ‘It was a big experience for me and I now understand just how big Manchester United is in America. There were a lot of fans in the hotels, at training and in the stadiums and I really enjoyed the experience. I am also learning a lot from my team-mates and the staff, and I am looking forward to playing more games.’ Herrera’s Spanish compatriots David De Gea and Juan Mata – who will be facing his old club on Tuesday – have been helping the midfielder settle in at United. ‘I have played with Juan since we played for the Spain Under-21 team,’ he added. ‘We have a great relationship and with David too. ‘For me, he will become the best keeper in the world. He always trains hard and wants to improve. That’s very important for a keeper.’ Special Juan: Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata (C) will play his former club Valencia in final friendly .

"By . Matt Barlow . Louis van Gaal stands on the brink of his first Barclays Premier League campaign eight months after standing to deliver a speech at the Savoy in honour of Jose Mourinho and embarking upon a largely unquotable ramble about the time he replaced Bobby Robson at Barcelona. Van Gaal flirted with self-aggrandisement at the football writers’ Gala Night – his audience would have been disappointed had he not - and then rescued it by delivering a decent punch-line. Mourinho turned out to be better than him after all, he shrugged, with reference to 2010 when Inter beat Bayern in the Champions League final, but this was the Dutchman’s marker down in London at the start of a year when he would descend upon England. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal's piers and prodigies thoughts of the Iron Tulip . Light touch: Louis van Gaal will attempt to lift the gloom which has enveloped Old Trafford in the past year . Casting a shadow: Sir Alex Ferguson (centre) will be looming in the stands but Van Gaal should handle it . At the time he was the manager of Holland and happy to be heavily linked with Tottenham but Old Trafford was his ultimate destination and hidden within that speech in January were the clues to his style and his confidence inside big clubs. Not a success: David Moyes tampered with the backroom staff and alienated key players . His meandering story was about how he refused to jettison the wisdom of Robson, so asked to retain him in an advisory 'upstairs' role, and liked what he’d seen of the hot-headed linguist-cum-coach from Portugal, so he kept him close, too. Yes he can work with Sir Alex Ferguson looming in the stands, if need be. Yes, he will help nurture Ryan Giggs and turn him into a potential successor if that is what he wants. Nicky Butt, why not? Anyone else? Strange how there seems more continuity to this appointment than when David Moyes arrived last year. Moyes was chosen as the continuity candidate and yet stripped away much of Ferguson’s backroom team and alienated key players. He is not famed for his human touch but Van Gaal, 63 on Friday, has the experience and faith in his own ability not to fear those around him or fret when all eyes turn his way, as they do now. Can he lead United from their post-Fergie gloom? Some things have fallen kindly. There will be no European football, so the main target is clear. Expect snide remarks from Mourinho about United 'on holiday'. It was his favourite line about Liverpool last season, but there was probably some truth in it. Time on the training field with your team is a rare commodity for managers in the Premier League. It helped Brendan Rodgers gate-crash the top four but Liverpool no longer have Luis Suarez, their inspiration and 31-goal leading scorer. Like Moyes, he starts against Swansea but unlike his predecessor who was pitched against Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City in his opening five Premier League games, the next four for Van Gaal are against Sunderland, Burnley, Queens Park Rangers and Leicester. Don’t be good, be lucky. Or be both. For managers, there are good and bad times to arrive at a club. The minds of all those who matter at Old Trafford from the boardroom to the dressing room, the Stretford End and the television screens in the Far East will have been opened to the idea of major surgery by last season’s strife. It helped soothe the departures of Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra and it will be interesting to see the extent to which Van Gaal commits to the traditions of United’s high-tempo and fluent attacking style. Shoulder the responsibility: Van Gaal will need the likes of Wayne Rooney to shine in his new United side . Still, it will not be easy. He will need Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney to shoulder responsibility as he organises the unit behind them and recruits new players with United’s appeal slightly tarnished by their absence from the Champions League. Liverpool boss Rodgers was quick to issue the warning that the competitive nature and intensity of the English game will be unlike anything else he will have seen, especially during his last couple of years in international football. Elsewhere in the Premier League, the biggest teams have been bulking up. Liverpool have reinvested the £75million they banked for Suarez and more, while champions Manchester City have quietly strengthened without losing any of their key players. Bulking up: Javier Manquillo is the latest player to sign for Liverpool following the sale of Luis Suarez . Arsenal have spent freely - the arrival of Alexis Sanchez is one of the most exciting of the summer – and Chelsea have added Cesc Fabregas, Filipe Luis and Diego Costa, the striker Mourinho so desperately wanted. Together with Nemanja Matic, signed in January, Chelsea's is starting to look like the archetypal Mourinho team, packed with muscle, cunning and commitment. Mauricio Pochettino improved Southampton at speed; can he do the same at Tottenham? He may find more resistance to his methods from more established footballers, but there is no reason why he should not. Spurs have ground to make up on last year’s top four, as do Everton and both these have the Europa League to complicate matters. Muscling in: Nemanja Matic has added power to Chelsea, now looking like a typical Jose Mourinho team . For Hull City, European football is important to the development of the club and the city but it will not help them in the scrap in the lower reaches with the three promoted teams and those who struggled last season. After finishing eighth in May, Southampton have been plundered, largely by Liverpool, and must fear the slide towards those in peril. When it is tight, twists of fate will be magnified. Villa were stung by the loss of Christian Benteke, Swansea missed Michu and West Brom could have done without the Nicolas Anelka farce. Pitfalls await, managers will be chopped and there will be aftershocks (as well as vanishing spray) from the World Cup. Spurred on: If Mauricio Pochettino improves Tottenham as he did Southampton, they may challenge for fourth . It less than a month since the final and players from Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Holland – of which there are many in the Premier League – played seven games in the tournament, plus warm-up games, not to mention training through May. Some of these players will break. Some will not. Some clubs will be equipped to cope and adjust and some will not. Some managers will survive the carnage and others will not.

"By . Joe Bernstein, Mail On Sunday . Five managers begin the Premier League season next weekend believing they will be champions. Arsene Wenger, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini are all serial trophy-winners with bags of experience. But if they expect their rookie rival, 41-year-old Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, to be intimidated despite not having a medal to his name, they will be disappointed. ‘I don’t lack confidence and I have an inherent belief in how I work,’ said Rodgers, whose side came from nowhere to finish runners-up to Manchester City last season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers: Liverpool will not 'do a Tottenham' Young gun: Brendan Rodgers does not think his relative inexperience wills top Liverpool challenging for title . ‘I’ve been doing this for 20 years now, and I love the challenge of working out my opponent and the different systems they might play.’ With so many big beasts around him, there are many who think Rodgers may suffer from ‘second-season syndrome’ where the team crash back to earth, particularly having sold their best player, Luis Suarez, to Barcelona. But they underestimate the Ulsterman, who learned his trade as a coach at Chelsea under Mourinho and has rebuilt Liverpool admirably while coping with the retirement of Jamie Carragher and the ageing of Steven Gerrard. Old head: Arsene Wenger will hope Arsenal's summer recruits can fire the Gunners to the top of the league . Defending champion: The pressure will be on Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini to retain the title . Happy newcomer: Louis van Gaal has experience of winning trophies in Germany, Holland and Spain . Wenger, Pellegrini and Van Gaal are in their 60s with either Premier League or Champions League silverware to their name. Mourinho, 51, has won both — in duplicate. Rodgers has signed seven players to cope with Suarez’s exit and the extra playing load of the Champions League. More are set to follow. He is sure that while he may lack long-term experience at the highest level, nobody in any Premier League dug-out will beat him for detailed organisation. ‘Towards the end of last season, for example, when we played Norwich it was Neil Adams’s first home game as manager,’ he said. The Chosen One: Jose Mourinho has added considerable firepower to his Chelsea squad ahead of the season . ‘I did all my homework, as I would if we were playing Chelsea or Manchester City. I looked at how Neil’s teams had played when he was youth-team coach, what system he liked to play, and I looked at his entire history as a coach. He liked the diamond system, so we played a way to counter and combat that.’ Rodgers did not need to remind anyone Liverpool won 3-2 when the fixture was played in April. ‘I always do my work,’ he said. He may be well behind Van Gaal, Mourinho and others on his CV at the moment but it is not his intention to finish like that. ‘I’m 41. Hopefully I’ve got another 20-odd years left in the game and I will have success in that period,’ he said.","Liverpool boss says he doesn't lack confidence in his ability as a manager .

"Sportsmail columnists Jamie Redknapp, Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Bryan Robson give their expert opinion on the upcoming Premier League season. Jose Mourinho might want to read all the way to the bottom... Which game is the golden ticket? Carragher: In terms of teams challenging for the top and the timing of it, Liverpool going to Stamford Bridge with three games to go looks the best game. It was pivotal last year and may prove to be again. Redknapp: Liverpool v Manchester United, especially with Louis van Gaal adding more stardust. You can’t beat the animosity between the clubs and the great players. United will be desperate for revenge after losing twice last season. Revenge mission: Wayne Rooney and Manchester United lost twice to Steven Gerrard's Liverpool last season . Keown: The Manchester derbies. Can City can permanently wrestle away United’s dominance and finish ahead of them two years in a row? Robson: Manchester City against Chelsea at the end of September could be a spicy, attacking game which will be an indicator of where the title goes. Which manager would you have liked to play for? Robson: Arsene Wenger. His philosophy is admirable. It would have been interesting to play in one of his sides, although I might have had my work cut out defending. Keown: Roberto Martinez. He’s one of the few Premier League managers I saw at the World Cup, which suggests he is a real student of the game. I want to find out what his training methods are and how he has managed to improve Everton so much. Redknapp: This is hard! The best manager I played for was my dad, Harry. I’m a huge admirer of Brendan Rodgers and I’d love to soak up Wenger’s experience. And now there is Van Gaal! But, despite letting himself down at times last season, I’d pick Mourinho. He’ll be the man lifting the trophy at the end of the season. Carragher: I’d pick Mourinho, too. He is a proven winner, there’s almost a guarantee of trophies and most players speak highly of him. The boss: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger talks to one of his former charges, Sportsmail's Martin Keown . Who can dethrone Manchester City? Redknapp: I expected City to kick on in the summer but I still feel they’re short in defence and need to tie up the signing of Eliaquim Mangala. Chelsea should have won the title last season and now with Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas, there are no excuses. I think they will win it. Carragher: I see City and Chelsea as the two front runners with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United chasing them. But I’m backing Chelsea to finish top. Robson: Arsenal have bought interesting players but Chelsea will be strong and I’d say it is between them and Manchester United. That may surprise some but being out of Europe could really help United. Keown: City will win it again. They have the stability. I was never able to defend the title — it is very hard — but they have the best squad with the best balance. In with a shout: Jose Mourinho's Chelsea are the favourites to overhaul Manchester City . Who’s the best signing? Keown: Alexis Sanchez — I’m being biased here! He was outstanding during the World Cup. He has such tenacity and his work rate is infectious. Carragher: Who knows yet? But Chelsea’s three big signings — Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis — look impressive as a package on paper. Redknapp: Lazar Markovic looks good at Liverpool. I watched him for Benfica last season and he reminded me a bit of Patrik Berger in the way he ghosted past people. It is effortless for him and the winger is happy to have the ball in tight areas. Robson: I really like Sanchez. He has great pace and can score both simple and spectacular goals. United wanted him a few years ago. The new faces: Alexis Sanchez (left) and Lazar Markovic will both be exciting additions . Which player would you buy who hasn’t moved yet? Robson: Everton’s Ross Barkley. He would really suit United and has all the attributes to be a top player: physique, touch, vision, confidence. Redknapp: I want to see the next best young player and wish it could have been James Rodriguez. I’d go for Radamel Falcao. He’d fit in perfectly at Liverpool or Arsenal. Keown: Eduardo Vargas, who played up front alongside Sanchez for Chile at the World Cup. Another tireless worker with electric pace. Carragher: Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba looks ideally suited to the Premier League. He would be expensive, but I would love to see another midfield powerhouse in our league. Wish you were here: Eduardo Vargas (right) would be a good addition to the Premier League . Can Van Gaal take United from seventh to first? Carragher: He will give them the belief that they can challenge straight away. Yes, he will demand a lot as he’s a winner but you can already see the benefits. But I can’t see the title going to Old Trafford unless they add more top players. Robson: I disagree. He can win it. I was really impressed by him while on United’s US tour. His organisation is excellent and no detail is left to chance. It’s also good to see Ryan Giggs involved as it will be an excellent learning curve for him should he eventually take over. Redknapp: We are so narrow-minded in this country and now he’s going to play 3-5-2. It’s a great system but people look at him like he’s from the moon. All of a sudden others will copy him. I don’t think United will win the league because they’ve lost Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic and are a few players short. Top four would be a great season. Keown: He’ll bring organisation and structure and can restore belief at the club. Their home record melted away last season and he needs to re-establish it. He can make the top four and have a cup run. Restoring former glories: Louis van Gaal will aim to take Manchester United from seventh back to the top . Who will surprise us? Redknapp: Everyone is tipping Southampton for a relegation battle but I think they will be solid. Yes, they’ve sold so many stars but there are always talented young players coming through. Keown: Tottenham. They have an outstanding manager in Mauricio Pochettino, who has a very clear way of playing. Their full backs will attack and there will be good movement. Carragher: I agree. Spurs have not bought many players yet but I rate Pochettino and expect a strong challenge for fourth place. They have a squad full of talent. Robson: Hull City could do well. Spurs also have a good squad. Outstanding: Mauricio Pochettino can spring a surprise at Tottenham because of his style of play . Can Liverpool be a force without Luis Suarez? Keown: You can’t lose a player of that quality and be a better team. They need to sign another striker. There’s a lot of pressure on Brendan Rodgers to prove the last campaign was not a one-season wonder. Carragher: They can’t replace Suarez and it is evident that when Sturridge gets injured, they will need more firepower. Buying so many players means that one or two will fail to live up to their price tag . The majority of Rodgers’ first-choice XI will be from last season’s team. Robson: They’ve bought some interesting players but Suarez was special — even though it was right to sell him. The demands of the Champions League will make it difficult for Liverpool to replicate their league form of last season. Redknapp: To lose your superstar is so tough. Maybe they should have bought a big-name striker like Falcao as a direct replacement. I worry there is so much pressure on Rickie Lambert. The expectation is very different from at Southampton — I know that having played for both teams. Pressure: Rickie Lambert will attempt to fill the gap left by Luis Suarez (right) Do you have a message for any one player? Redknapp: Wayne Rooney. He has the chance to be captain for club and country. England captains are like royalty in this country so he needs to behave himself and score goals. Enjoy it, embrace it, you’re not a kid any more. Carragher: Jack Wilshere’s problem is not smoking or other behaviour off the pitch, it’s getting in the team ahead of Aaron Ramsey. Wilshere needs the kind of season Ramsey had last year and to become a leader. Keown: Chris Smalling and Phil Jones have a huge opportunity to finally kick on with Vidic and Ferdinand gone. They need to prove they have futures with United and England. Van Gaal can make them better players. Are they any worse than Holland’s centre halves? No. Robson: I’d tell Fernando Torres to play with confidence. It’s such a shame to see because he looks like he is a lad who wants to do well. Play with confidence: Fernando Torres looks as if he still wants to do well but it isn't happening . So, then where should we be putting our money? Keown: Man City. Robson: Chelsea . Carragher: Chelsea . Redknapp: Chelsea. Carragher and Redknapp will again be a key part of Sky Sports’ coverage this season.

"By . Craig Hope . Follow @CraigHope_DM . Joe Hart admits he has a fight on his hands to keep Manchester City's No 1 jersey this season – but is confident he'll win his duel with summer signing Willy Caballero. The England goalkeeper was restored to the side for Sunday's 2-0 victory at Newcastle after Caballero had debuted in the Community Shield seven days earlier. The suspicion is the Argentine would have kept his place had City not lost 3-0 to Arsenal. But manager Manuel Pellegrini – who worked with Caballero at Malaga – started the Premier League season with Hart and he will continue between the posts when the champions host Liverpool on Monday. Competition: Manchester City keeper Joe Hart is under pressure from summer signing Willy Caballero . Safe hands: Hart collects the ball under pressure from Emmanuel Riviere during City's 2-0 win at Newcastle . Hart, though, was dropped by Pellegrini in favour of Costel Pantilimon after a string of gaffes last season. And the 27-year-old accepts he faces a new challenge following the £6million arrival of Caballero. 'That's who we are as a club. No-one can afford to rest, no-one is undroppable and no-one is guaranteed to play every game,' said Hart, who is currently in talks over a new contract at the Etihad. 'We all have to perform and that includes me. It suits me. I'm a fighter, I've been a fighter all my life. I'll continue to do that. I am ready to fight and I'm looking forward to hopefully keeping this position for a long time.' Hart missed seven league matches when he was axed last November and expects to sit out a few more this time around, if only because of Pellegrini's rotation policy as City compete on four fronts. 'Times have changed. Look around, everyone has (two) quality keepers,' he said. 'Sometimes stuff happens and goalkeeper is an important position, so you need two good keepers. 'Caballero is a great signing. We were sorry to lose Pantilimon to Sunderland and we wish him well. 'But Willy has come in - we know he's a great keeper after what he's done at Malaga. He wants to play as much as I do, but I've got the place at the moment and I'm going to do everything I can to keep it.' New boy: Caballero arrived from Manuel Pellegrini's former club Malaga for £6million this summer . High praise: Hart (left) has described Caballero (right) as a 'great goalkeeper' For the time being, however, Hart is enjoying the view. City barely broke sweat at St James' Park as goals from David Silva and Sergio Aguero got their title defence off to a winning start. And Hart added: 'I've always enjoyed watching this team. It's a great team to play for and they're a great bunch to train with. 'For most of them it comes off more than not, so you can't really say they are flair players - they're just quality players. 'We feel really settled as a team. We've had a good year under this manager and we feel ready to kick on. This club wants to do well and nobody wants to do better than this group of players.'","Hart started as City beat Newcastle 2-0 in their first game of the season .

Manchester City's Elite Development Squad could do little to prevent the 2-1 defeat on Friday night after Shay Facey was sent off for two bookable offences, leaving Chelsea with 10 minutes to attack. Chelsea Youth Team manager Adi Viveash will leave Aldershot sensing fortune was  on his side, while City right-back Pablo Maffeo will return north feeling the opposite. A goal from Maffeo just two minutes in - his first at U21 level - got City en route to  three points, only for the Spaniard to find his own net and gift Chelsea an equaliser 13 minutes from time. It was a melee in the box that allowed Maffeo to capitalise for his opener, before a tricky cross from Chelsea's Alex Kiwomya caused problems for the 17-year-old who, in truth, didn't deserve such rotten luck. It got worse for City as, four minutes later, they were reduced to 10 men with Facey the culprit receiving two yellow cards.

Chelsea Youth Team manager Adi Viveash talked to their official website afterwards. 'It was a really tough game against a really strong, physical team. They caused us problems but the game was everything I expected it to be,' he said. ‘It was nice for Charly to score because it was a difficult decision for me to leave him out. He’s had an outstanding pre-season, scoring and creating goals, and he was unlucky to miss out tonight but he responded in the perfect way.’ Facey's first came in the 56th minute for holding back Kiwomya, before he committed the same foul on Dominic Solanke less than half an hour later to be sent for an early shower in the Aldershot changing rooms. Chelsea sensed the win was within reach, and their persistence paid off. Kiwomya, a thorn in City's side all evening, burst down the right and a deflected cross fell kindly to substitute Musonda, whose low shot found the bottom corner. It was too little, too late for City to muster a comeback, and the U21 Premier League season started with advantage Viveash over Vieira.

"By . Phil Medlicott, Press Association . Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert is uncertain whether captain Ron Vlaar will stay with the club, but stressed he has received no bids for the defender and is 'totally at ease' about the situation. Holland centre-back Vlaar, who impressed at this summer's World Cup, has been linked with various sides of late, including Villa's Barclays Premier League rivals Southampton. Saints boss Ronald Koeman, his compatriot, has been quoted by Dutch media as saying of the 29-year-old that he would 'really like to have him at Southampton'. Will he stay or will he go? Ron Vlaar may be heading out of Aston Villa before the end of the transfer window . Having a look: Ronald Koeman says he would like to sign Vlaar at Southampton this month . But Lambert said on Thursday: 'Nobody has even picked up the phone to ask about him. 'If someone picks up the phone, then you talk. But nobody has.' Asked if he thought Vlaar would remain loyal to Villa, Lambert replied: 'I don't know. 'I'm not sure there is loyalty in football any more. So we'll have to wait and see. It will be entirely up to him.' Vlaar has a year left on his current Villa contract, and talks over a new one have not yet been opened. On the prospect of the player re-signing with the midlands outfit, Lambert said: 'To be fair to Ron, he has not come to us or anything. 'We have had little chats here and there, but I think his main concern was getting back after the World Cup, getting fit and hopefully being ready for Saturday (Villa's Premier League opener at Stoke). 'That is where he has been. I have a good rapport with Ron, so I don't have any problem with that whatsoever.' He added: 'We have never really had a chat about it (Vlaar staying or not). I'm pretty sure once it kind of settles down, there will be time for that. 'I am sitting here at ease with it - it doesn't really bother me at the moment. 'I'm sure I'll sit with Randy (Lerner, Villa's owner, and discuss the situation). 'I'm pretty sure things will evolve over the next few weeks or so, and we'll see what happens. But at the moment I'm totally at ease with everything, and so is Ron.' Lambert will check the condition of both World Cup semi-finalist Vlaar and new signing Joe Cole (thigh) ahead of Saturday's match but is optimistic both will be able to feature. Lambert has also reported strikers Christian Benteke and Libor Kozak are ahead of schedule in their rehabilitation from long-term injuries and could be available in 'a few weeks'. Belgium international Benteke has been sidelined since April, when he suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon in training with Villa that ruled him out of the World Cup and which the club said would require a minimum of six months' recovery time. Kozak sustained his injury in training with Villa as well, the Czech Republic frontman breaking his leg in January. Not flustered: Villa boss Paul Lambert remains calm about the prospect of Vlaar leaving the club . Another long-term absentee, defender Jores Okore, could be in line for his first competitive appearance since September having recovered from a serious knee problem. There could also be comebacks for winger Charles N'Zogbia, out for all of last term with an Achilles injury, as well as defender Alan Hutton and striker Darren Bent, who have previously been exiled from the Villa first-team and out on loan. All four have been involved in the club's pre-season. Bent has said he is feeling 'really positive' and 'confident about what's ahead', although Lambert has emphasised the ex-Sunderland man has work to do. When on loan for the season at Fulham in 2013/14, Bent scored six goals in 30 appearances in all competitions, and Lambert said: 'He had a bit of a barren spell even there. 'So he is going to have to really work at it - it is not going to come easy to him. 'Even the Fulham spell was a bit tough for him and he didn't really score that many goals. 'It is an opportunity for him now back here and it is up to himself.' Along with midfielder Cole, Saturday could also see competitive Villa debuts for three other summer recruits in defenders Philippe Senderos and Aly Cissokho and wide man Kieran Richardson. Meanwhile, reports have suggested Elche's Colombia midfielder Carlos Sanchez will be next to join, but Lambert was giving little away on that front on Thursday. 'The situation is that he is still not our player,' Lambert said. 'We'll have to see what happens over the next few days or so.'","Holland defender impressed hugely at the World Cup in Brazil .

"By . Hamish Mackay . Follow @@H_Mackay . Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert is planning on holding talks with captain Ron Vlaar in a bid to resolve the defender's future. With one year remaining on the Dutchman's contract, and following his stand-out performances for Holland in the World Cup, Vlaar has been linked with a number of clubs, notably Serie A pair Juventus and Lazio. After an extended break for the 29-year-old after his World Cup exertions, Vlaar returned to the Villa fold on Saturday, although only as a spectator for the club's 4-1 pre-season friendly defeat at Groningen. Transfer: Ron Vlaar is set for talks with Paul Lambert, the defender only has a year remaining on his contract . With Vlaar back in training this week as the countdown continues towards the opening Premier League game with Stoke on August 16, Lambert said: 'He told me he is concentrating on that game. 'He's not had much of a break, but he's enthusiastic, positive and raring to go.' Once Vlaar is back in the swing of things again, Lambert plans on a more in-depth chat. 'It was a good feeling I got from him,' added Lambert, speaking to the Birmingham Mail. 'To be fair, it was a really brief conversation I had before the game as I was preparing the lads for the match. 'Ron's got another year still to go on his contract, it's not as if he's at the end of it. 'Once we get back I'll sit with him, we'll have a bit more time, but he loves it at Villa, that's well known.'

"By . Pa Reporter . Roger Federer remains on course for his sixth Western & Southern Open title after advancing to the final with victory over Milos Raonic. The Swiss world number three is in a rich vein of form and will face David Ferrer in his fourth consecutive ATP final after winning in Halle and falling at the last hurdle at Wimbledon and in Toronto. The semi-final was a fairly straightforward affair with Raonic providing little resistance as Federer won 6-2 6-3. In form: Federer has reached the final in each of his last four ATP events, peaking in time for the US Open . Acknowledgement: The world number three waves to the crowd in Cincinatti where he has won five times . Federer did not drop a point on his serve in the first set and needed just a single break in the eighth game of the second to close out a routine win. 'I'm playing much better (than) last year. I can move freely again,' Federer told ESPN. 'I'm happy the results show. It's more fun playing this way. Now I am playing the right away. 'It's great for the confidence to switch from clay to grass to hard courts and keep on playing well. I've had a very complete season so far. 'This is my eighth final of the season. I hope I can win another final here.' Normal service: The Swiss star is enjoying tennis at the moment as he reached his eighth final of the year . Tough time: Raonic failed to win a single point on Federer's serve in the first set . Ferrer advanced to his 45th ATP Tour final on Sunday after beating Julien Benneateau 6-3 6-2. The 32-year-old Ferrer is chasing his second title of the season, having won the Copa Claro in February, and is hitting form at the right time ahead of the US Open. This win took just 72 minutes to complete, with 20 winners and a 40 per cent success rate with break points. In the women's draw, Serena Williams is a win away from her first title in Cincinnati after beating close friend Caroline Wozniacki 2-6 6-4 6-2. Williams now has an 8-1 record against the Dane, with this victory one of her most hard-fought with Wozniacki having been 4-2 ahead in the second set and on course for victory. 'I got off to a little bit of a slow start, but I was definitely in it,' Williams told the official WTA website. Rampant: David Ferrer took little over an hour to see off Julien Benneteau and reach the final . Outclassed: The two men share a moment at the end of the match which Ferrer won 6-3 6-2 . 'I was just physically grinding and trying to get in there and really just trying to grind out everything. 'She's a really good returner and she was getting everything back and making some good shots.' Williams will face Ana Ivanovic in the final after the former world number one overcame Maria Sharapova 6-2 5-7 7-5. After taking the first set, Ivanovic led 4-0 in the second and looked to be cruising before Sharapova hit back with the Russian leading 4-2 in the third. Stretched: Williams was made to work hard for her victory over Wozniaki, coming from a set and a break down . But Ivanovic was not to be beaten and battled back to set up a final against Williams. 'For me, the most important thing is recovery for tomorrow and trying to be fresh,' she said. 'It's going to be a great match, I think. We played three times this year already. 'I think it's going to be a great test for me as well to play against Serena. She's the number one player in the world and she's a great champion, so I think it's going to be a good match. I hope it goes well.'","Federer beats Raonic 6-3 6-2 to reach fourth consecutive tour final .

"By . Sam Peters . Relieved Stuart Broad was last night told he would not require facial surgery after suffering extensive damage to his nose when a short-pitched delivery from Varun Aaron smashed through the protective grille of his helmet. The England fast bowler top-edged a delivery into his face after hitting Aaron for successive sixes and was forced to retire hurt for 12, helped from the field by the team’s medical staff with blood pouring from his nose. The 28-year-old was taken to a nearby Manchester hospital shortly afterwards with his badly swollen nose heavily bandaged but was referred to a second hospital where a specialist in facial reconstructive techniques was able to assess the damage. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the clip of Stuart Broad take a blow to the nose . Painful: Broad takes a big hit to the face after a Varun Aaron ball went straight through the grille of his helmet . Distress: Broad looks in a bad way after the incident on Saturday afternoon . Bandaged up: Broad looks in a much better way after getting treatment for the injury . Lucky escape: It could have been a lot worse for Broad despite suffering a nasty injury . Broad, who was unable to collect his man-of-the-match award after taking six for 25 in India’s first innings, must now be considered a serious doubt for the fifth and final Investec Test at The Oval, after suffering a suspected broken nose and possible concussion. He is still expected to be fit for the fifth Test next Friday. Broad confirmed this week he will have surgery at the end of the series on a condition called patella tendinitis, caused by wear and tear on the knee joint but, if he is unable to play at The Oval, he could fly to Sweden this week for a second bout of surgery. The gruesome damage to his nose, caused when the ball slipped between the protective grille and the peak of his helmet, caused questions to be raised about the safety of modern headwear. He was wearing a relatively new helmet design made by Bristol-based company Arytek, which havs become increasingly popular among international players in recent years and claims to employ a unique ‘Air Cushioning Impact System’ (ACIS). The manufacturers also claim the sharper peak to the helmet makes it less likely for a ball to sneak between the grille and the lid. Yesterday it emerged that a new British safety standard is being finalised aimed at making cricket helmets safer in an attempt to prevent similar injuries in future. ‘The old British Standard didn’t even test the grille impacts and that was an obvious flaw,’ said Angus Porter, the chief executive of the Professional Cricketers’ Association. ‘So we have been working with the ECB, the ICC and British Standards over the last couple of years and that new standard is ready to be implemented.’ The new safety standards will limit the ability of players to adjust their protective grille settings — with a maximum of 55mm recommended. ‘One of the things in the new standard is that it changes the ability of a user to set the protective grille and leave an unsafe gap,’ said Porter. ‘With the new designs there is often no ability to adjust the gap between the peak and the grille which is not necessarily popular with the players but which is necessary.’ England vs India .

World number one Novak Djokovic's preparations for the US Open suffered another blow after a straight-sets defeat to Tommy Robredo in the third round of the Western & Southern Open. Djokovic, who looked to be back to his imperious best in winning Wimbledon last month, has struggled with the transition onto the American hard courts and with the final major of the year a little over two weeks away, doubts will be raised as to whether the 27-year-old can make a credible challenge. He was thumped by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Rogers Cup last week and any thoughts that may have been an aberration vanished following a 7-6 (8/6) 7-5 defeat to 16th-seeded Spaniard Robredo in one hour and 44 minutes. One of those days: Novak Djokovic is out of the Cincinatti Masters after a straight-sets loss to Tommy Robredo . Surprise: Veteran Robredo looks to the sky after clinching a 7-6 (8-6), 7-5 win . 'Just many, many, many things are not clicking these two weeks on hard courts,' said Djokovic on the ATP Tour website. 'It's unfortunate, but it's more than obvious I'm not playing even close to what I'm supposed to play. I have to keep on working and trying to get better for the US Open.' The ongoing tournament in Cincinnati is the only Masters title that Djokovic has not won, although he has been a finalist on four occasions. The opportunity, therefore, to complete a career 'Golden Masters' has been put on hold for another year following Thursday's defeat. Djokovic was made to toil in a three-set victory over Gilles Simon 24 hours earlier and looked uncomfortable throughout, making 30 unforced errors before limply conceding his serve in the final game to give 32-year-old Robredo victory.

Neale Daniher (top, right) with brothers and former fellow Essendon team players . Daniher told Seven News that he will spend the next few months educating the public about the disease and encouraging high-profile AFL players to help tell his story. Motor neurone disease (MND) slowly attacks the nervous system, until the use of arms, legs and ability to speak, swallow and breathe are gone. Its causes are still unknown. Daniher first realised there was a problem when he experienced trouble hanging out his washing. He went for tests, assuming there would a simple fix. 'Modern science. A few ­injections. A few tablets. Nothing serious. I’ll be back putting clothes on the line again,' Daniher explained. But after nine months he was finally diagnosed with MND. Still currently living an active life, Daniher says the worst past of the debilitating disease is that it does not affect one's mental ability. 'A tragedy of the disease is you’re a witness to your body dying,' he said. Neale Daniher (middle) hopes that sharing his battle with the public will help raise awareness for MND and encourage AFL celebrities to support the fatal disease . But the former coach, who took charge of 223 games for Melbourne between 1998 and 2007, says he plans to make the most of all the time he has left. 'You don’t cope by fear. You just day-by-day exist,' he said. 'You just get on with life and enjoy life and there’s a lot to enjoy. 'And you don’t cope by thinking where this will end up? There’s no fun in that. You don’t get many laughs in that.' Journalists and football teams have taken to Twitter to pay tribute to Daniher.

'I think to myself all day, what about my boys... what can I do to make sure that they remember me,' she said. Ms Rajah suffers an extremely rare form of cancer that is likely to kill her, reported Channel 9's A Current Affair. 'I may not be around past Christmas and expected case is a couple of years,' she said. Scroll down for video . Yasmin Rajah and her partner Ryan Price have two young sons Josiah (left) and Jazz (right) At just 29, Ms Rajah could have just months to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer . After going to a doctor believing she had a broken rib in July, tests revealed a cancerous tumour about the size of a grapefruit and squashing her heart. Diagnosed with stage 3 cancer, mature teratoma with a malignant adenocarcinoma differentiation, it has since spread to her bones and spine, reducing her chance of survival to just five per cent despite the tumour being removed from her right lung through open heart surgery. The form of cancer is so rare that little research has been done on it. After learning she had the disease, Ms Rajah said her first concern was her family - partner Ryan Price and their sons Jazz, eight, and five-year-old Josiah. The couple have been together for eight years and are now planning to marry thanks to the generosity of the community . Ms Rajah said her first concern after being diagnosed with the cancer was her family, including sons Jazz (left) and Josiah (right) Jazz said he hoped his mum could stay clam, be strong and get rid of the cancer as quick as a 'flash'. 'We did tell the boys that mummy was going to beat cancer and going to live, but things have changed,' Yasmin said. Her partner Ryan described Ms Rajah's condition as a sinking boat. 'There's a hole in it and no matter how much water you scope out, it's not helping - it just sinks,' he said. 'I love her with cancer, I love her without cancer, I love her with hair, I love her without hair.' Mr Price said he loves his partner with or without her cancer . While the couple initially told their sons Ms Rajah would beat cancer, her condition has since worsened . The couple met eight years ago in a bar where Ms Rajah performed and Mr Price said as soon as he saw her, he hoped she would talk to him and they are now planning on getting married. 'It means a lot to be a complete family unit,' Ms Rajah said, regardless of whether a marriage certificate is just a piece of paper to some people. Ms Rajah previously gave her first engagement ring to a minister who lost his home in a flood because she had no money to offer. In in act of complete kindness, Mr Price contacted Brisbane radio station B105, which is helping the couple get married with businesses and the public donating wedding rings, a wedding dress, venue hire, hair, make-up, catering and a bucks and hens night. A Brisbane radio station is helping the couple get married after Mr Price informed them about his partner's condition . A local business donated Ms Rajah's engagement ring, pictured, and also the couple's wedding ring . Since the radio broadcast information about Mr Price's letter, businesses and members of the public have donated goods and services for the wedding . Ms Rajah said the wedding plans had been a great distraction form her illness. Flight Centre has since teamed up with the radio station to create an online fundraiser at Givex.com so the couple can take their sons with them on a trip to Disneyland LA. The company has put $3,000 into the fund, which aims to raise $30,000 by the end of the month. 'This is the hardest thing I know I'll ever have to go through in my entire life,' Mr Price said. 'I hope that if things don't go as well as expected, that they (her sons and partner) know that I love them - that's it', Ms Rajah said.","Brisbane mother Yasmin Rajah has a rare form of cancer .

I'm very obsessional. Once I get started on something I just get carried away. 'A lot of people look at me aggressively. They look almost saddened and angry but I don't understand why - it's me who's looking like this, not them. He says his condition has made him change his appearance radically several times over the past five decades . Keith Gordon, pictured, has gone full circle since his youth by tattooing most of his body, even his eyelids . 'But I love the attention. I love being different and I love showing people that it is okay to be different.' Mr Gordon was part of the skinhead cult as a teenager. He says he then became obsessed with heavy metal - along with the long hair and tattoos. Along with his fellow music lovers, he covered his arms and shoulders in inkings - but he had to have them all removed after landing himself an office role - eventually working his way up to a £30,000-a-year job as an administrator. After years of change Mr Gordon finally turned his back on his carefree Bohemian life in Soho, world travels and excessive drinking to finally settle down at the age of 45 - getting married to Lisa, 42, and having children Jamie-Lee, 11, Ricky, eight, Jennifer, five. Keith Gordon turned his back on his carefree Bohemian life in Soho and settled down at the age of 45, getting married to Lisa, 42, in 2001, pictured . Keith Gordon is pictured last month next to wife, Lisa, and their children Diana Rose, 14, Jennifer, five, Ricky, eight and Jamie-Lee, 11 . He also became a father to Lisa's daughter Diana Rose, 14, from a previous relationship. Then, five years ago, after nearly 10 years of marriage, he felt an overwhelming urge to return to his first love - tattoos. He said: 'I had some tattoos done on my arms when I was 17 but I had them all taken off with skin grafts after changing my mind. 'It has only been later on in my life that I realised I should have stuck to my original beliefs and been true to myself. Now, I've come around full-circle. 'I don't know how many there are in total. I've lost count. It is just one big project. 'But getting my whole head tattooed was a very extreme, intense experience. 'There was a feeling of euphoria coming out knowing I had got another new piece and that I'd managed to stand the pain. Despite paying £15,000 for the tattoos, Keith Gordon, pictured left in the 1980s and, right, earlier this year, admits the art does not fit in well with his conservative lifestyle . 'At times it was very, very painful especially around the corner of the eyes, the lip and parts of the inner ear - that was absolutely killer.' But he admits it does not fit in well with his conservative lifestyle. He added: 'It doesn't go down to well at work, I'm like a fish out of water there. 'Generally speaking, younger people tend to really, really like the way I look. 'I get a lot of really positive reactions and they say stuff like 'hey, that's sick, that's really cool'. 'But then on the other end of the spectrum you've got the older ones who are not so favourable. 'I had one woman who was probably about 75 and upwards, who was with her very straight-laced conservative-type husband, look right into my face and said 'oh my God'. 'So I said it straight back. What's the big deal?' Up close: Keith Gordon has the words 'Jesus' and 'Satan' inked above his eyelashes . Not surprisingly his new appearance went completely against the wishes of his wife - even though he managed to convince her to get her own done after paying £1,500 for the rose and heart designs on her forearm and shoulder blade. Mrs Gordon, a former cleaner from the Philippines, said: 'I never would have married him if he looked like this when I met him. 'I feel embarrassed when we are out and everyone stares. But he's a good husband and a good father and I persevere. 'People think I am with him for the money but that's not true. I love him, that's why we got married.' His new look has also put him at odds with his children. Keith Gordon, pictured with his family in 2005, cut his hair and had all his inkings removed through painful skin grafts so he could start a white-collar career as an administrator . Son Ricky, who is learning kung fu and enjoys video games, said: 'I think it looks a bit ugly. My mum doesn't like it and I kind of agree with her. He looks kind of evil. 'I see it every day so I'm not really bothered but people always look at him and then they look away. 'My friends at school think he's cool and awesome. But he's just a regular dad to me.' Despite his family's objections, Mr Gordon is pushing ahead with even more tattoos and is in the process of finishing off a huge inking that spans his entire back. Even then it is unlikely he will stop and he is already planning to use his new look to audition for hard-man acting roles on television. He added: 'I've had them done now so I may as well try and make them work for me.'","Keith Gordon had body art had tattoos removed to secure white-collar job .

"By . Frank Coletta For Daily Mail Australia . First it was poor people who don't drive cars, now it seems Joe Hockey has been unwittingly dragged into a controversy over whether his driver stopped in a disabled parking zone when he picked the Treasurer up from Sydney Airport. But the images don't lie and despite Sydney Airport suggesting there 'was nothing wrong' with the driver's actions, the Treasurer's office did not shirk the matter with its prompt response to questions on the matter today. 'The treasurer was unaware of where the private contractor had parked and had no control over that as he was walking out of the airport terminal,' a spokesman said. It's unlikely the contractor will make the same mistake again, however, Mr Hockey's office going on to  add that 'the driver has been counselled'. Scroll down for video . You decide. Is the Treasurer's chauffeur-driven car stopping in a disabled parking zone at Sydney Airport? Despite what looks like a clear mistake, Sydney Airport security was contacted and did suggest the driver had not done anything wrong, having stopped in a limousine only area. That area is accessible only by a swipe card through a boom-gate. Under NSW Roads and Maritime Services . parking offences Rule 168-1 (1) Stop/park in a restricted parking area, . the fine for this infringement would be $104 and 2 demerit points. Earlier a spokeswoman for Mr Hockey had reportedly told ninemsn that the driver was not fined or even spoken to for stopping where he did, and that there were at least 10 other disabled spots still vacant at the time. Red marks the spot. It would appear hard for anyone to argue that this chauffeured car is not stopped in a disabled parking bay . Almost 3 and a half million Australians have a disability and Grace Fava from the Autism Advisory and Support Service says this is the sort of situation that she hears about far too often. 'It's not just those with physical disabilities, we also see it happening to parents with children with disabilities, it can make it very hard for them too,' she said. 'Aussies are usually very giving and considerate but this is wrong and I don't care how busy someone is, there is no excuse. 'His driver should know better and he should also know that Joe should not be treated any differently to any of us, I know he is a charitable man but this is not on.' Ms Fava called on the Treasurer to make a charitable donation to match what would have been the fine ($104). 'It's the honourable thing to do,' she said. This incident is just the latest in what is fast becoming a cavalcade of car-related gaffes for the embattled Treasurer. Last week he was forced to apologise after making comments that rich people spend more on fuel than poor households because poor people don't have cars or don't drive far. For that he was labelled a 'cigar-chomping Foghorn Leghorn' who is out of touch with Australians. Since then his own personal wealth has come under scrutiny, and more recently the hundreds of thousands of dollars that go towards his own forms of road transport has been revealed. Mr Hockey's expenditure and entitlements report showed that the treasurer has spent more than $200,000 of taxpayer's money over the past four years on cars and cabs.","Treasurer's driver 'counselled' over his apparent error of judgement .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Roger Federer survived an opening-match fright by outlasting Canada's Vasek Pospisil 7-6  5-7 6-2 on Wednesday to claim his 300th Masters Series win and reach the third round of the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati. Back in action after losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto on Sunday, third-ranked Federer appeared sluggish at times as he struggled to tame the 46th-ranked Canadian. With the victory the second seeded Swiss, a five-time champion on the Cincinnati hard courts, becomes the first player to reach 300 wins in the ATP Tour's elite Masters 1000 events. Focus: Federer held on to eventually win in three sets after being made to work hard by Pospisil . Respect: The two players share a moment after the Swiss star had finally triumphed . The match began with a tight opening set that saw neither player able to capitalise on break chances, Federer eventually winning the tiebreak on a forehand error by the Canadian. Pospisil, winner of the Wimbledon doubles title with American Jack Sock, battled back to take the second but a focused Federer wasted no time taking charge in the third with an early break on way to clinching the milestone win. The day featured a pair of early upsets with Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun shocking fourth seeded Czech Tomas Berdych 3-6 6-3 6-4 while Poland's Jerzy Janowicz knocked off Bulgarian seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 3-6 6-3. Unlucky: Pospisil put in a strong performance but couldn't deny Federer his 300th Masters win . After a first round bye eighth seeded Briton Andy Murray got his tournament off to a convincing start easing past Portugal's Joao Sousa 6-3 6-3. Murray, who has twice hoisted the trophy in Cincinnati, faced just two break points the entire match saving both while disposing of his Portuguese opponent in a tidy 72 minutes. 'The conditions are completely different here to Toronto,' said Murray, who made a quarterfinal exit in Canada. 'A few of the guys that have come in late have struggled with the conditions. Upset: Lu Yen-hsun knocked out Tomas Berdych in three sets as the top players struggled in Cincinnati . 'I hit the ball well from the back of the court today. I was able to control the ball well.

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . Members of the 2011 Cronulla Sharks team could escape with bans of just one month if they admit to taking banned substances in their controversial supplements program, following an investigation that was labelled Australia's 'darkest day in sport'. Players including captain Paul Gallen would need to accept heavily discounted suspensions of between one to six months in a bid to restore stability in the ailing club after 18 months of scrutiny over their supplements program. The Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) started investigating Cronulla in February 2013 over the use of banned substances during an 11 week period at the start of the 2011 season. Past and present Cronulla Sharks including captain Paul Gallen could face bans of up to six months as part of the ASADA investigation . The Sharks have paid a high price as a result of the investigation, which has set the club back $4 million, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The club faces finishing the NRL competition in last position after losing all but five games this season. Coach Shane Flanagan was suspended and the club has played most of this season without a sponsor due to the drug scandal and it paid a $600,000 fine to the NRL. AFL club Essendon have also faced scrutiny following a supplements scandal. Thirty-four current and former Essendon players were issued show-cause notices in June by the anti-doping agency. NRL Cronulla Sharks Deputy Chairman Keith Ward and Deputy Chair of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Tricia Kavanagh address the media at the Cronulla Sharks club in Sydney last year when the investigation was first announced . Coach James Hird was suspended ahead of the club's hierarchy launching legal action against the ASADA investigation last week as their battle continues. It's believed 17 Sharks players will be offered bans of up to six months and all would be back playing after the first month of next season. The retirement of John Morris will mean only six players will remain from those who played in 2011. Remaining players Sam Tagataese and Ricky Luetele were cleared by ASADA, as well as New Zealand Warrior Chad Townsend. Coach Shane Flanagan was suspended and Cronulla has played most of this season without a sponsor due to the drug scandal and it paid a $600,000 fine to the NRL . But that means captain Paul Gallen, Anthony Tupou, Nathan Gardner and Wade Graham could still face sanctions at the ends of the season. If Gallen was to be suspended he would miss the Four Nations tournament for Australia. No players would be able to train with their clubs or have an official role until after the ban. Former Sharks players at other clubs are expected to be offered similar deals including Gold Coast's Luke Douglas and Albert Kelly, Newcastle's Jeremy Smith and Kade Snowden and North Queensland player Matthew Wright. AFL club Essendon have also faced scrutiny following a supplements scandal with coach James Hird also suspended . Other players including Ben Pomeroy, Paul Aiton and Josh Cordoba moved into Super League. During 2011, 31 players were used during the season, but it's believed the investigation targeted 17 who played from round two to five. Players have claimed their innocence throughout the investigation. Gallen previously said he never considered taking a bans for being 'truthful and honest'. On the eve of State of Origin II Gallen said said the stress of the investigation had effected the mental health of players and even prevented him and his wife having another child. 'From day one, from the time Cronulla got brought into it which was a week or so after that press conference, I don't know anything,' Gallen said. 'Nothing has changed for me. I have been told to turn up to a meeting. I turned up at that meeting. Other than that, I don't know anything.'

Naomi Michelle Coleman, 37, was taken into custody at the airport in Colombo, after she arrived from India. Ms Coleman, who has a tattoo of a Buddha seated on a lotus flower on her right arm, was arrested for ‘hurting others' religious feelings,’ a police spokesman said. Tat's enough: Naomi Coleman, 37, was arrested at Bandaranaike International Airport in Sri Lanka for 'hurting religious feelings' with her sleeve depicting Buddha on a lotus flower . After her arrest at Bandaranaike International Airport, Ms Coleman appeared before a magistrate who ordered her deportation to Britain. The spokesman said she is currently being held at an immigration detention centre until deportation and said she would be removed ‘very soon - it could be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow’. This is not the first time body art depicting Buddha has gotten foreigners into trouble in Sri Lanka. Buddhism is the religion of the country's majority ethnic Sinhalese and Buddhist tattoos are seen as culturally insensitive. Briton Antony Ratcliffe was reportedly deported for showing a Buddha tattoo on his arm in March last year. Back to Britain: Ms Coleman was arrested in Colombo and later ordered to be deported back to Britain over her tattoo . Ms Coleman had arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport  from India, but is now set to cut short her holiday . In February 2013 a tourist from Netherlands was arrested by police in Kandy, central Sri Lanka, for having a large tattoo of Buddha prominently on her back, Gossip Lanka News reported. She was fined and released after saying that she had not intended to cause offence. In 2012 three French tourists were given suspended prison sentences for taking photographs in which they pretended to kiss a statue of Buddha at a temple. The American rapper Akon also realised the offence he had caused when he was refused a visa in 2010 after protests over one of his music videos in which scantily-clad women danced in front of a Buddha statue. More than 100,000 British citizens visited Sri Lanka in last year, accounting for 10 per cent of the total number of tourists, and the UK is the country's second-largest trading partner after India. Today, A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed they were dealing with the case of a detained British national. She said: ‘We are aware of the detention of a British national in Sri Lanka on April 21. We are providing consular assistance.’","British tourist arrested at airport in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Only three in ten people with a common mental illness such as depression get treatment, a leading psychiatrist has said. Professor Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that some youngsters with mental health issues get ‘literally no’ treatment. Prof Wessely told a newspaper, in his first interview since taking up the post in June, that the nation would not tolerate it if these figures related to cancer care. Depression: It is said that some youngsters with mental health issues get 'literally no' treatment (file picture) Interview: Professor Simon Wessely (pictured), president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said only three in ten people with a common mental illness such as depression get treatment . The expert said that in some areas patients are routinely waiting for up to two years for care. He told The Guardian: ‘People are still routinely waiting for - well, we don't really know, but certainly more than 18 weeks, possibly up to two years, for their treatment and that is routine in some parts of the country. ‘Some children aren't getting any treatment at all - literally none. That's what's happening.’ He said a larger proportion of people with severe mental illness have access to treatment but the figure still only stands at around 65 per cent. Prof Wessely said that although the NHS has an aspiration to deliver parity of esteem between physical and mental health services, ‘the gap is now so big and yet there is no more money’. Death: The news comes after the passing of actor Robin Williams who was found hanged in his bedroom at his California home earlier this week. Williams, 63, had grappled with severe depression . He added: ‘If people really want true parity in the sense of actual 90 per cent of mental health patients are treated within 18 weeks, just like they are for other disorders, that is going to have to mean money will have to move from acute to mental health.

Jo Perkins, 38, had long had the butterfly design on the side of her left foot when she started working for multi-million pound firm Salisbury FM earlier this year. But months after she started work, bosses brought in a ‘no tattoos on show’ rule – and terminated Miss Perkins’s contract when she found it difficult to cover up her inking. Controversial: Jo Perkins's butterfly tattoo on her foot which she says is only visible when she wears dresses .

She was not dealing with the public and says she was praised for her ‘outstanding’ work during her five months with the firm. Consultant Ms Perkins was forced from her . post with facilities management company Salisbury FM Ltd after falling . foul of a tough new 'no tattoos' rule introduced in June . There is no law protecting employees from being dismissed or not being engaged for work because they have a tattoo. In addition the Equality Act expresses that tattoos are not protected from disability discrimination as a severe disfigurement. It states: 'Tattoos and body piercings are not severe disfigurements that are treated as having a substantial adverse effect on the ability of the person concerned to carry out normal day-to-day activities.' Employment lawyer Nicholas Lakeland, who works for London law firm Silverman Sherliker, said that it was unlikely Miss Perkins could take any legal action as she had been working under contract for an agency. He said: 'From the facts, it sounds like a very harsh decision and an unfair one, actually. But obviously their policy is: ""No one with tattoos works for us"".' After hearing about the anti-tattoo policy, Miss Perkins says she sought advice regarding her inking. Miss . Perkins said: ‘The only way to cover it would be to wear a sock.

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . If you're more familiar with the well-endowed end of the underwear alphabet, wearing a bra that doesn't feel as thought it belongs to your grandmother might seem like an impossible dream. But a new fashion which allows big-bosomed ladies to wear more glamorous underwear is sweeping the high street - meaning larger bras no longer have to feel as though they are reinforced with iron. The trend hit the M&S lingerie laboratory earlier this summer, when experts unveiled a new non-wired bra for those with DD cups and larger. Scroll down for video . M&S is just one of the high street chains which is branching out in its range of larger bras, allowing women with bigger breasts to wear the more luxurious bras usually reserved for small cup sizes. Pictured: An example from their DD+ range . M&S recently unveiled its first non-wired bra for those with DD cups and larger, pictured above . Triumph has also created an innovative bra from those with larger assets, which uses silicone for uplift, instead of wire. Wonderbra, another popular underwear company, has also started selling strapless bras - previously only for those with petite breasts - up to a G cup. And, according to the statistics, it's about time. According to The Times, In the past ten years alone, the average bra size in the UK has increased from a 34B to a 36C. Amy Debenham-Evans, . lingerie merchandiser at Figleaves, added that the DD+ . business is worth 80 per more than the core size business of cups AA to D. Harlow & Fox was set up in 2011 specifically to . provide more luxurious bras for DD to G cups, while high street brands such as Elle Macpherson and . Agent Provocateur have since followed suit. The prominence of celebrities such as Kelly Brook in glossy magazines means bigger breasts are being celebrated . And, with the likes of Kelly Brook and other celebrities with larger breasts often being featured in glossy magazines, it seems larger boobs are having something of a Renaissance. According to M&S, the new range of non-wired bra uses 'compressed cup technology' which means the foam cups are specially moulded to give compression in the right places. It also includes a supportive cradle to help keep the bra in place - without having the usual, somewhat unflattering, two-inch straps. The designs include lace and silk, previously reserved for bras with a smaller cup size. Soozie Jenkinson, head of lingerie design . for M&S, said it was a beautiful design which still delivered on great shape definition and support. Meanwhile, Triumph's new bra with silicone - complete with animal print fabric and padded cups - gives the shape and . uplift of an underwired bra. Julia . Mercer, Triumph's bra fit expert, told The Times that the tide was turning because the average bra size sold by the company in M&S had increased from a 34B to a 36D. She said it was partly due to less active lifestyles, but also because so many people had previously worn the wrong-sized bra.","M&S lingerie unveiled a new non-wired, lacy bra for those with DD+ cups .

"By . Mark Prigg . Researchers have uncovered a tiny 5cm long hedgehog that roamed what is now Canada 52 million years ago. The creature, Silvacola acares, lived roughly 13 million years after an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs and left the mammals as the dominant land animals. About the length of a person's thumb, it ate insects, plants and maybe seeds, the researchers said. Scroll down for video . The thumb-sized hedgehog Silvacola can be seen with the tapir-like Heptodon in this reconstruction of an early Eocene Canadian rainforest. The Earth has experienced many dramatic changes in climate since the dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago. The warmest period was the early Eocene Epoch, 50 to 53 million years ago. During this interval, North American mammal communities were quite distinct from those of today. 'We were surprised by its tiny size, and frankly it threw me for a while and made it difficult to identify,' said University of Colorado paleontologist Jaelyn Eberle, one of the researchers in the study published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Its scientific name means 'tiny forest dweller.' Today's hedgehogs, and especially the ones that are kept as pets, are considerably larger. The smallest living hedgehogs are about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) long, not including the tail, Eberle said, 'but the moonrats (close cousins) can actually be upwards of 18 inches long (46 cm) and weigh a few pounds.'Hedgehogs are known for the quills they use to protect themselves. The fossils were not complete enough to show whether or not Silvacola possessed quills. Eberle said primitive hedgehogs that lived in Europe around the same time had bristly hair, so Silvacola may have had it as well. Today's hedgehogs also can curl up into a ball for protection. Instead of being removed from the surrounding rock, the delicate upper jaw was examined with a high-resolution CT scanner at Penn State University to avoid damaging the tiny cheek teeth. The earliest known member of the family that includes hedgehogs and moonrats lived about 58 million years ago. Today's hedgehogs and their relatives live in Europe, Asia and Africa. Today's hedgehogs, and especially the ones that are kept as pets, are considerably larger. The smallest living hedgehogs are about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) long, not including the tail. The researchers described another interesting mammal called Heptodon found at the same site, Driftwood Canyon Provincial Park. It was a tapir-like creature about as big as a medium-sized dog. It was a herbivore about half the size of today's tapirs but lacking the short trunk usually seen in these mammals. The half-pint hedgehog and trunk-less tapir lived in a rainforest along the edges of a lake, but it was not tropical, the researchers said. Rather it was a cooler, upland rainforest, more akin to today's climate in Portland, Oregon in the U.S. Pacific Northwest, about 700 miles (1,100 km) south of this location. 'Driftwood Canyon is a window into a lost world, an evolutionary experiment where palms grew beneath spruce trees and the insects included a mixture of Canadian and Australian species, said David Greenwood of Canada's Brandon University, another of the researchers. 'Discovering mammals allows us to paint a more complete picture of this lost world.'","5cm long hedgehog roamed what is now Canada 52 million years ago .

"By . Ross Davies . Cornwall's tourism board is seeking to soothe holidaymakers' fears over the swarms of jellyfish being washed up on its beaches this summer. According to the Marine Conservation Society, by mid-July there were already been 500 sightings of the floating animals across the south west seaboard. Experts have linked the spike to low wind levels and balmy sea temperatures, which have peaked at 21 degrees. Familiar visitor: The Barrel jellyfish is the most common jellyfish found in British waters . However, local tourism bosses have sought to reassure visitors that the jellyfish invasion is no threat to their safety. Malcolm Bell, Head of Tourism at Visit Cornwall, told Sky News: 'It's no different really to rock pooling - you keep your eyes open for the crabs and everything else. 'It's part of the habitat, it's part of the fun thing about having a British beach holiday.' Hotspot: Tens of thousands of tourists flock to Cornwall's beaches each summer . The most common jellyfish found in British waters is the barrel jellyfish. One metre in diameter, it can also be found on the coastlines of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. However, while the barrel jellyfish is considered to be harmless, the smaller, translucent Moon jellyfish, which constitutes 29 per cent of the species' population, can have a very mild sting. There have also been sightings of the fearsome Portuguese Man O'War, which carries a nasty sting, although they are far more rare. Careful where you step: There have already been over 500 jellyfish sightings on Cornish beaches this summer and moon jellyfish (pictured) have a mild sting . With sightings set to increase in the coming months, conservationist Patrick Maher from Dive Newquay advised: 'The important thing to remember with jellyfish is that they can continue to sting even after they have been washed up on the beach and are dead. 'Don't poke them, don't pick them up - avoid them and allow the authorities to remove them, seek medical advice if you get stung by one, but we are very lucky in Cornwall to have these types of species in our waters.'","500 sightings already this summer, says Marine Conservation Society .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . Josie Cunningham claims people who 'whinge' about her nose should help fund £3,000 surgery to alter it . A controversial wannabe glamour model who received a free NHS breast enlargement is now urging the public to help fund a nose job. Josie Cunningham, 23, who is heavily pregnant with her third child, claims people who ‘whinge’ about her nose should ‘put their money where their mouth is’ and buy her a new one. The former escort, from Leeds, has set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

"By . Vanessa Allen . On her television shows, she is often seen launching a late-night fridge raid for dishes she has lovingly prepared earlier. But in reality, Nigella Lawson binged on junk food including Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald's and Domino's pizza, her former aides claimed yesterday. The TV cook is said to have gorged on takeaways after getting the 'munchies' following late-night bonding sessions with her teenage daughter Cosima, known as Mimi. Mood swings: The sisters claim they struggled to cope with Nigella's mood swings - describing her as a 'Duracell bunny' one minute and a 'zombie' the next . Lifting the lid: Sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo have revealed what it was like working for TV chef Nigella Lawson . The revelations followed Miss Lawson's admission in court that she smoked cannabis 'with or in front of' Mimi, who is now 19. The . 53-year-old, whose best-selling cookery books include How to Eat: The . Pleasures and Principles of Good Food, could also devour two giant bars . of chocolate a night, according to her former aides Francesca and . Elisabetta Grillo. The . sisters gave an account of family life inside the £15million  London . townhouse that was wildly at odds with the lifestyle portrayed in Miss . Lawson's popular television programmes. Elisabetta . told The Sun: 'The kids were forever ordering takeaways and cooking . microwave meals and Pot Noodles in their rooms. For Nigella, staying up . late with Mimi was a bonding experience, a special time where the two . girls could talk. Change: Nigella's former assistant Francesca Grillo claims the chef went from being extremely nice to absent and grumpy . 'They . loved takeaways – McDonald's, Domino's pizza, Chinese, KFC, Wagamama . [Japanese noodles], fish and chips. It was surprising how much takeaway . food they ate given her reputation as a fabulous cook using only the . best ingredients.' She . added: 'Nigella was always more of a friend with Mimi than a mother. She was off working when Mimi was young so she saw their chats as a good . chance to get to know her daughter – to reconnect with her. They were . like two college students giggling in the lounge.' Mimi . is Miss Lawson's eldest child from her marriage to journalist John . Diamond, who died of cancer in 2001. During her court evidence, Miss . Lawson said she smoked cannabis in the final year of her marriage to . Charles Saatchi to help cope with an 'intolerable situation' but denied . being a habitual user. The . Grillo sisters, who have worked for her for more than a decade, said . they noticed several changes in her behaviour as her second marriage . collapsed, including mood swings, an obsession with psychics and . appetite changes. Elisabetta, 41, said: 'Nigella never had a sweet tooth before but in the last year she would gorge on treats. 'She . would munch her way through two big chocolate bars a night at one . point. I guess it was comfort eating as the cracks were starting to . show. She was stressed and could never relax or sleep.' Francesca, . 35, said Miss Lawson suffered from insomnia, and took anti-depressants . and Xanax, a prescription tranquilliser used for panic attacks.

"By . Leon Watson . A shocking picture of a toddler being threatened at gunpoint is being used to bolster support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ahead of a planned presidential election in June. The picture, which purports to show Syrian rebels holding the terrified child at gunpoint, was posted online by an alleged member of the Free Syrian Army alongside the caption: 'Our youngest hostage from among the hostile sects of Kessab.' But the authenticity of the picture, apparently taken in a predominantly Christian Armenian village near the Syrian border with Turkey, has not yet been verified with some online critics suggesting it is a propaganda stunt by the government to whip up support for the Assad regime. But if proven legitimate - either as a genuine hostage situation or a horrifying propaganda exercise designed to undermine the rebels - the photo would mark a sickening new low in a bloody and brutal conflict that's already claimed more than 150,000 lives. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: A picture of a young child held at gun point has been posted online - allegedly by a supporter of the Free Syrian Army . Arabic social media has lit up with response to the photograph, with some convinced of the picture's legitimacy while others believe it was merely a stunt designed to undermine support for the rebels. It has already sparked a considerable backlash against Syrian rebel groups on Arabic-language social media. Supporters of President Bashar al-Assad are spreading the photograph in an effort to build support for the current Syrian Government. Gerçek Suriye was one of many Twitter users to share the photo, and described the men in it as 'murderous terrorists'. It comes as Syria prepares to hold a presidential election in the midst of its bloody civil war that critics say will be rigged to return President Bashar al-Assad to office. Underlining the ongoing violence, mortar fire hit near the parliament building shortly before the election was announced, killing two people. Syria's first presidential election - after constitutional amendments did away with the old referendum system - will be held on June 3 amid violence that has killed 150,000 people since March 2011, according to one monitoring group. Speaker Mohammad al-Lahham announced the . date in parliament, saying Syrians living outside the country would vote . May 28 and candidates would be able to register to run from Tuesday . until May 1. The Syrian parliament convening in Damascus. Syria will hold presidential elections that are expected to return President Bashar al-Assad to office on June 3 . Rebel fighters and civilians stand looking at a burning building following a reported barrel bomb attack by Syrian government forces in the northern city of Aleppo . Lahham said voting would be 'free and fair... and under full judicial supervision'. He urged Syrians 'to give voice to their will through the ballot box and participate in the democratic process by electing whoever they think is most able to lead Syria to victory.' Assad, who became president after his father Hafez died in 2000 and whose current term ends on July 17, is widely expected to run and win another seven-year mandate despite the conflict. New election rules require candidates to have lived in Syria for the past decade, effectively preventing key opposition figures in exile from standing for office. The opposition has criticised plans to hold a presidential election and insists Assad should step down and have no role in Syria's future.

A man inspects a site hit by what activists said was a barrel bomb dropped by forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Aleppo . Much of the international community has also warned Syria against holding the vote, with UN-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi saying it could close the door to any peace negotiations. And on Monday Britain dismissed the election, saying that holding it during the war meant the result 'will have no value or credibility'. It remains unclear how Syria's government will organise a vote under the current circumstances, with swathes of the country out of its control and nearly half the population displaced. In three years, more than 150,000 people have been killed and nearly half the country's population have fled their homes .

Syria's conflict began with peaceful protests demanding democratic reform but soon escalated into a civil war after the government launched a massive crackdown on dissent. Violence continues in many parts of the country, even reaching into the heart of the capital, which has regularly come under mortar fire from opposition fighters on the outskirts. A security official said mortar fire in Damascus was expected to increase during the electoral period. 'They (rebels) will increase the fire this month to try to undermine the election,' he said. Syrian president Bashar Assad (left) during his visit to the predominanetly Christian city of Maaloula city, Syria . The U.S. is looking into whether a toxic chemical was deployed on areas of Syria that are controlled by rebel forces seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. State Department Jen Psaki said the chemical was likely chlorine, if it was used. She said officials are still trying to determine what happened in the village of Kafr Zita, but that the U.S. takes allegations about chemicals used in combat very seriously. On Sunday, French President Francois Hollande told Europe 1 radio station that he has 'several elements' suggesting recent use of chemical weapons in Syria, but no definitive proof. Psaki said the U.S. is working with the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to get more details. Syria specialist Fabrice Balanche said the government could only stage the election on 40 percent of the country's territory. 'The election can only be held in the government-held areas, a band of territory stretching from the Jordan border, through Damascus, Hama and Homs,' as well as Idlib city, Jisr al-Shughur, half of Aleppo and half of Deir Ezzor, he told AFP. Opposition member Samir Nashar, who spoke from neighbouring Turkey, described the election as 'a mere continuation of (Syria's) past.' 'For 50 years, from 1963 (when the ruling Baath party came to power) to date, there have been no transparent elections,' Nashar told AFP. 'I don't think that anyone would believe that these elections can really express the will of the Syrian people, considering all this destruction and forced displacement... What elections are we talking about? What about democracy?' An activist in Daraya, near Damascus, described the announcement as a new sign of military escalation in the conflict. 'Things are going towards escalation, and we haven't yet reached the point where either side is exhausted, and where they would genuinely want a political solution,' Amjad Abbar told AFP via the Internet. On the ground, regime forces were on the offensive in the central city of Homs, where the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said clashes were continuing in the districts of Bab Hud and Juret al-Shiyah. Both rebel-held neighbourhoods have been under government siege for nearly two years. In the northern city of Aleppo, meanwhile, activists said regime aircraft dropped explosives-packed barrel bombs on several districts, a day after 52 civilians were killed in air raids across the province of the same name. North of Damascus, a car bomb attack killed two soldiers at a checkpoint in Mashru Dummar neighbourhood.","Child is seen kneeling with their head tilted back, surrounded by guns .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . In 2006, Marcus Lee was offered a job in Dubai, working for one of the country's largest property developers. He and his wife Julie, both accountants from Sydney, decided to take a chance on the offer and made the move to the United Arab Emirates. Three years after they moved, Marcus was arrested for a crime he didn't commit and spent nine months in Dubai prisons, including two months in solitary confinement, and four years under house arrest as he fought to clear his name. Marcus, 45, and Julie, 50, whose ordeal finally came to an end in January when they were able to return to Australia, have written a book about the experience. The book, Trapped, consists largely of Marcus's diary entries from the time of his imprisonment. In the book he tells how the process of writing about his ordeal and the love notes smuggled to him by Julie on her prison visits were his 'lifeline'. Marcus and Julie Lee went through a five year legal ordeal, which resulted in Marcus being imprisoned for nine months . After the couple relocated to Dubai, Marcus says 'Everything was going along happily for a few years' before he was hauled into a police station and questioned about a man he had never met and a payment his company had made to another company. Marcus was able to fire off a text message to his wife, who had returned to Australia for her mother's 80th birthday, telling her to get back to the United Arab Emirates as it looked like the situation was serious. Marcus would spend the next nine months in some of Dubai's most notorious prisons. For six months of this time, Marcus had not been charged with anything. Eventually, Marcus was charged with bribery and attempting to defraud his company Nakheel and Australia's Sunland Group, crimes for which he was eventually acquitted. After receiving his panicked text message, it took Julie two weeks to find out where her husband had been taken. 'Julie got access to me after about two weeks; she had to first locate me. [When she finally found me] we were allowed five minutes in this meeting room, we couldn't really say anything… It was just a state of utter confusion,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'You go to work, you do your job, you're suddenly arrested, and there are these wild accusations. We're both pretty boring accountants thrust into horrific circumstance. We're not elite, we're not high-flyers, we're not connected, we're just accountants,' he said. Julie secretly took a photo from inside one of the prisons Marcus was held in . Left: Marcus and his brother Wayne on the day he was released from prison on bail in October 2009; Right: Marcus and Julie during the period of his house arrest in Dubai . Marcus spent the first two months in solitary confinement, in a cell 1.5 metres by 2.5 metres in size, located in the national security headquarters with the 'terrorists and threats to state'. He was allowed to leave his cell to go to the bathroom, as well as for three phone calls a week and a twenty-minute weekly visit from Julie. After two months, Marcus, who by this point had become very ill as a result of the 'rancid food', stress and 'cold, musty, dirty' conditions, was moved to a police station with 200 other prisoners where he was kept for another two months, before being moved to the central prison in Port Rashid, where he spent the five months before he was finally granted bail. Marcus contracted pneumonia while in Port Rashid, which he thinks may have killed him if Julie had not been able to visit and slip him antibiotics tablets. During the time he was imprisoned and under house arrest, Marcus's father, step-father and grandmother died and he was not able to fly home for the funerals,  which he said was a trauma that 'rippled through the whole family'. Marcus and Julie were allowed to return to the country in January this year . 'The visits and phone calls were the only times, other than using the bathroom, that I was allowed out of my cell. It was so claustrophobic in that tiny space, the walls seemed to get closer the longer I was in there. From time to time I would hear screaming echoing down the corridor. I never knew if it was the anguish of people who were being driven mad by solitary confinement or if they were being beaten or tortured. 'I am guessing that being a white westerner conveyed some level of protection other prisoners like the Indian or Pakistani ones didn't have. The Australian consulate would have raised an outcry if they saw me with bruises. I was never beaten or directly physically threatened, although many guards acted in a menacing, intimidating way. One of their favourite tricks was to bang on cell doors in the middle of the night, making wild accusations or threats. 'They would say things like, 'You've been telling your wife lies about us beating you, haven't you? You've been telling the consulate lies, haven't you? Do you want to be sent to Central Prison with the rapists and murderers? That's what will happen to you.' 'I was so vulnerable by this point that the threat of being thrown to the wolves in prison was completely terrifying, even worse than solitary. I suppose it's a version of the Stockholm syndrome that makes kidnap victims not want to leave their captors. 'They would also threaten to cut off the phone calls and the weekly visits. That sent stabs of fear through me: Julie was my lifeline. One particularly nasty guard had a favourite taunt: I had better tell them everything I knew, he said, because if I stayed in here my wife would leave me. I worried about how Julie was coping but I knew she would stand by me. I told the guard he obviously knew Julie better than me, but the sarcasm went straight over his head.' This is an edited extract from Trapped by Marcus and Julie Lee, published by ABC Books . While in prison Marcus began writing as a form of therapy. 'There's no trauma counselling over there. A friend said ""Just start writing your thoughts down"". One page became, five became 10, 10 became 50.' The journal, which forms the basis for the book written by Marcus and Julie, was smuggled out of the prison by Julie on her visits. Marcus was allowed to write while in jail and was allowed to pass notes to his wife, but he knew that if one of his notes, which detailed the horrors he witnessed in the jail - including violence, rape, and terrible conditions - was intercepted he and Julie could be in a lot of trouble from authorities. Julie began slipping messages to Marcus, writing messages, poems and love letters inside books that she was sometimes allowed to give him. 'On the rare occasion she could get a book in, she'd put a poem in the middle of the book, something to keep me going and remind me that there's something there.' Marcus was eventually released on bail, on the condition he, Julie and an Emirati sponsor, sacrifice their passports and that they pay $300,000. Marcus was kept under house arrest for four-and-a-half years until he was acquitted. Prosecutors appealed the acquittal, but in November 2013 the acquittal was upheld. 'It was a massive relief, but it didn't end there. We'd accumulated so much debt, I couldn't work, and we had to fight to get our bail bond back so we could pay back our debts.' It was not until the plane took off from Dubai Airport for Sydney in January this year that Marcus and Julie really felt their ordeal was over. They returned to the country asset-less, as they were forced to sell their family home in Sydney because they couldn't afford to keep up the repayments and Marcus has not returned to work, saying people treat him with an 'element of suspicion', despite his acquittal, because of his arrest. For Marcus, writing the book is a way of telling his side of the story, which gained considerable publicity in Australia. 'When someone's arrested overseas, there's this immediate thought of Schappelle Corby, it's not always the case… You're trapped in the Middle East, you're a long way from everyone, a lot of wild speculation and spin, you're in a jail, and you can't counter it in any way.' Another purpose for the book is to shine a light on the 'literally thousands' of other prisoners trapped in Dubai prisons who are waiting to be tried, or even charged. 'They're the forgotten ones… They typically come from poorer countries – India, Bangladesh, Pakistan. A lot of them are trapped there, there's a name for them in Arabic, kully wully, the literal translation is ""doesn't matter"", they're trapped in a never-ending cycle.' Marcus feels incredibly lucky he had Julie and his legal team to fight so hard to free him and the couple have moved to the Gold Coast where they are settling back into normal life, with their 14-year-old dog Dudley. 'I pinch myself every day when I realise I don't have to go to court, don't have the threat of incarceration.'","Marcus Lee was locked up for nine months in Dubai prisons and placed under house arrest for four years .

"By . Emily Crane For Daily Mail Australia . A fish handler's cured hand warts has lead researchers to look at Tasmanian sea snails as a potential cure for common cold sores and the related herpes virus. The blue blood of abalone, an edible sea snail found in pristine bays along Tasmania's coast, contains anti-viral properties that researchers have shown block the herpes virus' entry into cells.

The blue blood of abalone, an edible sea snail found in pristine bays along Tasmania's coast, contains anti-viral properties that researchers have shown block the herpes virus's entry into cells . Adrian Cuthbertson from Marine Biotechnologies Australia said 10 years ago when the company was involved in abalone serum trials relating to cancer treatments, patients who drank processed forms of abalone blood reported fewer cases of cold sore breakouts. 'Around the same time we had an employee responsible for loading and unloading abalone shells containers,' he said. 'After a month of working with the shellfish he found that the viral warts which had plagued his hands for years disappeared. Researchers Negar Talaei Zanjani and Dr Peter Valtchev from the University of Sydney are among those working with the herpes virus cell and blue blood of abalone . The abalone's healing properties were uncovered completely by accident, researchers say . 'This convinced me that abalone had to be investigated for its anti-viral properties.' Mr Cuthbertson said he then started working with chemical engineers at the University of Sydney and virus researchers at the Westmead Millennium Institute on the breakthrough research. The research has shown the same protein that gives the abalone blood its blue colour also has anti-viral properties.

Professor Tony Cunningham, from Westmead Millennium Institutes, said while current treatment can shorten the disease, it cannot kill the virus.

"By . Emma Glanfield . The teenage sons of a former French president and his successor’s mistress have been at war with each other on Twitter – exchanging insults over everything from their parents to the World Cup. Louis Sarkozy, the 16-year-old son of former President Nicolas, even challenged Leonard Triérweiler, the 15-year-old son of ex-First Lady Valérie, to a fight after the name-calling escalated. The spat has left much of France transfixed, with several Twitter users and media commentators calling for the boys’ parents to intervene. Louis Sarkozy (right), the 16-year-old son of former President Nicolas, even challenged Leonard Triérweiler (left), the 15-year-old son of ex-First Lady Valérie, to a fight after the name-calling on Twitter escalated . The teenagers started exchanging insulting tweets earlier this month and continued this week after it was revealed Valérie Triérweiler - the former live-in girlfriend of French president Francois Hollande - cost taxpayers at least half-a-million pounds last year. The money was spent mostly on security, with Ms Triérweiler at the time using four bodyguards, five personal aides, and regularly using state planes and official homes. After Sarkozy posted a picture on his Twitter page to a news article of the report, the ex-first Lady's son responded with: ‘But this is not my mother who had a credit card of the Elysee for his personal expenses...' To which Sarkozy retaliated: ‘Mine either.’ Sarkozy sent one tweet to Triérweiler after it emerged his mother - the former live-in girlfriend of French president Francois Hollande - had cost taxpayers at least half-a-million pounds last year . Sarkozy responded to the taunt with: 'Mine either!' Sarkozy, who attends a US military school, touted the idea of a fight after it was suggested by another user . The spat continued when Sarkozy junior appeared to support the idea of settling the fall-out with a fight - after it was suggested by another Twitter user who had apparently been following the quarrel. The teenager, who attends a military school in the US, said: ‘Whenever you want! We soldiers learn how to fight.’ Several French media commentators have shared their opinion on the matter, and today the website of news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur appeared to criticise the social media spat. ‘Neither Louis Sarkozy nor Leonard Triérweiler have any right to get involved in such complex political questions’, it said.","Louis Sarkozy, 16 - the son of former President Nicolas - is embroiled in spat .

"By . Jane Shilling For The Daily Mail . After our glorious, golden summer, the long days and warm nights are giving way to autumn. The mornings are crisper, the evenings cool. But the melancholy of the fading year is mixed with excitement, for late summer is the most beautiful — and generous — of all seasons. A mild, wet winter and hot summer have made for a bountiful August. There are bumper crops of blackberries, currants, pears and apples across the countryside. Sloe berries are not usually ready for picking until later in the year, but the fine summer and ample rainfall of the past few weeks has encouraged the berries to ripen early. They are often used in gin, jelly and puddings . In my home patch of the Ashford valley in East Kent, partridge and pigeon feast on fallen grains in the fields. On the shady edges of the fields where horses and cattle graze, mushrooms gleam like fat pearls. Hedges are swagged with blackberries, and poisonous woody nightshade winds around the hazel bushes where the nuts are starting to drop from their husks. But most spectacular of all the wild harvest this summer are the black marbles of the sloe. They are not usually ready for picking until later in the year, but the fine summer and ample rainfall of the past few weeks has encouraged the berries to ripen early. Sloes are a capricious fruit. Some years the yield is so sparse as to be scarcely worth picking. Even in a good season I wouldn’t expect to gather them until September. But last weekend the hedges were already heavy with cloudy, deep-blue berries. The smaller, sourer sisters of damson plums, sloes are the most feral of hedgerow fruit. They are mouth-puckeringly bitter. Foraging cooks suggest apple-and-sloe jelly, steamed sloe pudding, or even preserving them in brine like the Japanese do with plums. But really the best way to treat a sloe is to pierce it with a needle and drown it in gin. After weeks of steeping in the cellar, the black sloe will give you a dark, autumnal cordial with an almondy, faintly medicinal essence. There is nothing better for keeping out the midwinter chill. The Latin name for the sloe is Prunus spinosa, or spiny plum. Anyone who has had their hands and arms shredded while trying to gather sloes will know that it is spikily apt. The thorny black branches give the sloe its alternative name of blackthorn. Its trees are beautiful in March when their starry white flowers are among nature’s earliest harbingers of spring. While the sloe’s more palatable cousin, the cherry plum, was probably brought to Britain by the Romans, and gradually hybridised to produce Prunus domestica, the sweet European plum, the sloe has remained stubbornly undomesticated. It is still valued by some farmers as an ideal animal-proof hedge. Our frugal ancestors could find uses for most kinds of wild harvest, but Mrs Beeton’s compendious 19th-century Book of Household Management has nothing to say about sloes. By 1932, however, Florence White, founder of the English Folk Cookery Association, had included a recipe for ‘Aunt Lucy’s Home-made Sloe Wine’ in her cookbook, Good Things In England. I’m not sure that I’d like the wine — an acid-sounding fermented confection of sloes, lemon, sugar and water. But the sloe gin in The Constance Spry Cookery Book (1958) is another matter. The dark sloe berries are often used in certain types of gin and in sloe gin sling cocktails (pictured) Mrs Spry was a society florist who did the flowers for the wedding of the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson and ran a select cordon bleu cookery and flower-arranging school. If a recipe appeared in her compendious tome it was a sure sign of social acceptance. Spry’s recipe for sloe gin isn’t complicated: the only variation to the basic method of combining one-and-a-half pints of pricked sloes with ¾lb sugar-candy and a quart of gin is the addition of a few bitter almonds. Tantalisingly, she suggests that ‘the sloes may afterwards be used for flavouring purposes’, but doesn’t say how. Here the indefatigable Clarissa Dixon Wright (of Two Fat Ladies fame) comes to the rescue. Clarissa, who died earlier this year, assumed that you’d always have a few gin-soaked sloes handy. In her excellent Game Cookbook (2004) she wrote: ‘In all my years of drinking I sadly threw away the sloes from yet another finished bottle of sloe gin.’ Having sobered up, she discovered you can use the gin-soaked berries to flavour a casserole of wild duck and vegetables. I’ve tried her method with domestic duck and it is very good. It is hard not to love a recipe that ends with the advice to ‘add more gin if the sauce is too thick’. In Devon, they add the ginny sloes to cider, making a beverage aptly known as ‘slider’. And some people dip the sloes in chocolate to make little alcoholic sweeties. I first made sloe gin ten years ago. My son still recalls the shaming occasion when the chap behind us in the supermarket queue peered into my trolley, which had four litres of Sainsbury’s own-brand gin, a lemon and a packet of cat food, and remarked: ‘Planning a big weekend, are we?’ I usually follow the Constance Spry recipe, substituting preserving sugar (without extra pectin) for loaf sugar, and instead of bitter almonds I use strips of lemon peel, a few cloves, a stick of cinnamon and some star anise. Now, traditionally, you shouldn’t gather the sloes before the first frost, but if you can’t resist picking them now, a short spell in the freezer seems to work just as well. The real secret of good sloe gin is to keep the stuff for as long as you can. I keep each batch in a dark cupboard for a year, shaking the jar whenever I remember, before I drink it. The resulting brew has an aromatic sweetness nothing like the sticky purple substance commercially marketed as sloe gin. Some like to use it in cocktails, with such confections as the Moll Flanders (gin, sloe gin, dry vermouth, Angostura bitters), the Sloe Comfortable Screw (sloe gin, Southern Comfort, vodka, orange juice) and the dire- sounding Hopeless Case (sloe gin, peppermint schnapps, cola). But I think it is best drunk neat, out of doors and near its roots, perhaps in the lee of a muddy Land Rover while sheltering from the howling wind and driving sleet of a freezing point-to-point meet. Or later in the season when the pale sunshine hints at the coming of spring, and the white flowers of the blackthorn herald the next crop of bitter fruit.","Autumn is usual season for sloe berries but they've come early this year .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Burnley boss Sean Dyche hopes the experience of earning promotion against the odds can stand his players in good stead for the tests to come in the Premier League. The Clarets have no chance to ease themselves into the top flight with likely title challengers Chelsea the first visitors to Turf Moor on Monday evening. Much has been made of the considerable differences between the two clubs, but Dyche expects his players to meet the challenge head on. Looking back to the 2-0 win over Wigan in April that clinched promotion for Burnley, the manager said: 'There were some big games last year, people forget that. Prepared: Sean Dyche said big games during their promotion have prepared them for the Premier League . 'We played Wigan and delivered a fantastic performance, and that's probably the biggest game these players have played in a long time, because that one clinches what you're trying to do, and that means a lot to the club, a lot financially, a lot to the area, and of course the kudos of getting promoted. 'It's fair to say the first one against Chelsea, massive club, coming to Turf Moor under the lights with the TV cameras, that's a big game in itself. 'So it's how the players respond. We work hard on the training pitch to allow them the chance to deliver when that moment comes.' Dyche knows they must make the most of Turf Moor to give themselves the best possible chance of survival. Celebration: Dyche and his Burnley players after their match against Wigan which got them promoted . In their only previous season in the Premier League, in 2009/10, Burnley picked up 26 points at home, but only four away and were relegated. 'I got the feeling last season that there was a true belief with the fans and the player connection,' said Dyche. 'I think they really felt they had a group who were totally motivated towards the shirt and the club and the cause. They've come to really understand that and the positivity around that. 'They certainly will know we need that because the task has gone up again. We want the fans to stay with us of course and they did do last season, even when we had a couple of testing times at home. 'We'd go a goal down and there was a calmness to the stadium, a belief that the group would keep going. Opener: Sean Dyche's first Premier League game will be against Jose Mourinho's Chelsea . 'We're renowned for that, we are relentless in the way that we work and the way we approach games and deliver. We're looking to make sure that's still intact.' If Chelsea fans expect to ease to three points on Monday, they would do well to remember the fate that befell Manchester United in August 2009. The Red Devils were the first team to visit Turf Moor that season and were beaten 1-0, Robbie Blake scoring the only goal, while Brian Jensen saved a penalty. Dyche has clearly heard the story many times since joining the club in 2012, but is not about to promise a repeat. Friendlies: Burnley have only lost one of their pre-season games over the summer . 'We can't guarantee that,' he said. 'The size of some of the clubs we're coming across, some of the players, no guarantees from us. 'But what we are looking to guarantee is that we're ready, we're able, we're certainly mentally and physically motivated to go and deliver performances. Where that takes us we'll only know once the season gets off and running. 'There's always confidence because you believe in how you work, your staff work and your players work. That's what coaching and management is about. 'But you can only get to that point when you're ready. When that whistle blows, it really is down to players and how they perform. That's the magic moment. 'We're obviously looking to show we can at least be competitive, give good performances and see where that takes us.'","Sean Dyche says promotion experience will help in big games this season .
