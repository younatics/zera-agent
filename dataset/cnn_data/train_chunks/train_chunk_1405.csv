"A team of vets spent five hours shaving off two kilograms of matted, petrol-coated fur from the coat of a neglected dog whose owner dumped him at a rescue centre having never had him groomed. Bentley, a white Shih Tzu, was so timid when first taken into vets' care he flinched whenever a human tried to touch him. He was dropped off at a dog rescue centre in Meltham, West Yorkshire, by an owner who 'couldn't bear to touch him,' volunteer Kathy Trout said. Bentley the Shih Tzu arrived at a dog rescue centre in Meltham, West Yorkshire, with fur so matted vets spent five hours shaving two kilograms of it off . Bentley's condition was so dire when he arrived at the centre, owner Kathy Trout was reduced to tears . After shaving off his matted hair, Bentley had to be sedated for vets to put a jacket over his tiny body. Now the three-year-old dog won't allow it to be removed. When he first arrived at the centre, Mrs Trout was reduced to tears by his condition. His coat was so covered in petrol, she said, a drink of water may have poisoned him if any fur had got in his mouth. 'He came into our rescue from a member of the public. 'His fur was very, very long and matted like felt and all his legs were like tree trunks with chemical smelling fur. 'It looked like he was thick with oil, fuel or petrol. He really, really stank.' His owner, who arrived in a 'shiny 4x4' could not even bear to pick him up, she added. Vets had to sedate the dog to be able to shave off the mass of smelly, petrol-coated fur he arrived with . When Bentley arrived at the centre, his previous owner could not touch him, said Mrs Trout. Petrol and oil that was staining his coat meant the dog, who had never been groomed, gave off a strong stench . After spending time recovering at the centre, Bentley has overcome his fear of interaction with humans, and plays happily with the other dogs in its care . The dog will not allow any carers to remove a fleece jacket he now wears but is prone to giving kisses . 'She handed him over on a lead because she wouldn't even touch him. It is clear he has never been groomed. 'Leaving him in this state is a prosecutable offence but I’m not interested in going to the police - all I want to do is make sure Bentley recovers,' Mrs Trout added. The dog was so timid when he first arrived he became aggressive when humans tried to touch him. Vets were able to sedate him to shave off the matted fur before helping him overcome his fear of contact. 'Now if I gently put my hand out, he will come to me and lick my face. It’s wonderful to see him so happy again. 'He’s running around with the other dogs and enjoying his food again - he’s put weight back on, too. 'Now he can’t stop drinking water - he goes to town on it because before his fur polluted the water when he tried to drink. 'He is still terrified if I move too close to him I have to wait for him to come to me. We put his little coat on while he was still under sedation and it hasn't been off since - it’s a strong velcro so I know he will flip if I try.' The centre will be trying to find a new home for the dog once he has fully recovered from the trauma. 'Nothing prepares you for the heartache of taking in an abandoned and abused dogs,' added Mrs Trout, a former IT manager. 'Cases like this keep me awake at night and in tears - we are not trained to handle the emotional strain of taking in rescue dogs. 'You don’t have to love dogs - just respect them.' Kathy Trout said caring for abandoned and abused dogs was a difficult job for which nothing can prepare you .","Bentley the Shih Tzu could not be touched when first brought to vets .

"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker jumped to the top of the Republican presidential primary field in early primary states, a set of surveys show. Dark horse candidate no more, 47-year-old Walker, now in his second term as Wisconsin's head of state, is polling in the double digits in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - the first three states scheduled to hold contests next year. Likewise, Walker and several other likely GOP competitors have closed the gap with race frontrunner, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Dark horse candidate no more, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is polling in the double digits in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - the first three states scheduled to hold contests next year . Walker is represented consistently by the blue bar in the graph above. Likewise, race frontrunner Jeb Bush is represented by the green bar, while various other candidates - Mike Huckabee, Rand Pau and Lindsey Graham -  are tied to the red bar . Bush, 62, is the only Republican aside from South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham who has verbally committed to exploring a presidential bid. As such, his political action has been the beneficiary of a steady stream of large dollar donations. But a series of missteps, including the accidental release last week of former constituents' private information such as Social Security numbers along with the planned release of a trove of the former executives communications, generated unfavorable headlines for the moderate Republican. In Iowa, ex-Arkansas Gov. and Fox News personality Mike Huckabee, now leads with 17 percent of registered Republicans' support, according to an NBC News/Marist survey taken there this month. Still hot on Huckabee's heels is Bush at 16 percent, Walker now commands 15 percent of Iowans' support. No other GOP politicians tested made it to the 10 percent watermark. In the Northeast, Bush continues to maintain a three-point lead over his next closest competitor, Walker, winning 18 percent of the potential Republican electorate in New Hampshire to the Wisconsin politicians' 15 percent. Just behind were Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, 14 percent, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, 13 percent, the NBC News poll, released Sunday, revealed. South Carolina Republicans are sticking by their favorite son, Graham, a veteran lawmaker and war hawk. The 59-year-old Senator claimed 17 percent of Republican voters' support in his state to Bush's 15 percent and Walker's 12 percent. Huckabee and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, endeared to conservatives after a National Prayer Breakfast speech he gave in 2013, both nosed in at 10 percent. Jeb Bush is no longer the clear frontrunner in the GOP's 2016 presidential contest. Walker is hot on his heels in every early primary states, and in Iowa, he is now lead by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee . Democrats continue to flock to former First Lady Hillary Clinton in every early state. The former New York lawmaker has polled in the mid to high 60s in across the board in the NBC News/Marist polls. Vying for second place were Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden. Biden was the favorite in Iowa, attracting 12 percent of the state's Democratic voters to Sanders' seven percent, and the former Sen. from Delaware trounced in Sanders in South Carolina. The he earned 20 percent of Democrats' support while Sanders came in at just three percent in the NBC survey. But in New Hampshire, it is Sanders who currently has the upper hand in the context, polling at 13 percent. That's still 56 percent below Clinton in that state however. Her strongest showing among the three surveys, she has 69 percent of Democrats's support in The Granite State.","Waker, 47, is now polling in the double digits in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina - the first three states scheduled to hold contests next year .

"Tremors, excessive salivation and difficulty breathing are all signs you may have been bitten by a Brazilian Wandering Spider. In a number of cases, the venom of these arachnids can cause another unexpected symptom; intensely painful erections that last for hours at a time. Now scientists from around the world are hoping to harvest PnTx2-6, the active ingredient in the spider's venom, to create a natural Viagra that can work in 20 minutes. Tremors, excessive salivation and difficulty breathing are all signs you may have been bitten by a Brazilian Wandering Spider (pictured). In a number of cases, the venom of these arachnids can cause another unexpected symptom; intensely painful erections that last for hours at a time . Brazilian Wandering Spiders can cause priapism - a condition which occurs when blood becomes trapped in the penis, leading to abnormally long-lasting erections. To discover exactly how PnTx2-6 does this, Gwen Pearson from Wired reported that researchers cut off the penis of a dead mouse, and connected it to an electrical stimulator. Scientists from the University of Wisconsin were then able to measure the contraction of the muscles in tissue when they came into contact with different chemicals. They discovered that not only does the venom work, but it also has fewer side effects compared with existing erectile dysfunction drugs, such as Viagra. Although drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years, around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement.  A drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative. Stock pictured used . Never mind those little blue pills – men who have problems between the sheets could reinvigorate themselves simply by eating a Mediterranean diet. Eating fish, salads and olive oil, and enjoying the odd glass of wine, could transform the lives of men suffering from impotence, according to Greek cardiologist Athanasios Angelis. He said his research had shown that consuming such healthy foods helped clean out blood vessels, especially the narrow ones in the penis that are essential for a man to perform. Dr Angelis, an expert on erectile dysfunction at Hippokration Hospital in Athens, said: ‘The Mediterranean diet is well known to be a healthy diet, one that is associated with longevity, wellbeing, lower incidence of cancer and cardiovascular disease. ‘And this is very important, because people can choose this type of diet to prevent or restore their vascular health.’ He explained that when a man had problems achieving an erection, ‘it can be a sign of worse health problems to come’, because the blood vessels in the penis were ‘very, very sensitive’ to what was happening in the rest of the body. ‘Adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle can help reverse moderate erectile dysfunction,’ Dr Angelis said. Back in 2011, when the research took place, Dr Kenia Nunes, a physiologist at the college, said: 'The venom of the Phoneutria nigriventer spider is a very rich mixture of several molecules. 'These molecules are called toxins, and then we have various toxins in this venom with different activity. 'Because of this, when a human is bitten by this spider, we can observe many different symptoms including priapism, a condition in which the penis is continually erect.' Separate tests carried out on rats show the venom boosts performance by increasing the release of nitric oxide, a chemical that dilates blood vessels and improves blood flow. Since then, researchers have also successfully recreated the PnTx2-6 gene and infected a culture of caterpillar cells which produced the spider toxin. This artificial venom proved effective on rats. Ms Pearson reports that now scientists can create more of the venom, trials to determine the toxicity of the drug in humans may take place – although a product is likely to be years away. Although drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years, around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement. For these men, the only other options are to inject drugs straight into the penis, or use a pump that manually increases blood supply to the organ. Neither is very popular. A drug made from spider venom could prove to be an effective alternative. Scientists from the University of Wisconsin found that not only does the venom work, but also has fewer side effects than existing erectile dysfunction drugs, such as Viagra .","Venom of the Brazilian Wandering Spider contains ingredient PnTx2-6 .

LOVED the crop top!' one person wrote, while another added: 'I love your look. Beautiful. You knocked it out of the park.' The new mother, who celebrated daughter Vale's six-month milestone live on air on last Friday's episode of the Today show, accessorized her daring ensemble with a pair of simple black and nude pointed-toe heels, a silver charm necklace and a number of gold rings - as well as adding some extra sparkle courtesy of her beautiful engagement ring. It appeared as though Savannah was also debuting a darker hairstyle; while we are used to seeing her modeling a full head of blonde highlights, Sunday night's red carpet saw her showcasing a more natural, dark brunette shade, with just a few subtle streaks of blonde. And when it came to her make-up look for the evening, Savannah also chose to go for a darker look, opting for a bold smokey eye, complete with some seriously lengthy lashes. Clearly thrilled to be a part of such a historical show, which was celebrating the 40 years that Saturday Night Live has been on the air, as well as paying tribute to its most memorable cast members, Savannah herself took to Twitter to share her excitement at the evening's events.

"Labour's shadow business secretary said British workers needed to be as productive as the French . Britain's economy needs to become more like France because its workers are 'more productive', shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said. The rising Labour star said British workers took five days to what the French did in four. Mr Umunna's remarks come just days after a leading investment bank warned that the British economy under Labour would 'look increasingly like France', where growth is almost non-existent . But, Mr Umunna told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: 'The issue isn't just that we have more employment but the nature of the work. 'Too much of our work is low paid, it isn't secure, we don't have high skilled jobs. We have got to deal with the productivity problem in this country. 'It takes on average a British worker to Friday to do what equivalent workers in Germany and France will complete by the end of Thursday afternoon. 'The way we deal with that is ensuring people have more skills. They are actually more productive than us. 'People can say what they want about France but ultimately coming back to the UK we have got to be more productive.' Mr Umunna was speaking this morning ahead of a major speech on Labour's plans for the economy by Ed Miliband. A spokesman for the Labour shadow minister insisted he was not suggesting Britain should copy the French economic model. He said: 'Chuka was simply making the observation that despite our many strengths, compared with other major European economies Britain lags behind our competitors on productivity. 'That’s why today Labour is launching its better plan for prosperity to boost the number of better-paid, high skilled jobs.' But Mr Umunna's remarks come just days after the Bank of America  suggested that Labour's economic plans could lead to lower growth and seriously damage investor confidence in the UK. In a devastating assessment, it said: 'A Left-wing coalition around Labour, would, in our view, continue to deliver on fiscal austerity, albeit a milder version than the Tories, with the accompanying cyclical headwind that this entails, while embarking on structural changes which could in the medium run reduce the appeal of the UK as a business location and trigger, ultimately, a deterioration in potential GDP growth.' It added: 'In a nutshell, the UK would look increasingly like France.' The warning is acutely embarrassing for Mr Miliband, who cosied up to France's socialist President Francois Hollande after his 2012 victory. At the time, Mr Miliband said the two men were 'in agreement' on the economy, and suggested he was looking to replicate the French anti-austerity programme. Mr Hollande's policies, including a 75 per cent top tax rate, have proved a disaster. French president Francois Hollande has seen his popularity plummet as the economy has stalled . Economic growth in the final quarter was 0.1 per cent in France, compared with 0.5 per cent in the UK. Unemployment is 9.9 per cent – way above the 5.8 per cent in the UK. The BAML report warned that Mr Miliband is likely to 'seriously interfere with the private sector', adding that, with the public finances still in a mess, Labour may revert to bashing business in order to fund its pledges. 'If a centre-Left government cannot tackle inequality through social transfers, it will be tempted to focus on fighting 'primary inequality', for instance by imposing a massive increase in the minimum wage,' said the report. 'In our estimates, Labour's pledge to bring this to £8 per hour would put the UK at the level where France is, in terms of distance from the median wage. 'Re-regulation of working contracts and working time would also be likely. The 'energy price freeze' – mooted by Labour last year – and the proposals to introduce a market share cap in the banking sector are other examples of interference with the private sector.' Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said the report underlined the threat posed by Labour. 'Labour have no plan for the economy, other than more spending, more borrowing and more taxes,' he said. 'The choice is clear – between a competent Conservative government working through its long-term economic plan and the chaos of Labour with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.'","Chuka Umunna said French workers were more productive than in the UK .

"A rich burgundy or crisp chardonnay may be your tipple of choice. But a handful of 1,500-year-old charred grape seeds could help scientists recreate one of the finest ancient wines. It is the first time that seeds have been found, offering hope that the taste of 'Gaza wine' could finally be revealed. A handful of charred grape seeds (pictured) could help scientists recreate one of the finest ancient wines, called the 'wine of the Negev,' which according to historical sources, was one the the finest and most delicious produced around 1,500 years ago in the Byzantine empire . The seeds come from grapes that were used to produce the wine - also known as 'wine of the Negev' - which according to historical accounts, was one of the finest and most renowned wines in the empire that stretched from Spain to Greece. They were found at the Halutza excavation site in the Negev – a semi desert region of southern Israel - during a joint dig by the University of Haifa and the Israel Antiquities Authority. ‘The vines growing in the Negev today are European varieties, whereas the Negev vine was lost to the world,’ said director of the excavation, Professor Guy Bar-Oz of the University of Hafia. ‘Our next job is to recreate the ancient wine, and perhaps in that way we will be able to reproduce its taste and understand what made the Negev wine so fine.’ The seeds were found at the Halutza excavation site in the Negev – a semi desert region of southern Israel - during a joint dig by the University of Haifa and the Israel Antiquities Authority. The city of Halutza is mapped . Earlier excavations of the site have  unearthed the terraces where the vines were cultivated, the wineries where wine was produced, and the jugs in which the wine was stored and exported – but until now, no grape seeds were recovered. This Byzantine mosaic shows a man with an amphora for wine . The seeds are thought to be 1,500 years old. They were found in an ancient rubbish dump in the city of Halutza, Israel. The seeds come from grapes used to produce the 'wine of the Negev'. Experts hope they could be used to recreate the 'Gaza wine,' which was one of finest made in the Byzantine Empire. It was expensive and considered to be of very high quality, but because none has survived, wine experts are unsure what made it taste so good. Negev wine was lost to the world and the vines may have been a native species, which are now extinct. There is a chance that they could equally have been sourced from France or Italy, like the modern vines in the Negev region today. Researchers will now join forces with biologists to sequence the DNA of the seeds to discover their origin. Understanding more about the seeds, may also show how the grape variety was suited to such arid conditions - and this may even be used to unlock the secret of growing grapes with less water today. Byzantine sources tell of Gaza wine which was named after the port from which it was shipped to all corners of the empire. It was expensive and considered to be of very high quality, but because none has survived, wine experts are unsure what made it taste so good. Excavations of the site have previously unearthed the terraces where the vines were cultivated, the wineries where wine was produced, and the jugs in which the wine was stored and exported – but until now, no grape seeds were recovered. They were discovered in one of the ancient city’s rubbish dumps, or middens, which were preserved almost completely intact and now mark its borders, Professor Bar-Oz said. Archaeologists know from findings of pottery and coins that the tips were used when the city was at the height of its economic success. Halutza collapsed in the mid-seventh century for reasons unknown to historians and it seems the city and its rubbish dumps, were swiftly abandoned. Pottery vessels used for storage, cooking and serving were discovered in a particularly high concentration in one midden, including Gaza jugs used to hold Negev wine. The grape seeds were found along with other biological remains, such as the bones of imported Red Sea fish and shellfish from the Mediterranean, indicating the vast wealth of the Byzantine city’s residents. Archaeologists carefully sifted through the remains and used a technique so that soil sunk to the bottom of a container full of water and the remains floated to the top. Professor Bar-Oz said: ‘Maybe the secret to the Negev wine’s international prestige lay in the method by which the vines were cultivated in the Negev’s arid conditions.' A stock picture of the  view over the desert is shown . ‘After washing the dirt and gently sifting the findings all that remained was to separate the botanical findings, which included seeds, pits and plants remains, from small animal bones, which included the remains of rodents that were drawn to the refuse,’ Professor Bar-Oz said. Experts are unsure whether the vines from which the famous wine was produced throughout the Byzantine Empire, were imported from elsewhere. There is a chance that they may have been sourced from France or Italy, like the modern vines in the region today, or that they were native varieties that have now been lost. The researchers will now join forces with biologists to sequence the DNA of the seeds to discover their origin.

There is a chance that they may have been sourced from France or Italy, like the modern vines in the region today. A stock image of a vineyard in Tuscany, Italy, is shown . By doing this, connoisseurs could recreate the ancient wine and unlock the secret of why it was so highly throughout the Byzantine Empire — in Egypt, Greece, Italy, and Spain. Professor Bar-Oz added: ‘European varieties require copious amounts of water. Today it is less of a problem thanks to technology, but it is unlikely that that was the case 1,500 years ago. ‘It is more interesting to think of local grape varieties that were better suited to the Negev. ‘Maybe the secret to the Negev wine’s international prestige lay in the method by which the vines were cultivated in the Negev’s arid conditions.’","Grape seeds were found in an ancient rubbish dump in Hatutza, Israel .

"A 22-year-old man was found dead on Sunday after he lost control of his Porsche and plummeted several hundred feet to the bottom of a canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains. The man, who has not been named, was speeding westbound on Piuma Road, in Malibu, California when he crossed into the eastbound lane and careened down a steep embankment. According to the California Highway Patrol, the man was driving a 1998 Porsche and it was 11 a.m. when he lost control of the high performance car.

"A grand jury in North Carolina indicted a man Monday on three counts of murder in the shootings of three young Muslims in what authorities have said was a dispute over parking spaces. Television stations WRAL and WTVD reported a grand jury in Durham County handed up the indictments Monday for 46-year-old Craig Hicks. No one answered a phone call from The Associated Press at the courthouse, which closed midday for an impending ice and snowstorm. Indicted: Craig Hicks, 46 (pictured), was indicted on three counts of murder on Monday in the shooting deaths of three Muslims in North Carolina . Gunned down: (From left) Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23, his wife Yusor Mohammad, 21, and her sister Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were all shot dead near the University of North Carolina last Tuesday . Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21; and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were all found dead in their Chapel Hill condominium last week. Hicks was their neighbor, and others who lived nearby said he had frequent problems with where people parked in the complex near the University of North Carolina. Police in Chapel Hill have said they have not uncovered any evidence Hicks acted out of hatred for his neighbor's faith, but their investigation continues. The FBI is also investigating. Hicks, 46, is scheduled to be in court on the murder charges March 4. Too soon: People posted pictures of the couple, newly married, on Twitter just hours after they were both murdered. The couple are thought to have only been married a month when they were shot dead . Hicks described himself online as a 'gun toting' atheist. Search warrants listed a dozen firearms taken from his home, including four handguns, two shotguns and six rifles — as well as a large amount of ammunition. He was carrying a pistol when he turned himself in several hours after the Feb. 10 shooting. Family members of the victims have said they were executed with shots to the back of the head. Police have not discussed specifics on how they were killed. Hicks remains in jail without bond. His court-appointed lawyer, Stephen Freedman, has said he could not comment on the case.","Craig Hicks, 46, accused of shooting three young Muslims in argument over parking spaces .

Her decision to work with Barnardos was always for good intentions. She was offered this fee to front a campaign. However her intention has always been to give the entire fee back to charity in some way'. Initially the reality TV star had said she planned to donate some of her fee to a cancer charity but has now changed her mind. However, both Barnado's  - which supports vulnerable children - and Binky denied reports in The Sun that she had been paid £20,000. Taking to her official Twitter page, Binky dismissed the claim as 'total lies', while the Barnardo's Twitter page said: 'Our retail trading arm operates in commercial environment & is paying £3k for campaign.' Barnardo's added in a statement that it had taken a 'business decision to acquire the support' of Binky. A charity spokesman said: 'Barnardo's retail shops are part of the charity's trading arm and as such operate in a commercial environment. 'We are soon to launch a new campaign to encourage much-needed donations to our shops. 'We took a business decision to acquire the support of Alexandra Felstead to bring the appeal to a new and wider audience. We expect the campaign to increase donations significantly and will be monitoring its impact on our sales. 'Barnardo's does not usually pay celebrities who support our work with the most vulnerable children across the UK.' Barnardo's, which earned an income of about £242million last year, confirmed on Twitter it had paid in the region of £3,000 for the Made In Chelsea star's support but denied other reports that the figure was £20,000 . Binky, a 24-year-old fashion and beauty blogger, rose to fame after appearing on E4's Made In Chelsea . The move sparked outrage from some charity fundraisers, with campaigning Tory MP Charlie Elphicke describing it as an 'insult to volunteers who toil to raise cash for needy children'. One source, reportedly a friend of Binky's, told The Sun: 'To take money from a charity to help it is morally repulsive. The fact Barnardo's is paying her in the first place is even worse. 'If I give fifty quid to help abused kids I want it to be used for that purpose – not redistributed by a celebrity to a different charity.' The fashion and beauty blogger, rose to fame after appearing on E4's Made In Chelsea, alongside the likes of Spencer Matthews, Louise Thompson, Lucy Watson, Oliver Proudlock and Jamie Laing. Binky is not the first celebrity to be paid to promote a charity. Downton Abbey star  Elizabeth McGovern - who plays Cora, Countess of Grantham - was paid £28,000 by World Vision in 2013 for her band Sadie and the Hotheads to record an album and tour the UK in return for promoting the charity. She said at the time without the cash her band would 'never survive'.

"As maces crash into shields and battle axes cut into armor, knights are left wounded and bloodied on the battlefield. But while this scene appears reminiscent of a Medieval clash, these fights are happening in the U.S. with the launch of a new extreme sport in the form of a medieval fight club. The Armored Combat League of America (ACL) sees knights from different states  face each other in battle, armed with maces and swords. Scroll down for video . The Armored Combat League of America has launched its own Medieval fight club, where people dress as knights in full armor and equip themselves with maces and swords to do battle with rivals across the US . The knights are required to use 'real weapons, full force' as they face each other in battles across the US . And they don't hold back from actual battle or injury. Founding member Jay Brooks said: 'It is as rough as human beings can be with one another without one of them dying.' The ACL currently has around 100 people doing battle across America and was launched to give people enthusiastic about the medieval era the chance to relive it. Mr Brooks added: 'It just feels completely natural to us. This is what our ancestors did in the 14th and 15th centuries. 'It's a medieval fight club but we do want people to talk about it. 'I can't think of any other sport that is more intense. We are using real weapons, full force, full speed. 'I'm hitting a guy with a battleaxe in the back and other guys are getting hit in the head with a mace.' Knights from rival factions based in different states meet each other in often fierce armed combat . Those taking part are often left battered and bruised after facing each other, often with their wives looking on . Organisers said the club allows them to be as rough as possible for human beings without killing eachother . There are around 100 knights in America but the group hopes that will expand so more people can take part . Mr Brooks who is a full time knight and combat trainer said another reason for launching the club was the code of honor that fighters of the medieval era followed. He added: 'I try to live by the values of a knight. I try to adhere to the virtues of chivalry and justice and honour and truth. 'In this day and age a lot of people don't believe in an awful lot. 'The knights who lived in a very violent time had a code that they had to adhere to - if people held themselves to stronger codes today we'd all get along a lot better in this world.' Battles are held with rival factions - with the New York Sentinels recently taking on the Boston Dark Knights. The club has brought a medieval fight club to New York, with knights taking the subway as they go to training . Despite the cost of armor and weapons for the battles, there are already more than 100 members of the club . The Knights of New York decided to practice their battle skills in Time Square in preparation for combat . In preparation for the tournament - two of the Knights of New York, Zorikh Lequidre, 47, and Sam Awry, 35, took to the streets to practice. Mr Awry,a medieval history student, said: 'I don't think two medieval knights training for battle is the strangest thing people would see in public in New York City.' Enthusiasm for the sport is growing in America - despite the high costs of taking part. A standard suit of armor can cost around $1,500 but top of the range protection can cost upwards of $15,400. Organisers said people taking part are from a variety of different backgrounds, often looking for a chance to be a hero than some sort. And the sport also appears to take its toll on the wives of the knights, who are forced to watch their loved ones . Competitors from Boston Dark Knights (left) recently faced the New York Sentinels (right) in New Hampshire . Competitors talk tactics and ensure all their armor is in place as they prepare for battle in New Hampshire . Elizabeth Ross, 35, has watched her husband Brandon do battle as one of the Dark Knights of Boston. 'He is actually in retail but works for a company that sells building materials,' she said. 'When he is out of his armour he's just like a normal, funny guy, . 'In his armor he is pretty much fierce and beastly. It's quite amazing to behold and it is very sexy, very, very much so.' However she does admit the weaponry causes some concerns. 'The extremeness of the fighting is on my mind and I know that they are real weapons and that these guys are really into it,' she added. The group currently has around 100 members but hopes to expand across the US.","Armored Combat League of America has created a Medieval fight club .

"A portrait many believe to be of Henry VIII’s third wife is really of her predecessor Anne Boleyn, researchers claim. Facial recognition technology was used to compare possible likenesses of Anne, and found a striking similarity with a picture long said to be of Jane Seymour. The only undisputed portrayal of doomed queen Anne – the so-called Moost Happi medal in the British Museum – was used as a starting point for the project by computer scientist Amit Roy-Chowdhury. Scroll down for video . The portrait of Anne Boleyn (left), which shows a striking similarity to Jane Seymour, was compared against the only undisputed portrayal of Anne – the so-called Moost Happi medal (right) - using facial recognition . His hi-tech method uses differences in facial features to rule whether two pictures are of the same person. It revealed that the picture of Anne hanging in the National Portrait Gallery most likely is not of her at all, and was unable to decide on a second. However, a third portrait at Nidd Hall, North Yorkshire, probably does portray Anne – despite it long being said to depict her successor, the American Association for the Advancement of Science heard at its annual conference in San Jose, California. It had been argued that the painting was of Jane and altered to look more like Anne after her daughter Elizabeth I came to power. For instance, a brooch bearing the initials AB can be seen pinned to the woman’s dress. There are few images of Anne Boleyn after King Henry VIII attempted to erase her from history after her execution in 1536 . The discovery is significant as few images of Anne survive. Henry attempted to erase her from history after having her executed in 1536. Dr Roy-Chowdhury, from the University of California, said: ‘Who is being depicted in a portrait can be an area of considerable controversy among art historians. 'Portraits often have some importance. They represent someone of social standing, or some significant event. 'The goal of this project is to be able to use state-of-the-art face recognition to identify the individuals seen in a particular portrait.'","Facial recognition technology was used to analyse portrait of Anne Boleyn .

"David Cameron said he had paid cash for work but not so the trader could avoid tax . David Cameron today waded into the row over cash-in-hand work - insisting it was okay not to ask for a receipt because the 'onus' was not on tragers to pay their tax. A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said he had occasionally paid for goods and services in cash without getting a receipt, but insists that he has never helped someone 'evade the taxes that they should pay'. She added: 'If you have one-off payments for something, you may well pay cash. The onus is on the trader, who is responsible for making sure they pay the taxes that they owe.' Mr Cameron's intervention came after Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said getting a receipt for all cash-in-hand jobs was a 'matter of good housekeeping' and was a 'good thing to do'. Mr Umunna's remarks were in response to the controversy sparked by Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls who said families had a duty document how much they pay every time they get their hedge trimmed. Mr Balls said people had a duty to demand receipts for the smallest cash jobs carried out by gardeners, cleaners and handymen. But Mr Umunna this morning defended the shadow chancellor. He said: 'Is he demanding that your viewers keep every single receipt they get?...No, he wasn't.' However, he added: 'As a matter of good housekeeping it's a good thing to do' The Tories this morning claimed Mr Balls's suggestion revealed a 'complete lack of understanding' about business. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was 'absurd'. He said: 'I don't think anybody in the country probably does that unless they sit down and they do it as part of a process; in other words, if you are employing somebody in which the objective is paying them cash as a process of your business, then of course I suspect most businesses do keep some kind of record, that's the right thing to do. 'But if you have a one-off payment for something and you pay cash, I shouldn't think anybody in the country does that necessarily ... what it exemplifies is Labour's complete lack of understanding about how business works and, actually, how people get by.' Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said it was 'a matter of good housekeeping' to get a receipt for cash-in-hand jobs, following Ed Balls's remarks . Shadow Chuka Umunna refused five times to say whether Labour would hand back any money received from a donor found to have used aggressive tax avoidance. He was quizzed on the subject on the Today programme yesterday by Jim Naughtie. Mr Naughtie: Can we take it as an absolute given that if you discover that anyone who's given money to the Labour Party has been involved in aggressive tax avoidance, you give the money back? Mr Umunna: I think the Labour Party would think twice about accepting money from people who fit the description that you give. Mr Naughtie: No, simple question: If you've taken it, from somebody who is discovered to have been involved in aggressive tax avoidance, will you give the money back? Mr Umunna: Well I'm not aware that we have taken money from anybody who's engaged. Mr Naughtie: No, but if it emerged, nor am I, but if it emerged, are you going to be as good as your word? If it emerged, would you give that money back? Mr Umunna: Well as I said, I think the Labour Party found out that somebody was engaged in aggressive tax avoidance, would think twice before taking the money. Mr Naughtie: But if you had taken the money you'd give it back? Mr Umunna: Well I'm not, I mean, you're asking me a hypothetical question, because I'm not aware that we have taken it. Mr Naughtie: Well most questions in the run up to an election are hypothetical. You're talking about hypothetical questions about what you would do with business if you became a government. You aren't a government. Therefore that's hypothetical, this is hypothetical. Answer the question. If the money came from a tax dodger, would you give it back? Mr Umunna: Well I'm not aware that it has, that we have received any monies from people engaging in aggressive tax avoidance. He told BBC Breakfast: 'Here we have a man that would be the chancellor who is wandering around saying Big Brother is going to watch you carefully, that if you do any cash transactions and don't keep receipts, somehow they are going to punish you. I find that absurd.' The shadow chancellor's comments came as Labour and the Tories engaged in furious clashes over tax dodging, with both sides complaining of smears. As he was pressed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics about what constituted tax avoidance, Mr Balls said: 'The right thing to do if you are having somebody cut your hedge for a tenner is to make sure they give you their name and address and a receipt and a record for the fact that you have paid them.' Asked whether he himself followed that rule, he said: 'Absolutely. That's because I am the shadow chancellor and I'm extremely careful about these things. 'Over my life, have I ever given people a tenner and not given a receipt for it? Probably yes. But he had not done so 'since I have been involved in politics and Treasury matters'. Mr Balls said: 'It's not your job to pay their taxes for them and I think most people you give a tenner to are not going to be VAT-registered. 'They've got the legal obligation to make sure they pay their taxes if it's that kind of transaction - but I think the sensible thing for anybody is that you've got a record of it and you've done it properly.' Mr Duncan Smith said he could 'understand the frustrations people feel' about tax avoidance but insisted the Government had acted to close loopholes. Mr Umunna this morning dismissed the row as 'a storm in a teacup'. He told Sky News: 'I sometimes think the whole way we do politics and debate things in this bubble is just so ridiculous. 'He was doomed if he did and doomed if he didn't, in answering that question. It's all over the papers this morning, and actually it's a bit of a storm in a teacup, in my view.' Mr Umunna acknowledged that he did not keep all his own receipts, suggesting that Mr Balls was in a special position as he was putting himself forward as a future chancellor who might one day be in charge of HM Revenue and Customs. 'For my own part, do I keep a receipt every time I pay for something? I just paid for something using contactless payment, I didn't get a receipt for that,' Mr Umunna told Sky News.","Prime Minister said he had paid cash without asking for a receipt .

"Chemists subjected spheres of DNA to extreme temperatures  and found the material - and the data stored on it - could be successfully decoded . Just one gram of DNA can store the equivalent of 14,000 Blu-ray discs. But although the potential for DNA  as an alternative to hard drives  has been known about for years, it is not the most reliable and secure way to keep data safe. The latest breakthrough could be about to change that, however. Chemists subjected spheres of DNA to extreme temperatures designed to mimic chemical degradation and found the material - and the data stored on it - could be successfully decoded. The research was led by Robert Grass from ETH Zurich's Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences. 'DNA lends itself to this task as it can store large amounts of information in a compact manner,' said the researchers. 'Unfortunately, the data is not always retrievable error-free: gaps and false information in the encoded data arise through chemical degradation and mistakes in DNA sequencing. '[We] have revealed how the long-term, error-free storage of information can be achieved, potentially for more than a million years.' In 2013, researchers demonstrated that data could be saved and read from DNA, but during tests the time between 'writing' the information and reading, or sequencing it, was relatively short. Even during this short time, mistakes were spotted in the writing and reading of the data stored on the DNA. Over a longer term, DNA can change significantly as it reacts chemically with the environment, and this is the biggest obstacle to using DNA as a long-term storage option. With this in mind, Professor Grass took inspiration from fossilised bones. Despite being  thousands of years old, it is possible to obtain genetic material found within the bones. He concluded that this DNA is protected because it is 'encapsulated and protected'. With this in mind he devised a way to protect the information-bearing DNA with a synthetic 'fossil shell', in the same way. His team began by encoding Switzerland's Federal Charter of 1291 and The Methods of Mechanical Theorems by Archimedes in the DNA. The researchers then placed the DNA segments into spheres of silica with a diameter of roughly 150 nanometres. For the recent breakthrough, the researchers took inspiration from fossilised bones (stock image). Despite being thousands of years old, it is possible to obtain  genetic material because the DNA is protected inside the bones. The experts designed a similar 'fossil shell' to protect the information-bearing DNA in the same way . In order to simulate the degradation of DNA over a long period of time, researchers stored it at a temperature of between 60°C (140°F) and 70°C (158°F) for up to a month. These high temperatures replicate the chemical degradation that takes place over hundreds of years within just a few weeks. By doing this, the researchers could compare the storage of DNA in silica glass with other common storage methods such as on impregnated filter paper and in a biopolymer. The DNA encapsulated in the glass shell turned out to be particularly robust and the researchers were able separate it from the shell, using a fluoride solution, and read information from it. In 2013, researchers from the European Bioinformatics Institute at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire 'downloaded' all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets on to strands of synthetic DNA. In 2013, researchers from Cambridgeshire 'downloaded' all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets on to strands of synthetic DNA (illustrated) Scientists were then able to decode the information and reproduce the words of the Bard with complete accuracy. The same technique made it possible to store a 26-second excerpt from Martin Luther King's 'I Have A Dream' speech and a photo of the Cambridgeshire laboratory where the work took place. For their experiment, the scientists used a tiny amount of synthetic, dry DNA. Five genetic 'letters' from the genetic code - A,C,G and T - were used to represent the zeros and ones that make up 'bytes' of digital information. For instance, the upper case T in the word 'Thou' from the second line of Shakespeare's Sonnet XVIII - 'Thou art more lovely and more temperate' - was encoded by the sequence TATAT. The scientists then incorporated an 'error correction', similar to that found laptops and mobile phones. This involved overlapping short strands of DNA and independently writing every million-molecule fragment of code four times. Effectively, three back ups were created for each fragment, greatly reducing the chances of mistakes. This was a similar method used by Reinhard Heckel from ETH Zurich's Communication Technology Laboratory for the recent study. And, because the silica spheres are comparable to the way DNA is protected in fossilised bones, the researchers concluded that if stored at certain temperatures, the data could survive for millions of years. The team used the example of extremely low temperatures, such as -18° C. By comparison, data on microfilm can be preserved only for an estimated 500 years. Scientists used an 'error correction' similar to those found in laptops (stock image). This involved adding data to each fragment to create back ups . As the researchers pointed out, this is not the first time DNA has been used to store information and digital data. In 2013, researchers from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) at the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire 'downloaded' all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets on to strands of synthetic DNA. Scientists were then able to decode the information and reproduce the words of the Bard with complete accuracy. Dr Nick Goldman, from the EBI said: 'We already know that DNA is a robust way to store information because we can extract it from bones of woolly mammoths, which date back tens of thousands of years, and make sense of it. The scientists then incorporated an 'error correction', similar to that found laptops and mobile phones. This involved overlapping short strands of DNA and independently writing every million-molecule fragment of code four times. Effectively, three back ups were created for each fragment, greatly reducing the chances of mistakes. This was a similar method used by Reinhard Heckel from ETH Zurich's Communication Technology Laboratory for the recent study. The researchers from EBI stressed that the DNA used was wholly artificial and different to the genetic molecules of life, and if it was added to a human body, it would degrade and be disposed of. Theoretically, 100 million hours of high definition video could be stored in a cupful of DNA - equivalent to every film and TV show ever created. A DNA archive also requires no constant supply of electric power like hard drives and data centres (example pictured) do . Currently the technology is restricted by the length of time it takes to sequence DNA and its high cost - around £8,000 ($12,300) per megabyte of stored material. Even so, DNA-based storage could today be cost effective for archives of several megabytes over long time periods of 600 to 5,000 years, computer models predict.

"He's the clean-cut aristocrat who was reportedly left devastated when girlfriend Cressida Bonas left him for Prince Harry. Now it seems the boot is on the other foot, after Harry Wentworth-Stanley, 26, was pictured clutching Miss Bonas' hand as they stepped out together on Valentine's Day. But the prince wasn't at home nursing broken heart. Instead, he remains in Verbier, where he is enjoying a skiing holiday with his cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.

He is not the first man that Miss Bonas, 25, has been linked to since ending her relationship with Prince Harry last summer. In January, the budding actress was spotted with Riot Club actor Freddie Fox, 26, at a West End screening of Tim Burton’s movie Big Eyes. ‘Freddie and Cressida were very close and affectionate,’ a guest at the London screening told The Mail on Sunday at the time. ‘They spent half an hour deep in conversation in a corner by the bar. When the film started, they had to sit separately because there weren’t any seats together and they both looked very disappointed.’ Romantic: The pair, who dated while studying at the University of Leeds, were pictured on Valentine's Day .

The following week, the pair were seen together once again at Los Angeles celebrity hotspot Chateau Marmont, although the actor later denied that he and Miss Bonas were in a relationship. Fox, who is currently starring in Channel 4 drama Cucumber, went on to reveal that he is bisexual in an interview with the Telegraph, saying he wouldn't wish to say 'I am this or I am that'. 'I’ve had girlfriends, but I wouldn’t wish to say ""I am this or I am that"", because at some time in my life I might fall in love with a man,' he explained. 'I hope that I am the type of person who would fall in love with another person, as opposed to a sex. Most of my life to date has been as a straight man, but who knows what will happen next?' One man who has no such debate about his sexuality is Mr Wentworth-Stanley, who dated Miss Bonas while studying for a degree in Business Management and Spanish. The couple's relationship fizzled out after he departed for a gap year in Buenos Aires, but friends say the pair have remained close. Close friends: Miss Bonas was linked to Freddie Fox, 26, in January but the two are thought to be just friends . Busy: Cressida travelled to LA in January for a pre-BAFTAS tea party at the Four Seasons Hotel . According to one, Mr Wentworth-Stanley was unhappy to hear of Miss Bonas' relationship with Prince Harry when news first emerged, leaving her torn. 'Cressida is still very fond of her ex-boyfriend and, since Harry’s been on the scene, he’s been after her again,’ said the source at the time. 'Cressida is torn. She likes Harry but is not the sort to be bothered about his title.' Since returning from Buenos Aires, Mr Wentworth-Stanley, who is the son of Clare Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven, has based himself in London and completed a part-time Masters degree in Real Estate at the capital's South Bank University last year. After completing a two-month secondment at luxury property company Finchatton, he rejoined Savills' graduate scheme and is expected to complete his education this Spring. Glamorous: Cressida has been starring in a play at The Vault (right) but also attended the Golden Globes (left) Former love: Cressida, seen here at a rugby match last March, split from Prince Harry in the summer . Like Miss Bonas, his family background is a colourful one, with the 26-year-old amassing three half-siblings from his father's second marriage and two step-siblings from his mother's. He also has a sister, Louisa, but was hit by a family tragedy in 2006 when his older brother James, an accomplished polo player known to friends as 'the Golden Boy', committed suicide. Speaking at the time, Mr Wentworth-Stanley's father Nick revealed that he had 'wondered desperately' whether anything could have been done to prevent the tragedy. 'Words cannot describe the desperate frustration a parent suffers through losing a child this way,' he said.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic has revealed why he stripped off his shirt after scoring just two minutes into Paris Saint-Germain's draw with Caen on Saturday afternoon. The Sweden striker was showing his support for the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) by tattooing the names of 50 hungry people helped by the charity onto his body. The WFP has helped 805 million hungry people all around the world and the 50 chosen by Ibrahimovic symbolically represented some of the worst humanitarian crises ongoing today. VIDEO Scroll down for Zlatan Ibrahimovic tattooed names of 50 starving . PSG striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic tattooed the names of 50 starving people from around the world on his torso in support of the United Nations World Food Programme and showed them off after scoring against Caen . The 50 names were applied as temporary tattoos around Ibrahimovic's existing tattoos . The tattoos were designed to raise awareness of the United Nations relief work in impoverished countries . Ibrahimovic urged his fans to around the world to offer their support to millions of starving people . 'Wherever I go people recognize me, call my name, cheer for me,' said the PSG striker, who found the net after just 72 seconds in the Ligue 1 encounter at the Parc des Princes. 'But there are names no one cares to remember. That no one cheers for: the 805m people suffering from hunger in the world today. 'I have the supporters all over the world. From now on I want this support to go to the people who suffer from hunger, they are the real champions. 'So whenever you hear my name, you will think of their names.' Ibrahimovic had the temporary tattoos - of names such as Carmen, Mariko, Antoine, Lida, Rahma and Yaae - applied to his torso ahead of the Caen match. Ibrahimovic removed his shirt to reveal the 50 names after scoring after just 72 seconds of the match . When he scored in the second minute - extending a leg to direct Serge Aurier's cross into the bottom corner - he removed his shirt in the middle of the field to show off the tapestry of tattoos. Ibrahimovic received a yellow card for his troubles, as the rules dictate, but wasn't overly concerned having got his message across to the world. 'Each one of the 805m people suffering from hunger in the world has a name, a voice, a story to share,' said WFP director for France Marina Catena. 'Zlatan accepted the challenge and wished to carry their stories on his own skin so that the world does not forget them.' His goal represented the perfect start to the afternoon for the Parisian side but it ended in a nightmare for Laurent Blanc and his team. World Food Programme . Ibrahimovic wore most of the tattoos on his arm, chest and midriff . The striker was booked for removing his shirt in celebration, as the laws of the game dictate . Ibrahimovic turns to celebrate after seeing his shot hit the back of the net in only the second minute . Although Ezequiel Lavezzi doubled their lead shortly before half-time, they suffered four injuries and ended the match with just nine-men after two players went off after the final substitution had been made. Yohan Cabaye, Marquinhos, Serge Aurier and Lucas Moura are definitely out of PSG's Champions League last 16, first leg tie with Chelsea on Tuesday night, while Blaise Matuidi is rated 50-50. And, to add insult to injury, Caen fought back in the final few minutes to claim a 2-2 draw and stop PSG going top of the table.","Ibrahimovic took off his shirt in celebration after scoring on Saturday .

"Armed police are now guarding the headquarters of spy agency GCHQ 24 hours a day amid fears it could be targeted in a terror attack similar to the weekend's atrocity in Denmark, it was revealed today. Security has been tightened after the attacks in Copenhagen by lone gunman Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein and MI5 believes it is 'only a matter of time' before a similar attack in Britain. For the first time armed Ministry of Defence Police will guard the GCHQ listening station full time in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in response to the heightened terror threat. Protection: Armed police have been stationed outside GCHQ's Cheltenham headquarters amid the rising threat from 'lone wolf' terrorists . Threat: The current threat level of an attack has been set by the Government as severe, meaning a strike on Britain is ‘highly likely’ The current threat level of an attack has been set by the Government as severe, meaning a strike is ‘highly likely’. But it is not known whether officers have been deployed at GCHQ because of a specific threat. A GCHQ spokesman said of the decision to deploy armed police: ‘The security posture of our sites, including the safety of our staff, is under constant review.’ He added that it was the first time full time armed guards had been deployed at the site. Spy chiefs last night warned that lone wolf terror attacks are now Britain’s ‘biggest fear’ in the wake of Europe’s latest atrocity. However, officials accept there is little they can do to prevent such tragedies because those involved often live appparently normal lives within communities and give no hint of their intentions. A counter-terror source last night said lone wolf gunmen or suicide bombers, with no obvious link to known extremists, were ‘our biggest fear’. High profile: The leaks by Edward Snowden put GCHQ's work in the spotlight and experts believe this has made it more of a target . The insider told the Daily Mirror: ‘Loners are unpredictable and by their very nature tend not to make their intentions known in a way that can be intercepted. ‘Agencies have smashed many major mass casualty plots, but smaller attacks by one or two radicalised terrorists whose warped plans go below the radar make detection difficult. These people are out there, without doubt.’ It was revealed last night that the jihadi who killed two people in the Copenhagen atrocity was inspired by the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris last month. Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein was shot at a train station in Copenhagen after he opened fire on armed officers in the early hours of Sunday morning. The 22-year-old fanatic murdered film director Finn Norgaard, 55, while indiscriminately firing an automatic rifle at a free speech debate at a cafe on Saturday afternoon. His intended target was thought to have been the controversial Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who has previously depicted the prophet Muhammad as a stray dog. Mr Vilks escaped unscathed. Terror suspect: Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein (pictured) was killed in Denmark after opening fire on police and it is feared that a similar attack in Britain is inevitable . Two deaths: Finn Norgaard, 55, (left) was killed at a free speech debate in a cafe hours before 37-year-old Dan Uzan (right), a basketball player, was shot in the head as he guarded the door of a Bar Mitzvah . Some ten hours later the gunman shot Dan Uzan in the head at a synagogue holding a bat mitzvah celebration for 80 people. Mr Uzan, 37, an economist at the Danish treasury, had been acting as a volunteer security guard for the event. Two police officers, who were at the synagogue to provide extra security following the earlier cafe shooting, were shot in the arms and legs. Three others were injured in the earlier attack. All are expected to survive. The attack at the Krudttønden café bears striking similarities to the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris last month, in which two fanatics murdered 12 people. Their accomplice shot dead a policewoman and four hostages at a kosher supermarket.","Ministry of Defence armed officers now outside GCHQ in Cheltenham 24/7 .

"Police arrested three women at a Valentine's Day screening of Fifty Shades of Grey after reports a man was glassed . Officers were called to the Grosvenor cinema in Glasgow on Saturday night after reports a group of 'drunk and rowdy' women had turned violent. Witnesses said movie-goers were vomiting in the aisles of the cinema - where alcoholic drinks are served - before the alleged attack. Police were called to the Grosvenor Cinema in Glasgow's Ashton Lane on Saturday after an incident inside. Witnesses say a group of women had got drunk before attacking a man who asked them to be quiet . The cinema is the city's Ashton Lane, a West End street popular for its many pubs and nightclubs. Witnesses say a group of women were being rowdy during a showing of the erotic film, based on E.L. James's bestseller. It is reported that a man asked to group to keep the noise down when he was attacked with a glass by one of the women. Michael Bolton, who was at the screening, told The Daily Record: '[A woman] said that three or four girls had been very loud and were shouting. The man had asked them to shut up and he was glassed... Only in Glasgow are police called to the cinema.' Witnesses said cinema staff were left cleaning up blood from the cinema floor after the incident. The man's injuries were not serious and he did not need hospital treatment. Three women were arrested on suspicion of disorder offences, Police Scotland said. The alleged attack was during a screening of Fifty Shades of Grey, the erotic film starring Dakota Johnson (pictured) based on E.L. James's book . The force spokesman said: 'At 8pm on Saturday, 14 February, police responded to reports of a disturbance at the Grosvenor Cinema on Ashton Lane, Glasgow. Police sources have denied glass was used in the attack. 'Three women were arrested for alleged disorder offences. Inquiries continue to determine the full circumstances of the incident.' A spokeswoman for Grosvenor cinema said: 'I can confirm that an incident occurred on Saturday 14 February following an early evening showing of 50 Shades Of Grey. 'This was an isolated incident that was dealt with rapidly by cinema staff and stewards, as a result of which, Police Scotland attended and made an arrest. 'Despite press reports, nobody was glassed and a wine bottle was not used as a weapon. Those involved did not require hospital attention. 'We welcomed nearly 2000 customers over the weekend, including four further showings on Saturday night which passed without incident.'","Police were called to Glasgow's West End on Saturday night after incident .

"A man who is risking his health thanks to his addiction to illegal tanning injections says he would rather die than be pale-skinned. Ryan Ruckledge, 22, from Blackpool, regularly injects himself with Melanotan - a synthetic hormone that makes the skin turn darker - before enjoying his six sunbed sessions a week. The jabs are currently unregulated and experts say they could cause side effects including depression, nausea, high blood pressure and panic attacks. Scroll down for video . Ryan Ruckledge, 22, from Blackpool, pictured on today's This Morming regularly injects himself with Melanotan so his fair skin will tan when he uses a sunbed . Despite suffering from many of these symptoms - and once even being hospitalised because he thought he was having a heart attack - Ryan says he won't stop having the injections. Speaking on today's This Morning, he said: 'I would rather be dead because otherwise my personality would be dead. I couldn't walk down street if I was pale, I couldn't physically function.' The telesales worker - who once auditioned for The X Factor - told TV presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley that he heard about the injections from a friend after sunbeds were failing to give him the tanned look he desired. He explained: 'At school I was really pale as I am fair skinned. People would say to me ""'you are so pale"" and I hated being pale. Half the people I saw in magazines were orange and brown so it went from there. 'I started using sunbeds at the age of 15 but I just used to burn and peel so I stopped. Then a friend recommended the injections to me.' Ryan told TV presenters Phillip Schofield and Christine Bleakley that he's rather be dead than pale . The telesales worker says he hasn't thought about the long term effects to his health by having the injections and using sunbeds regularly as he's currently enjoying life thanks to being tanned . He said that thanks to the jabs, which he purchases from illegal sellers, he can have six sunbed sessions a week where he his skin tans instead of burning. Ryan said: 'I can't imagine my life without them. Without them I would be ghostly pale, see through. 'I wouldn't love life without these injections, I would not be confident or have the confidence to do the things I do.' Ryan says the nausea, stomach cramps, dizzy spells and panic attacks he has had since taking the jabs are not enough to put him off. 'I couldn't go out and walk down the street unless I have these injections because I hate being pale. I would have to stay in and miss parties,' he explained. He added that even the risk of death doesn't dissuade him and he hasn't considered the effect on his long-term health as he's currently living for the moment. The 22-year-old, pictured left auditioning for The X Factor in 2013, said he wouldn't have the confidence to walk down the street without a tan so he can't live without tanning injections(file photo of self injection, right) NHS Choices explain on their website... 'We could all be gone tomorrow. I could slip on a drink in a night club, hit my head and that would be it. 'No-one knows what round corner,' he said. 'I just love life at the minute with my mates.' When asked why he couldn't use fake tan products instead, Ryan said: 'I'd smell of biscuit and it goes streaky. It's not natural and when it comes off and I look in mirror and see myself pale, I don't like the way I look.' He added that he has run up thousands of pounds worth of debt in order to have the tanning jabs, as well as other beauty treatments including Botox and teeth whitening. But he said he wouldn't be in such debt if the government legalised the tanning jabs and made them available on the NHS. He believes many pale-skinned people could benefit from the product being investigated. He said: 'This injection means when you come into sun you don't burn so it could prevent skin cancer, it could be beneficial. 'I'm not just vain, I burn myself because I can't get a natural tan. It should be tested and looked into more. The government needs to look into it.' He has made a direct plea for this to the Secretary of State for Health tweeting: '@Jeremy_Hunt where's my tan jabs and Botox.' Despite the lack of knowledge around the long term health effects of injecting Melanotan - and the fact he is risking skin cancer with the frequent sunbed use - undeterred Ryan says he's addicted to tanning and won't quit. 'I'd rather walk around with gravy smeared on my face than be pale,' he said.","Ryan Ruckledge, from Blackpool, regularly injects himself with Melanotan .

"A dejected dog spent three hours tied to a lamppost on Valentine's Day after his owner abandoned him with a note saying 'needs a new home'. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier was found in a dark alleyway in Erith, south east London, on Saturday night - with a piece of twine attached to his lead and a sheet of paper in front of him. He is the second sad-looking Staffie to have been dumped by his owner in the last week - and some blame the trend on the negative attention the breed gets following attacks on people. Abandoned and alone: This dejected dog spent three hours tied to a lamppost on Valentine's Day after his owner dumped him in an alleyway in east London with a note saying 'needs a new home' RSPCA officers who discovered the latest abandoned pooch nicknamed him Valentino. Joanna Bishop, an inspector for the animal charity, said: 'Poor Valentino was dumped on Valentine's Day. 'He is such a lovely dog too. Beautiful, in really good condition with a shiny coat, and a really sweet nature. 'The only word to describe the way he was sitting there under that street light in the dark alley is bewildered. His face seemed to say ""Why am I here?"" Another unwanted Staffie: This dog, left outside Eastbourne Railway last week,  cut a forlorn figure and appeared to be so saddened by his situation that tears were coming from his eyes . 'I didn't get the impression he'd been mistreated before this point - and then found himself suddenly in a cold, dark alleyway, without any food, water or care. 'He was just sitting there flummoxed wondering what had happened and where his owner had gone - just very confused and sad. He was a blue Staffy with the blues.' Valentino's luck soon changed as he was adopted by a new owner after just a day in the kennels. Last week another black Staffordshire Bull Terrier was abandoned outside Eastbourne Railway Station, East Sussex, tied to the railing and left with just a small pot of water by his owner who fled in a taxi. A photo of the animal, looking forlorn, has been shared dozens of times on the internet with people calling for help for the 'crying' dog. Hugely popular: Kai became the most popular dog in the Scottish SPCA's history after he was found tied to railings outside Ayr station with just a suitcase containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy . Happy ending: Ian Russell, 52, (right) was chosen by the Scottish SPCA from a list of hundreds of people who wanted to give Kai a new home . The dog was found whining and pining for his owner after patiently waiting by the railing for more than an hour on February 11 in the hope that he would return. When no one turned up to collect the lonely dog he was reported abandoned and taken into the care of Eastbourne Borough Council. Another high-profile abandoning was that of Kai, the Shar-Pei crossbreed.

"Her political career has long been a butt of jokes for Saturday Night Live. So to toast the show's 40th birthday on Sunday night, Sarah Palin offered up some new material. Arriving at Studio 8H in her daughter's four-year-old silver mini dress, the former governor of Alaska joked about running for president, jesting that it would be great news for SNL's writers. Thrifty! Sarah Palin put on a leggy display at the SNL 40th anniversary show (left) in what appears to be a dress her daughter Bristol wore in 2011 (right) to the White House Correspondents' Dinner . The former Alaska governor joked about running again, jesting that it would be great news for SNL's writers . In a skit with Jerry Seinfeld, she asked how much the show would pay her to run for president in 2016. Seinfeld balked: 'No figure is too high Sarah!' She raised the stakes: 'What if I had Donald Trump as my running mate?' He replied: 'Now you're just teasing us!' Palin became a source of comedy inspiration for the show during her vice-presidential campaign alongside John McCain in 2008. Tina Fey developed a popular skit impersonating the Tea Party poster mom, which reached a climax when Palin herself made a cameo. The sketch drew in the show's highest overnight rating since 1994, with about 17 million viewers. But it didn't do wonders for Palin's political aspirations. After the episode aired, polls showed voters overwhelmingly agreed that Palin was unqualified for the role of vice president. Awkward: Palin and Alec Baldwin had an awkward exchange on the red carpet before the show on Sunday . Getting ready for her spot: Palin was sat with Taylor Swift and Steven Spielberg for her skit with Seinfeld . Speaking on the red carpet on Sunday night outside New York's Rockerfeller Center, Palin remembered the skit fondly. She told Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie: 'If this is indicative of the campaign, it was the most fun moment of the campaign.' Alongside Alec and Hilaria Baldwin, Palin hailed the show as a center for 'the most intelligent and comedic minds in America in one place.'

Fey's skit reached a climax when Palin herself made a cameo on the show (pictured) in the same outfit . But she was then caught in an awkward exchange with Alec Baldwin - with whom she shared an awkward cold open of SNL in 2008. She joked to him: 'I still prefer your brother!' Baldwin retorted: 'Of course you do,' before adding: 'We get to relax and have fun regardless of people’s politics. 'And I often think, if only Lorne Michaels could produce the Congress, maybe we’d have more fun and we would get more done.'","Former governor of Alaska arrived at Studio 8H in Bristol Palin's dress .

"Artillery exchanges between government forces and Russian-backed separatists were threatening the fragile ceasefire in Ukraine today. The country's military command yesterday said pro-Russian rebels had attacked 112 times since the ceasefire began on Sunday, mostly in the bitterly contested Debaltseve area. Spokesman Andriy Lysenko said five Ukrainian troops had been killed and 25 wounded in the past 24 hours. The rebels hit back, accusing Ukrainian forces of shelling Donetsk Airport. Under the ceasefire agreement negotiated by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France, the warring sides are to begin withdrawing heavy weapons from the front line today. Artillery exchanges are threatening the fragile ceasefire in Ukraine, pictured are members of the Ukrainian armed forces riding on a military vehicle near Debaltseve today . Pro-Russian rebels attacked 112 times since the ceasefire began on Sunday, pictured Ukrainian armed forces take their position near Debaltseve, eastern Ukraine . Pro-Russian rebels fire their weapons into the air today during the funerals of four rebel fighters killed on the frontline . But it now appears unlikely this plan will succeed. The ceasefire had raised hopes for an end to the conflict, which has so far lasted ten months and claimed more than 5,300 lives. Meanwhile, the European Union has added 19 people and nine organisations to its list of those facing sanctions. The additions include two Russian deputy defence ministers, the eastern Ukraine-born Russian singer Iosif Kobzon and several separatist commanders. The Russian foreign ministry reacted angrily to the decision, calling it 'clumsy' in the context of last week's ceasefire deal. The ministry dismissed the new EU sanctions as 'running against common sense' and harming chances 'to resolve an internal Ukrainian conflict'. German chancellor Angela Merkel appealed for the ceasefire to be respected. 'The situation is fragile (but) that was certainly to be expected with a view to Debaltseve,' she said. The ceasefire had raised hopes for an end to the conflict, families even ventured out into parks over the weekend . A ceasefire between the Kiev government and pro-Russian rebels appeared to be largely holding on Sunday . One man even went paraskiing on a frozen river  in Donetsk, Ukraine, during the fragile ceasefire . Rebels said soon after it came into effect that they had no intention of observing the ceasefire at Debaltseve, where they have been advancing since January and now have a Ukrainian unit all but encircled. Washington says the rebel operation around the town, which sits on a strategic railway hub, is being assisted by the Russian armed forces, which Moscow denies. Reuters reporters near the front said Debaltseve was being relentlessly bombarded with artillery. At least six tanks as well as armoured personnel carriers and artillery could be seen in woods near Vuhlehirsk, 10km (six miles) west of Debaltseve, which the rebels captured a week ago. Military trucks headed along the main road in the direction of the town to regular bursts of shelling and the firing of Grad rockets and machine guns. Ukrainian soldiers play football on the road leading to the embattled town of Debaltseveyesterday . 'You can hear there is no ceasefire,' said a rebel fighter with a black ski mask who gave his name as Scorpion, his nom de guerre, and blamed the fighting on Kiev's forces. 'Debaltseve is our land. And we will take Debaltseve.' A rebel commander, Eduard Basurin, said Ukrainian troops had violated the ceasefire 27 times in the past 24 hours. 'The pre-condition for withdrawal of heavy weapons is fulfilling Point One of the Minsk agreements - the ceasefire. One hundred and twelve attacks are not an indicator of a ceasefire,' said a Kiev military spokesman, Andriy Lysenko. A rebel leader, Denis Pushilin, responded by saying his forces were 'only ready for a mutual withdrawal of equipment'.","Artillery exchanges threatening the fragile ceasefire in Ukraine .

"The average UK commuter spends about 1.5 hours a day at the wheel. While not great for stress levels in general, there are other ways that the daily churn through traffic can negatively affect health. Research by my team at the University of Surrey has shown how drivers and pedestrians are being exposed to very high levels of air pollutants at traffic lights. The World Health Organisation links air pollution to seven million premature deaths every year. Drivers and pederstrians are being exposed to high levels of air pollutants at traffic lights, experts say. Pollution levels are 29 times higher at traffic lights than in free-flowing traffic, research found . It's well known that road vehicles in particular emit polluting nanoparticles which contribute to respiratory and heart diseases. Despite efforts to encourage a reduction, car usage has remained fairly constant in recent decades. Our team monitored drivers' exposure to air pollutants at various points of a journey and found traffic intersections were high pollution hot-spots due to the frequent changes in driving conditions. With drivers decelerating and stopping at lights, then revving up to move quickly when lights go green, peak particle concentration was found to be 29 times higher than that during free-flowing traffic conditions. Also of course, while travelling by road we are generally pretty close to the air pollution source, which is the tailpipe of preceding road vehicle. Though drivers spend just 2 per cent of their journey time passing through intersections managed by traffic lights, this short duration contributes to about 25 per cent of total exposure to these harmful particles. It's not always possible to change your route to avoid these intersections, but drivers should be aware of the increased risks at busy lights and at least try to avoid regularly taking routes that force them to sit in traffic inhaling potentially harmful fumes. Where this is unavoidable the best way to limit exposure is to keep vehicle windows shut, fans off and try to increase the distance between the cars in front where possible. Pedestrians regularly crossing such routes should consider whether there might be other paths less dependent on traffic light crossings. But there is more to it than asking drivers to take circuitous routes. Local transport agencies could also help by synchronising traffic signals to reduce waiting time and consider alternative traffic management systems such as flyovers. Cars emit polluting nanoparticles which contribute to respiratory and heart diseases. When stopped at a traffic light, people are  close to the air pollution source, which is the tailpipe of preceding road vehicle . They could also consider the appropriate placement of traffic lights. The use of these systems in built up residential areas, near schools or hospitals may serve to manage traffic flow but at the cost of trapping higher concentrations of harmful pollutants in exactly the areas where residents, and vulnerable members of society will most regularly commute or walk. I have written before about the use of low-cost sensing to capture air pollution hotspots in urban areas. The kind of data such projects could deliver feed directly into research such as this. The more we understand about where pollution hot spots are, the more direct action we can take in our own lives and the more we can push for greener, cleaner planning. The UK's Environmental Audit Committee recently described air pollution as a 'public health crisis'. These considerations are not just a 'nice to have', they have a direct effect on our health and wellbeing. This article was originally published by The Conversation. Air pollution raises the risk of suicide among middle aged men, according to new research . Air pollution raises the risk of suicide among middle aged men, suggests new research. A US study of more than 1,500 people who took their lives in Salt Lake County, Utah, U.S., found males aged between 36 and 64 were most prone after breathing in smog caused by factories and cars. After exposure to increased levels of nitrogen dioxide in the two to three days before their deaths, they were in 25 per cent more danger than normal. Exposure to air pollution particles raised the risk of suicide by six per cent. And those exposed to pollution were more likely to use violent means to end their lives. Professor Amanda Bakian, of the University of Utah, said: 'This suggests vulnerability to suicide following air pollution exposure is not uniform across Salt Lake County residents and some are more vulnerable than others.' The findings published in the American Journal of Epidemiology are particularly alarming as middle aged men already have the highest risk for suicide. While they do not show pollution causes people to kill themselves, they suggest it may interact with other factors, such as depression or pollen allergies, to make people more suicidal. Earlier results from the same study found the risk was highest during the spring and autumn, when most mental health agencies hire more crisis line staff. Men aged between 36 and 64 were most prone after breathing in smog caused by factories and cars . Smog levels are determined by the concentration of pollutants - ozone, sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) - in the air. Every day we breathe in tiny particles of these, which can embed themselves in our lungs. Studies have shown breathing polluted air can slightly increase your risk of lung cancer and affect the growth of children's lungs. Some doctors think that it may increase the risk of developing asthma, but this remains unproven.","Professor Prashant Kumar is a senior lecturer at the University of Surrey .

British personal trainer Jack Eyers became the first male amputee model to strut his stuff on the catwalk in the show. British personal trainer Jack Eyers became the first male amputee model to strut his stuff on the catwalk in the show; he had his leg amputated aged 16 . The show, which featured international designers, featured disabled models from all over the world . The show joined forces with  an Italian foundation that supports research to find a cure for spinal cord injuries . Jack, from Bournemouth, Dorset, was handpicked by celeb fashion designer, Antonio Urzi, whose creations have been worn by the likes of Beyoncé and Lady Gaga. He became an amputee at the age of 16, after having his right leg, which had been left withered by a condition called Proximal Femoral Focal Deficiency, amputated. Speaking ahead of his runway appearance, he said: 'It all feels so surreal. I can’t believe this is actually happening. To be the first male amputee model on a New York Fashion Week runway feels amazing - it feels like such a big deal. A model has her hair coiffed to perfection backstage at the diverse runway show .

'I have no idea what to expect, so it’s pretty overwhelming,' he continued. 'I just want to show that having a disability doesn’t need to hold you back.' Antonio Urzi is best known for creating some of the quirky costumes worn by Lady Gaga - including the silver sequined creation she wore on her 28th birthday last year. The designer to the stars has also had his pieces worn by the likes of Beyoncé and Britney Spears. Jack said: ‘It's amazing to think I'll be wearing clothes designed by such a prestigious man - I'm in good company. ‘I always said if I was going to do something like this, I want to do it big. ‘I want people to see me, and to realise that there needs to be more disabled models walking the runway.’ The show, which featured international designers with a 'Made in Italy' theme, featured disabled models alongside some of the industry's most esteemed clothes horses . Speaking about the show, producer Ilaria Niccolini told Ticker Report: 'It is a very significant moment in my fashion career, this opportunity to finally open the most recognised runways in the world [Mercedes Benz Fashion Week New York now, and in Milan Fashion Week in two weeks] to these beautiful talents, ready to show that disability is very often just a mental state by performing on the runway next to some of the best models on the scene.

"A Texas woman whose granddaughter was so severely beaten that she died with her spleen split in two is speaking out about her loss and the horrors endured by the 5-year-old little girl. Shelley Flatt-Blevins of Amarillo, Texas hasn't until now publicly discussed the unthinkable things she and her son learned about Kati Earnest's gruesome murder at the hands of Tommy Castro in court--evils all perpetrated while Kati's mom Kristina watched silently. 'During the court hearing I learnt that she'd stood by and watched while evil Castro viciously beat Kati black and blue,' said Flatt-Blevins, 48. Horrific: 5-year-old Kati Earnest was beaten to death by her mother's boyfriend with a wooden airplane she'd made in Sunday school in 2009 . Grieving: Kati's grandmother Shelley Flatt-Blevins (here with her son, Kati's father Nelson) has only now revealed the horrors of learning how her little granddaughter was killed. Her pain has only deepened since. Nelson has since died, too. He was shot dead in a gun accident last year . In 2009, Tommy Castro was dating Kristina Earnest. On the night of July 4, Castro beat Kati with a wooden plane she'd made at Sunday school and then with his fists before stomping on her with his full weight. Little Kati would later complain that she felt sick, vomit and die in the bathtub. After Kristina and Castro brought her to the hospital, they would first claim the girl--daughter to Flatt-Blevins' son Nelson--had drowned. 'I learnt from police that an autopsy on Kati's body indicated she'd died of blunt force trauma and hadn't drowned,' Flatt-Blevins said. 'I then learnt that Kristi had confessed to her own daughter's murder. I felt sick thinking about my precious little granddaughter.' But this was before the full scope of what had occurred would come to light in Kristina's 2011 trial and this grandmother's shock would not soon subside. Gruesome: Tommy Castro (left) beat Kati to death with the airplane and his fists. He also stood on her with his full weight, all while Kati's mother Kristina watched and did nothing . Shocking: Flatt-Blevins and her son would also hear in court that Castro had become enraged with the little girl after she wet herself in the seat of his beloved Mazda sportscar . Kristina, while fingering Castro for the blame, would later recant and claim she was too fearful of the repercussions were she to stop of boyfriend from viciously beating the 5-year-old before forcing her to perform military exercises meant for grown men. According to Flatt-Blevins, the court accepted a plea of guilty to causing injury to a child by omission from Kristina because 'they felt her first confession was false, suspected she'd been lured into admitting murder by Castro.' 'The judge jailed her for 50 years but the worst was yet to come – Castro's trial,' the grandmother said. She said: 'I sat in court and watched that monster as he told lie after lie about Kati. He denied killing her, said he was suffering from kidney stones when she died and was 'out of it'. On the stand, Castro (left) referred to 5-year-old Kati as 'disrespectful' and a 'liar' according to her grandmother . Victim? Kristina Earnest was initially handed a 50-year-sentence, but it was later shortened to 18 years after the court decided she, too, was a victim of Castro's abuse . 'He called Kati 'disrespectful,' and a 'liar,' when he took to the stand. This was rubbish. Kati was a lovely little girl, as good as gold.' On the day of her death, Kati had wet herself in the seat of Castro's beloved Mazda sportscar. He punished the little girl by beating her with her airplane. He also punched her with his fist and then stood on her. 'The severe beating damaged her internal organs. He then made her carry out military exercises – exercises meant for grown men,' Flatt-Blevins said. 'It was dreadful. She must have suffered. And all the time her mum watched and did nothing. 'The court was told that later that she said, 'I feel sick', before vomiting. She then got in the bath and died. 'She was killed by the people who were meant to care for her.' After her beating, Kati complained of feeling ill and vomited. She then got into the bathtub, where she died . Kati was found so badly beaten that her spleen had been split in two, according to her grandmother . 'She was killed by the people who were meant to care for her' said Kati's grandmother. Kati is seen here as a baby .","Shelley Flatt-Blevins of Amarillo, Texas has spoken out for the first time about the horrific death endured by her granddaughter Kati Earnest in 2009 .

"Students as young as thirteen are interviewing prospective teachers for jobs in schools. While Victorian schools have been praising the unusual hiring process, the Australian Education Union believes it isn't an appropriate place for the student voice to be heard and the responsibility of the employment of staff should be left to the principal. Peter Hutton, Principal of Templestowe College, has been running with the alternative  hiring system for the past four years. He told Daily Mail Australia that he thinks the process is 'fantastic' and up to 70 percent of the staff at the school have been employed using the unusual hiring method. Peter Hutton (pictured centre), Principal of Templestowe College, has been running with the alternative system of letting students help with the hiring of staff for the past four years . 'Not only do they interview teaching staff but they also interview support staff and even assistant principals,' Mr Hutton said. The students range in ages and Mr Hutton said in the past there have been Year 7 students involved in the selection process. 'The students take it very very seriously. There have been very few occasions where we haven’t agreed as a panel,' he said. 'To be honest if somebody wasn't prepared to be interviewed by students then they wouldn't be a good fit for us anyway. They wouldn't have the right attitude if that was going to be too confrontational for them.' Speaking to Daily Mail Australia Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace said she strongly does not believe students should decide who is employed at Victorian schools. 'We don’t support students being involved in the formal selection process of hiring staff,' Ms Peace said. It has been revealed that students as young a thirteen are involved in an interview process for prospective staff of Victorian schools . Templestowe College in Victoria has been running with the unusual hiring method for the past four years . 'Student’s have an important voice in our schools and they've got a lot to contribute but there are clear procedures that schools have to follow around staff employment and we don’t believe that students actually being on selection panels making decisions about the appointment of staff is appropriate.' Ms Peace said that the students may have the best intentions but they do not possess the skills or expertise necessary to able to make such a judgement. 'Students through no fault of their own haven't developed the skills and knowledge needed. The selection process Is pretty rigorous and it requires people with an understanding of how that works,' she said. 'Teachers do have to have good rapport and relationships with students but that’s something that’s tested in the selection procedures and application interview and the referees.' Principal Hutton said the prospective employee is firstly taken into a room with three adults members of the panel. The person is interviewed and then sent into another room to face a selection of students. The panel of students is chaired by a senior student, who has had experience in interviewing. He said the interviewees are told before they arrive that they will be questioned by students at the school during their interview. The school has trained nearly 50 students to be interviewers. Firstly the students explore exactly what qualities they would like in a teacher. Then they divide up into small groups and work out some appropriate questions that will give them an estimation as to how suitable the applicant will be for the job. The students' interview with the prospective employee usually last about 15 minutes. Tess Shacklock (left) and Kyle Meredith-Peck (right) spoke to Daily Mail Australia about their involvement in the interview process . The students are allowed to ask the interviewee a range of questions and their time with the person ususally lasts about 15 minutes . 'I never fail to be impressed by their honesty,' Mr Hutton said. 'Some of the comments that I've heard expressed today by members of the public (about the hiring method) just shatter me at the lack of faith that they have in students. 'I think when you treat students respectfully and get them to be involved in their own education they actually move up to that standard not lower their standard.' Tess Shacklock from the Victorian Student Representative Council sits on a selection panel that is part of the hiring process at Templestowe College. She believes the process helps to build a strong student-teacher relationship as makes it easier for students to develop a connection with the new member of staff. She said a normal interview technique would be to ask the interviewee a scenario question. An example of one would be to ask how that person would react to a student acting out in a class affecting the environment for other students . 'Asking questions like that we’d receive a more open-ended and extended answer, which gives you a better insight into how that individual would teach,' Ms Shacklock said. 'It’s a great example of student voice and the fact that we’re actually heard on issues that do actually matter to our education.' Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Meredith Peace said she strongly does not believe students should decide who is employed at Victorian schools . The 17-year-old who is in Year 12 at the school said she can't understand why people would think students should not be involved in the hiring process. 'We are just as capable as a teacher is to interview a fellow teacher. We have all the experience of being in a classroom and observing what it’s like to teach and what’s it like to be taught, so why wouldn't we be on the panel that decides who will be our teacher,' she said. 'We want to get the most out of our education and that means we want someone who is qualified, someone who is capable and someone who is approachable.' 13-year-old Kyle Meredith-Peck, who is also on the selection panel at Templestowe College, believes that students gain more respect for their teachers after becoming involved in selecting them for employment. 'The best thing is to get a balance between respect, kindness and knowledge. I think if you can balance that out you’re going to get really good teachers,' he said. Both Tess and Kyle agree that the top traits they look for in a prospective teacher are for them to be; approachable, knowledgeable, kindness and respect. An Education Department of NSW spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that the practice of involving students in employment processes does not exist in public schools in the state.","Students in Victoria are getting involved in the hiring of their teachers .
The Australian Education Union is opposed to the method .
Templestowe College has been using the practice for four years .

"A Republican congressman accused of sexual harassment is denying charges levied at him in court by a former aide who says she is a victim of gender discrimination. The ex-staffer, Lauren Greene, who was admittedly fired, alleged in a December a court filing that Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold told another staff member that he had 'sexual fantasies' and 'wet dreams' about Greene. Greene also claimed that the married congressman and father of two 'regularly drank to excess' and it was a topic of concern in the office that Farenthold 'a tendency to flirt'-  especially with redheads. Innocent? Texas Rep. Blake Farenthold says he didn't tell his assistant that he had 'sexual fantasies' and 'wet dreams' about his then-communications director, Lauren Greene . The Plantiff: Lauren Greene, an ex-staffer for Farenthold, claims the married congressman and father of two 'regularly drank to excess' when she worked for him. and it was a topic of concern in the office that Farenthold 'a tendency to flirt'- especially with redheads - when he was drunk . Formerly the communications director for Farenthold, Greene claims the congressman and his chief of staff created a 'hostile work environment' and she was later wrongfully terminated. She's asking for back pay and compensation for emotional distress. In the process of lodging her complaint against the congressman's office over the circumstances surrounding her departure from his staff, she accused the congressman of inappropriate behavior ranging from discussions about his sex life with staff and and sexually-charged commentary about her attire. The court document asserts that Farenthold once told his staff about a 'female lobbyist had propositioned him for a ""threesome."" ' Greene also claims he said he and his wife Debbie were 'estranged' and had not had sex in some years. In one instance of alleged sexual harassment, Greene claimed her former employer suggested she might have semen on her skirt. On another occasion Greene says Farenthold, responding to a complaint that her shirt was 'transparent' and her nipples were showing, told another staffer that Greene 'could show her nipples whenever she wanted to.' Once the congressman commented that Greene's skirt was unzipped, the lawsuit claims, but the 'opening was so small that Farenthold would have had to be staring at her closely to notice.' In a 14-page response filed in court last Friday, an attorney for Farenthold's office denied most of Greene's allegations, including all claims that the congressman was sexually attracted to Greene and made passes at her and that staff found his behavior concerning. Farenthold said its true he 'occasionally complimented' Greene on her appearance but he also praised other women and men in the office for their appearance from time to time as well. And while he did once comment that her skirt was unzippped, Farenthold flat out rejects the claim that he on another occasion made a joke about Green possibly having semen on her skirt. Furthermore, the court filing states, he did make any other tasteless comments about Greene's work. When she showed up to work once 'in a shirt and bra that were made of such flimsy fabric that [her] nipples were visible,' she was notified by a female staffer that she was dressed appropriately. Family Man: Congressman Farenthold is pictured here, from left to right, with his wife Debbie, and daughters Morgan and Amanda . Taking a shot back at Greene, the court document claims that multiple staffers in Greene's old congressional office noticed that 'on a number of occasions [she] would report to work with an extensive amount of animal hair on her clothing. While the three-term congressman's office acknowledged that 'some staff occasionally joked that Rep. Farenthold finds redheads attractive,' it claimed it wasn't a source of concern for staff. Farenthold also admitted that he did regale a tale about an offer to have a threesome,' except denies that the woman...was a lobbyist and denies the allegation's implication that Rep. Farenthold told his staff about the proposition for an improper or lascivious purpose.' Greene, the court document implied, is merely a disgruntled staffer who was fired over her 'poor performance' as communications directer and her 'failure to report to work and appear for multiple media events.' The Texas lawmaker's office claims that Greene was fired a day after it was discovered that she lied about the reason for her absence. Farenthold came under fire weeks before his election to Congress in 2010 for a photo he took with blonde a model in lingerie at a Texas nightclub  while attending a friend's birthday-fundraiser . Farenthold was first elected to Congress in 2010. Just after Greene filed her suit in December, the Huffington Post discovered comments left by Farenthold between 2006 and 2010 on a website for frequent flyers deriding his wife and in which he derided his wife, joked about infidelity and told a story about a flight attendant worrying she'd overserved him alcoholic beverages. Talking about upgrades, Farenthold  wrote, according to HuffPo, that 'Pregnant wife in [business class] with me in [economy] = waste of 9 hours of free booze' and 'Pregnant wife in [economy] with me in [business class] = waste of 9 MONTHS of my happiness.' In another thread, Farenthold noted that he is allowed reallocate his upgraded seat or keep it for himself. 'I can give it to my wife if I like, or if I'm traveling alone the hot redhead in 12B in hopes of......' he wrote. Farenthold also came under fire weeks before his election to Congress for a photo he took with blonde a model in lingerie at a Texas nightclub during a friend's birthday-fundraiser. She wore black negligee while he donned blue pajamas covered in yellow ducks. Still, he went on to win on to win November's election, and has been reelected two times since in the heavily Republican district.","She also claimed the married congressman and father of two 'regularly drank to excess' and had 'a tendency to flirt'- especially with redheads .

"Rock samples that date three quarters of the way back to the birth of our planet suggest life may have flourished on early Earth. Chemical evidence hints that early microbes may have ‘crawled’ out of the ocean and lived on land by 'pulling' nitrogen from the air 3.2 billion years ago. It was previously thought that the ability to use atmospheric nitrogen to support more widespread life appeared much later - roughly two billion years ago. Rock samples  that date three quarters of the way back to the birth of our planet, suggest life was flourishing on early Earth 3.2 billion years ago, researchers claim. The oldest samples came from a site in north western Australia (pictured) While life can exist without oxygen, it needs nitrogen to build genes - essential to viruses, bacteria and all other organisms. Without it, life on Earth would have been scarce. 'People always had the idea that the really ancient biosphere was just tenuously clinging on to this inhospitable planet, and it wasn't until the emergence of nitrogen fixation that suddenly the biosphere become large and robust and diverse,’ explained Roger Buick, professor of Earth and space sciences at the University of Washington. ‘Our work shows that there was no nitrogen crisis on the early Earth, and therefore it could have supported a fairly large and diverse biosphere.’ Researchers analysed some of the oldest and best-preserved rocks on the planet. The samples ranged in age from 2.75 to 3.2 billion years old and were collected in South Africa and north western Australia, according to the study published in Nature. Chemical evidence hints that early microbes may have ‘crawled’ out of the ocean and lived on land by pulling nitrogen out of the air 3.2 billion years ago. A stock image of a mixture of microbes is shown . The rocks were formed from sediment deposited on continental margins, so are free from chemical irregularities that would occur near a subsea volcano, for example. They also formed before the atmosphere gained oxygen, roughly 2.3 to 2.4 billion years ago, and therefore preserve chemical clues that have disappeared in modern rocks. The oldest samples showed chemical evidence that life was pulling nitrogen out of the air. A prehistoric sea creature living almost 250 million years ago, which was discovered near Shanghai in China, is believed to be the first amphibious ichthyosaur - reptiles that could live both in and out of the water. The predators roamed Earth at the time of the dinosaurs and moved to the water after starting out as land creatures. However, there were no fossils marking this transition until the new species was unearthed. The ancient marine reptile called Cartorhynchus lenticarpus, with seal-like flippers, may have been adapted to life on the land as well as in the sea, scientists believe. They are thought to have had terrestrial ancestors, but previously no fossils had come to light marking the transition of ichthyosaurs from land to sea. At 1.5ft (0.46 metres) long, Cartorhynchus lenticarpus was also the smallest known ichthyosaur, meaning fish lizard. The ratio of heavier to lighter nitrogen atoms fits the pattern of nitrogen-fixing enzymes contained in single-celled organisms, but does not match any chemical reactions that occur in the absence of life. Lead author Eva Stüeken said: ‘Imagining that this really complicated process is so old, and has operated in the same way for 3.2 billion years, I think is fascinating. ‘It suggests that these really complicated enzymes apparently formed really early, so maybe it's not so difficult for these enzymes to evolve’ Previous genetic analysis of nitrogen-fixing enzymes placed their origin at between 1.5 and 2.2 billion years ago. Professor Buick said: ‘This is hard evidence that pushes it back a further billion years.’ Fixing nitrogen means breaking a tenacious triple bond, which holds nitrogen atoms in pairs in the atmosphere, and joining a single nitrogen to a molecule that is easier for living things to use. The chemical signature of the rocks suggests that nitrogen was being broken by an enzyme based on molybdenum. Molybdenum is the most common of the three types of nitrogen-fixing enzymes that exist today. Molybdenum is now abundant because oxygen reacts with rocks to wash it into the ocean, but its source on ancient Earth - before the atmosphere contained oxygen to weather rocks - is more mysterious. The authors suggest that its presence may be further evidence that some early life could have existed in single-celled layers on land, exhaling small amounts of oxygen that reacted with the rock to release molybdenum to the water. Professor Buick said: ‘We'll never find any direct evidence of land scum one cell thick, but this might be giving us indirect evidence that the land was inhabited.’ ‘Microbes could have crawled out of the ocean and lived in a slime layer on the rocks on land, even before 3.2 billion years ago.’","Chemical evidence hints early microbes may have moved out of the ocean and lived on land by pulling nitrogen out of the air 3.2 billion years ago .

McLennan appears as an old-fashioned cook in the mock video, using her own appliances which turn out to be her kitchen and her saucepans. On the other hand, McCartney throws a mishmash of ingredients into the Thermomix in the space of a few minutes and relaxes with a bottle of wine. The Thermomix has become a staple in Australian kitchens. It's famous for it's ability to create a full meal out of a plethora of ingredients. It's a blender, steamer, chopper - and according to McCartney, it's a 'gang-bang of appliances that's created a futuristic robot saucepan'. 'It’s like an IVF baby that ends up being a psychopath - you have no choice but to love it,' McCartney says in the video, referring to its $2000 price tag. Sixteen minutes later, while McLennan is still sautéing her onions, McCartney’s Thermomix pings in the background, signifying that her risotto is done.

"Boris Johnson feels he would be well-placed to lead the renegotiation of Britain's membership of the European Union, it was claimed yesterday. If the Conservatives win a second term, it is expected that Mr Johnson would be a cabinet minister when they deliver the promised in-out referendum, by the end of 2017. As a journalist based in Brussels in the early 1990s, he has revealed he would like to use his knowledge of EU politics in the talks, and has 'strong views' about what Britain should push for. Mr Johnson insisted he could not take on the responsibility because he will be London Mayor until next year, but it will fuel speculation he is looking for some role in the future EU talks. Boris Johnson has revealed he would like to use his knowledge of EU politics in the talks, and has 'strong views' about what Britain should push for . He is set to return to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the General Election on May 7, and would be a front-runner in any future battle for the Tory leadership. Pushing for a role in Brussels could put him on a collision course with chancellor George Osborne who is understood to be positioning himself for a move to the Foreign Office after the election. The Mayor, who was on a week-long tour of the US last week, has also revealed he will renounce his dual American citizenship, which he was entitled to when he was born in New York. This will be widely seen as clearing a possible hurdle in running for the leadership of his party, whether it comes up after the election or at some point in a second term of Tory government. It will also help him avoid future tax bills from the US authorities, after recently settling a capital gains tax bill in the US on the sale of his London home, said to have been around £30,000. If Mr Cameron continues as Prime Minister after the General Election, Mr Johnson is widely tipped non-departmental cabinet role, such as party chairman, until his term as Mayor ends in May 2016 . If Mr Cameron continues as Prime Minister after the General Election, Mr Johnson is widely tipped non-departmental cabinet role, such as party chairman, until his term as Mayor ends in May 2016. But his surprise new ambition to drive a hard bargain for Britain in the EU was only revealed by sources close to him this weekend. One said he saw himself as a 'lead negotiator' and would ask for the job if it were not for his Mayoral duties. Speaking on his US trip, Mr Johnson said: 'I have strong views about how a renegotiation could happen. I'd be very happy to help. I think there's a deal to be done. If I wasn't happily lashed to my oar as mayor of London, I would do it.' A source told the Sunday Times: 'Boris could usefully offer informal advice about how to do it. He knows the scene very well. If he wasn't mayor, he would put himself forward.' On the trip, he met presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, congressmen and senators, who he said had urged Mr Cameron to keep defence spending at 2pc of GDP in a future government. This spending commitment has not yet been promised, but Mr Johnson said the message from his US counterparts is that 'they certainly want to see that'. It is his second foreign trip since the start of the year, having already visited Kurdistan to meet British service personnel training up the local Peshmerga forces fighting Islamic State. He said the trip was to drum up investment for London, but it will also burnish his credentials as an international statesman. Mr Johnson said in 2013 that Britain should be prepared to 'walk away' from Europe if the Prime Ministers fails to negotiate a good deal. He has also backed calls to hold the referendum as soon as possible – as early as next year. He said this week: 'Let's get it done and knock it on the head and do it for the good of Europe.

"A mother whose daughter was killed in a car crash exactly one year ago has had her child's ashes mixed with ink and tattooed onto her wrist. Maria Williams, 41, from Tredegar in South Wales, says the inking means she can carry her daughter Sophie with her 'always'. Sophie, who was just 20 years old, was pregnant with her second child when she was killed in a  collision on Valentine's Day last year. Memories: Maria Williams, 41, has had her daughter's ashes mixed with ink and tattooed onto her wrist . Although doctors tried to save mother and child, both died at the scene, while her boyfriend Ben Morgan, who was driving at the time, was left badly hurt. Mrs Williams, who was also pregnant at the time of the accident, has gone on to have another daughter of her own and had hoped to raise the child, named Sasha, alongside her granddaughter. 'I believe everything has happened for a reason,' she says. 'We miss Sophie dreadfully but she was taken to a better place. 'For us, Valentine’s Day means broken hearts. We will remember her always.' Mrs William's sons Shane, 18, and Skyle, 15, have also had tattoos made using Sophie's ashes etched onto their bodies, in both cases a drama mask. Tribute: The tattoo, left, is a tribute to Mrs Williams' daughter Sophie, right, who was killed in a car accident . Best friend: Mrs Williams says the tattoo allows her to carry her 'best friend' with her always . Tragic: Sophie was  pregnant with her second child when she was killed on Valentine's Day 2014 . According to Mrs Williams, the tattoos were chosen because Sophie loved acting, while her own three roses represent the 20-year-old's favourite flower. Despite having the tattoo, Mrs Williams says she will never get over her daughter's death but admits the birth of new baby Sasha has brought some happiness back into her life. 'I’ve had my baby now, a little girl called Sasha,' she says. 'Every day I think about the little niece she should be growing up with.' Sophie, who was already mother to a two-year-old daughter named Mia, was coming home after a romantic supper when Mr Morgan lost control of the car. Mr Morgan is now raising the little girl alone. 'Nothing will ever be the same,' adds Mrs Williams. 'Sophie was more than just my daughter, she was my best friend.'

"Brian the horse will probably be able to keep his name after a public outcry from other Brians . A one-tonne, 6ft-tall police horse called Brian is set to keep his name, despite fears it needs to be called something tougher to face rioters. Thames Valley Police said Brian is an unsuitable name for a horse and mooted calling the six-year-old something more 'war-like', such as Hercules or Caesar. But the force has now backed down, following protests from other men called Brian, who said the possible change would be a slur on their good name. A spokesman for the force said: 'Following a lot of protests, it looks like Brian may keep his name.' Brian Belo, the winner of Big Brother series eight, said 'This is a victory for Brians everywhere. 'It's a solid name and a strong name - think of Monty Python's The Life of Brian, about Jesus. 'I think it's a marvellous name for a horse, it's a friendly name, you would want to be kept safe by a Brian.' The force had admitted that its usual policy was to give their horses 'macho' names such as Thor or Odin. One mare called Mary became Luna, and another horse called Red became Trojan, it said. But dozens of Brians soon began posting comments about the name online, questioning why it was not 'strong enough' for a horse. It led to a growing campaign, with many using the hashtag #IamBrian to show their support to the horse. Among those who complained was Brian Lewis from Ascot, who said: 'I think it's outrageous. Brian is a good name for a horse.' And Brian Poulson, from Bracknell in Berkshire, said he was 'appalled' at the police name-change plan. 'There is no way they should be changing it...every horse should be called Brian!' The shire horse must now pass six weeks of training before he is kept on by the force. The tests include Brian going out on patrol in town centres and tests to see if he can cross bridges and trot through underpasses. Thames Valley Police had said the horse (pictured) would be given a more 'war-like' name such as Hercules . Thames Valley Police encouraged other Brians  to discuss the name saga, using the hashtag #IAmBrian . The force originally said that, if he passed the test, Brian would be scratched from the records and replaced with a more 'fitting' name.

But a force spokesman told MailOnline today that Brian was not certain to keep his name but that it was 'likely'. He said the decision would be made once the horse has passed his training. Brian was chosen from The Stables Equestrian Centre in Wilstead, Bedfordshire, where he had been since 2013. He has been taken on to replace Pluto, a seven-year-old shire horse, who suffered from peritonitis and died suddenly in his stables six months ago. PC Kirsty Wilson, of the Mounted Section, said Brian is so far doing well in the tests. She said: 'He has seen a lot of hazards - things you would expect to scare normal horses. 'With a horse, even pushchairs can be a hazard because they are not something they would normally see on a regular basis. 'A horse can have many personality changes in a six-week period, but so far Brian has not put a hoof wrong.' She added: 'I am 50/50 with him at the moment. He is certainly on his way and so far he has not given us any reason to doubt him, but it is very early days.'","6ft-tall horse is undergoing six weeks of training with Thames Valley Police .

"This is the shocking moment a police officer slammed a handcuffed man's head onto a custody suite desk, leaving him needing stitches in an attack that led to a £13,000 damages pay-out. Mark Cheesman was taken to Birkenhead police station in Merseyside, after he was arrested in 2010, accused of running in between traffic. CCTV footage taken from the station's custody suite shows that as Mr Cheesman protested his innocence, he was grabbed by constable Gregory Hawkswell. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage taken at Birkenhead police station shows the moment Mark Cheesman was grabbed by Pc Gregory Hawkswell and his head was slammed into the custody suite desk . His head was forced onto the desk, leaving him bleeding from wound on his chin and requiring stitches. The footage emerged as Merseyside Police agreed to pay £13,200 in damages to Mr Cheesman, from Tranmere, Merseyside. The force settled out of court after legal action was launched over the alleged unlawful assault but it did not admit liability and Pc Hawkswell was cleared of assault. Mr Cheesman was 23 in 2010 when he was arrested outside the Beach bar, in Birkenhead, and accused of running in between traffic, which he denied. He was handcuffed by Pc Hawkswell and arrested. The footage, from the police station cameras, shows Mr Cheesman taken to the custody desk to be checked in by the custody sergeant. As Mr Cheesman protested his innocence, he was grabbed by Pc Hawkswell. Merseyside Police has not admitted liability for incident, and the officer was cleared of assault . He was told to stop swearing after protesting that he had 'done nothing f****** wrong'. Handcuffed Mr Cheesman is seen to turn away from the custody sergeant to briefly look at Pc Hawkswell, and at that point, the officer grabs him and forces his head on to the desk. Mr Cheesman was later taken to hospital for stitches before being handed a fixed penalty notice the following day. Pc Hawkswell was charged with assault but found not guilty by a jury in criminal proceedings in 2011. He claimed he had feared for his safety. In defence documents the officer said: 'At the custody desk, Cheesman refused to face the custody sergeant, preferring to face myself instead, which I believed to be a threat. I attempted to lead Cheesman back to face the sergeant, at which point he became tense and attempted to rear at me. 'I applied force to the handcuffs and forced him down towards the desk in order to regain control of him. Mr Cheesman, who has been awarded £13,200  after Merseyside Police settled his damages claim, was left with a cut on his chin and required stitches . 'I believe that, as a result, Cheesman suffered a cut to his chin from a fixed sign on the custody desk.' Mr Cheesman's law firm, Bootle-based James Murray Solicitors, said the video showed that PC Hawkswell's account 'clearly was not plausible'. 'Mr Cheesman was in handcuffs, he was a young man of exemplary good character, had done nothing wrong and the video shows that,' said Mr Cheeman's lawyer, Lee Massingham. Mr Cheesman claimed false imprisonment, trespass to person, personal injury, aggravated and exemplary damages. Merseyside Police settled the claim for £13,200, plus costs, just weeks before a civil trial was due to start at Liverpool county court. The force has not accepted liability. Mr Massingham said: 'Viewing the footage of the incident that took place in the custody suite was very distressing for both Mr Cheesman and his family. 'It is absolutely paramount the public are made aware that they do not have to accept such treatment by police officers. 'Mr Cheesman is a man of good character and was not only subjected to a serious assault by an acting police officer but was also unlawfully arrested. 'It is disappointing that it took so long for the matter to resolve favourably for Mr Cheesman, but it is hoped that he can now move on with his life.' A force spokesman said: 'Merseyside Police considered this civil action and it was examined by the force's legal team. 'The force can confirm that it sought appropriate advice and that a settlement amount was negotiated before trial. 'Merseyside Police remains absolutely committed to the highest integrity and the professional standards of its officers at all times.'","Mark Cheesman was taken to Birkenhead police station after arrest in 2010 .

"Hope: The breakthrough could pave the way for a treatment routinely taken by middle-aged people to stop dementia in its tracks (file image) Scientists have discovered the key to stopping Alzheimer’s disease in its earliest stages. The breakthrough paves the way for a ‘statin-like’ drug that could be taken by millions to prevent dementia. Cambridge University researchers have found a naturally occurring molecule that can slow the formation of plaques in the brain. Amyloid plaques are closely associated with declining memory and other Alzheimer’s symptoms. The discovery raises the prospect of a treatment which could be routinely taken in middle age to stop dementia. It could even result in a pill that could be used to treat dementia in the same way that statins are used to prevent heart disease today. Lead author Dr Samuel Cohen told the Daily Mail last night: ‘This is the starting point for finding a drug that stops Alzheimer’s disease in its tracks. It might be used when the first symptoms appear. But another potential approach is that people would take it as a preventative drug.’ The condition affects more than 830,000 people in the UK. The research, published in the journal Nature Structural and Molecular Biology, is the first to reveal how the specific molecule can slow the formation of plaques in the brain. Amyloid plaques are created when fibrils – tiny toxic threads of protein – wrap around nerve cells in the brain and form clumps which scientists believe interfere with brain functions. The Cambridge researchers, who worked with collaborators in Sweden and Estonia, found that molecules of Brichos – part of a family of proteins that occur naturally in human lungs – can slow the process. Tests on mice showed that the molecules stick to the fibrils and stop them forming more plaques, halting their spread in the brain. Dr Cohen, of St John’s College, Cambridge, said that the findings open up new avenues for dementia research. The molecules themselves are not suitable for use in pills as they would not survive the digestive process. Understanding: The research is the first to reveal the way a naturally-occurring molecule can slow the formation of plaques in the brain. These plaques are closely associated with declining memory and other symptoms of Alzheimer’s (a brain ravaged by the disease is pictured) But Dr Cohen said many similar proteins may be more suited for use as a drug. ‘There may well be lots of other molecules like this – we just have not been looking until now because it was not clear what to look for,’ he said. If a suitable molecule is discovered, it could open the way to a drug that can wipe out the damaging plaques as soon as they start to appear. Dr Cohen said: ‘People could take them in their 60s to stop these proteins grouping together, well before the symptoms appear, which would reduce the risk of developing the devastating effects of this disease.’ The study was welcomed last night by health charities who said it promised to reduce the ‘catastrophic effect’ of dementia. Dr Laura Phipps of Alzheimer’s Research UK said: ‘This study has revealed clues to how to block one important chain of events in the disease.’ Dr Doug Brown of the Alzheimer’s Society added: ‘This revelation is exciting as it gives scientists a whole new way of looking at the problem, opening the doors to possible new treatments.’ £30million is to be spent to set up a network of dementia research centres. The Drug Discovery Institutes will employ 90 scientists. Alzheimer’s Research UK said the move would help to address the ‘desperate lack of effective treatments for the condition’.","Study is 'starting point for drug that stops Alzheimer's in its tracks'

"While President Obama flew to California for a few rounds of golf this weekend, his wife and daughters headed to Aspen for a secret trip - but it didn't stay secret for long. The trio arrived in Colorado on Friday and would've stayed under the radar had it not been for a car crash and some eagle-eyed Instagrammers. A police report from Sunday revealed that a motorcade carrying Michelle Obama and her girls was forced to stop when it came across a two car collision, the Aspen Daily News reported. One driver, who was from South Africa, had mistakenly driven in the wrong lane and a second driver, who was blinded by sunshine, was unable to avoid him, according to the report. Hitting the slopes: Michelle Obama, pictured skiing in Aspen in 2014, returned to the same slopes this weekend for a brief ski trip with her daughters. It is the fourth consecutive year she has visited the area . They hit head-on at 30 mph just before 8am, but both drivers walked away without injuries. The road was closed for around 40 minutes - but not for the Obamas. The presidential motorcade arrived at the scene and authorities let them 'sneak through while they waited on tow trucks,' said Police Chief Brian Olson. Pitkin County Sheriff's deputy Jesse Steindler told the paper that the rest of the trip went smoothly for the Obamas, who were joined by the Secret Service and a handful of local deputies. 'It was very uneventful,' Steindler said. 'It was very easy duty.' Welcome: After the family arrived on Friday, other travelers shared photos of their plane to Instagram . Spotted: Instagram users shared snaps of Michelle Obama's plane on the tarmac on Monday . Mrs Obama and her daughters Malia and Sasha, who have spent the three previous Presidents' Day weekends in Aspen, skied at Buttermilk on Saturday, he added. He would not say where they stayed but in the past, they have spent the weekend at the home of Jim and Paula Crown, who own the Aspen Skiing Co. The First Family were photographed after landing on Friday by Instagrammers, who shared images of her Air Force jet after it parked on the tarmac. 'As we were departing Aspen Michelle Obama and the girls were coming in to ski the weekend for President's Day,' one Instagram user, Keith Crews, wrote. 'Hoping to catch a lift home with #FLOTUS - but she's not answering my text,' another, Ken Fulk, wrote alongside a picture of the plane on Monday afternoon.

The man then continued: 'You look old Sarah. Put some clothes on Sarah,' to which she retorted: 'When you get a job, you can talk to me.' As she walked away, another person said: 'Good luck in Iowa, no one is going to vote for you.' During the encounter with fans one complimented her mini- dress.

"An illegal cigarette stash worth £11,000 was discovered inside a hidden compartment at a convenience shop, which could be revealed at the flick of the switch. The haul of smuggled cigarettes were found at the Supersam Mini Market in Handsworth, Birmingham, with most of them hidden behind a fake roof. Trading Standards officers, who stormed the shop with police and specialist sniffer dogs, also found hundreds of packets hidden in a hole underneath an ice cream freezer, and rolling tobacco concealed inside a kettle. A fake cigarette gang was caught hiding their stash of illegal tobacco in this hidden compartment at the Supersam Mini Market in Birmingham, which could be revealed at the flick of the switch . They found the secret roof space, which was fitted with electro magnets and a hidden switch - when they started stripping back the ceiling of the cellar. In total, they discovered 698 packs of cigarettes in the roof, 339 packs hidden under the freezer and 203 pouches of rolling tobacco, nine of which were in the kettle. The haul was the second largest ever found in Birmingham, and as a result of the find the owners of the convenience store have lost their licence to sell alcohol. Trading standards officer Chris Perry told a meeting of Birmingham City Council's licensing sub-committee that the estimated retail costs of the cigarettes would have been £10,957.50. 'This is a very large seizure for such a small shop,' he said. Trading Standards officers and police discovered 698 packs of cigarettes hidden inside the roof . 'It’s probably one of the biggest finds we have had in this area and is the second biggest we have had at a retail premises in the city. 'This was a highly sophisticated concealment which involved electro magnets and a hidden switch. 'Because it was such a large find we think that they were also being supplied to other shops in the area. 'We firmly believe that they knew exactly what they were doing because of the extensive efforts to conceal the products.' Despite the tobacco find the committee heard there had been no issues at the shop around the sale of alcohol. Keith Thomas, representing owner Salam Salih, had argued for suspension and licence conditions instead of revocation. He said: 'Small businesses are tempted time and again by people offering the sale of these cigarettes. The haul was the second largest ever found in Birmingham, and as a result of the find the owners of the convenience store (pictured) have lost their licence to sell alcohol . Another 339 packs of cigarretes were found hidden in this hole underneath an ice cream freezer . 'Unfortunately he has made an error and he wholeheartedly accepts the foolish mistake he has made. 'He is embarrassed. He did give into temptation and he fully accepts that he used those areas to conceal them. 'On the sale of alcohol it’s very evident that he has been nothing other than compliant. 'The cellar roof and the hole in the floor were in place when he took over the shop in 2009 and he has now sealed them up and permanently covered them. 'He does not believe that the response should be to remove his licence and ultimately his business.' Sub-committee chairman, Councillor Alex Buchanan said the shop should be barred from selling alcohol. 'The sub-committee has determined that the concealment of the tobacco warrants revocation in order to prevent crime and disorder,' he said. 'In relation to the sophisticated level of concealment, that does not equate squarely with the points raised on his behalf that he gave in to temptation, otherwise a small amount would have been found. 'He could still operate as a mini market without an alcohol licence.' Speaking after the hearing, Councillor Barbara Dring, chairman of the council's licensing and public protection committee, said: 'Salam Salih has shown a flagrant disregard for the law in the way he runs his shop. 'The business had gone to great lengths to conceal the illicit cigarettes and tobacco, which cannot legally be sold in the UK.'","Smuggled cigarettes worth nearly £11,000 found at Birmingham shop .

"The Tories have surged into a four-point lead as Labour’s woes with business hit home with voters, a poll showed last night. Support for the Conservatives rose by six points during the past month following Ed Miliband’s high-profile clashes with business leaders, the ICM poll for the Guardian found. It put the Conservatives on 36 per cent – just a point down from their 2010 general election result – Labour on 32 and the Liberal Democrats on 10. Scroll down for video . Conservative gains: David Cameron’s party has jumped six points to 36 per cent - just one point short of what he achieved at the 2010 General Election . The Tories’ showing is their highest since May 2012 and will cause alarm at Labour high command. The poll, conducted from February 13-15, put support for Ukip down by two points to 9 per cent. It suggests that voters who have flirted with Ukip are beginning to return to the Tory fold ahead of the general election. Support for the Greens also fell by two points. Last night Labour faced fresh controversy over the economy after shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said British businesses should learn from their counterparts in France. Unemployment in France is almost double the rate in the UK, and economic growth was just 0.4 per cent last year compared to 2.6 per cent here. But Mr Umunna insisted the French model had lessons to offer, particularly on productivity, which is higher than in the UK. David Cameron's Tories have moved four points clear of Ed Miliband's Labour after a surge in support just 80 days out from the election . Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘People will be alarmed that Labour’s vision for the economy is that we should be more like France – in plain English that means mass unemployment, excessive borrowing and economic failure. Nigel Farage has seen Ukip slip behind the Lib Dems in the polls . ‘Why would we want to go back to where we were five short years ago with Labour?’ Only last week, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch warned that a weak Labour government was likely to damage investor confidence and economic growth. The giant investment bank told clients that a Labour victory could ‘trigger, ultimately, a deterioration in potential GDP growth. In a nutshell, the UK would look increasingly like France.’ Two other surveys gave Labour a narrow lead. One commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft put Mr Miliband’s party unchanged on 31 per cent, regaining their lead over the Tory Party which dropped four points to 30. A Populus poll had Labour down one point on 33 per cent, keeping a lead over the Tories, who were unchanged on 31.

He said all firms winning major government contracts would have to provide apprenticeships, and confirmed Labour would cancel a planned cut in corporation tax to fund a cut in business rates.","David Cameron’s party has jumped six points to 36%, according to ICM .

"Two Islamic terrorists who plotted mass murder claim their human rights were violated when they were segregated in jail after they were accused of trying to dictate the faith of other prisoners. Ricin plot conspirator Kamel Bourgass and 'liquid bomber' Tanvir Hussain have today taken their legal battle to the Supreme Court. It follows a ruling in March 2012 when they failed to persuade appeal judges that their treatment was unlawful. They were alleged to have intimidated and bullied other inmates over matters of faith, so the authorities in their respective jails decided to separate them from other prisoners 'for good order and discipline'. Terrorists: Kamel Bourgass and Tanvir Hussain, left and right, have today taken their legal battle to the Supreme Court claiming their segregation in prison was unlawful . Both men denied accusations that they tried to influence and dictate the beliefs of other prisoners. Their QC Dinah Rose told the Supreme Court today: 'The issue in these appeals is one of fairness.' She said: 'Fairness requires that prisoners should be provided with sufficient information about the reasons and evidence relied on to justify the initial decision to segregate them, and their continuing segregation, so as to enable them to make meaningful and effective representations in their defence. Killer: Bourgass, an Algerian,  is also serving a life sentence for murdering Detective Constable Stephen Oake, 40, pictured with a kitchen knife during his 2003 arrest at a flat in Manchester . 'Fairness also requires that, at least once it is apparent that the segregation is not simply a short-term measure, prisoners should be afforded the opportunity to challenge the decision to segregate them before a body that is independent of the prison, and which is empowered to determine whether the factual case against them is made out and whether their continued segregation is justified.' Bourgass, an Algerian, is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives in relation to the 2002 Ricin terrorist plot. He is also serving a life sentence for murdering Detective Constable Stephen Oake, 40, with a kitchen knife during his 2003 arrest at a flat in Manchester. He injured four other officers during that attack and is serving sentences for attempted murder of two officers and wounding a third. Hussain was one of three men convicted of a plot to launch suicide attacks on flights from Heathrow to America and Canada using liquid bombs made of hydrogen peroxide hidden in soft drink bottles. He is serving life with a minimum tariff of 32 years. While detained at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire, Bourgass was segregated from March 10 2010 until April 22 and again from April 23 until October or November of that year. Hussain was segregated at HMP Frankland in County Durham from April 24 2010 until October 2010. Ms Rose told Supreme Court president Lord Neuberger, Lady Hale and Lords Sumption, Reed and Hodge that neither man was provided with adequate reasons or information concerning the evidence relied on to justify their initial or continued segregation. They were 'not informed of what they were required to do in order for their segregation to end, and were not afforded the opportunity to challenge the relevant decisions before an independent body'. Hearing: The Supreme Court in London has set aside two days to consider if the dangerous prisoners were badly treated . She argued that 'in the circumstances', the decisions to segregate them and to continue that segregation were 'unlawful'. Ms Rose told the court: 'In each case there was said to be a suspicion that the appellants had been involved in assaults on other prisoners. 'In neither case was there sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges or sustain internal prison disciplinary charges against them.' Both men, she said, were held in segregation in different prisons for approximately six months and during that time they were locked alone in a cell for 23 hours a day and permitted only one hour of exercise a day, 'which had to be taken alone in a cage'. The QC submitted that there were a number of reasons why 'stringent standards of fairness must be applied', including the serious effects of segregation on prisoners, particularly when it was prolonged. 'It is accepted that segregation carries a high risk of deterioration in mental health, and that after the segregation has continued for a period in excess of two weeks there is a risk of irreparable damage to the prisoner,' she said. In February 2011 a High Court judge said the procedures adopted to place them in, and keep them in, segregation did not breach their common law rights, or their rights under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights to fair treatment. During a new two-day hearing the justices will also hear argument on behalf of the Justice Secretary and the Howard League for Penal Reform. The case continues. Kamel Bourgass . Suspected Al Qaeda Bourgass was plotting to use the deadly poison ricin and murdered of a Special Branch detective during his arrest . Kamel Bourgass, then a 31-year-old failed Algerian asylum seeker, turned a Manchester flat into a bloodbath as he was cornered by police. He grabbed a kitchen knife and killed Detective Constable Stephen Oake, stabbing him eight times. He also knifed three other policemen during his bloody escape bid. At the time Bourgass, who was also known as Nadir Habra, was on the run after his attempts to make ricin and other poisons were discovered at a flat in Wood Green, north London, in a raid by anti-terrorist police nine days earlier. Detectives believe he had been trained in terror camps in Afghanistan run by Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and was specially selected for instruction in making poisons and explosives. According to an alleged co-conspirator, who co-operated with authorities when he was arrested in Algeria, Bourgass was planning to smear poison on the door handles of cars and buildings in the Holloway area of north London. Detectives believe he might also have had plans to use it in spray form or to contaminate consumer products. In the London raid, police found accurate recipes and ingredients for poisons including ricin, cyanide and botulinum - one of the most toxic substances known to man - and the blueprint for a bomb. Tanvir Hussain . Despite his love of clubbing, smoking cannabis and chasing girls, Tanvir Hussain turned to extremism after Britain's invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. After the 7/7 bombings he told a colleague at an NHS clinic at St Anne's Hospital in North London, where he worked as a temp, that Muslims were being persecuted. Born in Blackburn, he moved to London aged six with his Pakistani family. But he joined as gang of Islamic fanatics planned to use liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks to blow at least seven flights out of the sky and cause carnage to rival 9/11 in the U.S. A second phase of the plan included attacks on Canary Wharf skyscrapers, the Greenwich foot tunnel underneath the Thames, nuclear power stations, oil refineries and gas terminals. The discovery of the plot in 2006 brought chaos to international airports as sweeping restrictions were imposed overnight on how much liquid can be taken on to a plane. He was found guilty and jailed in 2009.","Kamel Bourgass and Tanvir Hussain say segregation in jail was unlawful .

"Ed Balls distanced himself from Ed Miliband yesterday as he warned he would crack down on a controversial form of ‘tax abuse’ used by the Labour leader. The Shadow Chancellor twice declined to say whether Mr Miliband had acted morally in signing up to the so-called ‘deed of variation’ on his late father’s will that limited potential inheritance tax liability. Mr Balls vowed that Labour would be ‘the party that will crack down on tax planning.’ Scroll down for video . Shadow Chancellor: Ed Balls (pictured) vowed Labour would be 'the party that will crack down on tax planning' He also distanced himself from the Labour leader’s attempt to personalise the row about tax avoidance by branding individual Tory donors ‘dodgy’. In a further sign of Labour’s difficulties over tax, Mr Balls was embarrassed over a £1.6million donation from shopping channel tycoon John Mills, who gave the money in shares in order to reduce the tax bill. Mr Balls sheepishly described the donation as ‘tax efficient’, and suggested the tax saved was ‘small beer compared to what the Tories get up to’. Labour’s credibility on the issue was further rocked by a series of revelations about the tax affairs of other major donors, including businessmen Sir David Garrard and Dale Vince and business adviser Bill Thomas. 'Open question': Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps (left) has challenged Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) to publish the full details of a so-called 'deed of variation' Mr Miliband, who has positioned himself as a moral arbiter on tax avoidance, came under fire last week over revelations that his family used a deed of variation to limit potential inheritance tax on the family home 20 years ago. The Labour leader insists that he did not benefit from the arrangement and Labour said it was a ‘straightforward lie’ to suggest he had avoided tax. Deeds of variation are entirely legal, but were described as ‘tax abuse’ by Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor. And Mr Balls yesterday ducked questions about whether his leader had acted morally, saying: ‘I think that Ed Miliband paid all the tax which was due.’ Asked whether a Labour review of tax avoidance would examine deeds of variation, Mr Balls told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘We will look at every area of tax law.’ Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps last night challenged Mr Miliband to publish the full details. Wants more to be done: Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable told Sky News yesterday that HM Revenue and Customs was still not doing enough to track down and prosecute the 'big fish' Mr Shapps said: ‘Labour say one thing on tax avoidance, but do another. Last week Ed Miliband criticised the practice, but today Ed Balls has admitted that the party accepts “tax efficient” donations because they “need the money”. Senior Tories have rejected calls for taxpayer funding of political parties, despite controversy over tax avoidance by wealthy donors. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith (pictured right) said voters do not want to pay for electioneering. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps has said state funding of politics is ‘just about the last thing we need’, given the low esteem in which politicians are held by the public. Last week Nick Clegg called for a review of party funding, to take big money from donors and unions out of politics. Yesterday he was backed by Tory ex-chancellor Kenneth Clarke, who said the Conservatives must break their dependence on wealthy donors. David Cameron should ‘put on his tin hat’ and agree to state funding, regardless of any short-term public backlash, he added. But Mr Duncan Smith said France and Germany, where parties receive state money, ‘have all sorts of problems’. He added that taxpayers will ask ‘Why should I spend more money on politicians … particularly politicians I don’t even support?’ ‘There is an open question as to whether Ed Miliband avoided the full inheritance tax liability he owed by using a deed of variation. ‘Now that Ed Balls has said he will look at closing these schemes designed to reduce inheritance tax liabilities, Ed Miliband should publish this document to clear up this matter.’ The deal centres on a £2.4million Georgian terrace house in Primrose Hill. Following the death of Mr Miliband’s father Ralph in 1994, the house was left to his mother Marion. The family used a deed of variation to alter his will to give Mr Miliband and his brother David 20 per cent of the house each. Experts say this would have limited their potential exposure to inheritance tax. Mr Miliband sold his share to his brother in 2004, and said he paid capital gains tax on it. The Labour leader said at the weekend he is ‘not backing down’ in his campaign against tax avoidance but some Labour figures are nervous that the crusade could backfire if it sparks an examination of the tax affairs of big Labour donors and senior Labour politicians. The tax row erupted last week after a number of political donors were named as having accounts with HSBC’s private bank in Switzerland, which is mired in allegations of tax abuse. Mr Miliband accused the former Tory treasurer Lord Fink, who was named in the files, of tax avoidance, and suggested he was a ‘dodgy’ donor – a suggestion he later withdrew. Lord Fink initially threatened to sue, but later acknowledged he had indulged in legal tax avoidance of a modest kind. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable told Sky News yesterday that HM Revenue and Customs was still not doing enough to track down and prosecute the ‘big fish’. Ed Miliband’s bid to make political capital out of the tax avoidance scandal was in free-fall last night, as Labour faced a string of allegations about the tax affairs of its own senior figures. Deputy Political Editor JASON GROVES reports on three donors and close advisers in the spotlight. Dale Vince . The green energy entrepreneur hit the headlines last week after it was announced he is to donate £250,000 to the Labour Party. But he was facing questions about his own tax affairs yesterday after it was reported that he has taken a £3.2million interest-free loan from his company Ecotricity. Tax expert Richard Murphy said the loan, revealed in the firm’s latest accounts, ‘looks to be a tax-avoidance arrangement’. A spokesman for Mr Vince, who has made a £100million fortune from wind farms, said company tax had been paid on the loan, and that Mr Vince (pictured below) had personally paid income tax on the ‘benefit in kind’. Dale Vince: The green energy entrepreneur, who has made a £100million fortune from wind farms, is to donate £250,000 to the Labour Party . Sir David Garrard: The property tycoon has an estimated fortune of £100million . Sir David Garrard . The property tycoon, who has an estimated fortune of £100million, has given more than £1.2million to Labour and lent millions more to the party. Yesterday it was reported that Sir David has had millions of shares in an offshore trust. When he sold his property firm Minerva in 1995, he transferred 16million shares to a Liechtenstein firm acting on behalf of his family trust, with a further 1.8million shares going to a trust company in Jersey. Tax advisers say offshore trusts can be used to avoid tax when the shares are later sold on. A spokesman for Sir David yesterday said there was ‘no irregularity or impropriety in the conduct of his financial affairs’, and that all his transactions had been conducted ‘in full view’ of the UK’s tax authorities. Bill Thomas: Labour's 'small business taskforce' chairman shot to prominence earlier this month . Bill Thomas . The former senior executive with an American computer firm is chairman of Labour’s ‘small business taskforce’. He shot to prominence earlier this month after Ed Balls struggled in vain to remember his name when the Shadow Chancellor was challenged to identify a single businessman who backs Labour. Mr Thomas was yesterday reported to be an investor in Invicta Film Partnership – a controversial scheme of a type that is under investigation by HM Revenue and Customs. Experts claim the schemes operate by funding loss-making films that can be set against tax. There is no suggestion Mr Thomas has acted illegally, and it is not known how much he invested.","Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls will not say if Ed Miliband acted morally .

"Ed Miliband has defended the controversial comedian Russell Brand – insisting that his attacks on democracy are striking a chord with ordinary voters. The Labour leader said he did not agree with Mr Brand's call for people not to vote, but said he was only saying what 'a number of people are thinking'. He said the Hollywood star's message – calling for a revolution against Westminster – reflected the fact that ordinary people felt 'politics doesn't speak to them'. Labour leader Ed Miliband has defended comedian Russell Brand, who he claimed was only saying what a lot of people thought . Mr Miliband's intervention comes despite widespread criticism of Mr Brand's call for young voters to turn their backs on elections. The comic has revealed that he never votes because he regards politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant. He told the BBC: 'I'm angry, because for me it's real. This is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution. 'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.' The comedian said he, like most people, regarded politicians as 'frauds and liars' adding: 'The current political system as nothing more than a bureaucratic means for furthering the augmentation and advantages of economic elites.' Speaking to Shortlist magazine, the Labour leader insisted he wanted people to vote – even if it was for the Tories. He said: 'I definitely want people to vote – and I want people to vote Labour, obviously – but it's really important that we engage people in the election.' But he added: 'People criticise Russell Brand, and I don't agree with his message, but what he's saying, a number of people are thinking. Which is that politics doesn't feel like it speaks to them.' Labour leader Ed Miliband with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls (right) during a visit to Jaguar Land Rover in Wolverhampton today . The Hollywood star sparked controversy after calling on youngsters not to vote in general elections . Mr Miliband insisted he, personally, did not feel disillusioned with politics. He said: 'I'm not disillusioned. I feel incredibly optimistic that we can make a difference to the country. 'And this election really matters. If you think about this election, there's a disagreement about where we are now, because the government thinks it's going pretty well. 'I don't agree. There's disagreement about the future – they've got this plan to go back to the 1930s on public spending.' Mr Miliband's remarks are in stark contrast to David Cameron, who insisted he was glad Mr Brand would not vote and ridiculed his anti-democratic stance. Russell Brand called for a 'revolution' in his book, released last year . The Prime Minister said: 'I'm a democrat. If Russell Brand's got a better idea, he can let us know.' He added: 'I'm relieved he won't be troubling the scorers in my constituency.' It also comes after the Green Party distanced themselves from Mr Brand – insisting they did not want his celebrity endorsement. There had been mounting speculation that the comedian-turned-anarchist – who has worked with leaders of the Left-wing environmental party in recent years – would be unveiled as the 'Green Nigel Farage'. But senior party sources claimed they didn't need an answer to the charismatic Ukip leader. One said that if such an offer were to be made to Mr Brand, it should be declined because his 'controversial' reputation would be 'toxic' to some potential voters. 'It might seem like a good idea for two or three days but I suspect it would quickly turn into a nightmare,' the source added. Last year Green leader Natalie Bennett joined Mr Brand to address 1,200 people at an anti-austerity rally in London. He has also worked with Green MP Caroline Lucas, to get the Commons to debate drug policy. But Ms Bennett said last month that the party did not need 'big personalities' to be a success at the ballot box. She insisted it wanted to concentrate on serious issues and not be led by a person who 'tosses their hair around and waves a pint'. But Caroline Lucas, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, praised Mr Brand. She said: 'I've worked closely with Russell to promote a more evidence-based, effective and humane approach to drugs policy and appreciate all he has done to put the issue on the political agenda. 'He has effectively rattled the cage of Parliament and it is right that he has - MPs need to do far more to regain people's trust and confidence.' A party spokesman added that it and Mr Brand 'both believe there is a positive alternative to austerity economics and recognise that the politics of the future does not have to look like the politics of the past'.","Miliband said he did not agree with Russell Brand's anti-politics 'message'

"A bride was beaten by her new husband on their wedding night because he couldn’t get her dress off, a court heard. Amy Dawson was hurled to the floor and punched repeatedly by Gavin Golightly, who lost his temper after failing to unfasten the garment.

Golightly, 29, pleaded guilty to assaulting her but was spared jail. Miss Dawson, who is divorcing him, said he should have received a tougher sentence. The accountancy student, 22, who has a child with Golightly, said after the hearing: ‘I thought I was going to die. He looked like he was going to kill me. ‘After the attack, he left the room and I tried to escape, but he came back in and continued to beat me. ‘Eventually, I escaped and found a hotel porter, who called the police. It was such a lovely day, and I was devastated it ended the way it did.’ Fearful: The 22-year-old accountancy student (left) said she thought her new husband (right) was 'going to kill' her when he launched the violent attack after their wedding reception in August .

Prosecutor Sarah Traynor told Peterlee Magistrates Court that they went to their room just after midnight, with Miss Dawson having to be helped by a hotel porter. ‘The defendant then tried to undo Miss Dawson’s dress,’ she added. The bride had a crochet hook to unfasten the buttons but Golightly refused to use it. ‘The defendant then jumped up from his chair, approached Miss Dawson and pushed her over,’ said Mrs Traynor.

"A West Australian woman has denied that she scammed pregnant mothers by selling them fake ultrasound pictures. Rawinia Hayes, who ran Amazing 4D Imaging in WA's South West region, pleaded not guilty in Bunbury Magistrates' Court to 18 charges, including accepting payment but failing to deliver goods and making false or misleading representations, the ABC reports. Ms Hayes was investigated by Consumer Protection last year after almost 80 complaints were received. Rawinia Hayes pleaded not guilty to 18 charges at the Bunbury Magistrates Court on Monday . Scores of mothers-to-be cherished the images of babies they were told they were carrying in their wombs. Concerns arose when some of the women realised others had been provided with pictures of the same unborn chlidren. Ms Hayes is alleged to have provided pregnant women with pictures of babies in the womb that were downloaded from the internet and claimed they were the same images the mothers-to-be had seen on ultrasound scans. One of the mothers, Charlotte Shilcof, told Daily Mail Australia she was one of hundreds of women decieved by the scam. She was given photos by Amazing 4D Imaging and told they depicted her now two-year-old daughter Ava. The 23-year-old from Bunbury in West Australia says that a video she received from the company appears to be real, but that photos sent to her were also sent to a number of other women who were at different stages of their pregnancies. Charlotte Shilcof, pictured with her now two-year-old daughter Ava, is one of hundreds of mothers who claims Ms Hayes' business, Amazing 4D Imaging, provided her with fake ultrasound pictures . She told Daily Mail Australia that while the video she received appears to be real, the separate photos that were sent to her (pictured in a scrapbook she created) had also been sent to a number of other women . A real ultrasound picture of Ava before she was born, taken by a different radiologist, stands in stark contrast to the images she received from Amazing 4D Imaging . 'I only found out they were fake when my daughter was about the age of one. Straight away I found three of the photos that I had put in our scrapbook album and saw them on the internet,' Ms Shilcof said. 'I was quite hurt. We really trusted her and it was a special time in our life, being our first child, and it was very upsetting to think that they are photos that don't mean anything - I scrap-booked all of them. 'Most people are pretty angry, but everyone's' situation is different. There have been one or two women whose children didn't survive and things like that - and there are still people who are only just finding out now. 'At first I was angry that she even considered that she could plead not guilty and now it just makes me laugh. There are hundreds of us. How can you plead not guilty and say you haven't done something when there's proof that you have done it.' Newborn Ava: Ms Shilcof said hundreds of the women who received the fake photos had joined a Facebook group. 'Everyone's' situation is different. There have been one or two women whose children didn't survive and things like that - and there are still people who are only just finding out now,' she said . 'I was quite hurt. We really trusted her. It was a special time in our life, being our first child, and it was very upsetting to think that they are photos that don't mean anything. I scrap-booked all of them,' she said . Ms Shilcof (pictured with her husband and daughter in 2013) said she was angry when she first heard Ms Hayes had pleaded not guilty . The Bunbury Mail reported that more than 100 people had joined a group set up for people who believed they had been given false ultrasound photos of their unborn children. The paper said the issue first came to light when a Bunbury woman posted her concerns on Facebook - which resulted in other women coming forward. 'We had an unprecedented 76 actual written complaints in relation to that issue,' Debbie Butler of Consumer Protection told the ABC in December. Ms Hayes pleaded not guilty to 18 charges, including accepting payment but failing to deliver goods and making false or misleading representations, after allegedly supplying dozens of expectant mothers with fake 4D ultrasound photos . Running a business called Amazing 4D Imagining, Ms Hayes is accused of using images from the internet and giving them to clients . One mother, Catherine Osment, was said to have paid for an ultrasound DVD and photographs of her unborn baby but when she received the photographs it was 'clearly obvious' all eight images were of different babies. 'I knew as soon as I opened them they were fake and it made me feel sick,' she said. She added that when she searched the internet she found the same photographs in Google Images. Further checks revealed the prints had been made before she had her scan. Dozens of expectant mothers claim to have received the same pictures and are devastated they have been misled . Women shared images on Facebook to compare the pictures, finding many of them were copies of the same photographs . Her partner had even been planning to have the baby's image tattooed on his chest, but he cancelled the appointment when he realised the photo might not be of his child, she said. Another mother, Jacinta Langford, said she believed an ultrasound photo of her twins had been lifted from Google Images. The Bunbury paper reported the business owner, who could not be named at the time for legal reasons, as saying she was considering legal action for what she said were defamatory claims, adding that her work was legitimate and professional. Women writing in response to the allegations expressed their horror and dismay with one commenting: 'What a terrible thing to do to people.'

Yet another commentator wrote that it was 'heartbreaking watching these parents put 'their' little images up…and other parents are saying and posting 'their' own images EXACTLY THE SAME…it is a disgusting betrayal of trust.' Others took to Facebook to share and compare images they believed to be duplicates of their own, and pictures which they all believed showed their own children.

"When 19 stone Kristina Miles planned to slim down, she hoped she would look and feel sexier than ever. However the newly-wed from Ipswich, Suffolk,who lost  9 stone over five years, said losing the weight has destroyed her sex life. The 23-year-old, who went from a size 24 to a 14, said she was horrified after shedding the pounds left her with the 'body of a granny' due to excess skin. Scroll down for video . Kristina lost 9st  but was horrified when she was left with fold of excess skin . Kristina says that she had to tuck her skin into her pants for her wedding with husband Ashley (right) Kristina says she is so unhappy with her current figure that not only does she not feel sexier but finds it difficult to be intimate with her husband Ashley. The slimmer has been turned down for skin removal surgery on the NHS and fears her only option to look attractive again is to gain the weight she lost to save her marriage. Kristina, who is a mother of three (two daughters aged five and one, and a son aged 4) said: 'I cannot stay like this. It's like being locked in a prison of skin. 'I just wanted to look good on my wedding day but dieting for my wedding has destroyed everything. The NHS has refused Kristina to have her skin removed and she says she can't afford the surgery herself . Kristina, pictured here with Ashley and her three children, says she feels like she has the body of a granny . The 23-year-old decided to shed the pounds after she struggled to find a dress for her wedding day - pictured left and right before the weight loss . 'I felt like I was hiding a big secret under my wedding dress. Everyone told me I looked lovely but they had no idea of the horror underneath.' Kristina added that not only did her appearance ruin her wedding day but has also affected her marriage. 'My husband was marrying a granny. The first year of our married life has been horrific. I want to feel normal again. Some days I wish I could cut it all off myself.' Kristina shed the pounds in a bid to look good for her wedding to Ashley, who she met after splitting from the dad of her first child, Dylan. Kristina says that not only did her excess skin ruin her wedding day but it has also had a big impact on her first year of married life as she has felt ashamed of the way she looks . She was spurred on to get slim after her first attempt to buy a wedding dress ended in disaster because none would fit. 'I took one into the changing rooms and I was puffing and panting trying to get it on. I was bright red, sweating and close to tears. In the end I just pulled it off and ran out of the shop.' Kristina worries that the only way she can feel normal is to put the weight she lost back on . After several successful weeks of dieting, her GP prescribed medication to boost her weight loss and soon she was shedding one stone per month. Kristina's weight loss was a huge success seeing her go from a size 24 to a size 14. But Kristina noticed that as more fat melted away, it left behind saggy skin. On the day of her wedding, she was close to tears as she had to tuck the excess skin into her knickers. 'I should have felt a million dollars because I had made it to a size 14. But I felt disgusting. I was hiding the body of a pensioner.' She smiled happily for photographs but says she was dreading the wedding night. 'It should have been such a special night but I felt too self-conscious to enjoy it. I felt sexier when I was fatter. I felt like a freak but Ashley told me not to be daft.' After the wedding, still feeling self conscious Kristina hoped that by continuing to diet believing that would shrink her skin . But even after slimming down a further two dress sizes to a size 10 and weighing in at 10st 2lbs, Kristina was left with drooping skin around her stomach. Desperate for a solution she saw her GP who agreed to refer her for an apronectomy to remove the loose skin on her stomach.

"The Health and Human Services Department said Monday it would extend by a week the deadline to sign up for Obamacare for enrollees who faced long wait times over the weekend or were unable to fill out an online form due to a computer glitch. The last day to sign up for health insurance through the government was Sunday, Feb. 15. But as many as half a million Americans may have been unable to complete their applications on Saturday because an Internal Revenue Service function that verifies income was out of service. The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, the agency with HHS responsible for implementing health care reform, said Monday that affected applicants would now have until Feb. 22 to enroll in healthcare insurance before they are assessed a fine. A Florida man receives assistance applying for medical coverage at a health insurance marketplace enrollment center in Orlando on Sunday, the last day to sign up for 2015 coverage under the Affordable Care Act. HHS announced Monday that it would extend the deadline to Feb. 22 for Americans who had had problems signing up over the weekend . 'We are pleased that the vast majority of consumers were able to apply and pick a plan through HealthCare.gov or its call center without a problem,' a spokesman for CMS, Aaron Albright, said in a statement on Monday. 'For those consumers who were unable to complete their enrollment because of longer than normal wait times at the call center in the last three days or because of a technical issue such as being unable to submit an application because their income could not be verified, we will provide them with a time-limited special enrollment period for March 1 coverage,' he said. While the new deadline to apply for insurance is Feb. 22, coverage will not kick in until March 1 - the same date as it will become active for applicants who successfully enrolled by Feb. 15, CMS explained. Eligible for the special enrollment period, CMS said, is those who 'attest' that they attempted to enroll by Feb. 15 but were unable to because of a computing error or 'extensive call center wait' times on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. According to USA Today, HHS discovered Saturday afternoon at roughly 2 p.m. that the income verification software wasn't working properly on healthcare websites. The publication says it took until 8 p.m. to fix the problem. Its unknown how much time elapsed before HHS became aware of the malfunction or how many people were kept from finalizing their health insurance requests. USA Today estimates that up to 500,000 were affected, however. Several states with a healthcare marketplace announced a postponement of their deadlines on Sunday, as well. Maryland residents who experienced technical difficulties will have until Feb. 28 to resubmit their applications. Citing inclement weather, Massachusetts and Rhode Island gave their residents until Feb.23 to sign up. California resident who work with a certified enroller now have until Feb. 20. As many as half a million Americans may have been unable to complete their applications on Saturday because an Internal Revenue Service function that verifies income was out of service. Several states also delayed their enrollment deadlines on Sunday for varying reasons, including inclement weather . The problems plaguing the healthcare enrollment system over the weekend were reminiscent of the technical difficulties that beset the website at the close of the 2014 open enrollment period and overshadowed the health care mandate's first year in effect. After a rocky start to the government-mandated program during which healthcare.gov was constantly beset with outages, the website again malfunctioned just before the March 31, 2014 deadline for uninsured Americans to get covered. As a result, HHS had to delay until mid-April the cut-off. A few bugs aside, the healthcare website, having been reconstructed in the off-months, has proven sturdy during the second enrollment period, and HHS projects that a grand total of 9.9 million people could gain health insurance through state and federal marketplaces. The Congressional Budget Office optimistically predicts that 13 million Americans could sign up for healthcare through the government. Anyone over the federal poverty line who does not have employer-based health insurance and does not register for Obamacare will be slapped by the IRS with a $325 fee or 2 percent of their income - whichever is greater. That's up from the $95 per person or 1 percent of a household's income fee that was levied in 2014. Concerned that many of their constituents are unaware of the greater fine, which averages out to $1,100 a household the Associated Press found, a group of senior Democrats in the House said they would the Obama administration to stretch out health care enrollment period for all Americans. 'Open enrollment period ended before many Americans filed their taxes,' Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, the member on the House Ways and Means Committee, Washington Rep. Jim McDermott and Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett told AP on Monday. 'Without a special enrollment period, many people (who will be paying fines) will not have another opportunity to get health coverage this year,' they said in a statement. 'A special enrollment period will not only help many Americans avoid making an even larger payment next year, but, more importantly, it will help them gain quality health insurance for 2015.' Republicans, on the other hand, would like to do away with Obamacare entirely. The GOP-led House of Representatives successfully passed repeal legislation earlier this month for the fourth time. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his chamber would vote to rescind the legislation, as well. Republicans lack a majority in neither chamber, and the White House has said it would veto any bill that dismantles the law, though. Alternatively, the GOP hopes a Supreme Court case looking at the legality of subsidies in Obamacare will topple the law once and for all.","The last day to sign up for Obamacare was Feb. 1, but as many as half a million Americans may have been unable to complete their applications .

She also attached a picture of herself to the letter, so Kate could see just what Scarlett looked like. And the polite little girl, who addressed the letter to 'Your Royal Highness' was even thinking about the future of the monarchy. The budding royalist wrote: 'My name is Scarlett and I am 5 years old. My school is called St Bedes. In my nativity I played you. I got a new red dress just like yours. I hope you like the picture of me.' She finished her letter by writing: 'I can't wait for you to be queen. I think you are lovely, yours sincerely, Scarlett xxxx.'

"A North Carolina newspaper issued a correction to a headline it placed on a letter to the editor on February 6: Obama is not the Antichrist, says the Lexington Dispatch. What Boyd Thomas wanted fellow readers to know is that the president is actually the Beast's biblical precursor--or, as those with a working knowledge of the prophesied end days know him, the Seventh King. Along with the correction, the online version of the letter has been amended to read, 'Is Obama the seventh king?' Correction! A North Carolina printed the headline 'Is Obama the Antichrist' on a letter to the editor February 6. The writer Boyd Thomas actually meant that Obama is the precursor to the Antichrist . To his credit, Thomas does ask that very question to open his 500 word letter. It seems that the Lexington Dispatch just miscounted kings. Thomas writes: . 'God states that seven kings must come before the rise of the Antichrist. Revelations 17:10 says the seventh king will reign for a short amount of time. Is Barack Obama the seventh king?' He goes on to make the argument that Obama is, in fact, this Antichrist antecedent. 'Obama claims nobody can stop him or change anything he's done,' Thomas says. 'This evil must come to pass before the Lord's return and the rise of the Antichrist, but you better know what evil you're dealing with.' Amended: The Lexington Dispatch ran the correction and also amended the online version of Boyd Thomas's letter to read, 'Is Obama the seventh king?' Just who is the seventh king? According to the English Standard translation of Revelation 17, he is one of those in power who aid the Antichrist in his bid to reign destruction down onto the Earth. Per Biblehub.com, in part: . And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come. This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated; they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction. And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast. They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.'","The Lexington Dispatch called Obama the Antichrist in the headline of a letter to the editor -- its author wants you to know that's no what he meant .

"An excessive-force lawsuit has revealed audio  of a female cop suggesting to a group of fellow officers that they turn off the dashcam before continuing with the brutal take-down of a suspect. Officer Kelli Swinton can be heard saying: 'Hold up. Hold up, y'all. Hold up. Hold up, everybody, hold up. We're red right now, so if you guys are worried about cameras, just wait.' At the time, more than half a dozen officers from the St Louis Metropolitan Police Department were surrounding 18-year-old Cortez Bufford, who was on the ground following a traffic stop last April. Four of the officers involved were now facing a lawsuit, filed last month, after it was claimed they used excessive force by kicking and twice Tasering the teen, his lawyer told Daily Mail Online on Monday. Scroll down for video . Soon after more than half a dozen officers surround the teenage suspect in St Louis, Missouri, another cop warned them that the dash-cam was still running - and then the screen goes dark . Officer Kelli Swinton can be heard saying: 'Hold up. Hold up, y'all. Hold up. Hold up, everybody, hold up. We're red right now, so if you guys are worried about cameras, just wait' Attorney Joel Schwartz said today that Mr Bufford was left with abrasions on his face and back and substantial medical bills after being treated in hospital. He is seeking an undisclosed amount in damages in a lawsuit expected to be settled in the fall. The cop who warned fellow officers about the camera may face disciplinary action, according to the St Louis-Post Dispatch. According to Mr Bufford's lawyers, the footage was reportedly held back for several months after the St Louis area erupted into protests centered around the suburb of Ferguson, following the cop shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown. The incident began on April 10 last year, when the Ford Taurus being driven by Mr Bufford made an 'illegal U-turn' and 'abruptly parked' , according to a police report. However dashcam footage contradicts this by showing the suspect parking up correctly. The report, seen by the STL Post-Dispatch, also said that cops saw marijuana and baggies in the car. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a copy of the police report from the St Louis Metropolitan Police Department on Monday . As seen in the dashcam video, around 10.15pm, he refuses to get out of the car, even as his passenger does what the cops ask. The police report stated that Bufford then reached for a gun. One officer can be seen running at the suspect and appeared to swing a kick at his head. On the video, the teenager can be heard screaming and the noise of a Taser can be heard. Mr Bufford can be heard yelling on the tape: 'I can't move.' Police later found a loaded semi-automatic pistol in the car. As more cops run in, Officer Swinton suggested turning off the dashcam and the screen goes blank. Bufford was charged with a felony for unlawful use of a weapon and a a misdemeanor of resisting arrest. The charges were dropped in August because the camera was turned off. Officer Swinton was reportedly appealing disciplinary action.

"As the number of people who have contracted hepatitis A from consuming frozen berries rises to nine across Australia, one woman has revealed her anger and fear over potentially being diagnosed with the virus. Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, had been using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies until Sunday evening, when she was alerted to the health warning which had been issued. 'I'm really angry ... (and) it's absolutely terrified me', Ms Sims told Daily Mail Australia. So far four cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed in Queensland, three in Victoria, and two in New South Wales. Ms Sims' case could take the national toll to ten. Doctors say she is exhibiting common symptoms of the disease and expect to formally diagnose her with the virus when her results come back on Tuesday morning. Scroll down for video . Trudie Sims, from Ballarat in Victoria, had been using Nanna's frozen berries in smoothies and doctors suspect she has hepatitis A . The products which have been pulled from shelves are Nanna's Mixed Berries 1 kilogram packets, and the 300 and 500 gram varieties of Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. 'Over the last two to three weeks I've been getting quite sick and I just thought it was a flu,' Ms Sims revealed. 'Last night I just couldn't really swallow anymore and I was going to make a frozen drink like I have been for the last four to six weeks,' she added added. After her partner Trevor alerted her to the health warning which had been issued when he saw Ms Sims with a packet of Nanna's berries - he rushed her to hospital. Since her admission her eyelids have turned yellow and she is exhibiting signs of jaundice. Ms Sims is also suffering from chronic tonsillitis and a chest infection - likely a result of her body fighting multiple infections. 'I'm massively jaundice and my liver's pretty crappy and these are the first signs of hep A from the berries,' Ms Sims revealed. Though still awaiting the definitive results of her blood tests, Ms Sims said her doctor was almost certain she had hepatitis A, news which left her in tears. The Ballarat woman said she feels betrayed by the food company, and claims she was misled over the origin of the product which she thought were Australian made. Nanna's frozen berries are what Ms Sims was consuming and are among a number of products which have been recalled . She is suffering from jaundice, evident on her eyelids, and doctors expect to formally diagnose her with hepatitis A when her blood test results return . 'I'm really angry', Ms Sims said before adding 'It's disgusting. We're in Australia - we have our own resources.' She now faces at least a week of unpaid leave from her casual job, is on heavy antibiotics and can't even kiss her partner. Ms Sims said she was beside herself when she found out, especially since she and partner Trevor visited his sick mother in hospital just last week. She hopes that she did not pass on any virus. The Ballarat woman decided to share her story in the hopes of alerting others of the dangers. 'I thought I’m going to tell someone … if I didn't know about it then how many other people don’t know,' she revealed. In recent days the frozen berry products have been pulled from supermarket shelves after increasing numbers of people contracted the potentially deadly hepatitis A virus after consuming the fruit. The first items to be pulled were 1kg packets of Nanna's Frozen Mixed Berries after five adults, three in Victoria and two in NSW, fell ill after eating the fruit. Ms Sims now faces at least a week of unpaid leave from her casual job, is on heavy antibiotics and can't even kiss her partner Trevor (left) who rushed her to hospital on Sunday night . The Ballarat woman said she feels betrayed by the company, and would not have bought the fruit had she known it wasn't made in Australia . On Sunday Patties Foods also recalled a number of their products, the 300 gram and 500 gram varieties of their Creative Gourmet Mixed Berries. Patties Foods CEO Steven Chaur said the wider recall was a precautionary measure until the results of further laboratory testing came back. 'We have decided that all our frozen Mixed Berries should be recalled until such time as we receive the results of further laboratory tests,' Mr Chaur said. 'The recall is an important step to ensure public safety and confidence.' The berries, which are sold in major supermarkets including Woolworths, Coles and IGA stores, are packed in China and distributed in Australia by Patties Foods, based in Bairnsdale in southeast Victoria. Meantime Australian farmers say the outbreak from frozen the berries imported from China illustrates the risks involved with imported food and called on consumers to always buy homegrown products. Victorian Farmers Federation president Peter Tuohey said not all imported food adhered to Australia's strict guidelines which were some of the best health and safety standards in the world. Mr Tuohey urged consumers to always buy Australian made products but conceded identifying those products could be quite challenging. Australian farmers urge consumers to always buy homegrown products . 'I can only assume that this company is using Chinese berries because they are offering a lower market price,' he told The Herald Sun. 'Berries are certainly in season in Australia.' He said that it was likely the berries were contaminated when they were first picked. 'They may have been placed on the ground where rats and other vermin could have caused the problem,' he said. 'Unfortunately, Australian Customs don't test every batch, they only check a certain percentage of shipments.' The health department has also told the company to recall the product that contains strawberries, raspberries and blackberries from China and blueberries from Chile. Hepatitis A is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Hepatitis A (pictured) is spread when traces of faecal matter containing the virus comes in contact with hands, water or food, and then enters a person's mouth. Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, says frozen berries have been tied to outbreaks of the virus in the past. 'Hepatitis A virus infection is uncommon and normally associated with travel to countries affected by endemic hepatitis A,' she said in a statement on Saturday. 'The only common link between the cases is consumption of this product - there is no overseas travel or common restaurant exposure.' NSW Health's Communicable Diseases Branch director Dr Vicky Shepherd said an investigation by all health agencies would help determine how many people have been affected - although some may not be struck down with the infection for a few weeks.

"Newly released CCTV footage shows the four-door sedan that Las Vegas police are searching for in connection to a road rage incident that left a local mother dead. Tammy Meyers, 44, had just finished taking her 15-year-old daughter out for a driving lesson when a man shot her outside her home on Thursday. Meyers died Saturday after being taken off life support and her killer is still on the run. In addition to surveillance footage of the car believed to have been used by the shooter in the incident, police have also released a sketch of the suspect. He has been described as a man in his mid-20s,  standing 6-feet tall, weighing about 180 pounds with spiked dirty blond hair and blue or hazel eyes. Police say the car he was driving, seen in the footage, is a gray or silver four-door sedan that may have damage to the front and side of the vehicle. Scroll down for video .

Meyers' bereaved husband has vowed to find the suspect, and the two other accomplices who were in the car along with him. 'My word to them is I hope the cops find them first and it’s not me,' Robert Meyers said. 'I have four kids. I just want to let you suspects know you took a mom away.' Police believe the shooter followed Tammy Meyers and her youngest daughter home from a school parking lot on Thursday before opening fire. She died Saturday evening, a family member told ABC News. Tragic: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, was shot in the head in an apparent road rage attack on Thursday . Speaking late Thursday night, the woman's husband, Robert Meyers, said: 'This was a loving mother of four kids teaching our daughter how to drive. Suspect: A 6-foot man with blond., spiky hair aged around 25 opened fire on Meyers as her children watched. Her 23-year-old son returned fire on the suspect's car which held 'several people' according to reports. Those people remained at large as of Sunday morning . 'After I turn off the machines to my wife today ... we've got to do something to take our city back,' he said. 'Every time you turn around, someone is getting shot.' However, according to local news station KSNV, Meyers left the life support machines on Thursday night on doctors' advice - who said to keep them active for 48 hours in case she improves. Mrs Meyers let her daughter take the wheel of the family's green Buick Park Avenue in a nearby school parking lot when a silver four-door sedan that had been following them passed and hit the brakes, Robert Meyers said. She steered around the car and continued driving home. Meyers said she sent their daughter into the house before the shooting. He described the girl as emotionally distraught. Meyers said their adult son emerged from their house and fired several shots with a handgun at the fleeing car. Meyers said he thinks at least one 9mm shot by his 23-year-old son hit the fleeing car, and he called for the assailants to surrender to police. Las Vegas police were sorting through conflicting reports and descriptions of the car that fled the scene, Officer Miguel Garcia said.

"The sex case against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was on the verge of collapse last night after four prostitutes dropped their accusations against him. All were main prosecution witnesses in the trial in Lille, northern France, in which the 65-year-old is accused of aggravated pimping. If he is acquitted, it will be yet another remarkable legal escape for the notorious philanderer who has been accused of a series of sex crimes. The women in the latest case had provided days of sordid testimony in which the man known as DSK was portrayed as a ruthless sexual predator. I solemnly swear: The aggravated pimping case against former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn may be over after four main witnesses, all prostitutes, have dropped their civil complaints . Many said they had been powerless to stop him subjecting them to painful sex acts performed at orgies around the world. One said she had seen DSK being ‘entertained’ by up to eight prostitutes during a single sex session in a Paris hotel. But court officials yesterday said the four women had dropped their complaint, along with a women’s rights group that was supporting them. ‘All consider there is not enough evidence to brand Mr Strauss-Kahn a pimp,’ said one court source. This means that just one other organisation called Nid, which campaigns on behalf of those forced into prostitution, is now officially complaining against DSK and 13 other defendants. ‘It does not mean that the trial is over, but clearly Mr Strauss-Kahn’s defence is now in a very strong position,’ said another source. DSK, who was once considered a shoo-in to become Socialist President of France, spent three days in the dock last week. Easy way out: Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn enters his car after leaving his hotel in Lille today  to attend a session on the third week of the so-called 'Lille Carlton Hotel Case' trial . He particularly objected to a claim by one woman who said she cried and gestured that she did not want to perform a certain sex act with him, but that he smiled and went ahead anyway. ‘It’s not my concept of sexuality to do it with a prostitute,’ DSK said, adding that he preferred the ‘party atmosphere’ of partner-swapping and swinging. DSK said that despite the idea given in court papers of ‘frenetic activity’, the orgies were organised four times a year because he had been very busy ‘saving the world from catastrophe’ at the time of the financial crisis. DSK is accused of aiding and assisting the prostitution of seven women between 2009 and 2011. He and 13 other defendants deny charges of pimping. Despite a number of previous high-profile accusations against him, including being arrested on suspicion of the attempted rape of a hotel chamber maid in New York, the Lille case is the first time that DSK has faced trial. He faces up to ten years in prison and a fine of more than £1million if found guilty at the end of proceedings later this week.

"They are more commonly seen as a cause of global warming - releasing clouds of methane as they digest their food. But new research suggests that cows may also provide a way of helping to relieve climate change in the future. Biologists have found that by tweaking the way in which cattle graze in fields it is possible to cut the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by trapping it in the soil. Rotating herds through many fields prevents the grass from being cropped too short like in the image above . The researchers used a technique called adaptive multi-paddock grazing management, which involves using small-sized fields that are grazed for only short periods of time. Cows and other livestock account for roughly 20 per cent of the world's methane emissions. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that warms the atmosphere many times more rapidly than carbon dioxide, although is far shorter lived. Ruminants like cows produce large amounts of methane due to the way they use bacteria in their stomachs to digest plants. They give off the gas in belches and wind. A government funded study has shown that changing the diet of cows could help to reduce their flatulence and so help tackle global warming. Giving rapeseed to cows reduces the methane content of their belches and wind by up to 20 per cent - while sheep fed on oats generate a third less gas. The fields are then given a long period to recover before they are grazed again, allowing plants to grow longer roots and store carbon dioxide from the air in their tissues. As they die, the carbon stored in the plants then becomes trapped in the soil. The method mimics the natural migration of wild herd animals such as elk, bison and deer. Peter Byck, a professor of practice at Arizona State University's school of sustainability and filmmaker, said some ranchers already use the practice to rejuvenate their land. He said: 'What they did not know is that they were helping capture a significant amount of carbon dioxide from the air. 'Current methods used to capture and store carbon are industrial in nature and expensive. Adaptive grazing is a natural technology. 'Ranchers who use the technique are earning more, becoming financially healthy.' Professor Byck, who directed the documentary Carbon Nation in 2011, will lead a team of researchers to study and compare 36 ranches in four areas around the US and southern Canada. Gas from livestock like the cows above account for 20 per cent of the world's annual methane emissions . There have been a number of trials to combat the methane gas produced by cows, including this one by the National Institute of Agriculture Technology in Castelar, Argentina that aims to collect their emissions . They will build on work by Dr Richard Teague at Texas A&M University that found that adaptive multi-paddock grazing could sequester an additional 30 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare over 10 years compared to conventional grazing. With multi-paddock grazing, fields become dominated with taller and more productive grasses than those where grazing is done continuously. Dr Teague found that the soil is more fertile, holds more water and contains more carbon from dead organic matter on ranches that use multiple fields for each herd. The technique involves allowing a herd to graze a pasture lightly for up to three days before allowing it to recover by between 30 to 90 days. However, the technique does require large areas of land and will not be ideally suited to all parts of the world. In the trials, some of the ranches rotated their herds through 48 different paddocks. Dr Teague said: 'The use of multiple paddocks per herd on commercial ranches spreads grazing over the entire landscape in the numerous smaller paddocks, rather than allowing a concentration of grazing pressure on preferred areas in the landscape.'","US Scientists are to conduct widespread trials of a new farming technique .

"Multi-millionaire property investor: Entrepreneur Paul Bloomfield enjoyed a lavish lifestyle including luxury homes, a helicopter and a private jet . Officials failed to prosecute a multi-millionaire property investor who did not pay any tax for 24 years, it has been claimed. Entrepreneur Paul Bloomfield enjoyed a lavish lifestyle including luxury homes, a helicopter and a private jet. But he did not submit any returns or pay a penny in tax for more than two decades, according to the BBC. His case was said to be the most extreme to have emerged in Britain since the HSBC scandal was revealed and raised further questions about HM Revenue & Customs’ apparent failure to prosecute tax dodgers. Mr Bloomfield, nicknamed ‘Boom Boom Bloomfield’ for his series of property deals in the 1980s, was reportedly named in the list of Britons with offshore accounts with HSBC in Switzerland. BBC1’s Panorama claimed he met HMRC investigators in 2011 – five years after his personal wealth was estimated at £60million – but told them he did not own any property or have any income of his own. Panorama said it had seen notes of the meeting, which said: ‘Bloomfield confirmed that his living expenses are paid from wherever there is money. Involvement: Mr Bloomfield helped to arrange finance for the new Wembley Stadium (above) in London in 2003 . 'In his words there is a box somewhere which contains money and he arranges for the bills to be paid.’ Mr Bloomfield, who helped to arrange finance for the new Wembley Stadium in 2003, claimed an offshore company paid his rent and another firm funded his use of a Boeing 757, a boat and a helicopter. During his 2011 meeting with HMRC officials, he denied having an offshore bank account, but the HSBC files – given to HMRC by French government officials in 2010 – reportedly revealed he had an offshore account with HSBC in 1993. Tax officials were said to have disbelieved Mr Bloomfield’s denials about not having any income and concluded he was liable for tax for the past 20 years, but he was not prosecuted. Ownership: Mr Bloomfield became renowned in the 1980s for buying and selling some of the best known sites in the UK, including Paternoster Square (pictured), near St Paul’s Cathedral . Mr Bloomfield, a friend of well-known property figures such as Gerald Ronson, became renowned in the 1980s for buying and selling some of the best known sites in the UK, including Paternoster Square, near St Paul’s Cathedral. He was declared bankrupt after a disastrous project during the 1990s property crash, but then bounced back, moving to Russia and reportedly making £158million through deals in former Soviet states. He is now believed to be living in Spain. Panorama said he had not responded to its requests for comment. Former tax inspector Richard Brooks, who now writes on tax matters, said: ‘If you haven’t paid any tax and you’re given a chance by the Revenue to come clean, especially when the amount is on this scale, and you don’t, then you can expect to be prosecuted. That is what you would expect.’ One former business associate of Mr Bloomfield, Mohammad Ghadami, told Panorama: ‘It wasn’t true he had no income, he had a few cars, a few drivers, security, a very expensive wife, an aeroplane. And he had... accountants and lawyers – to work for him.’ The BBC said if HMRC had checked the data about HSBC’s Swiss accounts when it was handed over, officials would have discovered one belonging to Mr Bloomfield and been able to take action years ago. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We don’t talk about identifiable taxpayers. We take a wide range of factors into account when deciding the right course of action.’","Investor Paul Bloomfield had luxury homes, helicopter and private jet .

"It may be the tallest obelisk and stone structure in the world. But the Washington Monument - standing opposite the Reflecting Pool and Lincoln memorial - has shrunk. Government surveyors have determined a new height for the US capital's landmark - about 10in (or 25cm) shorter than it was 130 years ago. The Washington Monument has shrunk by about 10 inches since it was built to honour George Washington . The new official measurement, which will be unveiled today, puts the monument at 554ft, 7in (169m) as measured from the floor of the main entrance to the top. Ever since the stone pillar was completed in 1884 to honour the nation's first president George Washington, the historic height has been recorded at 555ft, 5in (169.2m). The only observable height change was the pyramid-shaped tip had been rounded off over time. Surveyors in 1934 also noticed the peak had been rounded and attributed this to frequent lightning strikes that melted the aluminium tip. The graphic shows how the Washington monument was built over the years - it ran out of funding in 1858 . But experts now dispute that and say the difference is down to where the base point is measured from. Dru Smith, chief geodesist with the National Geodetic Survey, said: 'The building didn't change height because of anything; it is just where you start from,' The original measurement conducted in 1884 used four brass markers as a base for measurement. Those markers remain in place 9in (22cm) below ground – and it is possible the markers were at ground level in the past. A new plaza was installed around the monument more recently, also likely changing ground level. Despite the new measurement, the Park Service said it would stick to the existing height and would not change any brochures. When the monument was completed in 1884, it was the world's tallest structure until 1889 when the Eiffel Tower was built. It remains by far the tallest structure in the nation's capital, which strictly restricts building heights. The monument was damaged during the Virginia earthquake and Hurricane Irene in 2011 and remained closed to the public while it was assessed and repaired. After 32 months of repairs, it reopened  to visitors on May 12, 2014. The monument has shrunk in size by 10 inches since 1888, as the graphic demonstrates .","Government surveyors determined new height for US capital's landmark .

"Former escort Madison Ashton has lost her appeal against the estate of billionaire Richard Pratt, who she says promised her millions. Ms Ashton launched an appeal against the 2012 decision to reject her bid for part of the cardboard king's estate. Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress. Scroll down for video . Madison Ashton (pictured here at court in 2012) has lost her appeal against the estate of the late cardboard billionaires, Richard Pratt . Although the Supreme Court agreed the pair had the conversation, it found Ms Ashton's acceptance of $100,000 and the transfer of car into her name was done in full satisfaction of the trust claim. In November 2005, Ms Ashton signed a document from a employee of Mr Pratt's company, Visy Industries, that released Mr Pratt from any financial responsibility in exchange for a payment of $50,000 to the former mistress. Mr Pratt died in 2009. In appealing the decision, Ms Ashton sought a declaration that Mr Pratt's 2003 promises constituted a legally binding contract and anything she signed in November 2005 was void. She also sought damages from Mr Pratt's widdoe, Jeanne Pratt. Billionaire Mr Pratt died in 2009 . Ms Ashton appeared before the Supreme Court of NSW today . But on Monday, the Court of Appeal dismissed her bid, saying the arrangement failed to spell out important terms such as Ms Ashton's obligations as mistress, how long it would last and the details of how the trusts would work. The court said Ms Ashton had received substantial gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress and there was nothing to suggest she was prevented from returning to the escort industry. Madison Ashton, who was once showered with gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress, claims the two of them were in a de-facto relationship, and it was not just a 'business' arrangement the pair had. Madison Ashton who was known as one of Australia’s most notorious prostitutes - aka Christine McQueen — stopped working as a hooker in 2003 after Pratt (right) promised her he would look after her and her two children. Ms Ashton, who also sued the cardboard baron's estate for $10 million in 2012 lost and racked up a million dollar legal bill. In September, The Daily Telegraph reported, the court heard Pratt had a 'voracious appetite for young woman like Ms Ashton and that promising her five million dollars wouldn't have been very much money to such a wealthy man. Ms Ashton, mwho was known as one of Australia’s most notorious prostitutes - aka Christine McQueen — stopped working as an escort in 2003 after Mr Pratt promised he would look after her and her two children. It was reported she claimed to have given up a lucrative career in the high class escort business to become Mr Pratt's mistress . A book called 'Mistress: The True Stories of Mistresses and Their Men' released last year delved into the couples bizarre relationship. Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress . The late Richard Pratt (pictured) who was elected as Carlton's Football club's president Richard Pratt in 2007 was claimed to be in a de-facto relationship with prostitute Madison Ashton. Writer Matthew Benns and co-author Terry Smyth say Mr Pratt was one Australia's business giants, but  it wasn't just wealth that pleased him. Rather, he had an 'apparently endless desire' for sex, Benns and Smyth wrote, sustaining two long-running affairs with a pair of young women from the bush. They were Shari-Lea Hitchcock, from Cambewarra, on the New South Wales south coast; and Peggy Jane Heslop - better known as Madison Ashton, sex worker and Penthouse Pet - who stemmed from Wangaratta, in Victoria's north-east. Hitchcock was a 'blonde bombshell, 35 years his junior,' Benns and Smyth wrote.

"Harriotte Lane, right, with school friend Tegan Carrier, 13, is almost a foot taller than most of the girls in her class . A 13-year-old schoolgirl who set her sights on becoming a model after she suffered cruel taunts about her height after growing to six feet tall has become a beauty pageant queen. Harriotte Lane was teased and called names on a regular basis because she was always much taller than her fellow pupils at primary school in West Allotment, Newcastle. But now the teenager has proven to bullies that she is proud of her height after she was recently crowned Junior Miss Tyne and Wear Galaxy. She said: 'I used to get comments from people saying I was too tall to play with them and that I didn't fit in. 'It was really upsetting for me and it always made me feel really embarrassed. But now I use it as motivation - I see being tall as unique and it's something I'm proud of. 'As I got older I felt that being tall wasn't something I should be ashamed of any more and people started to see me for who I really am. 'I come from a very tall family but despite that I've recently overtaken my dad who is just under six foot tall. 'From modelling and doing pageants I gained heaps of confidence and now I embrace being tall - it's something that quite literally makes me stand out from the crowd.' Harriotte was always taller than the average height for girls her age when she was growing up - at five she was was three inches taller and by the time she was 10 she was almost six inches taller. Based on her current growth rate, doctors believe Harriotte - who lives with mother, Sarah, 42, father, Bill, 49, and brother, William, 11 - will grow to be 6ft 3in tall. But her height has left her suffering with low blood pressure that often leads to blackouts. She said: 'The growing pains meant I started feeling sick and dizzy all the time. After months of seeing doctors, my health got worse and they realised my blood pressure was too low. 'I can't actually have any medication or treatment for it because I don't suffer with any type of condition. The teenager took part in her first competition in August last year in the Miss Junior Teen GB event and was named as second runner-up at the Junior Miss Galaxy UK event (pictured left and right) this month . 'I've just been told to make sure I'm always well hydrated and that I live a very healthy and active lifestyle. 'I think the best thing to do that has been joining the pageants - they've helped me raise so much money for charity as well as boosting my confidence.' She took part in her first competition in August last year in the Miss Junior Teen GB event and was named as second runner-up at the Junior Miss Galaxy UK event on February 7. Harriotte is now set to battle it out for the Miss Junior Teen GB title in Blackpool on October 25. Her proud mother, Sarah, who works as marketing consultant, said: 'The bullying and name-calling was horrific at times - she was always left to feel excluded. Harriotte has recently overtaken her father's height, at just under six feet (left) and is more than a foot taller than her friend Tegan Carrier, 13 (right) Harriotte, pictured with her friends, says she was taunted and called names while she was at primary school but since she took up modelling part-time her confidence has grown . 'On top of all that she had the physical problems that came with growing so quickly - she would stand up and then collapse - often hitting the floor hard or losing her vision. 'But she copes with it all so well now and she's very determined to make the most of the pageants. 'Harriotte has always worked incredibly hard and now she's reaping the rewards of being so brave and strong through those awful times when she was younger. 'She won three awards at the Junior Miss Galaxy UK event, including the Miss Publicity title which she was given for raising awareness of charity work. I couldn't be more proud of her.' Harriotte set up the Leave Them Alone Facebook campaign in a bid to help others beat the bullies. For more information on the group, visit: facebook.com/Leavethemalonecampaign.

"A patient group has defended its 'excellent' GP after he was suspended from practice because he failed to manage 'endless' reams of paperwork. Dr Nihal Elapatha had his contract at his GP surgery terminated after a hearing found his performance was 'unacceptable'. The 65-year-old had worked at the Rochester Healthy Living Centre for 13 years before he was suspended last March. But a tribunal found his record keeping was 'inadequate' and that he did not arrange the appropriate treatment or tests for patients. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service also heard that Dr Elapatha was unable to touch-type and was not able to record everything that happened during an appointment. Dr Nihal Elapatha had his contract at his GP surgery in Rochester, Kent, suspended for a year after a medical tribunal found his performance was 'unacceptable'. But patients have rallied in support of their 'excellent' GP, with more than 650 people signing a petition in his favour . The fitness to practise panel noted: 'He could not type onto the medical record everything that took place during a single 10-minute consultation.' It adds: 'He had no touch typing ability and used his index fingers of both hands and one thumb on the space bar to make medical notes.' Dr Elapatha's practice was described as 'high demand, high volume where one has to work as though on a conveyor belt'. The panel suspended him for a year despite hearing that none of his patients were harmed in any way due to medical negligence or malpractice. However the hearing was also told all Dr Elapatha's patient satisfaction surveys were above the Medway and national average. Since the hearing, more than 650 people have signed a petition supporting Dr Elapatha. Patient Mandy Richardson-Mills, 42, said Dr Elapatha 'saved her life' and that he should not have been suspended because of 'endless admin'. She said: 'The whole situation is just disgusting and they were just trying to find a way to get rid of him. The fitness to practise panel heard Dr Elapatha, who is 60 years old, could not touch type and struggled to take down all the relevant notes during a 10-minute consultation (file picture posed by models) 'He literally saved my life and saved my ex-partner's life too. He was always there to support me and still is. 'He has got a whole lot of support. He is a good doctor and that should be the priority over endless admin. 'He was always there to treat his patients and he did a wonderful job. I can't praise him highly enough. 'There is a ridiculous amount of pressure on GPs. He is in his 60s and can't type, bless him. That doesn't make him a bad doctor.' Since Dr Elapatha left the surgery last March, services for around 2,000 patients at the surgery in Rochester, Kent, have been covered by locums. He has since taken remedial action by investing in new software, technical training and learning how to touch type. The panel, which concluded on January 30, found that  a permanent ban would not be appropriate. Chairman Linda Buchanan said: 'The panel found that Dr Elapatha had limited insight into his failings. 'It notes that initially, Dr Elapatha did appear to acknowledge that his record-keeping was inadequate and this was noted in the panel's determination on impairment. 'However, he appears to minimise his failings and therefore there is little reassurance that he will not act similarly in the future. 'The panel has determined that, given the serious nature of the findings and potential risk to patient safety, it is necessary for the protection of members of the public for Dr Elapatha's registration to be suspended immediately.'","Hearing found Dr Nihal Elalpatha's performance was 'unacceptable'

"Cushty: Oscar Pistorius has been given a raft of new privileges in prison after having his status was upgraded from category B to category A . Oscar Pistorius is now able to hug and kiss his visitors, own a radio and wear jewellery in a raft of new privileges behind bars, MailOnline has learned. The convicted killer will also be free to make more phone calls, take up a hobby and have a bigger budget to buy toiletries and treats after a decision by jail chiefs to re-categorise his prisoner status. News that Pistorius has been upgraded to category A status from category B comes two years after he shot dead Reeva Steenkamp at his home on Valentine's Day. Although Pistorius is still said to be struggling to cope with his loss of freedom, bosses at Kgosi Mampuru prison in the South African capital, Pretoria, relaxed the terms of his incarceration after deciding he poses little threat to security. The Pistorius family spokeswoman, Annalise Burgess, confirmed the track star, known as the Blade Runner, is 'now a Category A prisoner' – news that was greeted with delight by his relatives. A family source told MailOnline: 'We have a family Whatsapp group on which we all hear the news about Oscar as well as other family business. 'Since Aimee and Carl (his sister and brother) are his most frequent visitors, it is usually them who let the rest of us know what is happening with him inside. 'This has boosted him a lot. He has been very low in prison, although he seems to be getting all the support from the prison authorities that he needs. 'His new status means he will be able to have more visits – there are a lot of family members who would like to go and see him, but in the past have stayed away so that it is mostly Carl, Aimee, his aunt and grandmother who take the allocated slots.' It comes after one prison officer last week said the disgraced former Paralympian was being treated 'like royalty'. Up until now, Pistorius has been separated from his visitors by glass, with a handset to speak through and and a strictly 'no-touching' policy in place. The 28-year-old can now touch his loved ones during their 'contact' visits, which have been extended from two to three hours per month, although both he and his visitors will still be searched. Pistorius must continue wear his prison-issue orange jump suit. Sentence: Oscar slips his watch to his uncle Arnold as he is taken down to the holding cells after being given five years imprisonment for the culpable homicide. He has now been allowed to wear jewellery in prison . The runner who is famously a keen collector of expensive watches, is also now also free to wear jewellery, though not in his ears or nose. He was seen to hand over a chunky designer watch to his uncle Arnold Pistorius as he was led to the cells in the minutes after he was jailed for culpable homicide - or manslaughter - in October. The allowance the famous inmate is allowed to spend at the prison tuck shop has also risen– from R100 to R150 (£6 to £9) – which will enable him to buy chocolate, fizzy drinks and toiletries. Thanks to his new status, Pistorius will now have more chance of entertaining himself in his single cell, with the right to pursue a hobby (provided no sharp tools are needed) and keep a radio. The star of the London Olympic games will also be free to make more phone calls - 24 per year, a massive hike on his category B allowance of six per year. All prisoners are allowed to receive and write as many letters as they like, although they must fund their own postage and stationary costs. Killed by her boyfriend: Oscar was convicted of Reeva Steenkamp's manslaughter after shooting her through a locked toilet door at his home in Pretoria in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 . Since his jailing nearly four months ago, the shamed sprinter has completed a number of rehabilitation programmes, including a course on coping with emotions, and has proved to be a model prisoner. According to a prison guard, Pistorius spends much of his day isolated from other inmates. The sprawling facility is notorious for the sexual and physical violence that is meted out by the 'numbers' gangs who dominate prison life. Attacking – even murdering - fellow inmates is a means of climbing the gangs' chains of command, and a famous target is likely to hold even greater kudos. As a precaution, Pistorius rarely leaves his hospital wing where, at weekends, early mornings and late afternoons he is in the company of one of South Africa's most infamous underworld criminals, Radovan Krejcir. Although Pistorius is still said to be struggling to cope with his loss of freedom, bosses at Kgosi Mampuru prison (above) have relaxed the terms of his incarceration after deciding he poses little threat to security . The Czech fugitive – who is wanted in his own country on a raft of charges – is the defendant in three active court cases in South Africa, including fraud, robbery and torture. Last week, he was charged with a fresh count of murder. The Olympian and the fugitive shares the use of Krejcir's running machine and exercise bike which are kept on the hospital wing corridor. As a prisoner on trial, the Czech is entitled to greater privileges than a convicted criminal such as Pistorius. Pistorius could be freed from prison as early as July and allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. However, prosecutors are appealing his conviction for culpable homicide as well as his five-year jail term. Pistorius is expected to fight any decision to convict him of murder or lengthen his prison sentence, despite the fact he ran out of money to pay the team who defended him at his lengthy murder trial. Pistorius made history at London 2012 by competing at the Olympics and the Paralympics, where he won two gold medals.","Prison chiefs have upgraded his status from category B to category A .

A Coast Guard rescue swimmer helped them into a metal rescue basket before they were hoisted to safety. 'Given the severity of this storm, this rescue was a major effort and we are all relieved it ended as it did,' said Lt. j.g. Tyler Dewechter, MH-60 pilot and public affairs officer at Air Station Cape Cod. 'We are glad we were prepared for this storm and could render aid - and also continue to urge mariners to stay safe and heed the cautions and advisories of winter storm warnings.' They were checked for cold weather injuries but none were found. Before they took off, the pair said they were aware of the risks of their journey but thought they were well-prepared .","Reg and Jason McGlashan had to be rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard .

"For four decades, Sambany lived with a giant tumour growing from his neck. At its heaviest the mass weighed a stone and measured twice the size of his head. But after walking for three days, Sambany is finally free of the growth, after charitable medics performed a 12-hour operation to rid him of the tumour. The procedure, one of the most life-changing performed by the team at Mercy Ships, saw doctors and nurses remove one of the biggest tumours the charity has seen in its 30-year history. The operation took twice as long as expected and once removed, the team discovered the growth weighed a staggering 16.45lbs (7.46kg) tumour - just over a stone. Scroll down for video . Sambany first noticed a swelling in his left cheek when he was in his 20s. The mass grew to weigh just over a stone and was twice the size of his head, when medics finally removed it four decades later . After hearing the international charity Mercy Ships had docked a vessel at the port of Toamasina in Madagascar, Sambany and his grandson walked for three days to reach the crew seeking help. He is pictured after the life-changing operation with British anaesthetist Dr Michael McBrien . Speaking ahead of his life-changing operation, Sambany, who is around 60 years old, but doesn't know his exact date of birth, said: 'My heart is very, very happy. 'I'm very happy. I'm just happy. 'I know without surgery I will die. I know I might die in surgery, but I already feel dead inside from the way I'm treated. 'I choose to have surgery.' When he was in his 20s, Sambany, who is from a rural part of Madagascar, developed a swelling in his left cheek. Gradually, as the tumour grew his head began to lean progressively the other way to cope with the weight of the mass. The size of the tumour began to place growing pressure on his body, with his heart struggling to cope with the weight of the burden. When he arrived in the eastern port of Toamasina, Sambany had just one stop to make. He sought out the Mercy Ship docked there, and appealed to the crew for help. They faced a number of difficulties preparing for the operation, having never dealt with a tumour that size before. But the expert volunteer crew, which included British anaesthetist Dr Michael McBrien, from Belfast, overcame the obstacles and were able to perform the procedure. Speaking ahead of his operation Sambany said: 'I know without surgery I will die. I know I might die in surgery, but I already feel dead inside from the way I'm treated. I choose to have surgery' Due to the size of the tumour the medical team on board the ship Africa Mercy faced difficulties screening Sambany before his operation . Speaking after the operation, Dr McBrien, told MailIOnline: 'Sambany is one patient who I know I will remember forever. 'Our surgical and anaesthetic team achieved something quite incredible, considering his age and the size of the tumour. 'It is amazing to think that this was made possible on a ship docked in the port of Toamasina - it is a wonderful thing to be a part of. 'In terms of recovery, Sambany has a long way to go. 'From the hospital staff, the on board crew, and the local day crew - hundreds of people have dedicated themselves to transforming Sambany's life, and this is something that will continue while he recovers.' When Sambany caught sight of himself in the mirror for the first time since his operation, he was delighted. He exclaimed: 'I like it. I am happy.' Later that morning he was giving the thumbs up, and by the afternoon he was able to sit up in bed and play cards with his grandson. He will remain on the ship for the next few months to recover from his surgery. The grandfather first heard about the hospital ships through a friend. But the team persevered and following a 12-hour operation Sambany was finally free of the tumour . Seeing himself in the mirror for the first time since the operation he exclaimed his delight, telling his grandson: 'I am happy' There and then he made the decision to visit the crew of the Africa Mercy, with his grandson to see if they could help. They walked for three days, before embarking on a four-hour car journey to reach the ship. Judy Polkinhorn, Executive Director of Mercy Ships UK, said: 'Thanks to the expert skill of our amazing volunteers Mercy Ships are able to carry out such incredible, life-changing surgeries. 'I am so touched to hear about Sambany's story – he really epitomises what the charity is all about.' Mercy Ships operates the Africa Mercy, a state-of-the-art hospital ship which carries out life-changing surgeries in some of the poorest countries in the world. The ship is currently docked in Madagascar, providing medical care to the world's forgotten poor. Mercy Ships is an international charity that provides free surgery and medical care, while also helping to improve health care services in some of the world's poorest nations.

"Nick Gordon has sent a defiant message to Bobby Brown and the Houston family by having the ailing heiress's name tattooed across his arm in huge letters. He posted the picture on his Facebook page after being barred from visiting her bedside in an Atlanta hospital. His frustration was revealed by Daily Mail.com last week when it was disclosed he had told friends of his intense love for her and his hope that she would recover and clear his name which is at the center of a police investigation. Some members of the Houston family have said they expect him to be charged in connection with her hospitalization. Gordon's decision to have her name etched onto his left arm is the clearest sign yet that he intends to fight for her if she recovers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Show of commitment: Nick Gordon has posted this picture of an apparently new tattoo . Other side: This image from 2012 has surfaced also showing Nick Gordon with a gun. It had been deleted and published on Straightfromthea.com - then reproduced this weekend on an anti-Gordon website . Menace: Another picture from Nick Gordon's social media which is being highlighted by the website which suggests he represented a danger to her . But it comes at the same time as a picture of Bobbi Kristina's 'husband' is at the center of an increasingly dirty war between him and her father. The image was published this weekend on a website devoted to portraying Nick Gordon as a danger to 21-year-old Bobbi Kristina. The website called 'Is Nick Gordon Guilty in what happened with Bobbi Kristina?' also claims the critically-ill daughter of Brown and the late Whitney Houston was about to split up with Gordon. It features details of bitter rows between Gordon, 25, and Bobbi Kristina who has been unconscious and on life support since January 31 after being found face down in her bathtub. But it is the picture of Gordon holding a gun while driving behind the wheel of a car which is certain to fuel Bobby Brown's determination to keep him away from his daughter. It was first apparently tweeted by Gordon himself in 2012 and then deleted. The Atlanta website 'Straight from the A' published it at the time and claimed it had increased fears for Bobbi Kristina's safety over her relationship with him. But this weekend it was republished on the anti-Gordon website. It is certain to inflame anger against Gordon, who was brought up by Whitney Houston from the age of 12 and became Kristina's boyfriend. He has been accused of abusing the kindness of the Houston family and threatening Bobbi Kristina's matrnal aunt, Marion Houston. She has successfully sought an order of protection against Gordon, accusing him of stalking her and sending her threatening messages, which reportedly included photos of guns. The restraining order expires in April. Gordon is also at the center of a police investigation into how his girlfriend, who he claims to have married, came to have facial bruising at the time of her near drowning. Couple: Bobbi Kristina with Nick Gordon in 2012. She said she had married him although, after her drowning, that was denied by her father. They had been brought up together since he was taken in by Whitney Houston . Abusive: This was the letter Bobbi Kristina and Nick Gordon sent to a neighbor after they were thrown out of their apartment in a well-off part of Atlanta for 'partying and fighting' Gun image: Another picture from Nick Gordon's Twitter feed showing his interest in guns . The wedding claim has been denied by Bobby Brown who is said to be 'praying hard and singing hymns' at his daughter's bedside in a bid to aid her recovery. Gordon is also persona non grata with the Houston family who, with her father,have banned him from visiting Kristina, whose organs are said to be failing. Friends of Kristina accuse Gordon of being a bad influence on her and leading her into trouble with rumors of drug abuse. The couple were thrown out of their luxury apartment at Amli North Point after complaints by residents of their 'fighting and partying'. One neighbor told Daily Mail.com: 'They were a couple of spoilt brats and the police were called several times to attend their home. 'Most of us thought Kristina was a young and impressionable young woman who hung on her boyfriend's every word. 'When they were finally kicked out,they wrote an insulting letter to the couple they thought had been most behind getting rid of them. But we were all relieved to see them go. They were a nuisance and their letter proved that.' Sole visit: Nick Gordon at the hospital where Bobbi Kristina was initially treated. His presence there is understood to be the last time he was close to his partner and was the day after she was found drowned . Division: Bob Brown, pictured this weekend after visiting his daughter, has issued a public denial that Nick Gordon was married to his daughter . Gordon has denied harming Bobbi Kristina and told a friend: 'I didn't do anything to my baby. 'I just hope she wakes up and tells 'em what they all need to know. 'People are just jumping on my back cos she loves me. There's a load of nonsense being said about us. I love her, but I can't get anywhere near her.' But senior members of the Houston family claim Gordon is a bad influence on a vulnerable and motherless young woman, who stands to inherit $12 million from her mother's estate when she turns 30 . A third person, Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod, has also been dragged into the fallout of the recriminations against Gordon with Bobby Brown marginalizing him and urging people to 'disregard' him. Jerod, a musician who gave TV interviews and spoke up on behalf of Gordon, was left reeling by Bobby Brown's public statement against him . In a Facebook posting at the weekend he pleaded: ' How about you all reach out to every staton I ever did an interview with. 'Ask how much I got for any interview….$000,000.' He added: 'My reward is seeing Bobbi Kristina walk out of that hospital. Thanks for those who continue to pray for Kristina. I LOVE YOU COUSIN.' It has been reported that Bobbi Kristina's condition has worsened with her organs beginning to fail and the next 48 hours will be key to her survival. Her father faces the agonizing decision on whether to have her life support machine and ventilator turned off or urge doctors to continue to try to save the 21-year-old who stands to inherit $12 million at the age of 30. Claims emerged at the weekend that a decision would be made this week. But a lawyer for Bobby Brown said that was not going to happen. Christopher Brown told People magazine that was 'false'.","Whitney Houston's daughter has now been in a coma for more than two weeks since being found face down in a bath .

"Whitehall has wasted more than £5billion in just one year through errors, buying unused equipment and handing out compensation, a report has found. The losses include nearly £300million for written-off vaccines, £6million on ear plugs which could not be used, and £4million on costs related to the early withdrawal of Sea King helicopters from service. In one case, the Department for Education lost £1.2million because a school sent a payment to the wrong bank account, according to the report published today by the Taxpayers’ Alliance. Whitehall has wasted more than £5billion in just one year through errors, buying unused equipment and handing out compensation. The losses include nearly £6m on ear plugs (pictured) which could not be used . The new report also revealed that health spending which could have been avoided included £49million to exchange Tamiflu vaccines which were ordered in case of an avian flu epidemic – and are now out of date . Of all government departments, the Ministry of Defence had the biggest ‘avoidable losses’, at £3.1 billion in 2013-14, including spending on unsuitable or out-of-date equipment and IT systems. These losses included the ear plugs, another £7.2million on a mobile mine-detection system ruled to be not fit for purpose, and £24million on ‘fruitless payments’ on Merlin aircraft components. The Department of Health was found to have lost £761million, Work and Pensions could have saved £569million, and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, £469million. Health spending which the report says could have been avoided includes £49million to exchange Tamiflu vaccines which were ordered in case of an avian flu epidemic – and are now out of date. Another £255million was said to have been spent by NHS England and hospital trusts on other vaccine write-offs although many of these have a short shelf life and need regular upgrading. The survey of avoidable spending by government departments includes ‘special payments’ of compensation and legal fees which had not budgeted for - but amounted to around £157million. For these payments, the largest bill was incurred the Home Office, at nearly £50million – of which £15.6million was for legal fees related to asylum seekers cases. And the Department of Health paid out £28.5million including payoffs for staff and costs related to the reorganisation of the health service. Of all government departments, the Ministry of Defence in Whitehall (pictured) had the biggest ‘avoidable losses’, at £3.1 billion in 2013-14, including spending on unsuitable or out-of-date equipment and IT systems . Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘While in some cases closing a programme or getting out of a rental agreement early may make long-term sense, many of these losses are simply ludicrous and will seriously damage the trust taxpayers have in Whitehall civil servants. ‘It is clear there remains far too much waste in the system. With an ever-growing debt burden, we must make government more efficient and ensure taxpayers are getting real value for money.’ The think tank notes that some of these losses were not covered by department, but by other public sector bodies such as NHS trusts, HM Revenue and Customs or local government. Some losses will have been paid by one public sector body to another, but all are losses which, according to Government guidance, ‘are items that ideally should not arise.’","Whitehall has wasted more than £5billion in one year through admin errors .

"A parish vicar drunkenly assaulted his wife after losing their dog then drove off in his Jaguar while he was more than double the alcohol limit, a court has heard. Former Army chaplain Reverend David Davies attacked his wife of 26 years, Donna, during a row in a park after he got drunk while taking their dog for a walk. After the incident, the 50-year-old drove to his vicarage home in Torquay, Devon and was still over the limit when police came to his home, a court has heard. The father-of-two has now been banned from the road for two years and ordered to do 120 hours of unpaid work after admitting common assault and drink driving before Torbay magistrates. The court heard he also faces losing his job as a clergyman and the vicarage home which comes with the parish position. Reverend David Davies faces losing his job and home after drunkenly assaulting his wife before driving off . Magistrates heard Davies served as an Army chaplain for more than 20 years before becoming a parish priest. Last November, he left the home he shares with his wife to take the couple's dog for a walk, but Mrs Davies later received a phone call to say the dog was 'running around unsupervised'. She went down to Cockington Court park near Torquay to try to find her dog and discovered Davies drunk, the court heard. Prosecutor Edward Counsell said: 'There was an argument between them. Mrs Davies tried to walk away and was followed by her husband who, according to two witnesses, grabbed her hair and pulled her to the ground.' After the attack, Davies walked to his car as his wife protested that he was drunk and shouldn't drive. Police were tipped off by a witness and they went to the vicarage where Davies's car was parked. The attack followed a row in picturesque Cockington Court park near Torquay, Devon last November . The car's engine was still warm and Davies blew a reading of 92mg of alcohol in his breath – more than double the legal limit of 35mg. He was arrested and in police interview he 'admitted pulling his wife to the ground' and accepted he had been drink driving, said Mr Counsell. Alan Parsons, defending, told the court Davies had been married for 26 years and had two grown-up sons. He said Mrs Davies did not report the assault but her husband admitted there had been an attack in interview. Mr Parsons said: 'The consequences for Rev Davies over what has been happening in the last year and especially as a result of these convictions, are quite monumental. 'He has been suspended by the Diocese of Exeter but the indications given to his wife is that he will not be allowed to continue.' He said that means they will also lose their vicarage home which was tied in with his job as priest of Cockington and Torre in Torquay. Davies's lawyer told Torquay Magistrates Court (pictured) he 'has a lot of issues and a difficult path ahead' Mr Parsons handed in a letter from the vicar's wife as well as his Army service record. He told the court: 'He has a lot of issues and a difficult path ahead.' Davies admitted common assault and drink driving in November – six weeks after he was suspended from his duties at the end of September. The Diocese of Exeter said at the time of the offences that they 'were very grieved when the police informed us of the charges against him'. Davies, who left court without commenting, may struggle to obtain benefits due to his conduct, said Mr Parsons, who added that his wife earned £800-a-month working part time. The magistrates banned him from driving for 24 months and gave him a 12-month community order with certain conditions including doing 120 hours of unpaid work in the next year, and pay £145 costs.","Former Army chaplain lost his dog during a walk in November last year .

"Italy launched a massive rescue last night of more than 2,000 stricken migrants crossing the Mediterranean from Libya, where fears are growing over the rise of Islamic extremists. Coastguard officials reportedly recovered 2,164 people who had been crammed onto a dozen boats in the latest in a string of increasingly desperate attempts to enter Europe. It came on the same day Italy said it was evacuating 100 embassy staff in Libya, where extremists from the self-styled Islamic State group have beheaded 21 Coptic Christians in a gruesome video. Scroll down for video . Rescue: Another 2,000 stricken migrants were rescued from the Mediterranean by Italian officials last night . Desperate: An image of the rescue mission, which involved a dozen craft, released by the Italian coastguard . Emergency: Migrants were handed foil blankets and tended to by Red Cross officials on the choppy waters . By last night around 520 migrants were on board an Italian navy ship, the TGcom24 television station's website said. More than 900 other migrants were picked up by coastguard and customs police boats, while the rest were rescued by various ships in the area, according to reports. The Italian transport ministry said some of its coastguards had been threatened by four armed men earlier in the day who approached them by speedboat from the Libyan coast. The Kalashnikov-wielding men forced the rescuers to return a boat that had been emptied of migrants, the ministry said in a statement. Last year more than 3,200 people died while attempting to reach Italy by boat from North Africa, a sea crossing described by the UN as the most dangerous in the world. Rescue: By last night around 520 migrants were on board an Italian navy ship. Some left at Sicily (above) Exhausted: Women were among those disembarking at Porto Empedocle, Agrigento province, Sicily . Survivors: Not all migrants who try to reach Italy are so lucky. Last year more than 3,000 died on the journey . On Friday, some 600 migrants on board six dinghies were rescued by the Italian coastguard and merchant vessels around 50 miles off the Libyan coast. Many have now reached Sicily, where their fate will be decided by the Italian authorities. But in a major tragedy last week, more than 300 migrants died in the Mediterranean Sea when their overcrowded rubber dinghies collapsed and sank in stormy weather. The victims were among migrants mainly from sub-Saharan Africa who had embarked on the perilous journey from a beach near Tripoli. Today Italy's interior minister warned of an 'exodus without precedent' if the spread of Islamic State, also known as Isis, was allowed to continue unchecked. Militants have already rampaged through Iraq and Syria and seized large parts of the country, vowing to establish a Caliphate throughout the Middle East following an extremist interpretation of Sunni Islam. Saved: These migrants arrived yesterday in Sicily after being rescued on Friday - but others were not so lucky . Uncertain future: The group of men arrived as Italy's interior minister warned of an 'exodus without precedent' Islamic State's victims have included Christians and Yazidis alongside thousands of Muslims - who are told to follow the militants' version of religion or die like everyone else. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: 'We must not lose a minute. 'You have to intervene in Libya with a UN mission. The international community must understand that it is crucial for the future of the West. 'The threats against our country, unfortunately, are not new and our warning was already very high.' He insisted journalists 'could not create a link' between growing uncertainty in Libya and the wave of migrants willing to risk death to enter the country. But he added: 'The militias of the Caliph [are] advancing faster than the decisions of the international community. Fleeing: This group pictured in Sicily survived, but last week 300 migrants were feared to have drowned . Worrying: The United Nations has described the sea crossing as the most dangerous in the world . 'We risk an exodus without precedent and difficult to control.' Italian Defence Minister Roberta Pinotti told the newspaper Il Messaggero that the risk of jihadists arriving in Italy on boats carrying immigrants from Libya 'could not be ruled out'. She said Italy was ready to lead a coalition from Europe and north African states to battle against the advance of jihadists in Libya. 'The risk is imminent, we cannot wait any longer,' she said. 'Italy has national defence needs and cannot have a caliphate ruling across the shores from us.' Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told public television on Saturday that Rome was committed to intervening in Libya, and called for a stronger United Nations mission. 'We have told Europe and the international community that we have to stop sleeping,' he said. Rescue: This video still released by the Italian coastguard showed a rescue taking place on Saturday . Perilous: Migrants are often crammed into unstable dinghies which are unable to survive the trip . Last week's deaths of hundreds of migrants underscored the limited means and scope of Triton, an EU-run mission which took over in November from the Italian navy in scanning the sea for migrants. Italy scaled back the mission after its EU partners refused to share running costs of around 9million euros a month. Since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011, Libya - a former Italian colony - has been plagued by conflict among rival forces battling for control of key cities and the country's oil riches. Islamist militants, who released their brutal beheading video of a group of Coptic Christians yesterday, have left the situation even more fractured.","Massive rescue of a dozen stricken vessels last night near Lampedusa .

"When Michelle, now 46, from North Wales, met her husband John in 1993, she was instantly smitten. The divorced single mother of three small children, she says their whirlwind romance and marriage a year later in 1994 was like 'a dream come true'. But 20 years on and her dream had turned into a nightmare, when John ran off with her daughter-in-law, Liz. Distraught: Michelle was left furious when her husband of 20 years ran off with their daughter-in-law . Now Michelle says she will never forgive the man she once called husband - and says she is even more furious because of the hurt he caused to her son, also called John. Michelle's story began in 1993 when she was going through a divorce from her first husband. A chance meeting in a shop led to love and she was soon smitten. 'There was an immediate spark between us,' she remembers. 'He had what I thought were kind eyes. He was young, attractive, made me laugh. 'I just felt so comfortable with him. I felt like I could trust him. I was wary about introducing him to the kids but they just really got on. It was nice to be around each other.' Months after meeting, John moved in with Michelle and her three children and yes than a year later, the couple married in what Michelle describes as a 'fairytale' wedding. 'It was all I imagined a proper wedding would be,' she says. Michelle's three children, all of whom were adopted by her new husband, were equally delighted, with John proving a kind and caring stepfather. 'He was the only dad that I knew,' explains Michelle's eldest son John. 'I was quite close to him. We used to go out and play football and do things as a family.' Unsuspecting: John and Michelle had always been happy but that changed when Liz came on the scene . 'We just got on with life, enjoyed what we had and watched the kids grow up,' adds Michelle. 'I think we did good job with the kids.' But all that changed when John Jr, then aged 20, met Liz, a single mother of two who he would go on to marry. Determined to provide for his new family, John Jr enrolled on a osteopathy course at Surrey University, planning to sell his home in Wales and bring his family to live with him in England. The move was to have fateful consequences. 'I moved down there, put the house up for sale, and was waiting for it to sell before she and the kids moved in,' he explains. 'It did put a strain on our relationship.' Meanwhile, Michelle and husband John had also been having problems and as Michelle puts it, the couple 'weren't happy together any more'. She had also begun to suspect that the relationship between her husband and daughter-in-law wasn't as innocent as it seemed. Betrayed: Michelle with her husband John, son John Jr and daughter-in-law Liz at John Jr's wedding . On Shrove Tuesday 2013, her suspicions were fuelled by an episode at her home in which the pair indulged in a play fight, squirting cream at each other and 'slipping and sliding all over the floor'. 'It didn't look right,' says Michelle. 'It looked like they were flirting. They never acted like that before. They'd never behaved like that. They didn't even really get on. It just looked like a new relationship.' Horrified, she decided to take a closer look at the phone bill and soon discovered that one number, Liz's, kept popping up. 'I questioned my husband about it and asked him why there were all these phonecalls and what was going on between him and Liz,' she recalls. 'He laughed and said I was mad. I rang my son and told him to come home.' John Jr, however, didn't share his mother's suspicions. 'I didn't believe for one second that there was something going on,' he says. 'I stuck up for my ex and my dad. I was perfectly fine with those two meeting up and talking.' Matters between John Sr and Michelle continued to deteriorate, with the couple leading increasingly separate lives. Eventually, she asked him to leave and John Jr stepped in to offer his father a place to stay. 'I said he could come and stay at ours,' he explains. 'He said he didn't want to come in case he put a strain on our relationship. I insisted.' Furious: Michelle says the worst part has been the pain John Jr has been put through . The decision to allow his father to stay was to prove deadly for his marriage. A few weeks after John Sr moved in with Liz and John Jr, he got a text from his wife saying the marriage was over. 'I got a message off Liz basically saying, ""Me and your dad are seeing each other, we've talked about it and me and you are no longer together. We're going to make a go of a relationship"". 'About 10 minutes later, I got a message off my dad saying. ""I've heard Liz has told you that we're seeing each other. Nothing happened beforehand - it only just happened now"".' Beside himself, John Jr phoned his mother, who was equally distraught. 'It was horrible,' she says. 'I couldn't believe he would do that. 'It was hard to believe that the guy I lived with for 20 years could do something so nasty and then come out with comments like, '""We're doing nothing wrong"" and ""He's not my son"".' 15 months on, Liz and John Sr are still together and although Michelle is finally moving on from what happened, John Jr is still reeling. 'I lost my wife, my dad, the kids and my house,' he says. 'The whole lot. I have nothing else.' Michelle, meanwhile, remains angry about how her son was treated. 'It really killed me that he'd done that to my son,' she says. 'I find it really hard that my son suffered so much. 'I never thought he would do this to us or hurt us both so much.'","Michelle, 46, from North Wales was abandoned by her husband of 20 years .

"Italian anaesthetist Danaje Ahmid Raza, 56, pretended to be paraplegic for three years after staging accident in his hospital . A 56-year-old doctor pretended to be paraplegic for three years after staging an accident in his hospital so he could secure a 1.2million euro (£888,441) payout. Italian anaesthetist Danaje Ahmid Raza, 56, originally from Iran, faked falling down the stairs in 2012 and claimed the accident forced him into a wheelchair. But suspicions were aroused when he was seen driving, renovating his villa, pushing a supermarket trolley and going to the bar with friends, Il Messaggero reported. Police footage  captured him being pushed in his wheelchair before nimbly getting to his feet, placing his walking sticks in the boot and driving away. The doctor claimed he suffered a loss of vision in his right eye and a severe pain in his spine and was awarded 1.2 million euro in compensation and a 5,000 euro a month lifetime pension. But clinical tests revealed that the fraudster had not suffered any visible injuries to his spine and found his muscle tone was not altered in any way. Mr Raza was arrested by Turin police after a detention order was issued by prosecutor Antonio Rinaudo. Il Messaggero said he was arrested: 'Because the man went to the bar with friends, carried weights, took care of the renovation of his villa, loaded a bag of cement on the trunk of the car, pushed the supermarket trolley and was always  sure-footed and agile.

"An 87-year-old has forgiven the fraudster who swindled £7,500 of her pension money by pretending to have throat cancer - and is now desperate to see him again. Margaret Hounslea, from Merseyside, even wants to overturn the restraining order placed on conman Terence Dixon, despite the fact he has fleeced her twice for money. Dixon, 53, was jailed for 27 months in November  and ordered not to contact his victim until 2019. Margaret Hounslea, 87 (left), from Wallasey, Merseyside, wants to overturn a restraining order imposed on Terence Dixon (right), despite the fact he stole £7,500 of her pension money by pretending to have cancer . The court heard it was the second time Dixon - whom Mrs Hounslea refers to as her 'grandson' - had been sent to prison for stealing money from her. But Mrs Hounslea, who spent her life visiting prisons to rehabilitate criminals, wants the order removed so she can be reunited with her 'friend'. Without children of her own, the retired scientist keeps a 'bedroom' for Dixon at home and has kept a framed photo on him on top of her TV since the pair met 27 years ago. The Ministry of Justice has now indicated that Mrs Hounslea could have the ban overturned, but would need to make a fresh legal bid to lift it in front of the same judge who imposed the order. She said: 'Yes, he has misbehaved. He shouldn't have told me he had cancer. He'll get the sharp end of my tongue when I see him next. 'But I'm being punished as much as he is. He was my shopper, the person who changed the lightbulbs, who did jobs in the house. He cut my hedge. 'I still regard him as my grandson. I want the prohibition order lifted so he can come home. She added: 'I won't be alive in five years' time. I miss him. I need a friend.' The pensioner, who spent her life visiting prisons, calls Dixon her 'grandson' and says she misses him . Dixon was jailed in November last year after it emerged that he had persuaded Mrs Hounslea to transfer up to £80 a week into his bank account, leaving her with just £35 a week to live on. He claimed he was penniless, but in reality was receiving £630 a month in state benefits and living with his wife. The court heard how Dixon, who had started relying on her for money in 2007, also once arrived at Mrs Hounslea's home  and found she had  been lying on the floor for a day after a bad fall. But, callously, he just put her in a rocking chair with a bottle of water and biscuits and left her there alone, saying he had to dash to London for more cancer treatment. Two days later, he contacted Mrs Hounslea's friend, who arrived to find the pensioner dehydrated. Dixon turned up briefly but then left, claiming he had to rush off for an operation to remove half his liver. It was while the pensioner was in hospital that the friend raised suspicions about Dixon. When interviewed by police, he admitted he had mistakenly allowed her to believe he had cancer but had actually used her money to buy clothes and fund his lifestyle. After pleading guilty in November to the fraud, Dixon was lambasted by a judge who told him: 'You are frankly a disgrace. 'I hope you are ashamed till the day you die. She is a very pleasant, compassionate lady.' But Mrs Hounslea said: 'He shouldn't tell lies, but it's not criminal. I would have happily given him that money if he needed it. 'I wouldn't have gone into prisons, and done that job, if I didn't have forgiveness for people. We are all sinners. People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.' Mrs Hounslea met Dixon while working at HMP Spring Hill in Buckinghamshire and the pair struck up an unlikely friendship. The former school laboratory technician said: 'When I met Terry, the prison officer mistakenly referred to me as his gran, and that was the start. 'I told him, ""OK, I'll be your grandmother"".' But Dixon, who has various convictions for dishonesty, betrayed her trust in 2006 by stealing two cheques from her and cashing them in for £180. He was jailed for the fraud but Mrs Hounslea forgave him and their friendship continued. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Decisions on varying or discharging such orders are for judges and magistrates, who will make their decision based on the full facts of the individual case they are hearing.'","Prison visitor Margaret Hounslea met conman Terence Dixon 27 years ago .

"Britain must start to prepare for the impact of Greece’s inevitable exit from the euro, Kenneth Clarke warned yesterday. The former Tory Chancellor branded the new government in Athens ‘latter-day Trotskyites’, and said there was no way their demands could be met. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his hard-Left Syriza party have promised to slash repayments on Greece’s £185billion bailout and reverse the harsh austerity measures imposed. Scroll down for video . 'Grexit': Former Tory Chancellor Kenneth Clarke (above, speaking on Sunday Politics yesterday) branded the new government in Athens ‘latter-day Trotskyites’, and said there was no way their demands could be met . Protesters: Around 15,000 people gathered in central Athens last night to support the newly elected government’s push for a better deal on Greece’s debt . Plans include re-hiring thousands of civil servants, raising the minimum wage, imposing swingeing wealth taxes and providing free electricity for the poor. But the demands have led to deadlock with Germany and other EU countries, which are insisting Athens must fulfil its commitments. Around 15,000 people gathered in central Athens last night to support the newly elected government’s push for a better deal on Greece’s debt.

New government: Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (pictured) and his hard-Left Syriza party have promised to slash repayments on Greece’s £185billion bailout and reverse the harsh austerity measures imposed . Similar rallies are taking place in several Greek cities and about forty other solidarity gatherings are planned across Europe and in Australia, Brazil and the US. Asked whether the standoff would lead to a Greek exit - so-called Grexit - Mr Clarke told the BBC’s Sunday Politics show: ‘Just judging from the public statements of these latter-day Trotskyites who appear to have won the election in Greece, I can’t see how that can be reconciled. ‘I hope a very great deal of work is going on to minimise the impact on financial markets, on the United Kingdom - because it affects us just as much anybody else in the western world - to make sure that any knock-on effects of from their exit are minimalised, and knock-on effects on the Greek people, who are going to suffer more ... are also minimised as well. ‘I can’t see how you can sensibly avoid the Greeks defaulting and the Greeks having to leave the Eurozone. Concerns: PM David Cameron (left) and Chancellor George Osborne (right) have warned that the standoff with Greece - and the prospect of a new Eurozone crisis - is the greatest current threat to the British economy . ‘It’s not anything to do with just the Germans, I can’t see why any other states should take a huge multi-billion pound hit again for the Greeks so they can hire more civil servants, raise their minimum wage and scrap all their labour market laws.’ David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have warned that the standoff with Greece – and the prospect of a new Eurozone crisis - is the greatest current threat to the British economy. The Prime Minister held crisis talks with the Bank of England and senior Whitehall officials last week to make contingency plans to deal with the impact of Greece crashing out of the euro. Experts believe Greece could go bankrupt in a matter of weeks unless it can reach a deal with its main creditors, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.","Kenneth Clarke says there is no way government's demands can be met .

"Satellite images are being used to monitor how ocean acidification is changing the world's seas. For the first time, scientists have been able to obtain a global picture of how rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are affecting the oceans. Using thermal cameras and microwave sensors mounted on satellites orbiting 435 miles above Earth, the experts said it's possible to assess which areas of the ocean are most at risk of acidification. Scientists have used satellite data to map the alkalinity of the world's oceans for the first time. The image above shows the average level of alkalinity over the past five years with blue marking water that is more acidic. By using satellite data, scientists can obtain live information as the ocean changes . As the acidity of seawater rises, it can change the chemistry of the oceans and is expected to have a profound affect on marine animals. A recent study funded by the European Union found that ocean acidification is already having a profound impact on herring in the Baltic Sea. This heavily fished area has already seen pH values of 7.2 being recorded, so scientists wanted to see what impact it was having. They hatched eggs taken from herring caught off the coast of Norway and reared them in outdoor tanks with different levels of aciditiy. Those reared in tanks with pH values of 7.45 and 7.07 showed more signs of organ damage than those in low acidity water. They had more damage in the liver, kidneys and their find were often abnormally shaped while they tended to develop more slowly. After 39 days, the fish larvae in the medium acidity tank weighed 30 per cent less than those in normal waters while those in the high acidity tank weighted 40 per cent less. The researchers said that these smaller fish would be more at risk of being preyed upon and are less able to survive. Shellfish will struggle to find enough of the minerals they use to make their shells while the fish that feed on them will also suffer. Dr Jamie Shutler, an ocean scientist at the University of Exeter, said: 'It can be both difficult and expensive to take year-round direct measurements in such inaccessible locations. 'We are pioneering these techniques so  we can monitor large areas of the Earth’s oceans allowing us to quickly and easily identify those areas most at risk from the increasing acidification.' Currently scientists have to rely on measurements taken by instruments left in the oceans and research vessels around the world to build up a picture of ocean acidification. By using satellite data, scientists can instead obtain live information as the ocean changes rather than snapshots in time. In a paper for the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters, the researchers explained  they could combine data from a number of satellites to watch how rising carbon dioxide levels affect the oceans. They are using the European's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity sensor (SMOS), which was launched in 2009, and Nasa's Aquarius satellite that launched in 2011. It is estimated that around a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere is absorbed by the ocean. A recent study by the European Union found that ocean acidification is already having a profound impact on herring in the Baltic Sea, for example. The experts are using the European's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity sensor (SMOS), which was launched in 2009, and Nasa's Aquarius satellite that launched in 2011. Coral reefs like the one  off the coast of Bali (pictured) are expected to suffer as ocean acidification makes it harder for them to form . Currently scientists have to rely on measurements taken by instruments left in the oceans and research vessels around the world to build up a picture of ocean acidification. The researchers combined satellite data with algorithms to calculate acidification in each of the oceans of the world shown above . Lead researcher Dr Peter Land, from the Plymouth Marine Laboratory, said the new satellite techniques would allow scientists to monitor vulnerable areas such as the Arctic seas, the Bay of Bengal and the Caribbean simultaneously. He said: 'In recent years, great advances have been made in the global provision of satellite and in situ data. 'It is now time to evaluate how to make the most of these new data sources to help us monitor ocean acidification, and to establish where satellite data can make the best contribution.' Prawns (stock image) could taste less appetising in the future if the oceans grow more acidic . Marine biologists have found that shellfish take on a sour flavour if they are reared in slightly acidified sea water. They warn that as the planet's oceans grow more acidic, due to rising carbon dioxide levels, many of our favourite seafoods could become less appetising. Climate change experts predict that over the next century, the levels of the world's oceans could drop from pH8 to pH7.5. Many have warned this could lead to shrimps and prawns struggling to build the shells and skeletons they need to survive. Now, in the first study to test how ocean acidification could impact the taste of seafood, researchers at the University of Gothenberg and Plymouth University found it will make them sour. During tests, shrimp raised in water with a lower pH were 2.6 times more likely to be rated as the worst tasting. While those reared in the less acidic water were 3.4 times more likely to be judged the tastiest. Also the 63 per cent of the shrimp from the acidic water died during the three weeks. The results could have profound implications for the seafood industry as it suggests shellfish will become harder as their numbers dwindle, but also demand could decrease as people lose their taste for them.","Researchers at the University of Exeter have mapped world's oceans's pH .

"Online blocks on child porn have led to a nearly 70 per cent drop in searches for the material . Online blocks on child porn have led to a nearly 70 per cent drop in searches for the material, a study has revealed. The first research to examine the global impact of blocking child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) found there was a 'precipitous drop' in searches after the measures were put in place. Google and Bing, Microsoft's search engine, agreed in November 2013 to remove child abuse images from search results and show warnings when certain search terms were used. David Cameron had called on search providers to stop failing in their 'moral duty' to protect children and announced that households with children would automatically have filters on their internet service that parents would have to 'opt in' to lift – a victory for the Daily Mail's campaign to protect children from online porn. The US study, published in the journal Child Abuse & Neglect, analysed search traffic levels for keywords commonly used by people searching for CSEM between January 2011 and August last year. It found searches for such material dropped by 67 per cent in the final year studied – the period following the introduction of the blocks. Research author Professor Chad Steel, of George Mason University, Virginia, said the results showed 'technical controls aimed at prevention can be effective'. He said: 'The blocking efforts by Microsoft and Google…had a rapid and significant impact on child sexual exploitation material searches. The results show a precipitous drop in such searches.' But the study found such searches on Russian search engine Yandex – which has no such blocks – had continued at the same rate. Possession of child porn is not illegal in Russia and its distribution and production is only illegal when it relates to children under the age of 14. The lack of blocks on some international search engines meant it was still possible to find illegal material. Professor Steel added: 'Searchers from Russia and other locations where child pornography possession is not criminalised have continued to use these services. Additionally, the same lax enforcement environment has allowed searchers from the US to utilise Yandex with little fear of detection or referral to US law enforcement from the Russian authorities.' Nearly a third of all searches for CSEM came from smartphones or mobile devices such as tablets. Last week it was revealed that the number of children being counselled through ChildLine about online sexual abuse has more than doubled in a year. The charity said it carried out 2,842 counselling sessions on the issue in 2013-14, a 168 per cent increase on 2012-13. It had also seen an 87 per cent increase in the number of counselling sessions about online bullying. Last month the country's most senior judge Lord Thomas said the 'peddling of pornography on the internet' was fuelling violent crime. Google and Bing, Microsoft's search engine, agreed in November 2013 to remove child abuse images from search results .","Google and Bing agreed  to remove child abuse images from search results .

"Justine Sacco found herself trending worldwide on Twitter thanks to an ill-thought-out message she intended to be amusing . A PR consultant has revealed how a tweet she sent to amuse her 170 followers ended up making her a global hate figure and ruined her life. Justine Sacco's ill-thought-out message, sent before she boarded a flight to South Africa in December 2013 read: 'Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!' It cost the 30-year-old from New York her job and her reputation after it was re-tweeted by tech blogger Sam Biddle to his 15,000 followers. Tens of thousands of people responded in outrage accusing Justine of being ignorant and racist and calling for her to be sacked from her role as the senior director of corporate communications at IAC. With her phone turned off during her 11-hour flight, Justine had no idea of the furore her tweet had caused or that people were now baying for her blood. Unbeknown to her, her employers responded with the statement: 'This is an outrageous, offensive comment. Employee in question currently unreachable on an into flight.' The hashtag '#HasJustineLandedYet' began trending worldwide as people were desperate to see how she would react to the thousands of angry tweets and the fact her job was now under threat. A friend of Justine's deleted her account but the damage was already done. She was subsequently sacked and the public humiliation didn't stop there. People continued to troll her and more dirt was dug from her deleted Twitter account with BuzzFeed posting an article called '16 Tweets Justine Sacco Regrets'. Now more than a year on, Justine has spoken of the negative impact the incident has had on her life and how she never intended the tweet to be taken literally. 'Only an insane person would think that white people don't get AIDS,' she told best-selling British writer Jon Ronson as she features in his latest book So You've Been Publicly Shamed. 'I thought there was no way that anyone could possibly think it was literal.' She added that she bitterly regrets posting the comment: 'Unfortunately, I am not a character on ‘South Park’ or a comedian, so I had no business commenting on the epidemic in such a politically incorrect manner on a public platform. Justine's tweet, pictured here, enraged thousands of people who said she was racist and ignorant . 'To put it simply, I wasn't trying to raise awareness of AIDS or p*** off the world or ruin my life. 'Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the third world. I was making fun of that bubble.' Jon, whose previous works include The Men Who Stare At Goats and The Psychopath Test, interviewed Justine as he sought to investigate the impact a social media storm has on the ordinary people lambasted. Describing his motivation for the book, he wrote in the New York Times: 'As time passed, I watched these shame campaigns multiply, to the point that they targeted not just powerful institutions and public figures but really anyone perceived to have done something offensive. 'I also began to marvel at the disconnect between the severity of the crime and the gleeful savagery of the punishment. It almost felt as if shamings were now happening for their own sake, as if they were following a script.' Justine tells how her public shaming left her jobless and affected her health and wellbeing. She said: 'I cried out my body weight in the first 24 hours. It was incredibly traumatic. You don't sleep. You wake up in the middle of the night forgetting where you are.' While she regrets sending her tweet, she's also resentful of the way its interpretation led to her downfall - and how people she didn't even know seemed to take pleasure in her misfortune. Jon Ronson, left, has interviewed Justine for his latest book So You've Been Publicly Shamed, right . 'I had a great career, and I loved my job, and it was taken away from me,and there was a lot of glory in that. Everybody else was very happy about that,' she said. She added that it has also ruined her love life: 'I'm single; so it's not like I can date, because we Google everyone we might date. That's been taken away from me too.' Justine told Jon that she realised she 'couldn't sit at home and watch movies every day and cry and feel sorry for myself' forever and she needed to 'make steps to reclaim my identity and remind myself of who I am'. As a result, she now has a new job and is wary of what she shares on social media. She told Jon other than contributing to his book, she won't be speaking out about her story again. Shame: Miss Sacco pictured after landing in South Africa as the scandal broke . 'Anything that puts the spotlight on me is a negative,' she told him. In his book, Jon compares social media condemnation to the public floggings of centuries ago. He urges people to consider what they post online both in regards to sharing their own views or commenting on the views of others. He said of Justine's journey: 'When I first met her, she was desperate to tell the tens of thousands of people who tore her apart how they had wronged her and to repair what remained of her public persona. 'But perhaps she had now come to understand that her shaming wasn't really about her at all. 'Social media is so perfectly designed to manipulate our desire for approval, and that is what led to her undoing. 'Her tormentors were instantly congratulated as they took Sacco down, bit by bit, and so they continued to do so. Their motivation was much the same as Sacco's own - a bid for the attention of strangers - as she milled about Heathrow, hoping to amuse people she couldn't see.' Jon Ronson's book So You've Been Publicly Shamed will be published by Picador on 12th March .","Justine Sacco, 30, from New York, became a global hate figure .

She can carry off everything from a chic LBD to a more traditional printed smock dress or even a football kit.' In January, Harper looked trendy in a tweed coat by Little Marc Jacobs while scooting around London . The young fashion icon knows how to complete the look; with a  pair of Doc Martens, left, and a chic top knot . She may be the youngest member of the family but Harper has a mind of her own when it comes to getting dressed, her father recently revealed. '[Harper] gets her outfit ready the night before and then she gets up in the morning, we go down to get her ready and she changes her mind,' the athlete said on The Jonathan Ross Show. He added:'Then I'm in the room with Harper trying to pick out an outfit and anything which I pick out, which I think looks great, she puts back in.' Lulu Rayne commented: 'Ever since we were first introduced to Harper Beckham, she's had a style which many adults would aspire to. Her look is girly and effortlessly co-ordinated. She opts for outfits by chic, mainly traditional brands including Burberry and Bonpoint.' David recently admitted that Harper gets her outfit ready the night before and then she gets up in the morning, they go down to get her ready and she changes her mind . Sharing her tips for copying Harper's look for less, she said: 'Victoria loves to dress Harper in beautiful dresses, which don't need to cost a fortune. 'They can be finished off with a simple cardigan or a chic cape, which can be used to accessorise any number of outfits. Finish the look off with an adorable bow for the top knot.' Isabel Garreton, founder and designer of her eponymous childrenswear line which is loved by the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker’s children, added: 'Harper is definitely informed by her mother’s sense of style and commitment to elegance; think simple lines, good fabrics' Another toddler hogging headlines is Kim and Kanye West's daughter, North. Lulu believes that Harper wins the battle of the trendiest tots, though. She said: 'I think it's a shame that Kim and Kanye dress North West exclusively in black and dark colours. Little girls love to wear colour and it doesn't have to be the traditional gawdy pinks. For SS15 there are lots of great citrus colours for girls, I particularly love the colour palette from Roksanda Blossom's SS15 collection, which contains lots of yellow and orange. 'These colours would look great on North West so let's see some colour, Kimye!' Lulu thinks it's a shame that Kimye dress North West exclusively in black and dark colours. 'Little girls love to wear colour and it doesn't have to be the traditional gawdy pinks,' she said .","Harper, three, has been wearing Chloe designs before they hit the shops .

"A private school in Nashville has reportedly turned away a pair of potential students because their parents are gay. The Davidson Academy had allegedly told Brian Copeland they'd host him on a tour of the school he was considering for his children but the visit was cancelled when it was discovered he was raising them with his same-sex partner. Copeland has a son entering pre-kindergarten and an 8 month old daughter he wanted to send to the nondenominational school. The Davidson Academy told Brian Copeland and Greg Bullard they couldn't teach their children because they were a same-sex couple . This rejection letter from the school cited their admissions policy regarding 'unacceptable lifestyle conduct' The school has no affiliation with any specific church but says it operates in the Christian tradition. The Tennessean reports that a Jan. 14 letter told Copeland 'another education provider would be a better fit for your children. Therefore, we cannot grant admission to your children.' They had not yet officially applied for admission. Copeland, a real estate agent, is married to Greg Bullard. Bullard is the pastor of Covenant of the Cross. The pair wed in California in 2013 and have raised the children from birth. Bullard put the letter on his Facebook page, being shared more than 100 times. 'I am so disappointed in my high school, Davidson Academy,' wrote Toby Compton, executive director of the Metro Sports Authority. 'Sad, truly sad. Hurt deeply and I can't sleep.' The couple, who have raised the children from birth, wed in 2013 . Bullard said he posted the rejection to 'let my friends know that discrimination affects people you know and love and still hurts no matter how many times you go through it. We chose this school because of its rigorous faith-based K-12 academics and extracurricular activities; and, a friend with a son there asked them if a family like ours would be allowed and was told yes. After a phone conversation, fully disclosing we are a two-dad family, an appointment was set for us. I receive this letter canceling our appointment without even getting a chance.' He later said he didn't want to 'harm the school' only show that 'discrimination and inequality is alive and well.' 'I want to make that very clear,' he added. 'We want our children to have a Christian education, and we're finding that very, very hard.' Davidson's administrators have yet to respond to media requests. The pair desperately want their children raised in a Christian school but are finding it difficult . However The Christian Examiner notes that the letter cited the school's handbook and admissions policy. It states: 'Davidson Academy has the right and responsibility to do everything possible to ensure that its expressed purposes, mission, and beliefs continue in their highest traditions and are not harmed, compromised, or hindered by unacceptable lifestyle conduct on the part of its students, parents or guardians ...' The couple say they have no plans to seek legal action against the school. A rep from the Tennessee Equality Project said that if there had been any other incidents of a Nashville school rejecting a student based on their parent's orientation, they hadn't heard of it. But simply seeing the numbers of people sharing the letter online show how mcuh the 'conversation has significantly changed in Nashville.' 'Discriminating against parents, in this case, has an effect on the child,' said the group's executive director Chris Sanders. 'And I think maybe that's what is so striking to so many straight allies. Do you hit an entire family if you have a disagreement with the parents? That's why this has legs. That's why this has power. That's why this has emotional impact.'","The Davidson Academy had told Brian Copeland and husband Greg Bullard that another school would be 'a better fit for your children'

"Under pressure: Education Secretary Nicky Morgan could approve plans for the first new grammar school in 50 years within weeks . Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is under pressure to approve plans for the first new grammar school in 50 years within weeks. Senior Cabinet colleagues want her to sign off a selective satellite school in Kent before the general election. And sources believe Mrs Morgan is on the verge of agreeing the move, which was rejected by her predecessor Michael Gove. She is understood to be sympathetic to the argument that existing grammars should be allowed to expand by opening satellite schools. If approved, the application could open the floodgates for similar schemes elsewhere. It is another departure in style for the minister dubbed ‘Ms U-turn’ for her less radical approach than Mr Gove, who shunned the expansion of selective education in favour of free schools and academies. Tory support for grammars is growing, and 60 MPs have now backed a campaign to persuade David Cameron to clear the way for a new generation of such schools. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon and Home Secretary Theresa May are also strong supporters of plans for new grammars in their constituencies. The proposals at the centre of the move are by the Weald of Kent girls’ grammar school in Tonbridge, which wants to open a new campus nine miles away in Sevenoaks. Mrs Morgan and schools minister Lord Nash met last week with officials from Kent County Council and school trustees. ‘We want to give them [those proposing the new school] every opportunity to get this right,’ said an ally of the Education Secretary.Mr Fallon, the MP for Sevenoaks, is understood to expect Mrs Morgan to approve the plans before May’s general election. The new school – which already has planning permission and a £16million building fund – would admit 90 pupils a year from 2016. County officials say it complies with current law, which says any new grammar must be a satellite to an existing institution. Another proposal for a satellite grammar in Maidenhead, Berkshire, is backed by Mrs May, the area’s MP. Research for the grassroots party campaign group Conservative Voice has found that 84 per cent of people think grammars are a valuable asset. Supporting move: Among the Tory MPs to back a campaign for more grammars are former defence secretary Liam Fox (left), and former leadership contender David Davis (right). Two thirds of parents say they would enter their child for an 11-plus exam and send them to a grammar school if they passed. As education secretary in the 1970s, Margaret Thatcher allowed councils to decide whether their schools should remain selective, and there are now around 160 left in England, mostly in the home counties. Among the Tory MPs to back a campaign for more grammars are former defence secretary Liam Fox, and former leadership contender David Davis. Dr Fox said diversity in education should be ‘extended wherever possible’, while Mr Davis said the grammar system was ‘one of the most transformative’ policies’. Esher and Walton MP Dominic Raab, a member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘Grammar schools (were) creating a ladder of opportunity for talented and hard-working youngsters from council estates and rural backwaters.’","Education Secretary could approve first new grammar school in 50 years .

"Serving 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains, London's latest single-item menu restaurant the Porridge Cafe is set to open its doors in March. It follows in the footsteps of the UK's other single-item restaurants - Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe. Porridge Cafe is the brainchild of Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington, the founders of food truck business The Bow Street Kitchen, and will serve porridge made from 11 different grains including rolled oats, barley, quinoa, spelt and arborio rice. Savoury porridge of grain spelt cooked with beetroot juice and served with feta, capers, and a poached egg . Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. The cafe serves both sweet and savoury versions of the traditional breakfast dish. While the sweet options are fairly typical - apple, vanilla and hazelnut; strawberry, cinnamon and cranberry and raspberry, peach and almond - the savoury toppings veer towards the unusual. Made with grain spelt, arborio rice or grain buckwheat and quinoa, they feature slow-roasted chicken, leek and cream cheese; bacon, avocado and roasted tomato; and salami, pecorino and porcini mushroom. 'Our basic porridge will match Pret's prices,' Mr Williamson said. 'Customers will be able to top their basic porridge with sugar, jams or honey for £2.35. Grain buckwheat cooked with pomegranate juice and cardamom and served with orange slices, dates and dark chocolate shavings . 'The healthy and sweet porridges - with fruits and seeds -  start at £4 while the savoury risottos start at £5.50 for the vegetarian ones. 'The most expensive will be the ones with meat, with prices ranging from between £6 and £7.' The inspiration behind their latest venture came about when the duo were in Scandinavia. Mr Williamson said: 'We were in Copenhagen and we noticed there was  a lot of great porridge. We tasted different grains – in Scandinavia they use rye, buckwheat, spelt, barley and quinoa to make their porridge. ‘You would think we were sick of the stuff but the different varieties and incarnations are endless. 'We love how versatile it is and hope we can make people realise that porridge can be so much more than oats and water.’ High fibre, high protein and low GI, porridge has long been known as the perfect food as part of a balanced diet. Blueberry and apple compote rye porridge served with fresh blueberries, stem ginger and pumpkin and sunflower seeds (left) and banana, blackcurrant and peanut butter porridge (right) Porridge Cafe is the brainchild of Nik Wiliamson (pictured)  and his business partner Elly Harrington . ‘Eating porridge regularly can also help reduce stress due to the presence of magnesium in many grains,' Mr Williamson added. The partners discovered the huge amount of grains that are used to make porridge all over the world, along with the different methods to make it. They finally decided on 11 grains which they think ‘taste great’. ‘All in all we've chosen 11 grains we think taste great and have some really great health benefits,' he said. ‘The recipes we've developed are sweet, healthy and savoury flavours.' The cafe will open on 2 March on Paul Street, near Old Street station, London, and will serve from 7am to 6pm daily with a daily changing menu. At weekends there will be a brunch menu featuring three savoury and two sweet choices. Initially a pop-up, if the concept proves to be a success, it will become a permanent fixture. 'Our hope is in we will see whether people like it in the initial month and if they will buy our porridge,' Mr Williamson said. 'If it's successful we may extend in the location for a few more months and we will probably widen the menu so there will be other dishes involved.' The Porridge Cafe follows on the heels of London's Cereal Killer and Belfast's Simply Crisp cafe. Just crisps: Businessman Andrew McMenamin opened Belfast's Simply Crispy in January 2015 . Alan and Gary Keery of The Cereal Killer Cafe in Brick Lane serve 120 cereals with 20 toppings and 12 milks . Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his  pop-up going for just four weeks. But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open until at least March, and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or even London. 'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said. In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal.","The Porridge Cafe serves 25 different types of breakfast staple .

"A 23-year-old man and his parents have been left with a  debilitating gastric illness after falling ill during a dream family holiday to Egypt almost two years ago. The Wheeldon family, from Hoddesdon, Herts, travelled to the Resta Grand Resort in Marsa Alam for what they hoped would be a relaxing two-week break in July 2013. But the family became alarmed at the apparent lack of food hygiene when Reece, his parents, two siblings and his girlfriend fell ill with severe diarrhoea, stomach cramps and headaches shortly after their arrival at the resort. Reece Wheeldon, pictured here with his girlfriend, was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome after suffering debilitating food poisoning on a dream family holiday to Egypt two years ago . Since returning from their nightmare holiday, Reece has been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, while his parents continue to suffer from painful side effects. 'We were all concerned by the food hygiene standards and we felt that the facilities were shabby and not what you might expect from a five-star resort,' says Reece, who works as an administrator. 'We tried to make the best of things, but in the second week it was as if we were dropping like flies, one by one falling ill with horrendous symptoms. It was an absolute nightmare.' The family believes that under-cooked  chicken from a barbecue may have been to blame for their illness. The family of six were travelled to the Resta Grand Resort in Marsa Alam for what they hoped would be a relaxing two-week break in July 2013 . 'I have been diagnosed with IBS which means I now have to be more careful about the foods I eat and it can be very restrictive and my mum and dad have also still got some symptoms.' adds Reece. The tour operator TUI UK Ltd has now admitted liability, allowing the family to pursue a legal complaint and seek to compensation for their misery. 'We are pleased that the tour operator has admitted liability as it means we are now one step closer to gaining justice,' say Reece. 'However, nothing can turn back the clock and we hope that improvements to hygiene practices at the hotel are made to prevent another family from having to suffer like we have.'","Wheeldon family fell ill with diarrhoea, stomach cramps and headaches .

"A man and a woman who had 'known each other just minutes' left dozens of shoppers in California horrified after they stripped off and had sex in front of a crowded prom dress store in broad daylight.

"Police in Florida are desperately searching for a 33-year-old waitress who went missing last Thursday after going to a bar in Ybor City. Apryl Foster was last seen walking alone at around 2.20am Thursday after spending time with a man at a karaoke bar. On Monday, her parents, Peggy and Craig Beman, made a tearful plea to the public begging for help in finding Apryl. Scroll down for video . Where is Apryl? April Foster, 33 (left and right), a waitress from Florida, went missing early Thursday morning after leaving a karaoke bar in Ybor City . Worried sick: Peggy Beman, Apryl's mother, said her daughter is very reliable, and she would not have taken off without telling her first . 'We know she's not a perfect person, but she has been reliable,' her mother said during a press conference aired by ABC Action News. Apryl Foster was reported missing by her family Friday morning. Tampa police say that while they have found no evidence to suggest foul play, they are concerned for the woman’s safety because it is unlike her to disappear without telling her family and friends. Police say Apryl left work at Ulele restaurant in Tampa at 11pm Wednesday and met up with friends after at the Bad Monkey bar in Ybor City. She left the establishment at 12.06am with a man she met at the bar, and the two headed to the Double Decker karaoke bar next door. The couple briefly left the bar together and then returned. At 2.19am, Foster and her mystery companion walked out of the bar a second time. The 33-year-old waitress headed alone east, while the man headed on foot west down 7th Avenue. She has not been heard from since. Peggy Beman said she and her daughter are extremely close, and not a day goes by that they don’t communicate with one another. Foster is an aspiring singer who works at a server and staff trainer at Ulele restaurant in Tampa . Last sighting: Apryl was last seen leaving Double Decker karaoke bar in Ybor City, Florida, Thursday morning . Miss Foster, an aspiring singer who works as a server and staff trainer at the Ulele restaurant in Tampa, would always call her mother in the morning and at night to let her know how she was doing, and recently the two have started exchanging text messages as well. Mrs Beman said her daughter would not have taken off without telling her first, and she would not have left her cats, who were like children to her, alone and without food for such an extended period of time. ‘This just isn't her,’ said Foster's distraught mother. ‘We know something happened.’ Peggy Beman added that her daughter is someone who's never missed a day's work, not even when she was sick with the flu recently. By Friday afternoon, a sheriff's deputy accessed Foster's apartment in Brandon to perform a welfare check, but the home was empty and he found nothing suspicious. Investigators have since interviewed the man who was last seen with Foster Thursday morning, talked to her boyfriend, as well as her to estranged husband. They say everyone have been cooperative. Heartbroken: Peggy and Craig Beman, Apryl's parents, made a tearful plea for help in finding their missing daughter . Police also have obtained surveillance video from the vicinity of the two bars in Ybor City, but so far they have found nothing to raise a red flag. Apryl Foster’s vehicle is described as a red 2009 Chevy Aveo hatchback with license plate number K125YC and a 'Huskers' vanity plate. Peggy Beman revealed that a little over two months ago, Apryl felt like she needed to get away to clear her head. But before heading to Orlando, she called her mother and let her know that she will be temporarily turning off her cellphone. She also provided her with the name of the hotel where she was staying and promised to switch on her phone later that afternoon. 'That's how informative she was,' the woman recalled. Mrs Beman said the last time she and Apryl spoke on the phone was at around 11pm Wednesday. Her daughter was searching for a part for her broken windshield wiper and asked Peggy to go online and help her look for it. Police have been scouring the area in search of the woman, even flying a helicopter over the route from Ybor City to Brandon. They also have checked her bank account for any activity, but have found none. They are now waiting to subpoena her credit card account. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-873-TIPS or Tampa Police 813-231-6130.","Apryl Foster, 33, a waitress from Tampa, Florida, went missing early Thursday morning after leaving a karaoke bar in Ybor City .

'I just saw the train doors close then I realised that I was on the wrong platform,' said Mr Barry, who is originally from Dublin. 'It was a disaster.'

"Last year single mother-of-two Stephanie Cocker provoked outrage when she boasted about her 'cushty' life on benefits. The 25-year-old from Sheffield appeared on Channel 5 show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole where she revealed her £300 a week handouts made her 'as happy as Larry'. 'From being young, I've had everything I ever wanted. If I wanted a Barbie, I'd f***ing get it. I'm not f***ing getting off of benefits. That is just as simple as that,' she said on the show in 2014. Scroll down for video . Stephanie Cocker pictured on this evening's Channel 5 show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole . After her story appeared on MailOnline, furious taxpayers accused her of being a 'scrounger' and making them 'look like mugs'. Now a year on, the cameras have returned to Steph's council flat where she has defended herself against the criticism. She remains out of work and on benefits, blaming it on the fact she has to look after her children aged two and four. She says on the show (broadcast this evening): 'So many people take p*** out of the system. I'm not taking the p*** I'm asking for this help because I don't work.' The mother-of-two says she can't get a job as she wants to see her two children grow up . Stephanie first appeared on the Channel 5 show with her friend Travis, also on benefits, pictured left and with her on the programme seen on the TV screen, right . She added: 'I'd rather work nine to five and get less money but I want to watch my kids grow up too. When my kids are in school I'll get a part time job.' During the show, Steph, who left school at 14, is seen enrolling for a college course to help further her chances of eventually getting a job. But she doesn't end up attending because she can't get childcare. She explains: 'The college course I was going to got all f***ed up as I'm relying on my mum to watch the kids because it's not in nursery times. 'I'm not going to work, come pick the kids up, go to my mum's, care for them and that's every day seven day I week, I can't do that, I'll have no life,' she said.

The teenager admits he finds it hard to get out of bed and even phones his mother from his room when she's downstairs so he doesn't have to move. However, he soon realises, 'it's not healthy for 19-year-old to sit in his bedroom all day doing nothing' when his benefits are cut off for five weeks because he fails to keep up his appointments at the job centre.

"Two strange, cloud-like plumes reaching high above the surface of Mars are causing a stir among scientists. On two separate occasions in March and April 2012, amateur astronomers reported definite plume-like features developing on the planet. The plumes were seen rising to altitudes of over 155 miles (250 km) above the same region of Mars, and could help explain what makes up the Martian atmosphere. A mysterious plume-like feature, marked with yellow arrow, at the limb of Mars on 20 March 2012.The image is shown with the north pole towards the bottom and the south pole to the top . The phenomenon was observed on March 12, 2012 over the 'terminator', which is the boundary between day and night on Mars. One of the plumes developed in around 10 hours and lasted for 11 days, shifting shape from 'double blob protrusions' to pillars which merged into a 'finger' shape. A second was spotted nearby on April 6, 2012, and lasted about 10 days. 'At about 155 miles (250 km), the division between the atmosphere and outer space is very thin, so the reported plumes are extremely unexpected,' says Agustin Sanchez-Lavega of the University of the Basque Country in Bilbao, Spain, who led the study. The phenomenon was observed on March 12, 2012 over the 'terminator', which is the boundary between day and night on Mars. The top images show the location of the mysterious plumes on Mars, identified within the yellow  and red circle. The bottom images show  different views of the changing plume shape . One of the plumes developed in around 10 hours and lasted for 11 days, shifting shape from 'double blob protrusions' to pillars which merged into a 'finger' shape. Pictured are the 2012 plume events (ringed) on 22 March and 13 April . The plumes could be made of particles of water or carbon dioxide, said the paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Alternatively, it could be an aurora, similar to the shimmering light show that develops in Earth's atmosphere when solar particles collide with Earth's magnetic field. Past surveillance by scientific orbiters have suggested Terra Cimmeria to have a 'strip' with a strong but localised magnetic field. If this is the case, the Martian 'aurora' would be a remarkable 1,000 times brighter than its terrestrial equivalent. But 'both explanations defy our current understanding of Mars' upper atmosphere', the scientists admit. Their trails were vast, extending between 310 miles and 620 miles (500 and 1,000 km) in north-to-south and east-to-west directions. The 'clouds' were seen at high altitude, at about 155 miles (250km), roughly above Terra Cimmeria, which is part of Mars' rugged southern highlands, according to the paper. Mars is being scrutinised for signs of water and volcanic activity, both of which could theoretically nurture some form of life. Clouds of dust or ice crystals have been spotted occasionally over Mars in the past. But they have never been as extensive as the latest two, and they always formed at an altitude below 100km. None of the spacecraft orbiting Mars saw the features because of their viewing geometries and illumination conditions at the time. However, checking archived Hubble images taken between 1995 and 1999 and of databases of amateur images spanning 2001 to 2014 revealed occasional clouds at the limb of Mars, albeit usually only up to 62 miles (100km) in altitude. Mars with the plume at limb identified within the yellow circle, and at right, augmented views of the changing plume shape. On the background an area on Terra Cimmeria on Mars  where the plume formed . But one set of Hubble images from 17 May 1997 revealed an abnormally high plume, similar to that spotted by the amateur astronomers in 2012. Scientists are now working on determining the nature and cause of the plumes by using the Hubble data in combination with the images taken by amateurs. The plumes could be made of particles of water or carbon dioxide, said the paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Alternatively, it could be an aurora, similar to the shimmering light show that develops in Earth's atmosphere when solar particles collide with Earth's magnetic field.

"In the latest in our regular series on the travel habits of the rich and famous, champion skier Chemmy Alcott talks the marvels of Maui and what not to eat in Japan. Favourite childhood holiday? When I was three, we went to Crete, and a beautiful starfish floated up to me in the water and wrapped itself round my leg. I felt so connected with the sea. Top travel tip? Stay hydrated, use an eye mask - and enjoy the journey. Chemmy Alcott: Fond of snow, dreams of Hawaii . What do you never travel without? Earplugs. I am deaf in one ear and I find that when I need to really rest, I have to block totally the hearing in both ears. Where would you go if you could live in any other country than Britain? Well, it isn't a country - but the Hawaiian island of Maui. I have lots of friends there through my best friend, Julia Mancuso. The Maui world revolves around caring for others and having fun; money rarely comes into it. Most traumatic travel experience? I stopped in Tokyo, en route to Australia, and asked a local to take me to his favourite Japanese restaurant. Desperate not to offend, I ate everything put in front of me - eyeballs and all. The next 12-hour flight wasn't the smoothest ride! Where did you last go on holiday? I spent Christmas in the mountains. The best bit was helping my young nephews master the art of skiing, and also racing around with my hubby, Dougie Crawford. What destination is on your hitlist and why? After Dougie and I got married, we made a bucket list that includes everything from drinking a mojito and salsa dancing in a bodega bar in Havana to sipping chai tea at the Taj Mahal, heliskiing in Alaska, cat-skiing in Japan and ski-touring in Iceland.

"Thousands of DNA samples have been taken in a bid to solve the murder of Valerie Graves (pictured) More than 2,000 men came forward to donate their DNA as police try to solve the notorious 'Midsomer Murders' killing of a 55-year-old artist. Police set up a base at a village hotel close to where mother-of-two Valerie Graves was found bludgeoned to death in a country mansion on December 30, 2013. Officers were aiming to get DNA samples from men who live, work, or visit Bosham, West Sussex - which has a population of just 2,900 - to 'eliminate' them from the murder inquiry. In just over three weeks, officers collected samples from 2,042 men aged 17 and over, which will now be sent for analysis. The samples will be compared to the the limited DNA profile police have of Ms Graves' killer. Officers set up a base at the Millstream Hotel, in Bosham, for the voluntary DNA screening and also had a major incident lorry parked at various locations for people to visit. As well as being swabbed for their DNA, volunteers have also had their thumbprint and photograph taken. The samples will only be used to check against this particular crime and their DNA profile will not appear on any database. Legal safeguards are in place to ensure they are not used for any other purpose, police have said. Scroll down for video . More than 2,000 men have come forward to donate their DNA in Bosham, West Sussex, as police try to 'eliminate' them from the murder enquiry . As well as being swabbed for their DNA, volunteers have also had their thumbprint and photograph taken . A police spokeswoman said: 'The total number of DNA samples collected over 22 days sessions was 2,042. 'These were volunteered at the Millstream Hotel sessions and at the major incident lorry which was parked at various locations in Bosham, Fishbourne and Chichester. 'The samples will now be sent for analysis. 'Detectives are hoping to get samples from 5,000 men - those who live, work or visit Bosham and work will be ongoing to encourage those men who have not come forward to do so.' Detectives have said they will approach those who do not come forward voluntarily. The investigation was launched after Ms Graves' body was discovered while she was house-sitting for friends. Her death shocked the small community of Bosham, which featured in an episode of the ITV crime drama Midsomer Murders. Valerie Graves (pictured) had moved to West Sussex from Scotland shortly before her tragic murder . Police set up a base at a village hotel close to where the 55-year-old artist was found bludgeoned to death . The grandmother was staying in the £1.6million mansion with her mother, Eileen, 87, her sister Janet, 60 and Janet's boyfriend Nigel Acres, 59, when she was brutally killed with a claw hammer. The artist - who had just moved to West Sussex from Scotland - had gone to bed at 10pm on December 29. Twelve hours later, her sister found her dead in a ground floor bedroom at the rear of the house. A post-mortem examination revealed Ms Graves had suffered significant head and facial injuries at the house in Smugglers Lane. Despite extensive investigations, during which police interviewed 9,500 people, and a Crimewatch appeal, her killer still remains at large. Anyone with information about the murder should call 101, quoting Operation Ensign, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111. Police put up signs around the village asking residents to complete a voluntary DNA sample, which they say will help eliminate as many people as possible . Sussex Police have been trying to discover the identity of the killer of the divorced mother-of-two for more than a year. But despite a £20,000 reward, the involvement of the National Crime Agency, a BBC Crimewatch appeal as well as a partial DNA profile of a suspect, her murderer has not been found. Ms Graves was bludgeoned to death in one of the downstairs bedrooms of the luxurious waterside property in Bosham during the night of December 29 and 30, 2013. Coincidentally, a 1998 episode of fictional detective series 'Midsomer Murders' which was filmed in the village featured a man bludgeoned to death in his bedroom. The five-bedroom property in Bosham was being house-sat by Valerie’s sister, a teacher, and Jan’s long-term partner, 59-year-old architect Nigel Acres. They had known the owners, who were on holiday in Costa Rica, since the Eighties. Within hours of the grim discovery the following morning, the entire village was teeming with police officers desperately searching for clues. A specialist police team searched a small stream in a field in the area at the time of the main investigation . Officers first turned their attention to those in the house - statements were taken from everyone present and mobile phones were confiscated. Valerie’s children were interviewed as well as was her ex-partner, Brighton-based musician and sound engineer Roy Wood, with whom she remained on amicable terms. On New Year’s Day, the murder weapon was found 870 yards from the house - a 16 claw hammer - as well as a partial DNA sample believed to have been obtained from the red and black-handled tool. Police arrested 22-year-old insurance company worker Daniel Pereira, who was living in a Victorian worker’s cottage near where the murder weapon was found - but he was also quickly eliminated from inquiries and released without charge. A reconstruction of the crime, filmed at the property known as Hove To for BBC Crimewatch in October last year, resulted in just 20 phone calls from the public. Last month, detectives announced plans to DNA-test every man in the village as well as outlying areas in a bid to flush out the culprit and force a breakthrough in their investigation, codenamed Operation Ensign. In December last year, Ms Graves' two children Tim Wood, 32, and Jemima Harrison, 35, spoke ahead of the first anniversary of her murder. Mr Wood said: ‘It’s hard to carry on, knowing that someone is out there able to do it to someone else and knowing that they haven’t been caught for what they have done.’ The family said Christmas was put 'on hold' as they faced their first festive season without her.

"NHS staff in Glasgow were forced to fill out a form to move an office printer to examine the possible effect it would have on different 'population groups' including gipsies and asylum seekers (file picture) NHS staff were forced to fill out a seven-page form just to move an office printer – to ensure that gays, gipsies and other minorities were not offended. In an illustration of the politically correct bureaucracy strangling the health service, staff had to consider the possible human rights implications of shifting the equipment. The ‘ludicrous’ form examined potential consequences for homeless people, gipsy travellers and asylum seekers – and even asked whether the move could encourage people to commit suicide. It comes at a time of growing crisis in the NHS, with some patients being denied life- saving drugs while others have to wait up to 24 hours in hospital A&E departments. Scottish Tory MSP Alex Johnstone said: ‘Ludicrous doesn’t even begin to sum up this incident. This level of waste and madness would never be tolerated in the private sector. 'At a time when the NHS is supposed to be responsible with budgets, this is hardly a shining example of efficiency.’ The existence of the human rights forms came to light during a review of a proposal to site two printers instead of three on two floors at the Glasgow offices of quango NHS Health Scotland. It listed 17 different ‘population groups’ such as transgender people, lesbians and the disabled, and asked how they could be ‘affected differentially by the policy [of moving the printer]’. Even the potential effect on ‘people involved in the criminal justice system’ featured in the bizarre audit. Among ten human rights issues explored were the right to a family life and to freedom of expression. An examination of the right to life under the European Convention on Human rights even asked if moving the printer could lead to suicide. Unsurprisingly, the Health Inequalities Impact Assessment concluded that in these cases there were no negative consequences. However, the review, undertaken by two members of staff, noted that there would be a ‘general impact on all staff of making more queuing likely for the printer’ but there could be a positive social impact as ‘the people who do printing are more likely to meet and chat at the printers which do exist’. In addition, staff members with mobility issues could ask ‘teammates’ for assistance if necessary. NHS Health Scotland describes itself as a ‘national Health Board working with public, private and third sectors to reduce health inequalities and improve health’. In 2007, it emerged that it was setting up a £1million-a-year Directorate of Equalities and Planning to ensure lesbians, gays and immigrants were not discriminated against by the NHS. Staff were forced to fill out the forms because they had to consider the possible human rights implications of shifting the printers. NHS Health Scotland said it was ‘committed to being a great place to work’ (file picture) Health campaigner Dr Jean Turner said: ‘It sounds a little bit like bureaucracy taking over reason. Anyone who has worked in an office knows all you want is a printer that actually works and does all that you require of it.’ A spokesman for campaign group TaxpayerScotland said: ‘This is a ludicrous example of out-of-control bureaucracy. This assessment was written by a taxpayer-funded civil servant who surely must have something more useful to do.’ NHS Health Scotland said it was ‘committed to being a great place to work’ which aims ‘to ensure all staff are treated fairly and consistently and with dignity and respect.’ A spokesman said: ‘To help us do this and to comply with the Equality Act 2010, we take time to impact assess new policies and practices. It helps us check we don’t unintentionally disadvantage any of our staff. ‘In this specific case, a concern was raised that reducing the number of printers... might make things harder for staff with disabilities affecting their mobility. We therefore conducted the impact assessment to make sure it did not.’","NHS staff forced to fill out forms to consider human rights implications .

"Mathematicians have confirmed what fans of Adele, Radiohead and Lana del Ray may already suspect – that English language song lyrics are one of the most depressing forms of writing on the planet. A study has found that English-spoken song lyrics are more miserable than Russian literature, which has brought us less-than-cheery classic novels such as Anna Karenina and Crime and Punishment. Only Chinese novels and Korean film subtitles – which can be full of violence and gothic themes – were ranked less happy than English song lyrics. A study has found that English language song lyrics are less positive than Russian literature, making them one of the most miserable forms of writing analysed in a new study. A stock image of Thom Yorke from Radiohead is shown, whose lyrics include, 'if you'd been a dog they would have drowned you at birth' A random sample of English language lyrics ranked 22nd for ‘happiness’ out of 24 categories in different languages. However, overall, the study concluded that human language as a whole is positive. In 1969, two psychologists proposed  the Pollyanna Hypothesis - the idea that there is a universal human tendency to use positive words more frequently than negative ones, so that humans think, and talk, on the bright side of life. Since then, scientists have investigated whether the idea is true. Only Chinese novels and Korean film subtitles – which can be full of violence and gothic themes – were ranked less happy than English song lyrics (Shown above). Spanish was found to be the happiest language, with its Google searches ranking the most positive in terms of words analysed . Despite noting the unhappiness of English language pop lyrics, overall, the study concluded that human language as a whole is positive. Lana Del Rey's first album was titled 'Born to Die' A team of scientists at the University of Vermont used a vast data set made up of many billions of words to confirm the 1960s guess. They gathered billions of words from around the world using 24 types of sources including books, news outlets, social media, websites, television and film subtitles, and music lyrics. Mathematician Chris Danforth said: 'We collected roughly 100 billion words written in tweets.' From these sources, the team then identified about 10,000 of the most frequently used words in each of 10 languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Chinese, Russian, Indonesian and Arabic. Analysing a random sample of words from Arabic film subtitles, Twitter feeds in Korean, the famously dark literature of Russia, books in Chinese, music lyrics in English, and even the war-torn pages of The New York Times, they found the types of writing – and probably all human language, is skewed towards the use of happy words. The study found that English language song lyrics are less positive than Russian literature, which has brought us less-than-cheery novels such as Anna Karenina (a screen shot from the film starring Keira Knightley is shown left) and Crime and Punishment (right), capable of draining the most optimistic person of happiness . The team of researchers studied 100,000 words across 10 languages (a yellow box indicates the row language is more positive than the column language, and a blue background shows the reverse) Spanish was the happiest (pictured) and Chinese was the most negatively skewed . A random sample of English language lyrics ranked 22nd for ‘happiness’ out of 24 categories in different languages, but overall, the study concluded that human language is positive. The Smiths are known for their less than uplifting songs such as 'Heaven knows I'm miserable now' and 'what difference does it make' Mathematician and co-leader of the study, Peter Dodds looked at 10 languages and found ‘in every source we looked at, people use more positive words than negative ones.’ Despite violent films and miserable song lyrics, he said that ‘positive social interaction’ is built into global languages’ fundamental structure. The scientists also asked native speakers of the languages to rate words according to how positive or negative they find them. The results were published in the journal PNAS. 1. Spanish . 2. Portuguese . 3. English . 4. Indonesian . 5. French . 6. German . 7. Arabic . 8. Russian . 9. Korean . 10. Chinese . From these speakers, they gathered five million individual human scores of the words, with laughter scoring 8.5, for example, and terrorist, 1.3. Once all of these words were plotted, the researchers found that every language studied was inherently positive, and more words scored higher than five. Over all, Spanish was found to be the happiest language, and English took third place, behind Portuguese. A search of Chinese books had the lowest ‘average word happiness,’ but all 24 sources of words scored on average above the average happiness score of five, including song lyrics. When the team translated words between languages and then back again they found that ‘the estimated emotional content of words is consistent between languages.’ ‘Using human evaluation of 100,000 words spread across 10 languages diverse in origin and culture, we present evidence of a deep imprint of human sociality in language,’ the mathematicians wrote in the study. ‘The words of natural human language possess a universal positivity bias, the estimated emotional content of words is consistent between languages under translation, and this positivity bias is strongly independent of frequency of word use.' The scientists also built a computer programme called the hedometer, which was named after the Greek words for pleasure and gauge , to track levels of happiness in language over time, for example on Twitter. They found that over the past year, English speaking Twitter users used the most positive language on Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve and Thanksgiving, and used the most unhappy language to talk about the death of Robin Williams, Charlie Hedbo attacks and the Ferguson protests. The tool was also used to analyse the high and low points of 10,000 books to show that Moby Dick is an emotionally turbulent novel and that the Count of Monte Christo ends on a jubilant note. Language used in Crime and Punishment was predominantly positive but ended on a very low point.","Mathematicians from University of Vermont analysed happiness of words .

"Patients are being removed from a mental health hospital after a spot-check inspection found it had a 'disturbing' number of 'violent incidents'. NHS England has stepped in to transfer all 17 patients in the 'low secure' ward at Vista Independent Hospital to other units. Care Quality Commission inspectors found it had breached 12 national care and safety regulations when they visited in November after receiving warnings from whistleblowers and the local authority. They demanded the hospital make immediate, urgent improvements to protect patients from abuse. NHS England has begun the process of moving mentally ill and vulnerable patients from Vista Hospital in Winchfield, Hampshire after it failed a care inspection, which noted a 'disturbing' number of violent incidents and the wrongful restraint of patients (file picture posed by a model) The decision to remove some patients from the hospital in Winchfield, Hampshire, which has beds for 69, was taken last week after CQC inspectors made a return visit. Inspectors found patients were frequently restrained, had been pinned down and injected with medication, dragged to their rooms by their armpits and had belongings taken away from them as punishment. Some were regularly restrained in the dangerous face down 'prone' position – which can cause suffocation – but staff had a 'poor understanding' of the risk. One senior nurse telling inspectors: 'It doesn't matter which way you take them down, front ways or back ways.' One asthmatic patient was regularly restrained in this way but staff could 'not identify potential increased risks' of this, while a patient whose restraint was only stopped 'due to head-banging and bleeding from the nose' was not seen by a doctor. Patients were restrained 267 times, including 55 times where they were held on the floor, between March and October 2014 but the records were inconsistent and inspectors believed the real number was higher. The hospital had informed the CQC about police being called seven times during the period, but police had actually attended 22 times, inspectors found. There was a high number of 'violent incidents', including 334 involving patients and 272 incidences where staff were physically assaulted. The CQC's report, published on January 29, said it was 'concerned' patients were not protected 'from unlawful or excessive restraint'. It added: 'We spoke with patients who described unsafe restraint practices. 'One person described and demonstrated how they said their arm had been hurt, putting their hands together sharply behind their back.' Karen Wilson, CQC head of inspection, said: 'The number of violent incidents is disturbing – yet we found little evidence that the provider had the specialist skills or systems to learn from these incidents and prevent them happening in the first place.' Although inspectors 'observed examples of calm, caring interactions' on some wards, staff were described as lacking 'understanding of patient needs'. They referred to patients as being 'demanding', 'attention seeking' and wanting to get their 'own way'. The report said: 'We were concerned about their competency to care for people safely.' The 17 patients being removed were all on Watson Ward, a male low secure unit. The Care Quality Commission inspection found there were not always enough staff to care for people safely and that some staff and patients said they didn't feel safe on the wards (file picture posed by models) Vista agreed not to take on any more patients following the November inspection and brought in a new management team. However, the CQC referred it to NHS England last week to begin removing patients from one ward after deadlines it set for improvement passed. A spokesman for NHS England said: 'Vista Healthcare has failed to maintain safe standards of care and treatment for the vulnerable patients in its care. 'The first priority for all NHS commissioners is to make sure that all patients currently at Vista Healthcare are safe and well cared for. 'Commissioners, working with the Care Quality Commission have acted promptly and already begun the process of transferring these patients, some with complex needs, to centres that can provide care to the appropriate standards. 'NHS England supports the enforcement action taken by the Care Quality Commission, and will continue to work with partners in monitoring the progress of all actions required of Vista Healthcare.' Vista Healthcare said its new team was working 'to ensure that the highest levels of patient welfare and safety are restored'. It said CQC and NHS England had 'temporarily suspended our ability to care for low secure male patients', and it would work closely with both bodies 'to implement the improvements we all agree necessary'.","Vista Hospital in Winchfield, Hampshire was investigated in November .

"Concern: As many as a quarter of new cases of psychotic mental illness can be blamed on super-strength strains of cannabis . As many as a quarter of new cases of psychotic mental illness can be blamed on super-strength strains of cannabis, scientists will warn this week. The potent form of the drug – known as ‘skunk’ – is so powerful that users are three times more likely to have a psychotic episode than those who have never tried it. The study, leaked to The Mail on Sunday, will reignite debate around Britain’s drug laws – and will add weight to calls for a tougher stance towards those caught dealing or in possession of cannabis. According to Crime Survey figures for England and Wales, more than a million youngsters aged 16 to 24 smoke cannabis. Regular users are most at risk of a psychotic episode, prompting experts to warn that youngsters need to be aware of the dangers of skunk, which has been cultivated to be four times as strong as cannabis smoked by previous generations. The researchers, led by a team at the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, conclude there is an ‘urgent need… to inform young people about the risks of high-potency cannabis’, despite a worldwide trend towards relaxing drug laws. They will reveal there is a key difference between potent skunk strains and ordinary ‘hash’. Those who used these ‘weaker’ forms did not seem to suffer the same increase in risks. Psychosis is defined as a form of mental illness where people experience delusions, hallucinations, or both at the same time. Associated with conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, some victims are so badly affected that they end up committing suicide or seriously harming others because they believe they are being ordered to do so by voices in their heads. The findings will add substance to a 2012 report by the Schizophrenia Commission, which recommended the need for ‘warnings about the risks of cannabis’ to mental health. That report was chaired by schizophrenia expert Professor Sir Robin Murray, who also played a key role in the new study. Scroll down for video . Prevalent: According to Crime Survey figures for England and Wales, more than a million youngsters aged 16 to 24 smoke cannabis . It looked at cannabis use in two groups, each containing about 400 people, from 2005 to 2011. Those in the first group had all suffered ‘first-episode psychosis’ – a diagnosed first occurrence of the disorder. The second group were volunteers who agreed to answer questions about themselves – including on cannabis use and mental health history. Some had suffered psychosis, others not. They were not told the nature of the project. The academics found those in the first group were more likely to smoke cannabis daily – and to smoke skunk – than those in the second. The researchers say: ‘Skunk use alone was responsible for 24 per cent of adults presenting with first-episode psychosis to the psychiatric services in South London.’ Michael Ellis (above), a Tory member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said the 'study illustrates that those in government and the police must be careful to send out the right message' about cannabis . The latest research, to be published in The Lancet, concludes: ‘People who used cannabis or skunk every day were roughly three times more likely to have a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder than were those who never used cannabis.’ Michael Ellis, a Tory member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘This powerful new study illustrates that those in government and the police must be careful to send out the right message. ‘Cannabis isn’t a harmless drug: it can ruin lives.’","Scientists at King’s College London say youngsters must be told of risks .

"More than 4,000 U.S. soldiers are heading to Kuwait, opening up the possibility of an intervention in Iraq after President Barack Obama asked Congress to authorize military action against terrorists in the Middle East. The Commander-in-chief has ruled out large-scale U.S. ground combat operations similar to those in Iraq and Afghanistan, but he asked for the option to use military force against Islamic State fighters for three years. The fight could be extended to any 'closely related successor entity' to the Islamic State organization that has overrun parts of Iraq and Syria, imposed an extreme form of Sharia law and killed several hostages it has taken. Scroll down for video . Soldiers, their family members and guests gather at Fort Carson, Colorado, ahead of their deployment to Kuwait, which opens up the possibility of intervening in Iraq . Gregory Sierra, commander, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, (left)  salutes during the playing of the National Anthem, at Fort Carson's Special Events Center . The U.S. Army has kept a brigade in Kuwait since the end of the Iraq war in 2011. Those soldiers, including two units from Fort Carson, have worked to train local troops from throughout the Middle East. In its most recent deployment to Kuwait, a combat team from Fort Carson conducted training missions with allies including Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, which have joined the coalition against Islamic State fighters. The unit headed to Kuwait is Fort Carson's heaviest force, armed with tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Many of its soldiers are veterans of one or more of the brigade's previous combat tours in Iraq. 'We're no strangers to deployment,' said the brigade's commander, Col. Greg Sierra. Obama ruled out large-scale U.S. ground combat operations similar to those in Iraq and Afghanistan, but he asked for the option to use military force against Islamic State fighters for three years . The brigade has trained more than a year for the Kuwait mission. The soldiers practiced combat skills last used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported. The brigade's training regimen readied soldiers for a range of missions from humanitarian relief to nonstop combat, Sierra said. Sierra told soldiers and their families that if his brigade tangles with Islamic State fighters, the outcome won't be in doubt. 'In the end, if we do get into fights, we win decisively,' he said. The deployment comes as Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi confirmed plans to retake Iraq's third city, Mosul, from the jihadists by the end of the year. He insisted he did not want 'boots on the ground' from the international coalition but asked for ammunition, aid cover and training. 'I was a bit frustrated in my first three months of being prime minister because of the slowness of this support, but I have seen in the last four weeks, five weeks, an acceleration of this support,' he told the BBC. The deployment comes as Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi confirmed plans to retake Iraq's third city, Mosul (pictured last June) from the jihadists by the end of the year . Obama is currently in Southern California with his wife and daughters. On Sunday he played golf at a course privately owned by the billionaire co-founder of Oracle software, Larry Ellison. The White House says Obama's golfing group includes three childhood friends from Hawaii who are regular golf companions when the president is on the West Coast. He is expected to return to Washington on Monday evening. On Sunday, Libya's internationally recognised prime minister called for the West to launch air strikes to defeat Islamist militants who control Tripoli and have driven his government out of the capital. Speaking hours before Egypt bombed Islamic State targets in Libya in retaliation after militants said they had beheaded 21 Egyptian Christians, Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni made a plea for Western military intervention in a country rapidly slipping into chaos. 'We have absolutely confirmed information that al Qaeda and IS are in Tripoli and....near Ben Jawad,' he said, referring to a central town controlled by a faction that supports a rival government. 'I ask world powers stand by Libya and launch military strikes against these groups,' he said. 'This threat will move to European countries, especially Italy.'","The President has ruled out large-scale U.S ground combat operations .

"Indonesian authorities have postponed the transfer of Bali Nine kingpins Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the island where they are due to be executed. ABC News reports that a request from Indonesia's attorney-general has delayed the Australian pair's from Bali's Kerobokan prison to Nusa Kambangan, also known as 'death island'. The pair were scheduled to be moved tomorrow ahead of their impending execution by firing squad. But Fairfax reports the delay in their transfer has nothing to do with postponing the execution. 'We are responding to the requests from the Australian government and families,' Mr Prasetyo told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'We want the families to meet with Myuran and Andrew, to give them more time to be with the convicts on death row. This is not delaying the executions. This is just to provide the families with more time.' Scroll down for video . Andrew Chan's and Myuran Sukumaran's move to Nusa Kambangan has been delayed . Lawyers for Bali Nine drug Chan and  Sukumaran called for the delay on Tuesday. Todung Mulya Lubis was asked to front the state administrative court in Jakarta next Tuesday, where he is challenging the presidential decree that denied them clemency. 'We are talking about the lives of human beings,' he told reporters on Monday. 'Everyone dealing with this must take all arguments put forward in the clemency petition seriously. 'Rejecting the clemency might end up killing, or ending the lives, of the petitioners.' The lawyers argue President Joko Widodo's blanket ban on clemency to Chan, Sukumaran and all death row drug offenders, failed to judge individual cases on their merits as required. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo (C) arrives at the airport for a state visit in Manila on February 8, 2015. His decision not to grant clemency to the Bali Nine pair will be examined in court . Mr Lubis urged Attorney-General HM Prasetyo to halt plans to move the men from Bali's Kerobokan jail to central Java's Nusa Kambagan island, where the executions will take place. 'It's hard to reverse that, once they are moved there,' he said. 'For the sake of justice and fairness I think it is fair for the attorney-general to wait for this legal process to finish.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott has made another appeal for mercy to Mr Joko, whose hard line on drugs is popular in Indonesia. Police provide security at the ferry to Nusa Kambangan prison, where five of six prisoners expected to be executed are being held, at Wijayapura quay, Cilacap, Central Java . A general view of the death island Nusa Kambangan, upon which Indonesia's maximum security prison is located, in Cilacap, Central Java province . Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali . Heartbroken parents Ken and Helen said their goodbyes to Andrew and fly back to Sydney ahead of execution . The queue for visitors at Kerobokan is long and the waiting room gets crowded . The lawyers argue President Joko Widodo's blanket ban on clemency to Chan and Sukumaran failed to judge individual cases on their merits as required . Australian barrister Michael O'Connell says Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, remain 'composed and dignified' in very trying times. On Monday, an Australian woman who has been visiting the Bali Nine for 10 years inside Kerobokan prison described Sukuraman and Chan as 'really wonderful human beings'. The woman, who did not wish be named, is part of a Protestant church group funded by Australians who help those serving time inside the Bali jail. As the days appear numbered for Sukuraman and Chan the woman described the atmosphere inside the prison as 'really sad'. 'Everyone is sad right now,' she said. The visitor said she had many private conversations with the Bali Nine pair and it would be a 'shame' to see them shot dead. The parents of Sukuraman were allowed to bypass the regular visitor process . 'They're really wonderful human beings. They are the kindest, they are the gentlest, the smartest guys around actually, and that's what so sad because they have helped hundreds and hundreds of prisoners in there [Kerobokan prison],' the woman said. 'Many, many times I have seen and witnessed the many, many things they have done. It would be a very big shame to humanity if their lives were taken.' Earlier on Monday, the parents of Sukuraman were allowed to bypass the regular visitor process at Kerobokan jail as the family gathered to say their final goodbyes ahead of his impending execution. Brintha Sukumaran leaves afer visiting her brother on Monday .

The convicted drug smuggler's family arrived at the prison in a black van about 9.30am on Monday and were driven straight up to the visitors' door. They walked in and out, ignoring the media scrum that await for the family outside who follow them intensely along a three-metre-long path leading to the driveway. It comes after Andrew Chan's parents Ken and Helen Chan left Bali on Sunday night after saying goodbye for what could possibly be the last time. Sukuraman's mother and father were followed by a second black van believed to be carrying his family and friends. It's understood the families of the Bali duo have officially left. One woman, who was with Michael Chan told Daily Mail Australia: 'I cannot say anything. Sorry.' The convicted drug smuggler's family bypassed the regular process where visitors of inmates need to sign in. The prison on Nusa Kambangan, AKA death island, is a squalid facility surrounded by razor wire . Brother Michael Chan arrives to visit Andrew Chan on Monday . Michael and the Chan family enjoyed their first lunch together in nine years at the weekend . Identification normally must be provided to officials, a form must be filled out with details including the visitor's name, address, the prisoner's name and their relationship to the prisoner. It seems relatively easy to visit inmates inside the prison. A complete stranger could walk into a visitors registration complex, adjoining the prison, and request to see an inmate. A number is given to the visitor and they sit in a waiting room to wait for their number to be called. Regular visitors have warned others of the possible long wait and opt to stand outside the entrance to wait their number to be called. They tell people what to expect behind the metal door. When visitors are let through they have to hand in all electronic equipment, including cameras and mobile phones. Officials perform a pat down for security reasons before they let you into a roomful of inmates and their family. Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve . Bali Nine member Matthew Norman said it was 'impossible' to speak about the impending deaths of Chan and Sukumaran . The visiting hall is not enclosed but is undercover. Friends and family of inmates are forced to sit on the floor on woven mates while speaking to their loved ones, amongst other prisoners and their guests. A seasoned visitor cautioned that sometimes people would have sex inside the hall in front of everyone. She said the first time she visited, it gave her a shock to see the sight. Amongst the prisoners on Monday was Matthew Norman, the youngest of the Bali Nine. He was sitting and talking with an older woman, while leaning up against the wall. When approached to speak about the impending deaths of Sukumaran and Chan, the soft spoken prisoner said it was 'impossible' for him to be interviewed. Inside the jail, Norman is shielded from the media pack outside who have been stationed at the prison for about a month.","Bali Nine pair's move to Java's Nusa Kambagan island delayed .

"A man arrested by counter terrorism officers was last night charged with trying to obtain the deadly poison ricin. Mohammed Ammer Ali, 31, who was held following a series of raids in and around Liverpool last week, will appear in court this morning accused of attempting to obtain a chemical weapon. The chemical in question was ricin, a poison 6,000 times more deadly than cyanide which has recently been used by extremists in the U.S. enclosed in letters sent to politicians including Barack Obama. A man arrested by counter terrorism officers was last night charged with trying to obtain the deadly poison ricin . However police have stressed that officers have currently uncovered no plan or threat of an imminent attack either in Britain or abroad. Ali, of Prescot Road, Liverpool, was arrested during raids on five properties last week following an investigation by the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and Merseyside Police during which a number of items were seized. He was initially held on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. However he was last night charged with attempting to have a chemical weapon in his possession between January 10 and February 12, contrary to the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and the Chemical Weapons Act 1996. He is due to attend Westminster magistrates’ court today. One of the properties raided last Wednesday was the Salt and Pepper restaurant on Prescot Road, Liverpool. Ricin, a poison 6,000 times more deadly than cyanide, has recently been used by extremists in the U.S. enclosed in letters sent to politicians including Barack Obama . A witness described seeing 15 police officers, wearing gas masks and white boots, enter a property before seeing a woman and two children taken out and put into a van, with a man was placed in a separate van. Witnesses described police cutting through the glass of the front door with an electric saw or angle grinder. Dahir Hassan, who owns a nearby newsagent’s, described the scenes as ‘chaotic’. ‘Our shop opens at 6am and we heard a huge noise at around 7.30am,’ he said. ‘The police were shouting and they smashed down the shutters. The front door was completely ruined and the shutters were in pieces. It was very dramatic.’ Other properties raided included a large Victorian villa-style house in Rainhill, St. Helens understood to be a former nursery currently occupied by a software firm. Neighbours said a number of police cars arrived early in the morning and began conducting searches. In 2003 a British policeman was murdered in a raid on an Al Qaeda terrorist accused of running a terror plot allegedly involving the ricin. Last year an actress who sent ricin-laced letters to President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was jailed for 18 years . Special Branch officer Stephen Oake, 40, was stabbed by Kamel Bourgass during a police raid on a flat in Crumpsall, Manchester, with four other officers also injured. Algerian Bourgass is serving 17 years for conspiracy to commit public nuisance by using poisons or explosives as well as a life sentence for murder. Last year an actress who sent ricin-laced letters to President Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was jailed for 18 years. Shannon Richardson, 36, from Texas, who has played small roles in The Vampire Diaries and The Walking Dead, according to IMDB, obtained ingredients online before posting the letters – all of which were intercepted – and blaming her estranged husband. Experts say traces of ricin have been found caves used by militants in Afghanistan. It is produced from the beans of the castor oil plant, and just 70 micrograms or two millionths of an ounce, roughly equivalent to the weight of a single grain of salt, can be enough to kill an adult.

"A grandmother was arrested after squirting Fairy Liquid in her daughter's boyfriend's face . A grandmother is facing court after trying to wash her daughter's boyfriend's mouth out with Fairy Liquid because he was swearing at her. Margaret Gettings was charged last November after Robert Weekes,a 6ft 2in chef, phoned police in Newark, Nottinghamshire, to say she had assaulted him. The 73-year-old had squirted washing liquid at the man's face following a series of rows he'd had with her daughter and granddaughter. Mrs Gettings could now face prosecution after pleading not guilty to assault by beating in Magistrates Court. 'I put Fairy Liquid in my bag but never thought I would use it until he leant down over me and was cursing like a trooper,' the grandmother told the Sun's Andrew Parker. Mr Weekes, 38, phoned police to report he had been assaulted, and officers attended the scene. 'Officers attended an address in Newark on 16 November 2014, after the report of an assault on a 38-year-old man. 'A 73-year-old woman was voluntarily interviewed on suspicion of assault, and following CPS advice was reported for summons for the offence,' a Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said. Mr Weekes, who is thought to have since broken up with Mrs Getting's daughter, has since retracted his police statement and said he wants no further action to be taken. The Crown Prosecution Service is now deciding whether or not to move forward with her case. 'It's finished my faith in British justice if they can waste all this time and effort on someone like me while murderers go free,' the pensioner added. In 2007, Jonnie Wiseman, a cab driver, was arrested for squirting Fairy Liquid at his girlfriend in a jealous rage. A CPS spokesman this morning confirmed Mrs Getting's next court date was in March but would not comment further on the case.

"Hunched over a crystal ashtray, this is North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un pictured for the first time aboard his 174ft private  jet. The Soviet Ilyushin IL-62, dubbed Air Force Un, follows a design which became the world's largest jet airliner when it first flew in 1963 but now sells for as little as £65,000. Instead of 200 passengers it carries just the autocrat and his  trusted aides in a style compared in scale to the U.S. Presidential jet Air Force One. Scroll down for video . Plane: Hunched over a crystal ashtray, this is  Kim Jong-Un pictured for the first time aboard the private  jet dubbed Air Force Un. A fully-equipped Soviet Ilyushin IL-62 would be capable of seating 200 people . Enjoying the view: The leader was on a tightly-controlled flight to view blocks of university apartments . Released by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, these photos showed the dictator examining half-built apartment blocks  on the eve of the anniversary of his father's birth. He later toured the 'Future Scientists Street' on foot, using a pointing stick handed to him by a military underling so he could touch parts of the artist's impression he couldn't reach. The use of a private jet is a departure from the behaviour of Kim's father Kim Jong-Il, who had such a fear of flying that he visited China and Russia in a private armoured train. Unveiled in 1962 with its first flight the following year, the IL-62 became commonly-used around the world and continued being manufactured until 1994. Now-defunct nations including the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia adapted the plane into a private jet before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Visit: These images of the plane were revealed yesterday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, and claim to show new apartments being built on the banks of Pyongyang's wide Taedong River . Comparison: Given its size and the insignia on its tail, the  jet has been compared to Air Force One . The ageing model continued to be used widely including by the Russian airline Aeroflot until 2008, when its prominence began to fade as the carrier struggled in the global recession. Now second-hand versions can be bought for a fraction of the price of a London garage because of the airliner's age and high running costs. One 1990-built IL-62 with its original long-haul seating arrangement is being sold for $100,000 (£65,000) by a seller in Tucson, Arizona. Others are more expensive, including one 1984-built IL-62 which is on sale for $1million (£650,000) in Kazakhstan. The existence of Kim Jong-Un's private plane emerged last May, when state officials released photos of him disembarking onto a gigantic red carpet with his wife Ri Sol-ju. Looking at things: The North Korean dictator studied an artist's impresion of the new apartment blocks . Tour: The images were released a day before state officials marked the anniversary of Kim Jong-Il's birth . The North Korean ruler was accused of hypocrisy considering his contempt for Western indulgence, and U.S. President Barack Obama. His nation is also accused by campaigners, charities and global governments of grievous human rights abuses. It was even claimed that the leader enjoys trying his hand at the controls of the plane, though it is not known if he has qualifications as a pilot. 'Kim Jong-un likes steering aircraft,' a senior government source in Seoul was quoted as saying in the South's capital, Seoul. The new images were released yesterday ahead of the anniversary of Kim Jong-Il's birth on February 16, 1941. Memorial: Party officials met on the anniversary of the late dictator's birth to pledge their allegiance . Paying his respects: The autocrat at a memorial event today flanked by  top brass at Kumsusan Palace . The country marked the occasion with massive fireworks, the promotion of top generals and a rally by top officials to vow loyalty to his son Kim Jong-Un. Flanked by military top brass, the ruler paid respects to his late father today in a mass ceremony at Pyongyang's Kumsusan Palace. According to KCNA, the skyscrapers he viewed on the banks of Pyongyang's Taedong River will be lived in by scientists at the Kim Chaek University of Technology. Run nearby in the secretive nation's capital, the university is named after a North Korean general who fought Japanese occupation alongside Kim's grandfather Kim Il-Sung. The original Kim took power in 1948 and led the country for almost 50 years, creating a personality cult which means he is still North Korea's 'eternal president' despite dying in 1994. His son Kim Jong-Il ruled from 1994 until his death in 2011 when he handed the reins to Kim Jong-Un, whose aggressive stance set off new diplomatic ripples between North Korea and the West. Red carpet treatment: These images released last May drew the attention of the world to Kim's private jet . Scale: The secretive nation has long since built up a cult of personality around the Kim dynasty . Even bigger: The U.S. President's Air Force One has two galley kitchens, a surgeon and an operating theatre .","Kim Jong-Un uses  174ft Soviet Ilyushin IL-62 with 560mph top speed .

"Ed Miliband suffered a fresh blow today – after 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked his leadership and questioned whether they could vote for him. Declan Donnelly, 39, said he had always voted Labour but was unimpressed with Mr Miliband. He said: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.' His Britain's Got Talent co-star Ant McPartlin – also 39 – said the pair were 'staunchly Labour' but didn't know if they could vote Labour under Mr Miliband. 'Staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked Ed Miliband's leadership and questioned whether they could vote for him . The remarks appear to echo public concern over Mr Miliband's leadership, with just 80 days until the election. According to the latest polls, more than half the public think Mr Miliband is doing a bad job – with less than a quarter happy with his leadership. His overall approval rating has slumped to minus 29. This is stark contrast to David Cameron – who splits opinion down the middle, according to the pollsters Opinium. The PM has a net approval rating of minus one. Despite Mr Cameron's personal advantage, Labour continue to be ahead by two points in the polls – on 35 per cent, compared to the Tories who are stuck on 33 per cent. Ant and Dec, speaking to the Times, said they followed politics 'keenly', but were disillusioned with Labour and the Tories. Mr McPartlin said: 'I voted Labour all my life. But last election I voted Tory because I was thoroughly disillusioned with the Labour government. 'Now I'm thoroughly disillusioned with a coalition government. I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.' Ant McPartlin said he had voted Labour all his life until the last election when he backed David Cameron's Tories . Mr Donnelly added: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.' The pair dismissed the idea of hosting a political programme. Mr Donnelly: 'The problem is people want to watch people they like. It's very hard to make politicians likeable.' Mr McPartlin: 'If you're a family in Middlesbrough and you're watching grown men arguing on the TV, you're not going to know what the parties stand for, just two men trying to get the better of each other. I can't stand it. No wonder people don't relate.' The Geordie pair have previously opened up about politics.

"Five diseases and health conditions not previously linked to smoking are now thought to be caused by the habit, scientists claim. The link between cigarettes and lung disease, some cancers, artery disease, heart attacks and stroke is well documented. But scientists at the Washington University School of Medicine have identified smoking is also linked to significantly increased risks of infection, kidney disease, intestinal disease caused by inadequate blood flow, and heart and lung illnesses not previously attributed to tobacco. They studied health data from almost one million people, following them for 10 years. Their findings suggest the number of people dying from smoking each year, across the world, is significantly underestimated. A new study, funded by the American Cancer Society, has found strong evidence to suggest smoking is linked to five extra diseases and illnesses, than was previously thought. Scientists estimate it means around 60,000 more deaths in America each year, should be attributed to the habit . In the US, health officials estimate smoking kills around 480,000 people each year. Research has already established 21 diseases caused by smoking, including 12 types of cancer, six categories of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], and pneumonia including influenza. In the UK that figure is around 100,000, while the World Health Organisation estimate the global figure stands at six million, when taking into account second-hand smoke. However, the team of scientists at Washington University believe those figures could be considerably higher, when taking into account deaths from the five additional health problems, they now believe are closely linked to smoking. Dr Eric Jacobs, co-author of the study, estimates smoking could be killing around 60,000 extra Americans each year - around 13 per cent of the 480,000 deaths currently attributed to the habit each year. If applied to the world wide figure, their theory suggests an extra 780,000 across the world could be dying from the affects of smoking each year. Dr Jacobs, said: 'The number of additional deaths potentially linked to cigarette smoking is substantial. 'In our study, many excess deaths among smokers were from disease categories that are not currently established as caused by smoking, and we believe there is strong evidence that many of these deaths may have been caused by smoking. 'If the same is true nationwide, then cigarette smoking may be killing about 60,000 more Americans each year than previously estimated, a number greater than the total number who die each year of influenza or liver disease.' Those taking part in the study were men and women, all aged 55 or older . While the link between smoking and lung disease, coronary heart disease and stroke is well documented through past research, this new study found the habit doubled a smoker's chance of developing kidney failure (pictured) as well as hypertensive heart disease, various infections and respiratory illnesses . Over the course of the decade-long study, more than 180,000 of the participants died. Researchers found current smokers, as predicted, had death rates almost three times higher than those who had never smoked. Their findings show the majority of excess deaths in smokers were due to diseases that are established as being caused by smoking, including 12 types of cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Past studies have already established a link between smoking and 21 different diseases, as recognised by the US surgeon general. They are: . This new study, funded by the American Cancer Society, found strong links between five additional health problems and cigarettes. They are: . But they also found around 17 per cent of the excess deaths in smokers were due to diseases that have not yet officially been linked to smoking, by the US surgeon general. It means these deaths would not be counted in estimates of the death toll from smoking. The scientists noted, in particular, that smoking was found to at least double a person's risk of death from several causes, including renal failure, intestinal ischemia, hypertensive heart disease, infections and various respiratory diseases, other than COPD. Smokers were also six times more likely to die from a rare illness caused by insufficient blood flow to the intestines. The risk of death from each of these diseases was found to decline after a person quit the habit. The study authors note there is strong evidence that smoking is a cause of death from these five diseases, even though they are not currently included in estimates of deaths caused by smoking. Smoking was also linked with smaller increases in risk of death from other causes not formally established as caused by smoking, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and cancers of unknown site. The authors conclude that a substantial portion of excess mortality among smokers may be due to diseases not formally established as caused by smoking. They add, that if supported by future research, some of the diseases should be included in future estimates of the death toll from smoking. The team of researchers also found evidence the habit was linked to increased risk of breast cancer, pictured under the microscope. Breast cancer is not currently formally linked to smoking in the US . Dr Brian Carter, an epidemiologist at the American Cancer Society, which funded the research, told the New York Times: 'The smoking epidemic is still ongoing, and there is a need to evaluate how smoking is hurting us as a society, to support clinicians and policy making in public health.' The study was an observational one, assessing people's habits and noted statistical correlations between their behaviour and their health. Correlation does not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. As a result these studies are not deemed as strong as experiments where volunteers are given random treatments, with placebo groups included for comparison. People cannot ethically be instructed to smoke for a study, so much of the data relating to cigarette's effects on people has to come from observational studies, such as this. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.","New study links smoking to 26 diseases - five more than thought in past .
Link between cigarettes and lung disease, artery disease, heart attacks, stroke and some cancers is well documented .
But scientists identified smokers are at double the risk of kidney failure, hypertensive heart disease, infections and extra respiratory problems .
Also six times more likely to suffer rare condition caused by poor blood flow to the intestines .
Estimated smoking kills 60,000 more Americans than thought each year .
If five illnesses are included in smoking death toll, global figure could increase by hundreds of thousands, scientist's findings suggest ."
"The director and co-writer of Oscar-nominated movie Still Alice has been hospitalized with severe respiratory problems related to his ALS. Richard Glatzer, 63, was taken to hospital near his Los Angeles home on Friday, his husband and collaborator on Still Alice, Wash Westmoreland, wrote in a Facebook message. Mr Westmoreland said that the couple were communicating with eye movements and their plan was to watch the Oscars from hospital next weekend,Yahoo! reported. Scroll down for video . Directors Wash Westmoreland, back center and Richard Glatzer (front) with the stars of their movie Still Alice, Julianne Moore (right) and Kristen Stewart (left) at AFI FEST in November. Mr Glatzer was taken to hospital last week with complications related to his ALS . Mr Westmoreland posted: ''Not so glamorous but I wouldn't have it any other way. And Richard will be alive to see it.' The couple married in September 2013. Mr Glatzer was diagnosed with degenerative ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, in 2011. By the time production started on Still Alice, he'd lost his speech and the use of his arms. Adapted from Lisa Genova's bestselling book, the tender and occasionally harrowing drama Still Alice tells the story of an accomplished Columbia University linguistics professor, Dr Alice Howard (played by Julianne Moore) who discovers that she has early onset Alzheimer's. Moore has been nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for her work. She has already been awarded a Golden Globe for her role and is a favorite to win the Oscar  - her first in five nominations - on February 22. In an interview last month, Glatzer communicated by typing on an iPad with a toe on his right foot. 'I could still type with one finger on the iPad,' said Glatzer of the film shoot. 'It's so very important if you're struggling with a disease like this to feel you still matter. 'It's ironic that in my deteriorated state, I'd be able to make a film that was creatively everything I'd ever wished for.' The directors have partnered on three other films, The Last of Robin Hood in 2014, Quinceanera in 2006 and The Fluffer (2001). Julianne Moore has been nominated for an Academy Award for her role in movie Still Alice, where she plays a doctor with early on-set Alzheimer's .","Richard Glatzer was taken to hospital near his Los Angeles home on Friday suffering complications from ALS .

"In the latest of our regular series on the travel habits of the rich and famous, TV icon Ruby Wax tells us all about camping in Wisconsin and beaches in Costa Rica. Ruby Wax: Happy memories of Wisconsin and Costa Rica, not so much of Chile . Earliest holiday memory? Elkhart Lake in Wisconsin. There was a theatre camp nearby for children who wanted to act. I would go and watch performances of Oklahoma! and hang around the stage door. No one broke it to me that it wasn't actually Hollywood. Top travel tip? Get upgraded. If you're on a plane, say you have a condition that means you can't be around other people. And never accept a hotel room until you've had a good look at everyone else's. Favourite place? Cape Town. It has everything America aimed for, but it hasn't been ruined by tourism. It's difficult to get to and it has edge. The mountains are above you and the ocean in front. I own a place there and I just love it. Favourite hotel? Harmony House in Costa Rica. It's in the jungle and it's primitive, but in a five-star way. There's a beautiful beach and paths that wind through jungle. Holiday disaster? When I was eight, we were in Chile and my father said he would leave without me if I wasn't in the lobby on time. I was late, and he left me behind. He left 12 dollars with the receptionist and told me to get a taxi. I got in the taxi in my swimming costume and rubber ring. I was traumatised. What do you look for in a holiday? Go small and interesting. Guesthouses and home stays are fantastic.

"With his parole hearing scheduled for later this week, convicted cop killer Bruce Lorick is ready to regain his freedom - and fall in love. The 57-year-old inmate has spent more than 30 years in prison for the 1980 killing of New York City police officer Joseph Keegan. On Saturday, Lorick will appear before a Manhattan parole board for the fifth time and make a case for his release. In the mood for love: Bruce Lorick (left), 57, who is serving a life sentence in the 1980 murder of officer Joseph Keegan, 41 (right), has created a profile on an inmate dating site in anticipation of his fifth parole hearing . While awaiting the hearing, the lovelorn Clinton Correctional Facility inmate has joined the dating website meet-an-inmate.com hoping to find women 'for friendship or possibly more,' according to his post, which first caught the attention of the New York Daily News. In his profile, the cold-blooded cop killer describes himself in glowing terms as a 'Black male who is childless, single, humorous, witty, loyal, a good listener, and an excellent lover.' On paper, Lorick is quite the catch: a brown-eyed, 5-foot-10, 180-lbs college-educated military veteran from a Protestant background whose many interests include books, music, art, movies, horses, 'and mostly anything involving a woman.' And based on his dating profile, Lorick is not the least bit picky when it comes to choosing a mate. ‘Your race, weight, and looks are not important to me because all women have something special about them, plus I am looking for love instead of trying to find faults in you,’ he writes. ‘I have no hidden identities, so you can be yourself without fear or shame, as I have learned that people are not perfect, just human beings.’ The post is accompanied by a photo of Lorick sitting on a bench in a green prison jumpsuit with a 'come hither' look in his eyes. While Lorick seems to be very confident that Friday's hearing will go his way, the victim’s family have vowed to do everything in their power to keep the convicted killer behind bars for the rest of his life. On June 13, 1980, transit officer Joseph Keegan, 41, stopped 22-year-old Bruce Lorick at the 59th-Street Columbus Circle subway station for failing to pay the fare. Home away from home: Keegan is serving his sentence at Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York . When Keegan went to arrest Lorick, a struggle ensued and the suspect grabbed the officer's service weapon and shot him in the head. Keegan was just 44 days from an early retirement. He had been planning to quit the force after 15 years so he could start a family. A year later, Lorick was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. He became eligible for parole in 2005, but every time he made a plea for freedom, his request was denied. Last month, 40 of Keegan's family members showed up at the state parole office in Manhattan and handed in their impact statements asking to keep Bruce Lorick incarcerated. ‘My uncle was executed,’ Noreen Keegan Connelly, the officer’s niece, told the New York Post last month. Lorick's profile on meet-an-inmate is not his first foray into the world of online dating. In 2005, around the time of his first parole hearing, he posted a personnel ad on the site prisonerlife.com looking for a woman between the ages 30-57 'who is unafraid of being herself and desire [sic] to be loved totally.' Finding love in a hopeless place: In his profile on meet-an-inmate.com, Lorick describes himself as 'Black male who is childless, single, humorous, witty, loyal, a good listener, and an excellent lover' A decade ago, Lorick described his ideal life partner as a Christian woman who is not a 'fanatic.' Keegan's relatives, among them more than a dozen cops, were infuriated by his killer’s audacity. His niece was also outraged when Keegan offered her a sum of money last year in exchange for her willingness to drop her opposition to his parole bid. ‘Of course I declined because there’s no dollar value on my uncle’s life or anyone’s life. He has no remorse and really no regard for human life,’ Connelly told CBS New York.","In his online profile, Bruce Lorick, 57, describes himself as 'childless, single, humorous, witty, loyal, a good listener, and an excellent lover'

"When Jonny Normal came down with a cough and a high temperature, he joked it was 'man flu'. Weeks later, having been put into an induced coma, doctors warned his family they may have to turn off his life support machine. Mr Normal's flu had developed into pneumonia, where an infection causes the tissue in the lungs to swell, causing difficulty breathing. Incredibly, while his family had come to say their goodbyes, the now-47-year-old showed signs of life, and woke up from the coma a few days later. Scans showed he had also suffered a stroke, and though he was left paralysed for six months, he learned to speak and walk again is now at home with his family. Jonny Normal, 47, joked about having man flu but days later was rushed to hospital and put in a coma and on a life support machine for two weeks. He was suffering pneumonia, an infection which causes the lungs to swell, causing difficulty breathing . Mr Normal was sent for  extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, where an artificial lung pumps blood around the body. But he did not respond to treatment and remained in a coma. He is pictured with his wife Andrea, 45, before he fell ill . Doctors worried that Mr Normal would be brain damaged due to lack of oxygen to the brain, and suggested turning off his life support. But when his wife and family came to say goodbye he blinked, showing he was conscious. He is pictured here with his family before becoming ill . Mr Normal, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, said: 'I'd been joking about having man flu earlier in the week. 'I had a high temperature and felt lethargic. It just seemed like a normal cold. I was so healthy I couldn't understand how it could happen.' Mr Normal made light of his symptoms and likened them to 'man flu' on the radio show he runs. But after five days, he was rushed into hospital and told he had pneumonia, which can be caused by the virus that causes flu. His wife Andrea, 45, said: 'When I came home from work, I found Johnny under a blanket and he didn't look well but he just said he had flu. 'But the next day he was throwing up and his temperature was through the roof. He had breathing problems too so I rang 999 in a panic.' When Mr Normal arrived at Warwick Hospital in March 2014, doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia and he was transferred to the intensive care unit at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham. He was put on life support, which pumped oxygen round his system, and was transferred to Leicester Hospital. His wife Andrea was given hospital accommodation so she could stay with her husband, but asked her parents to look after their two daughters Olivia, now 15, and Eve, 10. Doctors warn that symptom of pneumonia include having a cough, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, a fever, shivering or a pain in the chest. The NHS website advises visiting a GP if you have any of these symptoms. Dr Mike Smith, a former GP, told MailOnline: 'Most cases of pneumonia from late childhood to old age are broncho pneumonia. 'The infection crawls down into the smaller breathing tubes, which get filled with gunge, causing a bit of wheezing. 'Doctors hear crackles on the stethoscope from the liquid in the lungs that shouldn’t be there. 'This liquid makes a perfect environment from which bacteria will grow and cause the lungs to swell.' Dr Smith said it is difficult to ascertain when a person has flu and when they have pneumonia, as the symptoms are very similar. Therefore he advises seeing a doctor if there is any concern. He said: 'Other than a doctor being able to hear that crackling in your chest, there’s nothing specific in pneumonia. 'In terms of symptoms, it’s difficult to tell flu and pneumonia  apart. 'You start to feel more ill than usual with pneumonia. 'You might well have a temperature and feel awful. You’ll be coughing up gunge. 'You should go and see your GP if you have any concerns your flu is more than just a passing virus.' Mrs Normal said: 'He looked so frail. I didn't want them to see their dad like that.' Mr Normal's liver and kidneys were failing and doctors told his wife he had Influenza A and Bocavirus - a pathogen which is believed to cause respiratory infections - which were affecting his breathing. She said: 'I tried to reassure our girls the doctors were doing their best for him. 'But then I was told there wasn't enough oxygen in Johnny's blood and with time, his organs would shut down. 'I didn't understand how flu could do that so quickly.' For the next 11 days doctors monitored Mr Normal and tried to bring him off life support. He was transferred to the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester for two sessions of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a treatment given to patients with severe lung failure. Here, a machine acts like an artificial lung, taking blood from the lungs, removing carbon dioxide and then oxygenating it, before returning it to the body. But Mr Normal didn't respond to the treatment and showed no signs of coming round. His wife said: 'Doctors feared he'd been starved of oxygen and suffered brain damage. 'There wasn't much they could do for him though I begged them to give him a chance. 'They said it wasn't fair on his body and wanted to let him die naturally.' However they said they would give Mr Normal steroids until he passed away, and a ventilator would breathe for him. In the meantime, his wife had to go through the agony of preparing her family for her husband's death. She said: 'I called our girls so they could see their dad and we told him we loved him and hoped he'd come round. 'We sat round his bed holding his hand. 'We thought it was the end.' When Mr Normal woke up, scans revealed he had also suffered a stroke. He was paralysed for six months, and had to re-learn to walk and speak again . After being in a coma for a fortnight, Mr Normal suffered complete muscle wastage and was transferred for physiotherapy. He was allowed home in September 2014, and still has trouble breathing. He is pictured with his daughter Eve, 10,  and their dog Charlie, before he became ill . But, miraculously, just days later, Mr Normal opened his eyes. His wife said: 'I told him if he could hear me, he should blink. 'When he did, my heart was in my mouth. 'It was just a tiny movement but to me it was everything.' After this, doctors watched Mr Normal's ventilator for signs he was breathing. A fortnight later he took his first breath, and began to move and speak again. Mrs Normal said: 'Gradually, Johnny spoke and moved his right side, but not his left. A scan showed he'd had a stroke.' Mr Normal was transferred for physiotherapy, after suffering muscle wastage due to being in a coma for a fortnight, and weeks later took his first steps. Mrs Normal said: 'His therapist and I coaxed him on by saying he had to get better to walk his girls down the aisle one day. 'I was so proud. I couldn't believe how far he'd come.' Mr Normal is grateful to be back at home with his family. He said: 'Even just sitting at home watching a DVD with Andrea and the girls is magical, it's something I thought I'd never have again' Mr Normal was allowed home in September 2014. After suffering lung damage he now struggles to take air into his lungs but doctors say this will improve with time. The father-of-two said: 'I can remember hearing the doctor say they were putting me in a coma, I thought that was game over. 'I've had to learn everything from scratch, learn to eat and swallow again. 'But with Andrea's help, I'm walking again now. 'Even just sitting at home watching a DVD with Andrea and the girls is magical, it's something I thought I'd never have again.' Doctors warn that symptom of pneumonia include having a cough, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, a fever, shivering or a pain in the chest. The NHS website advises visiting a GP if you have any of these symptoms.","Jonny Normal, 47, believed he had flu but days later woke up vomiting .

"The 23-year-old American woman who allegedly plotted to carry out a massacre at a Canadian mall on Valentine's Day  posted harrowing messages online for years before the plan was foiled. Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, from Geneva, Illinois, posted about her admiration of Hitler, the Columbine killers and other murderers on her Facebook page, Tumblr site and forums, and even hinted at the deadly plan, writing last Wednesday: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down.' Two days after the post, she was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after police received a tip. Randall Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia was arrested on the same charges. A third suspect, James Gamble, 19 killed himself as police moved to arrest him at his home in Nova Scotia, and a fourth - a 17-year-old boy - has been released from custody. Angelic? Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath, pictured left in her high school yearbook photo and right in a recent Facebook photo, was arrested after landing in Canada, where she allegedly planned to execute a massacre . Online profiles show the named suspects had been exchanging unnerving messages for years. The dark messages come in stark contrast to Souvannarath's high school yearbook photo shared by the Kane County Chronicle, which shows a pretty teen. She went on to study at Coe College, where she studied English and creative writing before graduating last year. But online, Souvannarath, whose father is from Laos, painted herself as a neo-Nazi and regularly shared photos of Hitler while lauding white separatists, such as former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. 'Free speech is dead,' she apparently wrote in one forum in 2007, when she would have been just 15. 'That's why we need people like David Duke to bring it to life again.' Her Tumblr account is entitled 'c**kswastika', according to the Chronicle Herald. On the page, she displays a large pink swastika and links to James Gamble's Tumblr page, which shows images of Hitler, dead bodies and murders, and videos of the Columbine shooters. Gamble's page also features conversations that include graphic sexual descriptions as well as naked images of himself. Ominous: Last week, she posted this message showing 'Saturday the 14th' - the day of the alleged massacre - in bloody, dripping letters with the message: 'HA HAHA' posted beneath . Terrifying: She also shared this image with the words 'Valentine's Day. It's going down' with the names 'C***swastika' and 'Shallow-Existences', which refer to her and James Gamble, another suspect . Harrowing: Beneath the poster, she apparently added this chilling message on her Tumblr page . 'I'm such a morbid f***ing freak,' he writes in one post. 'I love it.' Her Tumblr page also features images of the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, including photos of their dead bodies, . 'Eric and Dylan are dead, but Reb and VoDKa live,' she wrote, apparently referring to Gamble. In one post from February 11, she shared a movie poster showing two ghoulish figures with the words: 'Valentine's Day. It's going down' - perhaps hinting at their alleged plan for February 14. Beneath the poster she added: 'It's almost here. The clock is ticking.' She also shared quotes from murderers and photos of weapons. One picture shows a man holding a gun and wearing a t-shirt that reads: 'Natural selection.' Another post on her blog reads 'Saturday the 14th' in red, dripping letters with the comment: 'Ha Haa' written beneath. Her website is still showing new updates. Police said that she had pre-programmed online messages before she was due to carry out the attacks and ultimately kill herself. 'Shooting obsessed': Randall Shepherd, 20 (left), and James Gamble, 19 (right), allegedly plotted the mass shooting with Souvannarath. Shepherd has now been charged but Gamble killed himself before his arrest . Sick: A Tumblr page that appeared to belong to Gamble shows his obsession with the Columbine killers (Dylan Klebold is pictured center) as well as crime scenes, Nazis, guns and torture . Shepherd has his own Tumblr page with the name genesistogenocide, according to the Chronicle Herald. The page is an ode to 'gore, porn, Columbine, horror and heavy f***ing metal'. Again it features images of mass murderers, the Nazis and pornography. As well as posting to Tumblr, Souvannarath and Shepheard appear to have been active on the online chat board Random Insanity, according to the Chronicle Herald. She appears to go by the name SnoopyFemme. They are also connected with each other and Gamble on Facebook, where Souvannarath again shares violent images and her own Nazi-themed sketches. The group, labeled by police as 'murderous misfits', had conspired to carry out a mall massacre on Valentine's Day and then take their own lives, authorities said. Investigators say the group planned to open fire inside Halifax Shopping Centre on Saturday. The plot was foiled by law enforcement at the last minute after they received a tip-off from a member of the public, according to a Halifax Police statement. 'Based on what we know so far, it would have been devastating - mass casualties would have been a real possibility,' Justice Minister Peter MacKay told reporters on Saturday. Chilling: She shared these selfies to Facebook, including one wearing a skull mask, right, like in the poster . Terrifying: A user that appears to be Souvannarath posted numerous messages to forums, including this one commending former Ku Klux Klan leader and neo-Nazi David Duke . Chilling: In 2013, she uploaded this sketch she made, including Nazi emblems and the phrase: 'White Power' 'The attack does not appear to have been culturally motivated, therefore not linked to terrorism. 'A day known to represent love and affection could have taken a much different meaning today had it not been for the exceptional efforts of the combined law enforcement community.' Souvannarath was arrested arriving at Halifax Stanfield International Airport by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police airport at 2am Friday. where she was being picked up by Shepherd. A senior police official told The Associated Press that Souvannarath confessed to the plot after her arrest. She had also programmed a number of tweets to be posted posthumously, the official said. On Saturday, the young woman's family posted a note to their door in Illinois reading: 'We are very sorry, but we are not prepared to make a statement at this time.' A neighbor, Kathy Schooley, told the Chicago Sun Times that she hadn't seen Souvannarath in a while but remembered her as a 'normal girl' who often changed her look from Goth to girly. Police said the group had access to firearms and presented a significant weapons-related threat. Weapons were seized by investigators, but it is unclear what type. Gamble was found dead inside his parents' home in Timberlea at 1.20am on Friday, after officers surrounded the property. Police heard a single gunshot before entering the house. Plot: Canadian police have foiled a murderous plot that would have seen at least two people storm a public place and kill as many people as possible on Valentine's Day before committing suicide, officials have said. Scene: Gamble, 19, killed himself at this Timberlea house early Friday after police surrounded the property . Target: Police say they have confirmed the target for the massacre was to be the Halifax Shopping Centre . Gamble's father told local media he needed privacy to grieve the death of his son, according to Global News . The fourth suspect, a 17-year-old boy, who was arrested at 11am Friday at a house in Cole Harbor, has now been released by police without charge but remains under investigation. The plot was intercepted after a tip off by a member of the public. According to CBC, the information came from Geneva, where Souvannarath lives. The tip only came in on Thursday and police were able to make the arrests within a matter of hours. Police said the four alleged plotters 'had some beliefs and were willing to carry out violent acts against citizens'. On Friday, Mike Savage, mayor of Halifax, applauded the work of police in Canada, describing the arrests as 'a great example of the fine work they do on a daily basis to help keep Canadians safe.' 'We have among the best emergency response in the country,' he told CBC News. 'The good news is they discovered all this and dealt with it very effectively. We always have to be vigilant.'","Lindsay Kantha Souvannarath of Geneva, Illinois, and Randall Shepherd, 20, of Nova Scotia, have been charged with conspiracy to commit murder .

"A former concert pianist dubbed 'The Car Lady of Chiswick' who died homeless in a road accident has been immortalised on Google Street View. Anne Naysmith died last week after being hit by a lorry in west London - but can be seen on the website leaning on a wall beside her trolley in an image taken six months before her death. The 78-year-old woman once played London’s prestigious venue Wigmore Hall but spent 25 years living in a battered blue Ford Consul in Chiswick with bags covering the windows.

'Car Lady': The 78-year-old woman (left, in the Google image; and right) once played London’s Wigmore Hall but spent 25 years living in a battered blue Ford Consul in Chiswick with bags covering the windows . Homeless: For her final 13 years she slept in an alley behind an Italian restaurant, the boiler room at Charing Cross Hospital, or a tiny garden she crafted in hedges behind Stamford Brook Underground station . In the image taken last August she can be seen sitting on a wall with her trolley, wiping something off the bottom of her shoe on Prebend Gardens - where she was famous for sleeping outside. Miss Naysmith lived in the car from the age of 29 until March 2002 when Hounslow Council towed it away because some people complained that it was an eyesore. For her final 13 years she slept in an alley behind an Italian restaurant, the boiler room at Charing Cross Hospital, or a tiny garden she crafted in hedges behind Stamford Brook Underground station. Google continually updates its images, taken by camera-mounted cars, but forever stores the pictures, which can be viewed by scrolling through time on the website. One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said of the photo: ‘It's very interesting and a fitting tribute to see her pictured where she once lived but I doubt she would've given it much thought. Removal: Miss Naysmith lived in the car from the age of 29 until March 2002 when Hounslow Council towed it away because some people complained that it was an eyesore . Domain: Miss Naysmith lived her later life on the streets, including on land by Stamford Brook Tube station . ‘She never had a computer or a mobile phone so I doubt she would've got very excited about it.’ Miss Naysmith would regularly be seen on the spot where Google's car captured her picture as it is near where she once slept in her car. Born in the Essex seaside town of Southend-on-Sea in 1937, she was a concert pianist in the Sixties - and trained at the Royal Academy of Music. But within a very few years, her life had fallen apart and she was living in her car. There are many theories about what triggered her fall. Some friends talk of a doomed love affair with a  chorister, while others claim she became depressed after her musical career stalled. Sally Mates, the actress and sister of retired Conservative MP Michael Mates and a neighbour who had known Anne for 30 years, insisted it all dated back to a breakdown she suffered in 1976. Miss Naysmith died last Tuesday, and Hounslow Council is expected to announce her funeral arrangements this week.","Anne Naysmith died last week after being hit by a lorry in west London .

"An Australian woman who has been visiting the Bali Nine for 10 years inside Kerobokan prison have described Myuran Sukuraman and Andrew Chan as 'really wonderful human beings'. The woman, who did not wish be named, is part of a Protestant church group funded by Australians who help those serving time inside the Bali jail. As the days are numbered for Sukuraman and Chan, who will be transported later this week to Nusa Kambagan where they will be executed, the woman described the atmosphere inside the prison as 'really sad'. 'Everyone is sad right now,' she said. The visitor said she had many private conversations with the Bali Nine pair and it would be a 'shame' to see them shot dead. Australian death-row prisoners Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali . Heartbroken parents Ken and Helen said their goodbyes to Andrew and fly back to Sydney ahead of execution . The queue for visitors at Kerobokan is long and the waiting room gets crowded . The parents of Sukuraman were allowed to bypass the regular visitor process . 'They're really wonderful human beings. They are the kindest, they are the gentlest, the smartest guys around actually, and that's what so sad because they have helped hundreds and hundreds of prisoners in there [Kerobokan prison],' the woman said. 'Many, many times I have seen and witnessed the many, many things they have done. It would be a very big shame to humanity if their lives were taken.' Earlier on Monday, the parents of Sukuraman were allowed to bypass the regular visitor process at Kerobokan jail as the family gathered to say their final goodbyes ahead of his impending execution. Chan and Sukumaran will be moved to Nusa Kambangan this week . Brintha Sukumaran leaves afer visiting her brother on Monday . The convicted drug smuggler's family arrived at the prison in a black van about 9.30am on Monday and were driven straight up to the visitors' door . They walked in and out, ignoring the media scrum that await for the family outside who follow them . The convicted drug smuggler's family arrived at the prison in a black van about 9.30am on Monday and were driven straight up to the visitors' door. They walked in and out, ignoring the media scrum that await for the family outside who follow them intensely along a three-metre-long path leading to the driveway. It comes after Andrew Chan's parents Ken and Helen Chan left Bali on Sunday night after saying goodbye for what could possibly be the last time. Sukuraman's mother and father were followed by a second black van believed to be carrying his family and friends. It's understood the families of the Bali duo have officially left. One woman, who was with Michael Chan told Daily Mail Australia: 'I cannot say anything. Sorry.' The convicted drug smuggler's family bypassed the regular process where visitors of inmates need to sign in. The prison on Nusa Kambangan, AKA death island, is a squalid facility surrounded by razor wire . Brother Michael Chan arrives to visit Andrew Chan on Monday . Michael and the Chan family enjoyed their first lunch together in nine years at the weekend . Identification normally must be provided to officials, a form must be filled out with details including the visitor's name, address, the prisoner's name and their relationship to the prisoner. It seems relatively easy to visit inmates inside the prison. A complete stranger could walk into a visitors registration complex, adjoining the prison, and request to see an inmate. A number is given to the visitor and they sit in a waiting room to wait for their number to be called. Regular visitors have warned others of the possible long wait and opt to stand outside the entrance to wait their number to be called. They tell people what to expect behind the metal door. When visitors are let through they have to hand in all electronic equipment, including cameras and mobile phones. Officials perform a pat down for security reasons before they let you into a roomful of inmates and their family. Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve . Bali Nine member Matthew Norman said it was 'impossible' to speak about the impending deaths of Chan and Sukumaran . The visiting hall is not enclosed but is undercover. Friends and family of inmates are forced to sit on the floor on woven mates while speaking to their loved ones, amongst other prisoners and their guests. A seasoned visitor cautioned that sometimes people would have sex inside the hall in front of everyone. She said the first time she visited, it gave her a shock to see the sight. Amongst the prisoners on Monday was Matthew Norman, the youngest of the Bali Nine. He was sitting and talking with an older woman, while leaning up against the wall. When approached to speak about the impending deaths of Sukumaran and Chan, the soft spoken prisoner said it was 'impossible' for him to be interviewed. Inside the jail, Norman is shielded from the media pack outside who have been stationed at the prison for about a month.","Myuran Sukuraman's family gathered to say  final goodbyes on Monday .

"Made from six savoury layers and four sweet ones, this 12-inch-tall pancake tower has been dubbed The Beast and contains 2,500 calories - the same as an average man's daily intake. Stuffed with cheese, cajun chicken, salami, Nutella, peanut butter, chocolate and a fried egg with maple syrup, the £15 meal has been created by chef Faisal Mayet who is challenging diners to finish it in less than 10 minutes  on Shrove Tuesday. Hearty eaters who successfully battle their way through the American-style meal at Pancake Corner in Urmston, Greater Manchester, get the dish for free. Chef Faisal Mayet with The Beast, his 10-layer sweet and savoury pancake containing 2,500 calories . Diners will have to finish the £15 American-style pancake dish if they want to get it for free . Mr Mayet, 27, said: 'I think it's pretty calorific. A stack of four American pancakes with just maple syrup is about 600 calories. 'I think it has got to be possible to finish it. We did a trial a while back with a just a stack of 10 plain pancakes and two out of four people succeeded, although one didn't do it in the time. 'Obviously this is a lot more, and there are many different flavours to contest with but I reckon someone out there will take it on and do it! 'I am not sure how all these different flavours like Nutella with spinach, or chicken with chocolate or even mayonnaise with toffee sauce are going to work out. That's why it's a challenge.' The layers are made up of American-style pancakes topped with Italian tomato sauce and cheese, followed by a layer of Cajun chicken and BBQ sauce, and a layer of marinated chicken mayo and black pepper. The pancake tower also includes layers of spinach, tomato and cheese and also a pancake topped with salami. Four sweet layers of strawberry and Nutella, peanut butter and sliced banana, hazelnut, slice banana and toffee sauce and a mix of milk and white chocolate buttons complete the dish. On top of the pancake tower is a fried egg smothered in maple syrup. The tower costs £15 and must be finished in just 10 minutes with winners getting the dish for free. In order to make the tower, which takes 15 minutes, Faisal and his team follow a strict plan of assembling the tower with the savoury pancakes at the bottom because they take the longest to cook. The tower takes 15 minutes to make and is assembled with savoury pancakes at the bottom . Mr Mayet added: 'We wanted to do something different this Pancake Day. 'We have a lot of these ingredients on the menu and we thought, how weird would it be to put them all together. You see these really delicious looking pancake towers with strawberries and cream only. 'We thought what if we just did everything you could have on a pancake and made it into a tower. It is kind of like having five layer as of main course followed by a five layers of dessert. It is definitely something no one else will have thought about.' Jacob Moss tries - and fails - to demolish the calorific pancake tower, which is on sale in Greater Manchester . Challenger Jacob Moss, 24, from Salford, a council worker, said: 'I couldn't eat it, not a chance and I'm a big eater! When I first saw it I thought 'that looks easy! 'I watch Man Vs Food and it looked nothing like that. I thought ""I can do this"". 'Then I got stuck in and there was not a chance I was finishing it. It was much more difficult than I thought. All the fillings are really hard to get through. I was there for about 40 minutes and by that point I had only eaten a quarter. 'This is definitely a challenge to do and with all those different fillings and textures and flavours it became really hard to get through. I would have a go at it again. It is deceptively hard!'","Chef Faisal Mayet created 12-inch-tall stack as Shrove Tuesday challenge .

"Richard Sandon was subjected to the 'cowardly' unprovoked attack while using his mobility scooter in Peterborough . A disabled RAF veteran has been left with serious injuries after being knocked out of his mobility scooter and stamped on by a thug who had tripped over his dog's lead. Richard Sandon, 52, who needs the scooter to get around, was subjected to the 'cowardly' unprovoked attack while travelling along a towpath in Peterborough. He moved out of the way when he saw the other man approaching but his dog - who is deaf - crossed the path and the suspect tripped on the lead. Despite Mr Sandon apologising, he was punched in the face and knocked out of his scooter. The man then punched and stamped on him as he lay on the ground. Cambridgeshire Police have released a picture of Mr Sandon in his hospital bed in order to highlight the attack, which happened at about 7.30pm on Friday near the bridge at Railworld. The dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Blue, was also kicked but not seriously hurt. Mr Sandon said: 'I cannot understand what sort of person would attack me and my dog Blue in this way. 'I am a disabled man who is obviously unable to defend myself. 'Blue is deaf and wears a high-visibility coat which states this. Neither of us were a threat to this man. I hope he is caught so he cannot do this to anyone else.' Mr Sandon retired from the RAF after 17 years of service after being shot in the leg while in South America. After Friday's attack, he was treated for a broken arm, fractured ribs, bruised kidneys and has various bruises around his face and body. Detective Constable Vicky Speirs said: 'Mr Sandon tried to explain that his dog was deaf while apologising but the man launched a vicious and cowardly attack. 'It was an appalling and unprovoked assault on a victim who couldn't defend himself. The 52-year-old veteran was attacked on the towpath (pictured) near the bridge at Railworld in Peterborough . 'I'm confident there would have been others using the footpath at the time and may have seen this man.' The attacker, who made off after the incident, was described as wearing a peaked black beanie hat with a red, yellow and green band around it. He was black, slim, about 6ft 2in, in his late 20s or early 30s, and wearing a military-style green khaki three-quarter-length jacket, jeans and white boot-type trainers. Anyone with information should call Det Con Speirs on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.","Richard Sandon was attacked while in his mobility scooter in Peterborough .

"Joshua Bonehill, 22, from Yeovil, Somerset, has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated harassment and malicious communications . A former public schoolboy has been arrested in connection with a string of anti-Semitic messages sent to an MP. Joshua Bonehill, 22, who is said to be behind an anti-Jewish rally organised for Stamford Hill, north London, next month, was arrested following allegations of abusive messages being sent to Labour MP Luciana Berger. Ms Berger, MP for Liverpool Wavertree and shadow minister for public health, has previously called on Twitter to do more to stop online abuse after receiving 2,500 anti-Semitic tweets in just three days last year. Metropolitan Police confirmed that a man had been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated harassment and malicious communications at an address in Yeovil, Somerset, on Friday. A Met Police spokesman added: 'Officers investigating allegations of malicious communications sent to a Member of Parliament via a social-media network have arrested a man. 'He was bailed to a west London police station until the end of March.' Hackney Borough Police also took to Twitter to confirm the arrest, writing: 'We can confirm a 22 year old man from Yeovil was arrested by Hackney officers investigating allegations of inciting racial hatred. 'The man has been bailed with conditions. Any breach of those bail conditions will be dealt with appropriately and proportionately.' Mr Bonehill wrote about his arrest on his self-titled blog and said he was 'completely shocked and traumatised by the incident'. He also claimed that his bail conditions prevent him from travelling inside the M25 – meaning he could be unable to attend the Stamford Hill protest if it goes ahead. He wrote: 'The police officers told me that I was to be arrested for one count of racial hate, one count of political harassment and one count of malicious communications, at this point, I could only assume that it was to do with liberate stamford hill.' 'In other words, I have been banned from London and this is due to last until the 26th of March 2015.' The 'Liberate Stamford Hill' protest, which has been advertised on social media as the 'Jewification of Great Britain', targets the north London area because of its large Jewish population. It has been planned for March 22. Labour MP Luciana Berger (pictured), who is shadow minister for public health, has previously called on Twitter to do more to stop online abuse after claiming she received 2,500 anti-Semitic tweets in three days . Earlier this month, a report by the Community Security Trust (CST) revealed that attacks against British Jews have reached a record high. Officials at the group, which monitors anti-Semitism and provides security for the Jewish community, recorded 1,168 anti-Semitic incidents in 2014. This was more than double the 535 incidents recorded in 2013 and the highest annual total ever recorded. The incidents ranged from violent attacks in the street to vile graffiti and criminal damage against synagogues and homes. The bloody conflict in Gaza and Israel is the single biggest contributor to the rise, the CST said. A CST spokesman told The Independent: 'We welcome this arrest and hope this puts an end to his supposed march in Stamford Hill. 'We're pleased to see hate on social media is being taken seriously by the authorities.'

"She makes no secret of the fact that she cheats her way to model cheekbones with make-up but it seems that Kim Kardashian's face isn't the only part of her body to benefit from contouring. The 34-year-old reality star has been using make-up to enhance her cleavage and has reportedly hired a contouring expert to make sure she gets it spot on. According to The Sun, the mother-of-one has enlisted the help of Jessica Mirdita, who uses bronzer and highlighter to give Kim 'an instant boob job'. Extra help: New reports claim Kim has hired a contouring expert in a bid to boost her bust with make-up . A source told the paper that Kim's husband, Kanye West, who has been revamping her style in recent months, is on board. 'He thinks she has a phenomenal body and every part should be celebrated,' they said. While little is known about Ms Mirdita, she is believed to be a colleague of Kim's long-standing make-up artist, Mario Dedivanovic. Her Instagram page is littered with photos of Mr Dedivanovic, many accompanied by gushing captions thanking him for being 'awesome'. 'Thank you for everything,' reads one especially complimentary missive. 'You're just as awesome of a person as you are a makeup artist! [sic] And thank you especially for taking me across the world.'

'Thank you again @makeupbymario for allowing me to assist you and watch you first hand working your magic.' MailOnline has contacted Kim Kardashian and Jessica Mirdita for comment. If true, her bust is just one of the many parts of Kim Kardashian's body to get the contouring treatment. Last year, she began using Charlotte Tilbury's £45 Supermodel Body, which promises to let you 'cheat your way to your dream body', to define and enhance her legs. Speaking about the product, which Tilbury describes as being 'like shapewear for your skin', Kim said: 'It's legendary! I used it on my legs.' Slimming trick: Kim Kardashian, pictured in Paris last September, uses Supermodel Body to  enhance her  legs . Make-up maestro Tilbury, who shared her beauty tips with Kim during her time in London, said of the product: 'I have poured all my make-up artist know-how into creating this incredible slimmer shimmer.' The product is enriched with FermiProtect, a wild shitake mushroom extract that protects the collagen fibres in the skin. According to Tilbury, it also has a firming effect and makes skin look toned and supple, even if it is really nothing of the sort. The product also contains precious-metal highlighter mix to re-create what Tilbury calls her secret 'celebrity limb trick' -  a technique which sees her use highlighter on the centre of legs and arms to create the illusion of leaner, longer limbs. Big fan: Tilbury was introduced to Kim during one of the reality star's regular jaunts to London . Another key ingredient, caffeine, will be familiar to anyone who has used cellulite creams in the past, and promises to detox the skin and banish puffiness. 'It's easy body makeup-in-a-minute,' adds Tilbury, who applies it by twisting the applicator and rolling the cooling-metal massager down the centre of  limbs before blending out with her hands. 'Any stylist will tell you that wearing black slims, streamlines and contours but white widens,' she continues. 'They’re basic laws of art, photography and make-up artistry. I always use the same principles when body contouring. 'You can elongate and slim by highlighting down the centre, and shading at the edges. I’ve using this trick on the glorious angels of the runway and stars on the red carpet for years.' Speaking about working with the reality TV star, Tilbury said: 'I had the pleasure of working with the charming and absolutely beautiful Kim Kardashian - she has the most outrageously natural long lashes I've ever seen!'.","Kim, 34, reportedly called in contouring expert Jessica Mirdita .

And the couple seemed just as reluctant to share their good news today, as they made a brief, straight-faced appearance together while leaving the Sun Inn pub in Hulverstone. Cumberbatch and his wife, who announced their engagement in the Times, were seen leaving the 600-year-old island inn before making their way into a 4X4 which was waiting at the entrance. The 38-year-old actor, famed for his role as Sherlock Holmes, donned a leather jacket, a flat cap and dark sunglasses as he attempted to shy away from the cameras. Meanwhile, his pregnant wife appeared to be displaying her commitment to the matrimony by wearing a stylish detective-style trench coat, similar to those worn in the Sherlock Holmes TV adaptation, complete with sunglasses and welly boots. Although the pair had taken ingenious steps to keep their wedding secret,  the likes of Andrew Scott - who plays master criminal Moriarty in the latest BBC adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s books - were present at the island church for the ceremony. Roads around the village of Mottistone had been cordoned off, staff at the hotel where the wedding party celebrated were sworn to secrecy, and a white van drew up outside the church at the crucial moment that Cumberbatch and his new bride Sophie Hunter emerged, blocking the view. Cumberbatch's new wife, 36, appeared to be displaying her commitment to the matrimony by wearing a stylish detective-style trench coat, complete with sunglasses . The 38-year-old actor, famed for his role as Sherlock Holmes, donned a leather jacket, a flat cap and dark sunglasses as he attempted to shy away from the cameras . The couple only appeared briefly before making their way into a waiting 4X4 which was waiting for the newlyweds at the entrance of the island pub . The sneaky deployment of the vehicle was a sly echo of the moment in the 2012 TV series when the detective used a truck in the plot to fake his death. Scott has previously joked about his screen relationship with 38-year-old Cumberbatch, reacting to the recent news that he is to become a dad, by joking: ‘I don’t think Benedict will ask me to be a godfather. I’m his arch nemesis.’ But he was one of 40 family and friends invited to yesterday’s ceremony at the 12th Century St Peter and St Paul church. Other guests included his War Horse co-star Tom Hiddleston. The party arrived there just before 3pm to be greeted by around a dozen wellwishers. Rain began to fall when the 36-year-old bride arrived at church wearing a traditional white dress at just after 3.20pm. Nemesis: Benedict Cumberbatch married Sophie Hunter yesterday. Pictured arriving at the church is Andrew Scott, who plays Cumberbatch's arch-rival Moriarty in Sherlock, and actor Tobias Menzies (top left) After the hour-long ceremony, the couple climbed into a car to drive the short distance to Mottistone Manor for their reception. Cumberbatch’s choice of the Isle of Wight came as a surprise to local residents who had no idea why he had chosen the island. But bride Sophie, a theatre and opera director, is thought to be distantly related to the first Lord Mottistone. The star is believed to have spent Friday night at the George Hotel in Yarmouth on the island. That evening, he joined 140 guests for a party there. Staff were sworn to secrecy but one employee said: ‘Benedict had a big party here on Friday night. There were about 140 people and it was a buffet meal. We have all been told to keep quiet about it and not tell anyone.’ Several of the partygoers spent the night in the hotel. And yesterday morning, locals joined in the pre-wedding excitement by posting a series of tweets. The bride and groom's car, thought to be a classic Mark VII Jaguar, was pictured pulling up to the church today, but there was no sign of Mr Cumberbatch or Miss Hunter . Intimate: The hasilty-arranged ceremony, organised to take place before pregnant Hunter gives birth, took place in this church in front of friends and family . Local councillor Chris Whitehouse wrote: ‘Isle of Wight’s gone mad with Benedict Cumberbatch marriage fever this morning. Fans of both genders flocking to Mottistone for a glimpse.’ Another added: ‘So if everyone is camped out at Mottistone church to gatecrash the celeb wedding, does that mean Sainsbury’s will be nice and quiet?’ There had been speculation that Martin Freeman, who plays Dr Watson to Cumberbatch’s Sherlock, may have been best man. But Freeman’s partner Amanda Abbington said such rumours were ‘bowel-shatteringly, mind-numbingly wrong’. Cumberbatch is enjoying a golden period in his career as one of Britain's most popular actors. He he has been lauded for his role as codebreaker Turing, having also starred in Star Trek: Into Darkness and 12 Years a Slave after leaping into the public consciousness in the title role of the BBC's detective series Sherlock. He previously dated the actress Olivia Poulet and the designer Anna Jones. In Sherlock, Cumberbatch was best man at sidekick Wason's wedding - while in real life, Martin Freeman is thought to have been Cumberbatch's best man . Close: Cumberbatch's Sherlock co-star Martin Freeman, , is understood to have been best man . The newlyweds spent the afternoon at the Sun Inn in Hulverstone - having a meal and a drink with locals at the pub . Hunter is an Oxford graduate who studied modern languages. She has directed a number of experimental and avant garde productions including a puppet version of Shackleton's Antarctic expedition which toured the US. She has taken acting roles in TV shows such as Doctor Who spin-off Torchwood and an episode of Midsomer Murders, as well as the 2004 film version of Vanity Fair starring Reese Witherspoon. Her stage productions as a director have also included the Britten opera The Rape of Lucretia. She has also had a music career of her own, recording a French language album with Robbie Williams's collaborator Guy Chambers in 2005 called The Isis Project, after they met through a mutual friend. His disappearance from the eligible bachelor lists came just a matter of weeks after fellow A-lister Hollywood star George Clooney married the lawyer Amal Alamuddin.

"Hundreds of reptiles have been discovered hidden in cigarette packets, hollowed out children's books and luggage after four men allegedly tried to smuggle them out of Australia. Skinks, geckos, frogs, pygmy pythons, and a dead death adder - one of the most venomous snakes in the world - were found in the staggering haul. A number of invertebrates and 33 dead reptiles, which appear to have been tagged for use as specimens, were also discovered amongst more than 157 reptiles and amphibians being transported out of Western Australia. Four men were arrested and charged - two from Russia and two from the Czech Republic - at Perth International Airport on February 6 after an investigation by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the WA Department of Parks and Wildlife. Skinks and geckos were among the hundreds of reptiles discovered hidden in hollowed out children's books in the post and on their way to European destinations . A little reptile is seen peeking out of a cigarette packet lined with tissue. There were 157 creatures - dead and alive - found by customs . Skinks, geckos, frogs, pygmy pythons and a death adder - one of the most venemous snakes in the world - were among the haul . Reptiles were found in packages posted from Carnarvon, Tom Price, Geraldton and Perth to European destinations and two of the men also allegedly had reptiles hidden in their luggage at the airport. All of the men face charges under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. ACBPS WA Investigations, Compliance and Enforcement Manager, Vesna Watt, said: 'These arrests should serve as a warning to those looking to illegally exploit Australia's natural fauna.' 'Customs and Border Protection takes these matters seriously and those caught could face up to 10 years in prison.' During a separate Parks and Wildlife operation on 5 February, a total of 92 reptiles were found at Broome, Derby and NSW post offices and in a car intercepted in Broome by WA Police. Reptiles were found in packages posted from Carnarvon, Tom Price, Geraldton and Perth to European destinations . Some of the creatures were tagged as specimens and transported in plastic bags. Four men were arrested and charged  at Perth International Airport on February 6 . A male from Western Australia and two NSW-based males, including a minor, could face more than 90 charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act. Senior wildlife officer Rick Dawson said the two incidents represented a major breakthrough in the detection of reptile trafficking in WA history. 'Together, more than 240 native species have been prevented from leaving the State in the space of a week,' Mr Dawson said. 'Posting animals in packages and secreting them in luggage is not only illegal but cruel and inhumane - more than 20 of the reptiles were either dead by the time these parcels were intercepted, or have since died. 'The cooperative effort by agencies to conduct these operations and protect native wildlife is outstanding.' Mr Dawson said among the animals seized from the operations were several species of reptiles listed as Specially Protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act. 'Our aim is to always release rescued animals back into the wild, if possible,' he said. People with information about the illegal removal of native animals or who notice any suspicious activity suggesting that animals are being illegally removed should call Parks and Wildlife's Wildcare Helpline 9474 9055, Customs Watch on 1800 061 800, the police, or Wildlife Trade Compliance on 02 6274 1900.

"One hundred and sixty square feet may not sound like much space for a family of three and their dog - but the Cox clan from Terre Haute, Indiana, are ditching their regular rental home in favor of scaled-down living. Their diminutive home on wheels, which is nearing completion, will hardly leave room to stretch out for Cori Cox, 37, his wife Angel Tyra, 33, their eight-year-old daughter, Amelia, and Dexter, their 60lbs dog. The dwelling, which measures eight feet by twenty feet, features living space, bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen, but minimized to the extreme. Scroll down for video . Tiny living: Angel Tyra, 33, poses in the doorway of her 160sq ft house, which is nearing completion at a cost of just $20,000 . Cosy: Amelia Cox, eight, snuggle up in the loft area of the tiny house, which is mobile but resting in Terre Haute, Indiana . Householders: Cori Cox and his with Angel, above, decided to downscale dramatically to lessen their environmental impact - and save cash . The change has seen Tyra throw out her shoe collection, and Amelia donate most of her toys to charity. The family has thrown out their beds, TV and any bulky furniture that would not survive the downsizing, according to the Indiana Star. It has cost them just $20,000 to build the house, which is nearing completion. Their kitchen will have space for a shrunken refrigerator and an oven the same size as a microwave. Tyra said she was skeptical at first, but came round to the idea later. She said: 'When [Cori] first brought the idea to me, I said, ""you're totally out of your mind... nobody lives like that. We can't do that."" But she came round to the idea - and the family is now expected to reap a huge saving from it - with their montly utility bill slashed to just $50 and the price of the property itself shrunk dramatically thanks to their own hard work building it. Full-size: The diminutive house can be dragged behind a pick-up truck and - in theory - will comfortably house three people and a dog . Lit up: The house still get electricity - but combined utilities are expected to come in at some $50 a month in total .

"Inmates at the prison holding Anders Behring Breivik are demanding that he is released from solitary confinement as they claim it is draining resources. His isolation demands that the five adjacent cells on his block at Skien prison, 87miles south-west of Oslo, remain empty, which fellow prisoners claim is 'preferential treatment'. The 36-year-old murdered  77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers -  in 2011 after detonating a bomb in downtown Oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on Utoya Island. Demands: Inmates serving their time alongside massmurderer Anders Behring Breivik wants him released form solitary confinement as they claim it has led to cutbacks for other prisoners . A representative for the inmates at Skein Prison said the demand to have Breivik released from solitary confinement came after his move to the prison resulted in cutbacks. 'We are mainly talking about the economics of it. It affects all of the other inmates,' he told state broadcaster NRK. 'He sits there with an entire cellblock to himself while there are austerity measures and cutbacks everywhere.' However, representatives from the Norwegian prison service said the other prisoners are not affected by Breivik's situation, as Skien gets additional funding to detain the mass-murderer. Breivik, a right-wing, anti-muslim extremist, was sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment with preventive detention in 2012. Pure evil: Breivik murdered 77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers - in 2011 after detonating a bomb in downtown Oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on Utoya Island . It the harshest possible prison sentence available under the Norwegian justice system and it is likely he will remain in prison for the rest of his life. Since his incarceration, Breivik has made increasingly desperate attempts to receive publicity, as well as issuing a number of bizarre demands. In February, he threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a PlayStation 3. It emerged that he had issued a typed list of 12 demands to authorities at the high-security unit in Skien in southeast Norway where he is serving out his sentence. The demands - outlined in a letter sent to the the French national newsagency AFP  - included better conditions for his daily walk and the right to communicate more freely with the outside world, which he argues are in line with European rights legislation. He also demanded that his PlayStation 2 games console be upgraded to a Playstation 3 'with access to more adult games that I get to choose myself'. Held apart from other prisoners since 2011 for security reasons, Breivik argued in the letter sent in November, last year, that he has the right to a wider 'selection of activities' than other inmates to compensate for his strict isolation.","Inmates at Norwegian prison claims Breivik's isolation drains resources .

"It's a debate that has raged across homes and offices for  years: Should you put milk in before you make a cup of tea, or afterwards? Now, this argument may have finally been settled as the British Standards Institution's (BSI) official guidelines claim the milk should be put in the cup first - at least when a pot is being brewed. It also explained that to gain the institution's approval, the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served. According to the official best practice guide by London-based British Standards Institution there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml of water used, and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served with milk. At least 2.5ml of milk should be added to a small bowl or cup before the infused water is added . The BSI is the business standards company best known for the BSI Kitemark. This mark is an internationally recognised symbol of excellence and is seen on everything from manholes to aircraft. Formed in 1901, BSI was the world’s first National Standards Body and in addition to the Kitemark, it also tests products to make sure they meet certain standards, such as rugby scrum caps, fire extinguishers and condoms, as well as issuing standards which act as guidance for companies looking to implement best practice. The institution's best practice when it comes to making a cup of tea is called 'Preparation of a liquor of tea for use in sensory tests.' Herbal teas (stock image) should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F) Steeping tea is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours and soften it. For standard black tea, freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F). Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water. Herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F). Regardless of the temperature, the standard explained that tea should be steeped for six minutes. According to this standard, two different sized pots made of porcelain or glazed earthenware are recommended, alongside two corresponding small and large 'bowls' - or cups. The first, large pot should measure be between 74mm and 78mm wide and stand between 83mm and 87mm tall. It should also have a lid. The ideal smaller pot should be between 61mm and 65 mm tall and ideally 64mm wide. The larger cup is should be between 57mm and 63mm tall by 109mm - plus or minus 3mm -compared to 49mm and 55mm wide. Either way, the large pot should not exceed 318ml, and the small pot must have a maximum capacity of 159ml. To make tea without milk, 2g of tea should be used for every 100ml of water. Pour freshly boiled water into the pot up to 4mm and 6mm below the brim. The tea should then be left to infuse for six minutes. This is also known as steeping and is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours. On average, a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves, so at least two bags should be used for a small pot of tea and at least four should be used for a larger pot. When made with milk, the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to milk in the cup. At least 2.5ml milk is recommended for use with a smaller pot, and 5ml milk is advised for the larger pot. This helps the milk mix more evenly though the 'liquor' when the tea is added to the bowl. To make sure the water doesn't scald the milk, the BSI explained that its temperature should not exceed 85°C (185°F), but should be above 60°C (140°F) for optimum flavour and sensation. Pour freshly boiled water into a pot up to 4mm and 6mm of the brim. The tea should then be left to infuse for six minutes. This is also known as steeping and is the process of soaking a solid - in this case tea leaves - to extract flavours and soften it . On average, a teabag weighs 2g but contains around 1.5g of tea leaves so at least two should be used for a small pot and at least four should be used for a larger pot. When being made with milk, the tea should be made and brewed in the same way and then added to at least 2.5ml milk in the bowl . The standard does explain that different sized pots can be used, but these measurements are recommended. If milk is added first and the teabag is dropped into the milk before it has infused with the water, then the steeping process is affected. It doesn't affect the brewing process, but it will cool down the liquid which will directly impact the effectiveness of the steeping. Dr. Stanley Segall at Drexel University, Philadelphia said: 'When you steep tea leaves in hot water, water-soluble materials are extracted to produce the tea. 'Changes in brewing temperature affect extraction of colour- and flavour-responsible chemicals exponentially.' He explained that reaction rates generally double for every rise in temperature of 18°F, and decrease by the same factor when the temperature is lowered.","British Standards Institution control Kitemarks and best practice guides .

"Detectives in two states are hunting for a NSW man accused of robbing a stranger at knifepoint after selecting his victim through a lonely heart advertisement. Beau Robert Bartlett responded to an advertisement through online classifieds site Craigslist in December. Police believe the man who posted the ad on Craigslist - more commonly used to sell furniture and find flatmates - had been seeking 'male companionship'. Bartlett allegedly arranged to meet the man outside his home in Liverpool in Sydney's west. He allegedly held the man at knifepoint and ransacked his unit, getting away with personal documents. Beau Robert Bartlett responded to an advertisement through online classifieds site Craigslist in December before allegedly robbing at knifepoint the man who posted the ad looking for 'male companionship' 'It appears the whole meeting had been allegedly set up for the purpose of an armed robbery,' Detective Sergeant Graham Hibbs said. Bartlett has no fixed abode and police believe he may be moving between NSW and Queensland. There is a warrant out for his arrest. The exploitation of dating applications has been linked to recent high-profile crimes, including the alleged murder of a woman on the Gold Coast last year by a man she met on Tinder. Chat applications, such as WhatsApp and WeChat also present a challenge to police as criminals turn to the technology to lower their chances of detection. A NSW Police spokesperson said peer-to-peer applications evaded the scrutiny of more public platforms including Facebook and Twitter. Detective Acting Inspector Paul Grace said there have been several cases in recent years linked to dating and chat apps and sites being exploited . 'Police certainly have concerns that a range of criminals including drug dealers and pedophiles are operating in that space and taking advantage of that hidden communication,' the spokesperson said. Detective Acting Inspector Paul Grace said there have been several cases in recent years linked to dating and chat apps and sites being exploited, including a man who was robbed at gunpoint by two men he arranged to meet through Skout. The offenders were sentenced to four years' jail. Det Sgt Hibbs said people using the internet to set up romantic encounters or other meetings needed to tread with caution.

"Farmers have hailed a 'miracle' after a cow at a nursery with no bulls suddenly gave birth to a calf. Harriet the cow has lived a life of celibacy since she moved to Pinewood Nurseries in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. But owner Liz Robinson was left stunned when  the Dexter cow suddenly went into labour and gave birth to calf Petal. Scroll down for video . Harriet the cow with calf Petal - who she bore despite living on a farm which doesn't have any bulls . Liz Robinson, from Pinewood Nurseries in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, said she was shocked by the birth . Ms Robinson, 30, said workers are calling Petal the 'moo-siah', adding: 'We had absolutely no idea Harriet was pregnant until she woke us up in labour. 'She didn't look any different to the others - just another fat cow. We have never bred cows at the nursery so we don't have any bulls. 'We weren't told Harriet was pregnant when we bought her so when Petal arrived we were all stumped.' Ms Robinson has owned Pinewood with her husband, Tom, and her sister Maria Jackson, both 33, for just over ten years. They have been rearing Dexter cows for meat in their farm shop for four years but have never bred their own, instead they buy them in from a livestock supplier. As a result they have never needed a stud on the farm and were shocked when Harriet woke them up with labour noises in the middle of the night. Harriett stunned the nursery's owners when she woke them up with labour calls in the middle of the night . Farm workers have started calling little petal 'the moo-siah' after her unexpected birth in December . Ms Robinson said: 'One of the cows woke Tom up with their loud lowing. He rushed down to see what was going on. 'When he got there Harriet was in the middle of labour and that was the first we knew. 'We thought some of the others might have been pregnant, but we've had no babies since.' Fortunately for Petal - named after the flowers grown at the nursery - she is not destined to be sold in the farm shop. Her surprise appearance on December 8 2014, eight months after Harriet had arrived at Pinewood with six other cows. A clue on the calf's appearance may lie in the fact that the typical gestation period for a cow is around nine months. Ms Robinson says Harriet is the only one of six cows brought in last summer to have given birth .","Cow is among herd living on a farm which doesn't have any bulls .

As locals and tourists alike, some scantily clad in hot and humid conditions, danced their hearts out, violence put a dampener on proceedings in three other cities holding their own festivities. In Sao Paulo, web news portal G1 quoted police as saying a man was stabbed to death at a street fest late Saturday, CBN radio reported. Another shooting saw one person hurt in the northern city of Salvador, which hosts one of Brazil's most spectacular carnivals. In Rio, the urban violence that so often scars the life of the city of more than six million has faded into the distance, at least for five days of festivities that began Friday and drew more than a million people Saturday to ""blocos"" street parties. Huge crowds descended on Ipanema Beach to watch some of the most popular groups, including Simpatia e Quase Amor (friendship is almost love). Although the atmosphere has been joyful, Rio authorities have deployed 15,000 police just in case emotions boil over amid the heat mixed with alcohol. An unidentified man opened fire in a central plaza during the Bloco da Lama, or Mud Street Party, killing one still unnamed man and leaving nine more injured . Cordao da Bola Preta, Rio's oldest street group, had hoped to attract as many as two million people Saturday. But Globo newspaper reported that only about a million attended, with the venue shifted slightly owing to pre-Olympic roadwork. 'I'm not sure the figures are right -- but in recent years, carnival has grown so much maybe there's nowhere else for it to go,' said Luiz Benevides, a 39-year-old drummer with a top bloco playing Beatles songs with a samba flavor. 'Street parties are the best thing that could ever happen to carnival. I have stopped watching the main parades as they are now so commercialized -- though maybe the street versions will go the same way.' After Sunday and Monday night's elite parades, the jurors will elect the winners ahead of next Saturday's Parade of Champions. A panel of judges will run the rule over the dancers and massed ranks of percussionists as well as their spectacular floats before determining who takes the crown worn currently by the Unidos da Tijuca school. The main parades at the Sambodrome designed by Oscar Niemeyer are the culmination of months of preparations. Violence has broken out at other cities celebrating Carnival with one man stabbed to death in Sao Paulo and another shooting taking place in Salvador . 'The excitement builds and builds. Then it's your school's turn to go and there you are, under the lights, the noise. It's an indescribable feeling,' said Megumi Kudo, a Japanese-born solo dancer with the Salgueiro elite school. The sweltering heat means the parades, broadcast live on television in an all-night spectacular, do not start until 9:00 pm (2300 GMT). The last school is not scheduled to finish until around 4:00 am (0600 GMT), leaving residents of the 'Marvelous City"" bleary-eyed -- though they will be dancing again through Monday and into Tuesday. The first record of carnival celebrations dates back to 1723 -- but the first samba school was not formed until 1928. Other cities, notably Sao Paulo, with its own Anhembi Sambadrome a major draw in Brazil's business hub, and the northeastern cities of Salvador and Recife, are also engaged in their own spectacular festivities. This year's carnival comes after a difficult year for Brazil, whose economy is facing zero growth this year while flagship oil firm Petrobras is mired in a huge corruption scandal.","Unidentified man opened fire in a central plaza during the Bloco da Lama, or Mud Street Party, killing a 21-year-old man and injuring nine others .

"He is the man behind many of the world's most popular gadgets, from the iPhone to the Macbook - and his designs may have even ventured into a galaxy far, far away. A new profile of Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive, claims he gave Star Wars director JJ Abrams advice on the weapons for the much anticipated movie. It also reveals that Steve Jobs was aware of Apple's latest product, the Apple Watch, before his death, and and that in keeping with Ive's design philosophy, the firms new 'spaceship campus' will have floors that curve into walls. Scroll down for video . Something new: A striking. sword shaped lightsaber emerges as the cloaked figure prepares to do battle. London-born designer Jonathan Ive is Apple's senior vice president of design. Since 1996, he has been responsible for products including the iMac, which ultimately led to the design of the iPod, and more recently Sir Ive was behind the drastic redesign of iOS 7. He was knighted in 2012. Ive also leads the Human Interface (HI) software teams across the company. Outside of Apple, Ive has designed products for charitable causes, including a Leica camera for a charity auction, and a Jaeger-LeCoultre sports watch for an AIDS-charity auction. Although the majority of his work is at Apple, Sir Jonathan has taken part is other projects - and is believed to have been behind the design of Eve, the female robot in the hit film wall-e . In 2001, he created a white polystyrene box to house a book by Paul Smith, and in 2013  worked with Marc Newson, who also helped design the Apple Watch, on a range of products for the Project Red auction - where an aluminium desk the pair worked on sold for $1.7 million. In a rare interview, Sir Jonathan revealed to the New Yorker he has also helped shape the far future in a conversation with Star Wars director and friend J. J. Abrams. Ive once sat next to J. J. Abrams at a boozy dinner party in New York, and made what Abrams recalled as 'very specific' suggestions about the design of lightsabres, it claims. 'It was just a conversation,' Ive told the magazine. Although he'd said nothing about cross guards, he had made a case for unevenness . 'I thought it would be interesting if it were less precise, and just a little bit more spitty . A redesigned weapon could be 'more analog and more primitive, and I think, in that way, somehow more ominous.' The result of an ambitious $4.05 billion buyout that saw Disney acquire complete autonomy over the franchise from LucasFilm in November 2012, the hugely popular first trailer revealed a new weapon - a fiery new lightsabre, with a cross guard, and a resemblance to a burning crucifix. Steve Jobs was aware of Apple's latest product, the Apple Watch, before his death, Ive said. In  the interview, Ive also reveals the firm's secret office on Apple's Cupertino capmpus. 'The room is about three thousand square feet, though its outsized reputation has led it to be described as 'cavernous; . It ends in a glass wall, behind which stand three eight-foot-high computer-numerical-control (C.N.C.) milling machines that shape plastic and metal to produce models and prototype parts. Ive's small team of designers work 12 hour days, and when Ive designed the space he wanted these machines to be as integrated into the studio as noise and dust pollution allowed. 'They make physical objects, and that is what we're doing,' he told his interviewer. 'Steve was the most focused person I've met in my life. 'It's terrifying that when you really truly focus, it seems a bit illegal. 'You can achieve so much. 'What focus means is saying no with every bone in your body to something you know is a good idea but you say no because you're focused on something else. I remember talking to Steve Jobs and asked why he was perceived as harsh. 'And I said couldn't we be more moderate? And he said why? And I said because I care about the team. 'And he said: 'No Jony, you're just really vain. You just want people to like you. I'm surprised at you, because I thought you really held the work up as the most important and not how you are perceived by people.'' 'People misunderstand Steve because he was so focused' Toward the end of his life, Jobs told Walter Isaacson, 'If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it's Jony. Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in and say, 'Hey, what do you think about this?' 'He gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product. 'And he understands that Apple is a product company. 'He's not just a designer. That's why he works directly for me. He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me.' Ive also spoke at a special celebration of Jobs life, held on the lawn at Infinite Loop, Apple's office. 'Steve used to say to me—and he used to say this a lot—'Hey, Jony, here's a dopey idea.' 'And sometimes they were: really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room, and they left us both completely silent. 'Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones which, in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound.' Ive said to me, 'I couldn't be more mindful of him. 'How could I not, given our personal relationship, and given that I'm still designing in the same place, at the same table, where I spent the last fifteen years with him sat next to me?' The Apple Watch was conceived 'close to Steve's death,' Ive said. Ive is also believed to have been the designer of Eve (left) from the Pixar hit film Wall-E .

"An arbitration panel ordered Lance Armstrong and Tailwind Sports Corp. to pay $10 million in a fraud dispute with a promotions company for what it called an 'unparalleled pageant of international perjury, fraud and conspiracy' that covered up his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Dallas-based SCA Promotions announced the 2-1 decision against the former cyclist when its lawyers said Monday they had asked Texas' 116th Civil District Court in Dallas to confirm the arbitration ruling, dated Feb. 4. The panel included a neutral chairman, who ruled in favor of SCA, and one person selected by each side. SCA paid Armstrong and Tailwind, the since-dissolved team management company, about $12 million in bonuses during Armstrong's career, when he won seven Tour de France titles. Those victories were stripped after Armstrong and his U.S. Postal Service teams were found to have used banned performance-enhancing drugs. Scroll down for video . Lost: Shamed cyclist Lance Armstrong was ordered to pay $10M Monday to SCA Promotions--a company he once took to court in a suit that helped bring to light his doping . SCA disputed the bonuses in arbitration in 2005, and the case produced the foundation of the doping evidence later used against him. Despite allegations of cheating, Armstrong continued to deny doping and the company settled with Armstrong and paid him $7 million inj 2006. The company sued Armstrong to get its money back after Armstrong's cheating was exposed by a report from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and a televised confession interview with Oprah Winfrey. The case was sent back to the original arbitration panel of independent chairman Larry Faulkner, SCA selection Richard Chernick and Armstrong pick Ted Lyons. In the 2005 arbitration hearings, Armstrong testified under oath that he did not use performance-enhancing drugs. 'Perjury must never be profitable,' the majority wrote in the new decision. 'Tailwind Sports Corp. and Lance Armstrong have justly earned wide public condemnation. That is an inadequate deterrent. Deception demands real, meaningful sanctions.' Armstrong attorney, Tim Herman, declined comment. 'We are very pleased with this result,' said SCA's president and founder, Bob Hamman. 'It is hard to describe how much harm Lance Armstrong's web of lies caused SCA but this is a good first start toward repairing that damage.' Armstrong argued his original settlement could not be overturned under state law. The arbitration majority said the $10 million was a penalty for Armstrong's lying and efforts to intimidate or coerce witnesses in the previous case. Lyons wrote in his dissent that the panel itself was not deceived in the original settlement when it signed off on a voluntary agreement entered by SCA. 'There is no Texas case or statute that allows for this type of sanctions motion nine years after the award was given,' Lyons wrote in his dissent. Lyons' dissent also attacked SCA, writing that in 2005 the arbitration panel had found the company to have engaged in selling insurance in Texas without a license, which could have exposed it to more than $22 million in damages under Armstrong's original claims. 'No party in this case came here with clean hands,' Lyons wrote. 'The final decision by the panel reminds me about the `do right rule.' It doesn't matter what the law is, let's just do what is right,' Lyons wrote. 'Arbitrators, like judges, don't have that luxury, and the Panel exceeded its authority by indulging itself here.' Armstrong also is being sued by the federal government and former teammate Floyd Landis in a whistleblower fraud action over his team's sponsorship contract with the Postal Service. That case is not set to go to trial before 2016.","Dallas-based SCA Promotions announced the decision against the former cyclist on Monday .

"A drunkard had to be rescued buttocks-first after he followed the smell of beetroot soup down a ventilation shaft. Onlookers posted footage of the bizarre rescue online after firefighters used sledgehammers to smash through the wall of an apartment block stairwell in Barnaul, Russia. According to reports, the 31-year-old was a homeless man who crawled head-first down a 16-inch wide chimney on Valentine's Day to chase the irresistible aroma of borscht. Scroll down for video . Hole in the wall: This man was saved bare-bottomed from a ventilation shaft in Barnaul, Russia, after reportedly chasing the smell of borscht - Ukrainian beetroot soup - down the 16-inch wide brick chimney . Tenants in the town, near the Kazakh border, told LifeNews the lock on an attic apartment was broken and the man's neatly-folded clothes and shoes were left next to the top of the shaft. They were alerted to the man's plight by a resident who heard 'strange sounds' when he sat down for lunch with his wife. 'I thought you never know, maybe someone decided to clean the ventilation shaft,' he said. 'But the noise was repeated, and as I approached it became clear there was a man there. He yelled: ""Save me, help me, I'm choking"".' Bum luck: The ill-fated explorer's cries for help were heard by rescuers who had to find a crack in the wall . Firefighters were called and tried a string of methods to pull the man out, including lowering a rope - but he reportedly could not grab hold of it because he was upside down. The rescuers then resorted to smashing through the walls. Because they did not know exactly where the man was, they had to break through the wall in more than one place before they found his bare buttocks staring back at them. It then took several minutes to widen the hole, tearing away pieces of brick and masonry, until the man's legs were exposed allowing him to be pulled to safety. It is now known why the man was naked at the waist, but Russian media reported he was thought to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Bricking it: The man quivered as firefighters widened the hole by tearing off chunks of brick and masonry . Light at the end of the tunnel: After several minutes, the man's legs were exposed and he was set free . The head of the rescue team Vladimir Prisyaznich told LifeNews: 'The shaft width is about 40cm. This size corresponds to a 14-year-old, but is not suitable for an adult.' The man, who reportedly complained of a broken arm, gave several theories as to why he had crawled into the shaft in the first place. One theory was that he had followed the smell of freshly-cooked borscht, the traditional Ukrainian beetroot soup. Another more believable theory was that he was a drug addict who was trying to steal from the residents for his next fix. He promised to return and repair the wall but the tenants, unwilling to believe him, have already started fundraising to patch up the hole, LifeNews reported.","31-year-old got stuck on Valentine's Day after following smell of borscht .

"A jilted groom-to-be who was dumped by his fiancée over Christmas has met the woman he is taking on what would have been their honeymoon, after he auctioned off her place on eBay. John Whitbread, 32, from Donisthorpe, Leicestershire, was heartbroken after his ex-fiancée Amy told him she wasn't 'ready to get married' and left him with a spare ticket to the Dominican Republic. Instead of cancelling the trip, Mr Whitbread decided to give the opportunity to a stranger to join him by auctioning off the £1,950 ticket, with offers starting at 99p. Scroll down for video . John Whitbread went in for a hug as he met raffle winner Kelly for the first time at the airport this morning . The pair were united on live television just under two hours before they will board the flight to the Dominican Republic . But when the two highest bidders - who offered £8,000 and £7,900 - failed to pay up he decided to raffle off the tickets for £10 instead. He was united with raffle winner Kelly Wood for the first time on ITV this morning just under two hours before he was due to board the plane at Manchester airport for the two-week all inclusive break. The advert said his desired companion must be an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss'. Arriving at the airport with his parents this morning, Mr Whitbread waited anxiously to see if the woman would arrive. John Whitbread was dumped by his ex-fiancee Amy just weeks before their Valentine's Day wedding . He said: 'I feel nervous. I don't know what to do with myself. I know her name is Kelly and what she looks like but I'm trying to save it all for the plane.' Mr Whitbread was undecided on how he would greet her and was debating whether to give her a hug, a kiss - or 'a high five' and added 'I'll see what comes naturally'. When they were finally introduced by a television crew they gave each other a hug. Miss Wood, who had set up her own Facebook campaign called 'Take Kelly Wood' said: 'I'm nervous - my hands have just started to shake. I feel like a swan, quite calm on the front but underneath I'm paddling away.' A television crew from Good Morning Britain, which filmed the moment they first met, asked the pair a few 'Mr & Mrs' style questions before they boarded the plane. Asked who would get the window seat Miss Wood offered it up to Mr Whitbread and whether they were thrill seekers or beach babes they agreed they were a bit of both. Miss Wood also revealed that she 'sleeps in the middle of the bed' and the worst habit Mr Whitbread could have would be snoring, which he previously revealed he did. His new companion was then introduced to Mr Whitbread's parents, who embraced her and their son. The pair will fly to the Caribbean region today, where they will stay in the honeymoon suite in single beds, and return on March 3. The pair admitted they were both feeling the nerves, as Miss Wood told Good Morning Britain her hands were shaking and Mr Whitbread said he didn't know what to do with himself . Instead of cancelling the honeymoon he decided to auction off the tickets to a stranger who might like to join him. The two highest eBay bidders failed to pay up, so he decided to sell raffle tickets instead . Explaining his decision to sell-off part of his honeymoon to the highest bidder he said: 'I was gutted when she said she didn't want to get married but I realised I couldn't mope forever and I didn't want what I'd already paid to the holiday to go to waste. 'Besides, I think it will be good for me to get away. I'm just looking for a new friend who fancies a holiday with someone fun.' He claims his girlfriend of two years, Amy, told him she had pre-wedding nerves and could not go through with their wedding due to take place on Valentine's Day this year. But when he tried to cancel their holiday the Co-op said he would only be able to claim half the cost back so he decided to keep the holiday and advertise for a new companion to join him. With the help of his best friend Craig Gibson, he set up an eBay auction to find someone to travel with him. Mr Whitbread, who described himself as a slim, 5'9, with dark hair who enjoys a good laugh, wrote on the advert: 'I'm not boring, I'm adventurous otherwise I wouldn't be doing something as ridiculous as this'. This is the moment the pair first met live on breakfast television this morning. Before then all they knew were each others names and what they looked like. Mr Whitbread said he wanted to save chatting for the plane . The pair will stay two weeks at the honeymoon suite at the Blue Bay Villas Hotel in the Dominican Republic . Kelly Wood had campaigned to win the ticket and was introduced to her holiday partner for the first time this morning. Miss Wood compared herself to feeling like a swan - fine on the surface but paddling underneath . Although the couple had been engaged for a year and due to marry on Valentine's Day, Mr Whitbread says he harbours no bitterness to his ex-fiancee. Speaking after the split, he said: 'I'm just really glad she told me before we went through with the vows on our big day - I suppose I've got to respect her honesty. 'But I'm certainly not going to let the money or the opportunity pass me by. 'When I found out at the travel agent I could only get half my money back I was looking at other deals and places I could go but I thought, ""No, I wanted to go on this holiday"". 'I called my best friend and he agreed so I headed straight to his house to make the ebay page. 'Everyone I know is taken and I'd rather go and enjoy it with someone new that I'd never otherwise get to meet. Mr Whitbread admitted he could only get half his money back from the travel agent and decided he wanted to go on this holiday but would like some female company . A friend help him set up an advert where he asked for an 'easy going down to earth' woman, a British citizen with a passport and 'good looking wouldn't go amiss' 'I'm not looking for a relationship - this could be an opportunity for someone who has never had the chance to take a holiday like this before. 'I'm not looking for anything apart from a fun holiday. If the girl is sporty and wants to do some scuba diving with me that would be great too.' After being overwhelmed with the response, Mr Whitbread pledged to donate any money over £1,050 to testicular cancer research, and so far the figure has reached £2,000. He added: 'People have said I've got real balls to do this so I thought I might as well try and make some money for charity if I can to.' Kelly Wood set up her own Facebook page to get people to buy tickets and donate to Mr Whitbread's cause and eventually won the seat herself. She posted this message this morning after keeping her win a secret . His ex-girlfriend Amy said: 'I just didn’t feel ready to get married and John wasn’t my soulmate. Obviously it’s difficult for John, I’m finding it hard too. 'It’s obviously not nice to finish with someone over Christmas but I thought it was better that he knew now, sooner rather than later. 'It was better that I called it off now than getting to the altar and not being able to go through with it. 'Fair play to John. I’m pleased that he’s doing something positive.'","John Whitbread was dumped by ex-fiancée weeks before their wedding day .

"A former mayor and his wife accused of the murder of 43 trainee teachers were the stars of one of the world's biggest carnivals before they were incinerated. Effigies of Jose Luis Abarca, former mayor of Iguala, Mexico, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda, were set ablaze in a ceremony to get rid of evil spirits and ill feelings. The couple are currently in jail after they were charged with the kidnapping of 43 trainee teachers in Iguala last September. It is believed they ordered corrupt police to arrest the students and hand them over to gangsters. None of the students have been seen since. Scroll down for video . Cleansing fire: Effigies of Jose Luis Abarca, former mayor of Iguala, Mexico, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda, were set ablaze in a ceremony to get rid of evil spirits at Mazatlan International Carnival . Burn baby, burn: The effigies tied back to back and were stuffed with fireworks before being ignited . Jose Luis Abarca (right), former mayor of Iguala, and his wife Maria de los Angeles (left), are currently in jail after being charged with the kidnapping of 43 trainee teachers . The scandal has rocked Mexico, which is fighting a long-running war against criminal cartels who control the flow of drugs to the lucrative U.S. market north of the border. So when the time came for organisers of the International Mazatlan Carnival to choose a figure for its annual Quema del Mal Humor (Bad Mood Burning) ritual on Saturday, their decision had practically been made for them. The climax of the ritual is the incineration of a giant puppet, usually modelled after a public figure. 'Think massive exploding piñata on steroids,' says one tourism website. Organisers of the carnival in Sinaloa, which is listed as one of the world's top three by Forbes, chose the couple because they represented the most evil people locals could think of. Director of Culture of Mazatlan, Raul Rico Gonzalez, said: 'They were chosen because they epitomised the new political masters who enriched themselves regardless of the cost to the welfare and indeed the lives of others.' Crowds cheered as the effigies burst into flames, spewing fireworks at the climax of Saturday night's ritual. Abarca and Pineda were tracked down last November to a squalid flat in Mexico City. They went on the run when suspicion turned on them over the disappearance of 43 student teachers. The students vanished after they were taken into custody by police. It is alleged that police handed them over to a local drug gang controlled by Pineda, a scion of a Mexican crime family.

Magic night: The carnival in Mazatlan has been going for 117 years and has many traditions . Tourism: The five-day event draws plenty of travellers who come to see the exotic sights of Mexico . Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said the cartel's leader, Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, describes Pineda as 'the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala'. She allegedly believed the students had come to town to disrupt a speech she was going to make, but it has since been claimed they were merely passing through on their way to Mexico City. They were apparently set to attend for a service in the Mexican capital in remembrance of students massacred there in 1968. The case has spurred anger across the country, and large protest marches demanding action by the government have been held in Mexico City, Acapulco and the capital of the state of Guerrero, Chilpancingo.","Jose Luis Abarca and Maria de los Angeles Pineda are in held in Mexico .

"Stéphane Desormiere has grown used to being woken up at 4am by a crew member. That's because it's at that time that rowdy guests, exhausted from a night of partying at whichever port the yacht has docked at for the night, roll back on board ready for some late night sustenance. For the French superyacht chef, who has Michelin-star experience both on land and at sea, it's suddenly all hands on deck. 'I have to be quick. There's not a lot of notice so you have to move fast and you can't be sleepy. I usually get the coffee out first which buys me some time to cook whatever they need.' Scroll down for video .

The kitchen uses the freshest red snapper, sea bream and sea bass in it's  menus: all bought daily from the nearest island's fish market . 'At that time of night, guests usually ask for a full English breakfast, although I have been asked for things like beef fillet then too. Whatever the request, so long as I have the ingredients, I will make it.' If it's an unusually accommodating attitude, it's because it has to be.

Every day a guest might have a different request' To charter the Axioma for a week guests will need to find £390, 000 (€525,000/$600,000), which means Stéphane's clients are a pretty exclusive bunch. Clientele ranges from oligarchs and celebrities to high level business owners and developers. Luckily, chef Stéphane is not the kind of man to be intimidate. 'For me, it's about the challenge. Every day a guest might have a different request. 'I can't plan ahead as the menu is so tailored to the fresh ingredients that are available at each island. I might have a rough idea in my head what I'm going to make but you have to be flexible. I go shopping at local markets for fresh meat and fish every day if I can.' 3D cinema: Clientele on the Axioma range from oligarchs and celebrities to high level business owners and developers . If guests go out partying (a frequent occurrence at the right port) the chef is on standby for their return for 4am feasts of beef fillet . That means he has to have a vast knowledge of food as the yacht can be chartered anywhere in the world from the Caribbean to the Mediterranean, Adriatic, Maldives and Asia. On top of that Stéphane has to be ready to fulfill special requests from guests including everything from £1,100 (€1,500/$1,700) Beluga caviar, slabs of Wagyu beef (Japanese beef known for its deliciously marbled fat) and jamón ibérico (fine Spanish cured ham). 'Ideally if they want something unusual they order it in advance of the trip so I can order things in time. That doesn't always happen, in which case I get on the phone to a supplier and fly ingredients over, then courier them  to the yacht.' If he's served any famous names, he's not saying: discretion is paramount for all staff working on board and it's more than his salary's worth to let slip anything too salacious (about £66,000/$101,000 a year for a top chef, for those who are interested). Special requests include  Beluga caviar, slabs of Wagyu beef (Japanese beef known for its marbled fat) and Spanish jamón ibérico . There is a fully functioning gym on board and 22 crew on the Axioma, one of which is a sous chef who accompanies Stéphane in the kitchen . There are 22 crew on the Axioma, one of which is a sous chef who accompanies Stéphane in the kitchen. Midnight feasts aside, both wake up at about 6am to start breakfast; normally it's a full English but often a continental breakfast is preferred. The galley kitchen is a fairly cramped affair but one that's become second nature after 13 years cooking on the high seas. 'I can spend up to 14 hours a day in the kitchen, prepping food, devising menus cooking and serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. The long hours are probably the toughest part.' Although travelling around the world and seeing myriad different countries, cultures and cuisines more than makes up for it, and is one of the biggest undeniable perks of the job. It also means that rather than store ingredients for days on end he can buy everything - within reason - fresh. Red snapper and sea bream are firm favourites on board. 'I love to cook fresh fish, nothing is better to work with or has such a lovely texture. My specialities are salt-crusted sea bass and moules mariniere, which sounds simple but when they are that fresh they are exceptional.' Chef Stéphane uses gold leaf to decorate plates (left) and doesn't regret moving from dry land to cooking on a yacht for one second . The Axioma has 22 crew, one of which is a sous chef who accompanies Stéphane in the galley kitchen which is about four metres long . What can be homemade on board is, including everything from five type of foie gras to vanilla ice cream, so it takes a deft hand and calm countenance to see each week through. 'Before working on yachts I spent 20 years cooking in restaurants. The technique is very different. 'Here, space is far more restricted – the kitchen is only four metres long with a long counter running along each side – so I have to plan carefully. I fry what I can to leave space in the oven for only what's necessary.' What can be homemade on board is, including everything from five type of foie gras to vanilla ice cream . He can organise a five-course meal on any stretch of beach large enough to swing a red snapper and is constantly amazed at the dishes guests request. 'One family asked me to cook a cassoulet. It's a simple enough French dish of wild beans and sausage but we were in almost 40 degree baking heat. That was pretty unusual but I was happy to do it for them. Usually people ask for light Mediterranean style dishes which impact the stomach a little less.' They are in swimwear after all. He can organise a five course meal on any stretch of beach large enough to swing a red snapper and is  amazed at the dishes guests request . But, for Stéphane, the best moment comes at the end of every day. 'When guests call you up from the kitchen to the front of the table to say thank you for such a delicious supper, it's a wonderful feeling. It makes the long days more than worth it.' 'The 72 metre (236.2 ft) AXIOMA is available for last minute winter charter in the Caribbean and for summer in the Mediterranean through Yachting Partners International (YPI) from EURO 525,000 per week.

"A popular US-based beauty brand is claiming to have created a one-of-a-kind lip treatment which promises to completely eradicate any signs of dryness or chapping - a common problem which plagues millions people each year as soon as the colder winter months arrive. But according to Bite Beauty, chapped lips could well be a thing of the past thanks to the brand's newly-launched Five Night Fix For Lips, a $15 treatment kit which includes a lip exfoliating stick and an overnight mask. Bite claims that the lip-treating duo will 'replenish and revitalize lips', leaving you with a 'healthy, soft and nourished' pout after just five nights. Scroll down for video . A quick fix: Bite Beauty's $15 Five Night Fix For Lips includes an exfoliating lip scrub stick and an overnight lip mask treatment . Eager to find out if such a quick-fix cure was really possible, I put Bite's treatment to the test. Having been a dedicated lover of lipstick for many years now, I've always found it irksome that, during the coldest times of the year, I am forced to abandon my favorite bold lip colors in favor of boring balms and salves in an attempt to heal my dry, cracked, wind-battered lips. As a result of the recent frosty weather in New York - gale-force winds and sub-zero temperatures - my lips have been worse than ever during the past few months and I was desperate for a solution. On paper the treatment seems incredibly well-thought out. Bite have even ensured that all of the ingredients included in their products, which are intended to be used over night, are 'food-grade', meaning that they can be ingested without any fear that the user will be exposed to something dangerous or unpleasant. Similarly, the dosage is incredibly generous; there is more than enough product to last you through the suggested five nights of use. But how does the treatment fair when it is actually put to use? Day one: My lips were dry and sore, and I am unable to wear lipstick . Day four: After using the treatment for three nights, I braved lipstick for the first time in weeks. Iwas happy to see that it applied smoothly - with just the tiniest hint of dryness detectable . Day six: Following five nights of treatment, my lips were back to their usual, flake-free state and all my lipsticks were back in action . Upon first use, I was quite surprised to find that the exfoliating stage of the Bite treatment, which comes packaged in a fun, medicinal jar, was actually rather uncomfortable to use. According to the brand's description, the Whipped Cherry Scrub Stick is supposed to 'gently buff away impurities' with 'castor oil beads to help leave lips soft and supple' and 'fruit extracts to help brighten and restore lips'. But despite its deliciously sweet scent - it really does smell, and taste, like cherry-flavored sugar - I found that the scrub had a bit of a bite to it and left my already-dry lips feeling red raw and quite sore. In all fairness, I perhaps didn't hesitate to think about was the fact that I was rubbing my lips with a stick of what is essentially a lump of sugar granules; it might have been worth proceeding with a slightly lighter hand, at least initially. Thankfully, the second stage of the treatment - the Agave Lip Mask - was wonderfully soothing, and really felt like it was helping to nourish my flaky, cracked lips. The idea is to leave the lip mask on overnight, in order to allow it to work its 'magic' while you sleep, so, following the instructions carefully, I left the treatment on and headed to bed. Initially, the next morning, I didn't notice a huge amount of difference - until I realized, at around lunchtime, that I hadn't reached for my lip balm once since leaving the house which, given that I had taken to applying some sort of salve almost every 15 minutes, was something of a personal triumph. A further two nights' worth of treatments later and the improvement was far more obvious. My lips were smooth, soft and practically flake-free, bar the odd stubborn crack which refused to heal straight away. I even dared to reach for one of my favorite lipsticks and was happy to see that it applied pretty smoothly - with just the tiniest hint of dryness detectable. And on day six, the cure was complete as far as I was concerned - although I still had plenty of both of the products left over. After five nights of use, my lips were back to their usual, flake-free state and all my lipsticks were back in action. Plus, there is still plenty of both products left over, which means I don't have to purchase the same kit again, should my lips run into any trouble in the future. All in all, I'd consider this test a real success. And I'm not the only one who thinks so; thus far, the product has received an overwhelmingly positive response on social media, with fans of the brand taking to both Twitter and Instagram to heap praise on the treatment. 'Holy grail beauty item! Couldn't live without it this winter!' one person wrote on Instagram, while another added: 'The only thing that works [to help chapped lips] is the 5 night fix for lips by @bitebeauty - I don't wear lip balm anymore!'","The $15 treatment consists of a lip exfoliator and an overnight lip mask .

"Hundreds of Jewish graves have been desecrated in a 'heinous anti-Semitic attack' in France. The country's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the attack happened at the main Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union, in the Bas-Rhin department in Alsace, on the German border. Up to 400 gravestones were vandalised by being kicked over, or had Nazi swastikas daubed on them in red paint. Scroll down for video . 'Heinous anti-Semitic attack': A defaced tombstone pictured yesterday at the main Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union, in the Bas-Rhin department in Alsace, on the German border . Shocking scene: Up to 400 gravestones were vandalised by being kicked over, or had Nazi swastikas daubed on them in red paint . 'Odious act': France's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve (at the site of the Copenhagen attack yesterday) said the country would 'not tolerate this latest attack which harms the values all French people share' Mr Cazeneuve said: 'This was an odious act against religious freedom and tolerance. France will not tolerate this latest attack which harms the values all French people share.' The incident follows the murder of four Jewish people by a Kalashnikov wielding terrorist following a siege in a Paris Kosher store last month. Mr Cazeneuve said 'everything will be done to establish the identity of the perpetrators' of the Sarre-Union attack 'so as to bring them to justice'. Manuel Valls, France's Prime Minister, joined in condemning the 'vile anti-Semitic act', and also pledged that the criminals responsible would be brought to justice. Many of the Jews buried in Sarre-Union were linked with the Second World War Holocaust, when some 76,000 French Jews were entrained to their deaths in German concentration camps. Police response: A gun attack on a synagogue in Copenhagen left one Jewish man dead this weekend . Massacre: The Charlie Hebdo atrocities in Paris saw 20 people die, including the three terrorists responsible . Philippe Richert, UMP President of the Alsace Regional Council, said it 'was too early to say' who might be responsible for the Sarre-Union attack, but confirmed that police were 'flooding the area'. The Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union has been attacked in the past - 54 graves were desecrated there in 2001, and 60 in 1988. Alsace is an area with a terrifying history of anti-Semitism, with pograms - organised attacks against Jews - regularly taking place there in the Middle Ages. In 1940, during the Second World War, Alsace was annexed to Germany, and 2605 Jews from Bas-Rhin alone were murdered during the Holocaust. Neo-Nazis still living in the area have been linked with regular attacks on Jewish sites, including cemeteries. Today's damage was first reported in the middle of the afternoon by a number of visitors to the cemetery. A criminal enquiry was launched soon afterwards. A gun attack on a synagogue in Copenhagen left one Jewish man dead this weekend, as Jewish leaders complain of a rising tide of anti-Semitism. The Paris attack in January was part of the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine atrocities, in which a total of 20 died, including the three terrorists responsible. All were radical Islamists furious at Charlie Hebdo publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, but they also made clear that they wanted to kill Jews. Linked with Al Qaeda and Islamic State, they said they wanted to take 'revenge' for Israel's war against Arab neighbours in the Middle East - particularly Palestinians. The Paris attacks led to security being stepped up at synagogue and other Jewish sites across France. Three soldiers were attacked by a knife-wielding thug linked with Islamic terrorism in the Riviera city of Nice earlier this month too. Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, has said the situation is now so bad that European Jews should immigrate to Israel.","Attack at Jewish cemetery in Sarre-Union in Alsace on German border .

"The on-off girlfriend of Kim Kardashian's infamous sex tape partner Ray J has been arrested for allegedly 'beating him to a bloody pulp'. TMZ reports that Princess Love attacked her 34-year-old partner  last Wednesday morning around 3am in New Orleans after waiting for him to return to his hotel from a strip club. Ray J reportedly told police that Princess went 'ballistic' before cracking several of his ribs, busting his lip open, and tearing a ligament in his knee. Scroll down for video . Threat: Princess Love, pictured with Ray J back in September, apparently beat the rapper 'to a pulp' after he spent the night at a new Orleans strip club last Wednesday . Someone staying at the W French Quarter Hotel also apparently heard Princess scream: 'I'm gonna kill you.' A security guard at the complex then saw Ray J bleeding and called 911, according to TMZ. Police confirmed to MailOnline that Princess was charged with domestic abuse and battery. Putting their argument to one side, Ray J apparently bailed his girlfriend out and paid $10,000 for her lawyer. Despite the severity of the reports, in recent Instagram photographs Ray does not appear to show any sign of injury. His face is not bruised and his lips are not cut.

"Hit maker: Singer-songwriter Lesley Gore, best known for her song 'It's My Party', died Monday of lung cancer at a hospital in Manhattan. Pictured above at the Sirius Satellite Radio studios in 2007 . Singer-songwriter Lesley Gore, who topped the charts in 1963 at age 16 with her epic song of teenage angst, 'It's My Party,' and followed it up with the hits 'Judy's Turn to Cry,' and the feminist anthem 'You Don't Own Me,' died Monday. She was 68. Gore died of lung cancer at New York University Langone Medical Center in Manhattan, according to her partner of 33 years, Lois Sasson. 'She was a wonderful human being — caring, giving, a great feminist, great woman, great human being, great humanitarian,' Sasson, a jewelry designer, told The Associated Press. Brooklyn-born and New Jersey-raised, Gore was discovered by Quincy Jones as a teenager and signed to Mercury Records. She graduated from Sarah Lawrence College with a degree in English/American literature. Gore's other hits include 'She's A Fool,' ''Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows,' ''That's the Way Boys Are' and 'Maybe I Know.' She co-wrote with her brother, Michael, the Academy Award-nominated 'Out Here On My Own' from the film 'Fame.' She also played Catwoman's sidekick in the cult TV comedy 'Batman.' In the 1990s, Gore co-wrote 'My Secret Love' for Allison Anders' film 'Grace of My Heart,' released in 1996. A couple of years later, she appeared in 'Smokey Joe's Cafe' on Broadway. Gore had been working on a stage version of her life with playwright Mark Hampton when she died. In 2005, she released 'Ever Since,' her first album in 30 years, but was sure to revisit older hits in front of fans. 'If I've learned anything in this business,' she told The New York Times that year, 'how stupid would it be not to do 'It's My Party' when people come to hear it?' Time to cry: Gore pictured above singing and playing the piano in 1966. 'It's My Party' topped the charts in 1963.

She officially came out to the public when she hosted several episodes of the PBS series, 'In The Life,' which dealt with gay and lesbian issues. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Gore turned 'You Don't Own Me' into an online video public service announcement demanding reproductive rights which starred Lena Dunham and Tavi Gevinson, among others . In the last few years, she performed at Feinstein's at the Loews Regency in New York and, along with Ronnie Spector and LaLa Brooks, headlined the 'She's Got the Power' concert outdoors at Lincoln Center in 2012.

"Travelling with toddlers can be hellish. Especially if you leave before dawn and realise en route to the airport that you've forgotten to bring your pram. Oh dear. It was too late for us to turn back and, no, you can't buy a buggy at Gatwick because nobody is stupid enough to leave theirs at home. Happily, Anassa, a Thanos family hotel in North-west Cyprus, is acutely geared up for children. A fine spot on the shoreline: Anassa occupies a pristine position on the north-west coast of Cyprus . Friends had told us it was the best hotel for children that they had ever stayed in, so our expectations were high. After a four-and-a-half-hour flight, and a 45-minute drive from Paphos airport, my wife and I and our two children (aged three and one) were greeted with cold flannels and glasses of cool bitter lemon. A buggy materialised on request and our anxieties melted away with our ice cubes. Anassa, meaning 'queen' in ancient Greek, lives up to its regal name. It's all marble floors, water features and amphora pots. The service is miraculous and there is even a 24-hour (complimentary) infant menu. Perched on a hilltop overlooking a Mediterranean bay, the hotel is within walking distance of its own sheltered beach, a boat ride away from ravishingly beautiful blue sea lagoons and a five-minute drive from Aphrodite's bathplace, where the goddess disported herself. (Legend has it your beauty can be restored with a drop of its spring water, but annoyingly, it has yet to work for me.) There is no denying it is an expensive destination. If you need to ask how much the villas with infinity pools cost, you won't be able to afford them. Anassa has all the creature comforts - two spectacular outdoor swimming pools, an indoor pool, spa, four restaurants - but its USP is its design: it resembles a traditional Cypriot village. The gardens and white-washed villas are arranged around a square with its own Byzantine chapel. Yes, it's a little Disneyfied, but it works. The hotel is cleverly laid out on different levels so it never feels full. Directly above the spa is the chapel, so you can worship your body and soul in quick succession. The clientele is intriguingly Euroeclectic. There was a handsome, septuagenarian, Italian gentleman with a beautiful young wife and three daughters dressed in identical couture; David Cameron's Eton contemporary Octavius Black and his Cameron-Cutie wife Joanne Cash; and the odd tattooed Eastern European with a body-builder's physique, gold chains around his neck and a golden woman on his arm. We knew Cyprus from previous trips and its extraordinary range of Roman amphitheatres and mythological sites. But you can be forgiven for not wanting to leave the hotel grounds. We made a point every day of walking through its fragrant gardens lined with jasmine and bougainvillea. When we found we didn't have appropriate footwear for our one-year-old son, the staff offered to fetch us Crocs from the capital 80 miles away. We bravely walked out to buy a €3 pair from the local market; a transaction felt positively subversive. There is no better way to stress-test a hotel than with toddlers. Every request was met instantly. Please can you erect netting on our terrace to prevent our tearaways from escaping into the garden? Done, sir. Please can you put a latch on the front door to prevent them letting themselves out? No problem. Making a splash: Anassa is ideal for family holidays (even if you've gone and forgotten the pram) In the afternoon, we tended to drop the children off at the kids' club, which they loved. It was air-conditioned and manned by calm and kind polyglot staff. Almost all of the 166 rooms have sea views. We had two interconnecting rooms with terraces. The decor was bland, but quality bland. Breakfast was served on an outside terrace under almond trees. There were fresh bowls of fruit salad, date truffles and raw honey served on the comb. In the evenings, we dined with the children al fresco in the square, serenaded by local musicians. On offer was a traditional Cypriot buffet, a smorgasbord of Greek salads and roast suckling pig on a spit. Anassa is a second generation family-run hotel, and it prides itself on repeat visitors. We left with indelible memories of swimming in the pellucid waters of the blue lagoon, dancing with our children under the moonlight to violinists and passing a school of dolphins in our motorboat. It was like going on honeymoon - but with your children in tow. Classic Collection Holidays (0800 294 9318, www.classic-collection.co.uk) offers seven nights at Anassa from £8,799 for a family of four during May half-term. Price based on two adults and two children sharing a family studio, full-board, and includes return flights to Paphos and private transfers.","The five-star Anassa resort sits on the north-west coast of Cyprus .

"An innocent man who  spent 18 years in prison including a dozen in solitary confinement after being wrongfully convicted of the murders of six people is fighting for reform in Texas's justice system. Anthony Graves, now 49, was sentenced to death in 1994 after being found guilty of killing two adults and four children in Somerville, Texas, in 1992 based on a co-defendant's false testimony. Despite prosecutors failing to present any physical evidence, he was forced to spend 18 years behind bars and was scheduled for a lethal injection twice before eventually being freed in 2010. For 12 of his years in prison, Graves was held in solidarity confinement, which saw him spend at least 22 hours a day locked alone in a tiny concrete cell with a metal bed and a toilet. Scroll down for video . Free man: Anthony Graves (pictured), now 49, was sentenced to death in 1994 after being found guilty of killing two adults and four children in Somerville, Texas, in 1992 based on a co-defendant's false testimony . Isolation: Despite prosecutors failing to present any physical evidence, Graves was forced to spend 18 years behind bars, including 12 in solitary confinement. Above, this photo is believed to show Graves' cell . Now, the free man, who was released after the key witness in the trial recanted his testimony and a judge ruled the prosecutor had withheld evidence, is seeking what he deems 'life-saving' reform. Speaking to Take Part, Graves, who was also  jailed after the prosecutor intimidated witnesses, said long-term isolation can lead to psychological damage that lasts even when an inmate is freed. 'Solitary confinement is designed to break a man's will to live,' he said. 'You're sitting there, in a little cage, day in and day out, year in and year out, waiting for the state to execute you or release you.' While he was on Texas's death row, Graves  said he 'witnessed men just literally, literally losing their minds'. Some of them resorted to slitting their own throats to escape from the torment, he said. Those who were released went into the outside word 'with a lot of baggage', including PTSD and hypersensitivity, he said, adding that he himself would often burst into tears for no reason. 'The first three years I was out…I couldn't even hold a conversation with people without crying,' he said. Graves also suffered from difficulty sleeping, but his condition eventually improved, he said. Cal for action: Now, the free man (pictured, left, speaking to ACLU of Texas in 2013 and, right, in his mug shot after being arrested on suspicion of killing six people in 1992) is seeking what he deems 'life-saving' reform . Release: 'Solitary confinement is designed to break a man's will to live,' said Graves (pictured speaking to reporters after his release from prison in 2010). He said it had psychologically affected him after his release . More than 6,500 inmates in Texas are currently living in solitary confinement, according to a report by the ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project, which was published last week. However, this figure does not include prisoners who are on death row. Inmates typically remain in solitary confinement in the state for nearly four years before being transferred or released. But more than 100 prisoners have been in solitary for more than 20 years, the report says. The inmates are forced to live in conditions that 'impose such severe deprivations' that they are left psychologically damaged and more likely to commit crimes again upon release, it claims. 'We met with people who were profoundly mentally ill. So mentally ill we didn't feel comfortable sharing their stories in this report,'  attorney Burke Butler, who helped produce the report, said. Death row: Over 6,500 inmates in Texas are currently living in solitary confinement, according to a report by the ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project. Above, Texas's death row, where Graves was held . Dire conditions: Prisoners in solitary confinement are often forced to use their beds and toilets as tables for meals, cannot put up posters and will either have no window or a tiny strip of glass to see out of (pictured) Butler said that prisoners in solitary confinement are often forced to use their beds and toilets as tables for meals, cannot put up posters and will either have no window or a tiny strip of glass. He added that these dire conditions mean that correctional officers have little control over inmates - because there are no longer privileges that can be removed for bad behavior. 'When someone's in solitary, they have nothing to lose. Their lives are miserable,' he said. According to the report, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice holds more than 4 percent of its prisoners in solitary confinement - around four times more than the national average. In recent years, other states have started to limit the practice of placing prisoners in solitary confinement amid concerns it can result in damage their mental health in the long run. Last month, New York's Rikers Island, the second biggest prison in America, banned such confinement for inmates under the age of 21, Take Part reported. Speaking to ACLU in 2012, Graves said: 'Solitary confinement is driving men crazy. I don't understand how someone can subject another human being to this type of punishment and think that it's justified. 'It is totally inhumane. There's no way around it. You know, you really don't truly understand the impact of removing someone from human contact for years. It has a negative effect on that person. 'I experienced that so many times, where I'm shouting, 'I'm there. I want- - I want somebody to just, you know, come talk to me, you know, just shake my hand'... And I couldn't get it.' Graves, who has created a foundation for reform of the criminal justice system, added: 'We're driving people crazy. And this is our criminal justice system that's supposed to serve and protect us. Raising awareness: Graves, who has created a foundation for reform of the criminal justice system, said: 'We're driving people crazy. And this is our criminal justice system that's supposed to serve and protect us' 'But we are literally driving men insane. And those that are already insane, we're just putting them in the casket. That's all we're doing. There's no rehabilitation.' When Graves was released in October 2010, he blamed his 1994 conviction and subsequent death sentence on lawmakers who follow polls that show enduring support for the death penalty. 'What has to happen is someone famous, someone that they admire, has to be falsely accused or has to be convicted, to where they say, 'Oh my God, this has become an epidemic,' because now they can relate,' he said in an interview at the time. But he was also overwhelmingly grateful to the people who had helped to get him out, including local college students, members of the public and his attorneys, CBS News reported. The American Psychological Association advises that prisoners who are considered 'mentally ill' should not be placed in solitary confinement because it could exacerbate their health issues.","Anthony Graves,  49, was wrongfully sent to death row for murder in 1994 .

She was made acting head in 2014 and this month was confirmed as the head teacher of the school, which has 600 pupils aged from pre-school to nine on two sites in the town. 'When I was helping the children skipping in the playground at lunchtime it never occurred to me that I would end up as the head teacher,' she said. 'Because I trained here in the classroom and I have got to know the school well. I never have imagined being head this quickly. 'The biggest challenge is knowing all the people in both schools and trying to get the absolute best for each child. 'It has helped that I have been at this school all along. My experience in the different roles means I can see things from all perspectives. It is so worthwhile. I love it. This is the best job in the world.'

The tourist board received more than 130,000 suggestions, and has now whittled down the answers. Attracting the most attention, with more than 15,000 votes, was the Welsh village of Llanfair-pwllgwyn-gyllgo-gery-chwyrn-drobwll-llanty-silio-gogo-goch, which was given the Mandarin name of 'Healthy Lung Village' because it can only be pronounced by those with sufficient breath. The second most popular place to rename was London's Savile Row, which is famous for men's bespoke tailoring. It was dubbed 'Custom-made Rich People Street' by the Chinese. The third most popular to be voted upon was Scotland's Glen Coe, which was named the 'Splendid and Beautiful Valley' by more than 12,000 people.

Meanwhile, Northern Island's iconic Giant's Causeway, was renamed 'Musical Scale Lava' in Mandarin. Sally Balcombe, VisitBritain chief executive, said the campaign had been 'hugely effective' and urged businesses to promote their Mandarin name. She said: 'Chinese visitors already stay longer in Britain than in our European competitor destinations and are high spenders. 'Every 22 additional Chinese visitors we attract supports an additional job in tourism. 'We want to ensure that we continue to compete effectively in this, the world's biggest outbound market and ensure that we deliver growth and jobs across the nations and regions of Britain. 'Digital engagement is one of our strengths and this campaign has been hugely effective at driving this with our potential Chinese visitors. 'We're working closely with the industry and hope to see some of Britain's most popular points of interest use these new Chinese names on their social media channels and websites to amplify that engagement.' In 2013, more than 196,000 Chinese tourists visited the UK, spending nearly £492million - an average of £2,508 per person.

"Cabin staff working for two major Gulf  airlines face losing their jobs for falling pregnant and are even required to get permission  before they marry, outraged campaigners claim. According to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF)  carriers based in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are guilty of 'flagrant abuses of aviation workers' labour rights'. The worst offender, according to ITF, is Qatar Airways - which employs over 31,000 people and is the world's tenth largest airline with a modern fleet of over 100 aircraft. The policies for female workers in the skies at two Gulf-based airlines have caused controversy . According to ITF, Qatar Airways currently operates a draconian hiring policy insisting: . Last year the airline was attacked by Norway's anti-discrimination ombudsman after it told women attending a recruitment day in Oslo to wear short skirts. According to ITF, former crew members have claimed that in the past female staff have been fired for posting pictures of themselves in bathing suits or exposing tattoos on their  Facebook pages. Another female crew member was allegedly dismissed after management received a report that she had 'kissed a man at a Doha nightclub'. But perhaps most shocking is an interview published last year by the Swedish newspaper Expressen in which a Qatar Airways pilot reportedly states how the CEO tries to keep female crew members from mixing with male pilots by making remarks such as: 'the pilots are my chauffeurs, they only come to you to f*** you'. Emirates also has reported policy that women who fall pregnant in their first three years of work must leave their role . Gulf-based Qatar Airways are accused of abusing the  rights of their female cabin staff . Emirates has defended its policies stating that female workers are expected to fly in the first three years of their contract . Rossen Dimitrov, Qatar Airways Senior Vice President Customer Experience, insisted it was untrue that cabin staff had to ask permission to get married. He said: 'As has been stated before, Qatar Airways flight attendants do not have to be, or remain single. 'Many of our cabin crew are in fact married. The employment contracts simply use the term ""single status"" which is a common term in many Gulf companies' contracts. In addition, cabin crew do not have to ask permission before marrying. Qatar Airways' Chief Executive Akbar al Baker has defended the carrier's hiring policy . 'Like many other airlines, for health and safety reasons and as mandated by the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority, cabin crew do have to notify us when they become pregnant. 'Cabin crew in Qatar, as in other GCC countries, are licensed professionals, and must therefore comply with civil aviation regulations in order to maintain a valid cabin attendant licence and a cabin attendant medical certificate. 'Cabin crew who cannot fly, due to pregnancy, or who for any other reason are unable to maintain their licence, are assisted with finding suitable ground positions.' Qatar Airways is not the only Gulf-based airline which stands accused of discriminating against their female workers. Dubai-based Emirates - one of two flag carriers of the United Arab Emirates -  is currently operating a policy whereby female cabin crew who become pregnant in the first three years have to leave. In a statement made last year chief commercial officer Thierry Antinori defended his airline's policy. He said:  'If you are hired by Emirates as a cabin crew, during the first three years we expect from you to fly.' MailOnline has contacted Emirates for comment. Gabriel Mocho, civil aviation secretary at the international grouping of transport unions, said: 'The treatment of workers at Qatar Airways goes further than cultural differences. 'They are the worst for women's rights among airlines.' The policies have been compared to those used by the first big U.S. airlines in the 1960s. Pan Am for example specified  attendants must be unmarried, a minimum of 5ft 2ins, weigh no more than 130 pounds, have no children and had to retire at the age of 32. However campaigns by the group Stewardesses for Women's Rights during the 1970s brought in new laws. The age restriction was eliminated in 1970 and the restriction of hiring women only was lifted   in 1971. However it took until the 1980s to eliminate the no-marriage rule  and weight restrictions were still being enforced in the 1990s. Mr Mocho added: 'You can't see that deep level of sexism anywhere now except at these airlines in the Gulf.' The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) has claimed  Qatar Airways is an organisation 'with a secret to hide'  accusing it of subjecting its workforce to a regime of curfews, surveillance and constant fear of sacking and even arrest. The ITF claims many of the firm's cabin staff have reached out to them for help complaining of a 'climate of fear'. They have provided the following account which they say comes from a Qatar Airways cabin crew member describing what life is like at the airline. 'The phrase that time and time again its workers reach for when talking to us is that they live in 'a climate of fear'. A QR cabin crew member explains: 'All the cabin crew live in company accommodations and cannot move out. 'There are cameras in every building and security guard watching everything you do, and the only way to go in or out of your accommodation is by swiping your ID card otherwise the doors won't open, this way they can keep track of the exact times when you leave or come in. 'I believed this is very dangerous specially in case of a fire or something. There's a housing department, and they randomly have spotchecks in your apartment, if you have alcohol, cigarettes, pork products, or anything that is not allow by them you are sacked immediately. 'Also you have a curfew to be back in your accommodation every single day since the first day you arrive… this includes on your days off, meaning you can ever stay outside. 'Many people get sacked daily … for reasons you will never believe. The biggest problem is there are no workers rights in this country so there's nowhere to complain, if you don't like anything you simply get sacked and if that happens before completing 2 years with the company you have to pay a bond which many cannot afford. 'And the only way to leave the country is by the company authorizing an exit permit, so you are basically trapped, many employees who have been in trouble for stupid reasons and are suspended from flying are trapped in Doha for even months with no salary waiting for clearance by the airline, payment of your bond etc. 'Nobody knows what to expect until they arrive here they don't mention this things during the recruitment process.'","Qatar airlines demands attendants ask permission before getting married .

"Alan Ramsay, 12, was swinging from a goalpost during a school PE lesson when it fell on him . A 12-year-old schoolboy suffered a broken neck after he was crushed by a falling goalpost during a school PE lesson. Alan Ramsay was knocked unconscious and suffered three serious fractures when the goal tipped over as he tried to swing from its two-metre high cross bar at Liberton High School in Edinburgh. Classmates watched in horror as he lay unresponsive for three minutes, with bones sticking out of his mouth and neck, before he was rushed to hospital. His mother Louise Ramsay, 30, who lives close to the school, ran round after she was called and told there had been a 'slight accident'. She said: 'It's just horrific. It's every parent's worst nightmare. You send your child to school and the next minute you find out that they are hurt. 'I literally ran round the corner to the school. It was traumatic for my son but also for myself. 'I was told in the phone call he'd had a ""slight accident"" and as a precaution they had rung an ambulance. 'When I saw the ambulance there, he was covered in blood, and I saw he had a head injury so they needed to put the collar on him. 'That's when I found out he had been knocked unconscious. One bone was poking out from under his tongue, one was out under his ear.' Alan also suffered damage to a blood vessel in his brain, which left him at the risk of a stroke, and has been moved around different hospitals for X-rays, surgery and a neurological scan. Doctors say he is recovering well but are still working out the best way to treat the 'kink' in the blood vessel, as the issue is not common in children and can increase the risk of a stroke. Classmates looked on in shock as bones were sticking out his mouth and neck as he lay unresponsive (right) before he was rushed to hospital (left) He suffered three serious fractures as well as damage to a blood vessel in his brain, which left him at the risk of a stroke. He has been moved around different hospitals for X-rays, surgery and a neurological scan . Miss Ramsay added: 'My boy had surgery, his neck is broken. I get that he was playing on the crossbar, but I don't know how they managed to fall on top of him. 'The goals are two metres (6ft 6in) high and he is 1.54 metres (5ft). He jumped up and swung from them. They haven't secured them firmly enough. 'He's going to be in the collar for eight weeks and he's going to be home-schooled. I don't want him to lose his education. 'When the doctor came in and told him he had a break in his neck, he got a big fright.' The incident happened less than a year after 12-year-old Keane Wallis-Bennett was crushed to death by a free-standing wall as she changed for PE at the school last April. The wall has since been demolished. His mother Louise Ramsay, 30, (pictured together, left) described it as 'every parent's worst nightmare' Miss Ramsay said the tragic events in the school last year instantly came to mind when she received the call at around 9.15am last Thursday. She said: 'I had everything going through my head after that girl last year. Alan's best friend was sick, half of the first years were crying. They were all upset. 'He was just lying there under the goalposts. Especially after what happened last year, they say it's the curse of the PE department. I'm concerned about everything. 'I know my son is old enough to know that he shouldn't be playing on the goals, but surely they should have been secure? Alan is not the only child to swing on them.' Alan's classmates have rallied around him and have been paying visits to cheer him up. A spokesman for the city council said: 'We wish Alan a full recovery and the school are offering every support to him and his family to ensure his education continues while he is off. 'We take all incidents of this nature extremely seriously and immediate action has been taken to prevent anything similar happening. 'The school has carried out a full risk assessment of all gym activities and other schools and community centres have been instructed to carry out an immediate review of similar equipment. 'The Health and Safety Executive has been informed.' Another serious incident happened at the school in 2011 after a girl was seriously injured when she fell 16ft down a lift shaft. The incident happened at Liberton High School - the same school where Keane Wallis-Bennett, 12,  was crushed to death by a free-standing wall as she changed for PE last April (pictured, a policeman lays flowers)","Alan Ramsay was knocked unconscious and suffered serious fractures .

"A heartbreaking image shows an eight-year-old boy hugging a purple teddy bear for comfort as he arrives at hospital after losing his parents and baby sister in a horrific car crash. The boy, suffering from head and abdominal injuries, and his other sister - whose third birthday was on the day of Sunday's crash - were orphaned when the family car slammed into a tree near Lake Mundi by Victoria's western border. The 39-year-old father, who was driving at the time, died in hospital on Sunday afternoon after being trapped in the car for a number of hours. The two remaining children were airlifted to the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne and survived with injuries. Scroll down for video . A heartbreaking image shows an eight-year-old boy holding a teddy bear for comfort as he arrives at the hospital after losing his parents and baby sister in a horrific car crash . Three people, including a woman and her baby girl, are dead after their car slammed into a tree in Victoria . The father and driver of the car, 39, was trapped in the car for a number of hours but later died in hospital . The 29-year-old mother and her baby girl died at the scene of the crash, which happened about 7.30am on Casterton-Penola Road, near Lake Mundi. The boy arrived in hospital with critical injuries but it has since been revealed he is now in a stable condition, Nine News reported. He is suffering from head and abdominal injuries according to Fairfax Media. His surviving sister escaped the accident with only minor injuries on what was believed to be her birthday. The family are believed to be from Congolese, from Central Africa, but now living in South Australia. Two children, a boy, 8, and a girl, 3,  have been left orphaned by the tragic accident . They arrived in Mount Gambier just 18 months ago, and had returned from a reunion with family in the Congo just hours before the accident, according to The Advertiser. The family reportedly flew to Melbourne early on Sunday morning, immediately attempting the six hour drive home just after they stepped off the plane. The Conglonese community in Mount Gambier held a vigil in memory of the young family on Sunday night, and a woman who works at the son's school spoke on behalf of the family. 'They are absolutely destroyed ... they are just grieving because it was such a sudden accident,' Inna Tucker told The Advertiser. The family are believed to be from Congolese, from Central Africa, but now living in South Australia . The accident takes Victoria's road toll to 39, compared to 36 at the same time last year . 'They’d already been through so much as refugees, endured so much trauma ... they came here for a better and brighter future and it has ended up like this,' she said. Superintendent Don Downs told the ABC it was a 'tragic collision' and part of a 'horror start' to the year in the area. 'People think they can drive in these back roads and there's not a big risk, but there is a big risk,' he said. 'When you come out to jobs like this it's heart-wrenching. Heart-wrenching on the community and heart-wrenching on the members who attended.' Victoria police say they think the driver may have missed a turn off, and fatigue may have been a factor in the crash. It takes Victoria's road toll to 39, compared to 36 at the same time last year.","A father, mother and their young daughter were killed in the crash .

"A final scene of 'American Sniper' showing Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's gory death at a rifle range was cut after the victim's wife urged  screenwriters to leave it out for the sake of their young children. The $264million box-office sensation, which was released last month, was supposed to end with Kyle, 38, being shot dead at the range by 27-year-old Eddie Ray Routh in Stephenville, Texas, in 2013. But after the late father-of-two's widow, Taya, pleaded with director Clint Eastwood and other execs not to include the horrific moment in the film, it was omitted, screenwriter Jason Hall has revealed. 'We talked about doing it but... five days after Chris was murdered, [Mrs Kyle] called and said, ""This is going to be how my children remember their father, so I want you to get right"",' Mr Hall said. Scroll down for video . Distraught: A final scene of 'American Sniper' showing Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's death at a rifle range was cut after the victim's wife, Taya (pictured crying in court last week) urged screenwriters to leave it out . Couple: The widow (pictured with Kyle before his 2013 death) pleaded with director Clint Eastwood and other executives not to include her husband's shooting in the film for the sake of their children, then eight and six . Blockbuster hit: Mrs Kyle 'called and said, ""This is going to be how my children remember their father, so I want you to get right"",' screenwriter Jason Hall said. Above, Bradley Cooper portrays Kyle in the movie . He added that Mrs Kyle's request had affected him as a father. 'I didn't want this movie hanging over [the kids'] heads for the rest of their lives as the film that showed their father getting shot,' he said. 'American Sniper', which stars actor Bradley Cooper as Kyle, was already in production when Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, were gunned down by Routh, a Marine with PTSD, in February 2013. Within days, the film's creators had penned five different endings for the movie, all of which featured the two soldiers being shot dead at the range. 'We talked about how we would shoot it,' said Mr Hall. But after Mrs Kyle's request, screenwriters decided to scrap the possible endings and replace them with an epilogue explaining what happened to Kyle, whose children were eight and six at the time. Speaking to the New York Daily News, Mr Hall said: 'In the end, I think we felt this was a film on Chris's life and not about his death. And we also wanted to be careful not to glorify the guy that did it.' The featured ending of 'American Sniper', which has been accused by some of glorifying murder and serving as war propaganda, just shows Kyle and Littlefield arriving at Rough Creek Lodge rifle range. Murder trial: Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh (right, in a black suit and red tie), who had PTSD, is currently on trial for shooting dead Kyle (left) and his friend, Chad Littlefield, at the rifle range in Stephenville, Texas . Writer: The film's creators had penned five different endings for the movie before Kyle died, all of which featured the two soldiers' being shot dead. 'We talked about how we would shoot it,' said Mr Hall (pictured) Blockbuster hit: But after Mrs Kyle's request, screenwriters decided to scrap the possible endings and replace them with an epilogue explaining what happened to Kyle. Above, Cooper with Sienna Miller in the film . During his interview with the newspaper, Mr Hall also condemned critics of the movie, which is based on Kyle's autobiography and has been nominated for six Oscars, saying any reaction  'is a good one'. He added that many veterans' associations have told him the film has sparked discussions about soldiers' lives after they return from war in comments that mirrored  ones made by Michelle Obama. Two weeks ago, the US First Lady declared 'American Sniper' 'touches on many of the emotions and experiences that I've heard firsthand from military families over these past few years.' Speaking at the launch of '6 Certified', she added: 'We hope our country will welcome back our veterans, not by setting them apart but by fully integrating them into the fabric of our communities.' Routh is currently on trial for shooting dead Kyle and Littlefield at the rifle range. There is no doubt that he was responsible for shooting the sniper, who has the most kills to his name in U.S. history. Emotional: Last Wednesday, Mrs Kyle was pictured wiping her eyes with a tissue (pictured) as she testified during 27-year-old Routh's capital murder trial at the Erath County Donald R. Jones Justice Center in Texas . Widow: Mrs Kyle wore a brown dress, a brown shawl and crosses around her neck for Wednesday's trial . Support: Mrs Kyle greets a supporter before court is in session during Routh's high-profile murder trial . The former Marine has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. At the end of the trial, jurors must decide whether or not he intentionally committed the murders and knew his actions were wrong. Last week, Gene Cole, a former patrol deputy, said Routh confessed to killing Kyle and Littlefield 'because they wouldn't talk to me' while he was an inmate at Eratch County Jail in June 2013. Dressed in his police uniform, he told the court: 'I heard Mr Routh say, ""I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me. I was just riding in the backseat of the truck, and nobody would talk to me.' He added that Routh believed Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield had forgiven him. '[He told me], ""I feel bad about it, but they wouldn't talk to me. I'm sure they've forgiven me"",' he said. On Wednesday, Mrs Kyle was pictured wiping her tear-filled eyes as she testified during Routh's capital murder trial at the Erath County Donald R. Jones Justice Center. The trial continues.

"It is known as a breeding ground for the biggest names in American comedy. But some of the best slipped through the net. The rejects of Saturday Night Live include Jim Carrey, Kevin Hart, Zach Galifianakis, and Steve Carrell. In something of an apology to those who were rejected but later made it, some of the best audition clips were broadcast during the 40th anniversary episode. Scroll down for video . Didn't need it! Jim Carrey was turned down in 1980 (left) but is today (right) an A-list movie star . Bounced back: Zach Galifianakis didn't get a role in 1999 (left) but became a writer for SNL (right, on Sunday) Pete Davidson introduced the reel with the words: 'Here's a look back at the auditions of some people Lorne hired - and a few he maybe should have.' The segment featured the 1992 audition of comedy chat show host Stephen Colbert, who failed to make the cut. Jim Carrey can be seen walloping around the set in an energetic sketch that failed to win over associate producer Jean Doumanian in 1980. And Kevin Hart, who was sidelined after an audition in 2013, also earned a spot in the reel. Not his day: Chat show host Stephen Colbert was turned away in 1992, long before he made it on TV . Regrets: The SNL team admitted they should have hired Kevin Hart after his audition (pictured) in 2013 . Didn't make it: John Goodman, who has since hosted the show 13 times, lost out to Joe Piscopo in 1980 . Other comedians who didn't make the cut but succeeded later include Friends star Lisa Kudrow - who is credited with transforming female comedy. She was shown the door after losing out to Julia Sweeney. Kathy Griffin was in the same audition, and later said she thinks the producers made the right choice with Sweeney. Steve Carell auditioned with his then-fiancée - later wife - Nancy Walls in 1995. Walls was cast, but Carell lost out to Will Ferrell.

"Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Turkey for days of protest about violence against women and ministers have called for the death penalty to be reinstated, following the brutal attempted rape and murder of a 20-year-old student. Ozgecan Aslan's burned body was found in woodland after she is alleged to have tried to resist a sexual assault by minibus driver Ahmet Suphi Altindoken who then stabbed and clubbed her to death, it is claimed. Three people have been arrested in connection with Miss Aslan's death and protests have continued throughout Turkey for three days. Scroll down for video . The murder of Ozgecan Aslan has caused outrage in Turkey, with people protesting in the streets about violence against women in a country where females are frequently seen as not equal to men . Her death has caused outrage in Turkey where women are frequently killed at the hands of violent men and are seen as having a lower status - a few recently inflamed by comments made by the Turkish president who said women were not equal to men. Protesters took to the streets in their thousands bearing placards of Miss Aslan and Turkish women shared their stories of harassment and violence on Twitter using the hashtag #sendeanlat (you tell your story). Turkey's Family and Social Minister Aysenur Islam, the only woman in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, said the death penalty should be reinstated for the perpetrators. She said: 'Not as a minister, but as a mother and woman, I think punishment for such crimes can be the death sentence... We can put it on our agenda.' A number of people changed their Facebook profile pictures to images of the student and women have pictured themselves wearing black shrouds in tribute to the 20-year-old. Protesters have been seen in Istanbul and Ankara for the last three days protesting against Miss Aslan's murder. Miss Aslan was reported missing on Wednesday evening in Tarsus. Dozens of people have taken to the streets to protest against the endemic violence in Turkey . A woman with red tears painted on her face (left) and another with a bullet hole (right) took part in protests . According to reports the 20-year-old was the only passenger left in a minibus driven by Altindoken, who allegedly changed the route of the bus when the other passengers got off and attempted to rape her. When she resisted him and used pepper spray he is said to have killed her. Altindoken is then accused of returning to Tarsus to find his father Necmettin Altindoken and friend Fatih Gokce to help him dispose of her body, Anatolia news agency reported. All three are being held at different detention centres in Turkey. They are alleged to have burned the body in a wooded area in a bid to hide the evidence but the corpse was found by police on Friday. Ozgecan Aslan was allegedly attacked by the bus driver and killed after she used pepper spray against him . A number of protesters took placards and posters with photos of the 20-year-old student on to protests . Dozens of women gathered to protest in Istanbul on February 14 following the murder of Miss Aslan . On February 15 women hold posters reading Ozegecan Aslan is our rebellion (centre) during demonstrations . A member of the Bar Association in Turkey, which has reportedly refused to defend any of the three arrested in connection with her murder, holds a picture of Miss Aslan at a rally in Ankara on February 16 . The head of Mersin Bar Association, Alpay Antmen, said that no member of the bar in the region would defend the perpetrators in court, the Sabah newspaper reported. According to the Hurriyet daily, Altindoken confessed to the murder, saying he had stabbed Aslan and then struck the fatal blows with a crowbar after seeing she was not yet dead. The murder has also caused outrage among ministers and the public and has been compared to the reaction after the gang rape and brutal assault of Jyoti Singh in Delhi in 2012, who later died of her injuries. Miss Aslan was laid to rest, the coffin borne only by women, on Valentine's Day. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus through South Delhi in 2012. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28,  Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor who was also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forces judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. EU Affairs Minister Volkan Bozkir added: 'If something like this had happened to my daughter I would take a gun and I would punish (the attacker) myself.' 'Afterwards I would accept whatever penalty I would be given.' But Bozkir indicated he did not favour reimposing the death penalty, saying it was important to separate personal emotions and actions on a state level. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's two daughters, Sumeyye Erdogan and Esra Albayrak, paid a joint visit to the grieving family of the victim. Turkey is already battling shocking levels of violence against women. According to the Platform to Stop Violence Against Women activist group, 294 women were killed by men in 2014. Critics claim that the situation is not helped by the ruling Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) and Erdogan, who declared in November that women were not equal to men.","Ozgecan Aslan, 20, was found burned in woodland near Tarsus in Turkey .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has gone on the offensive to win back voters by making a strongly-worded statement about Australia's fight against terrorism and visiting small businesses to market his proposed tax cut. On Sunday Mr Abbott made it clear that Australia would no longer be taken ‘for mugs’ in the war against terrorism. He may have been on the defensive over the past few weeks as his position as Prime Minister came under increased scrutiny, but he went on the attack on his official YouTube channel to reaffirm his government’s pledge to strengthen national security. And on Monday during a visit to a sportswear factory in south Sydney Mr Abbott posed with a green and gold 'Abbott 1' shirt while flagging his new small business and jobs package. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott holds up an Australian team shirt  during a visit to a sportswear manufacturer, in Carlton, Sydney . The Prime Minister  is guided through the process of applying his name and the number '1' to an Australian team shirt, by Director Margaret O'Dowd . Mr Abbott and wife Margie visited a manufacturer, where he flagged his new small business and jobs package . 'Small business is where our creativity most flourishes. Small business is where jobs creation gets going strongest and quickest,' he told reporters. In his national security address on Sunday, Mr Abbott was adamant that from now on there would no longer be any ‘benefit of the doubt’ given to those who were possible threats to the security of the nation. ‘It's clear to me that for too long we have given those who might be a threat to our country the benefit of the doubt,’ he said on the video. ‘There's been the benefit of the doubt at our borders, the benefit of the doubt for residency, the benefit of the doubt for citizenship and the benefit of the doubt at Centrelink. ‘And in the courts, there has been bail, when clearly there should have been jail.' Sydney siege gunman Man Haron Monis was out on bail at the time of his attack at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place last December where he and two others died. The Prime Minister signs an Australian team shirt as factory workers look on and take photos . Mr Abbott, along with Member for Barton Nickolas Varvaris (pictured right) Mr Abbott has gone on the offensive to win back voters after avoiding a leadership spill . ‘We are a free and fair nation. But that doesn't mean we should let bad people play us for mugs, and all too often they have. Well, that's going to stop,’ the Prime Minister said. Mr Abbott made it clear that a review of the siege is being considered by the federal government, and that and the government's response would soon be released. He also said that his government planned to pass data retention legislation as soon as possible to help counter terrorist activities. ‘We pledge to keep our country as safe and secure as we humanly can,’ Mr Abbott said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott made it clear that Australia would no longer be taken ‘for mugs’ in the war against terrorism . ‘As a nation we are responding to this threat. We’ve provided our security services with more powers, more resources and stronger laws. ‘I give you this assurance, as a country, we won’t let evil people exploit our freedom.’ Earlier this week Mr Abbott backed up his words with actions when on Tuesday police arrested two immigrants - Omar Al-Kutobi, 24, and Mohammad Kiad, 25 - in Sydney for allegedly plotting an act of terror involving a machete attack in the name of Islamic State. Mr Abbott also condemned a 'brutal' shooting in Denmark as an affront to free speech. Twin attacks shook Copenhagen over the weekend. On Sunday Mr Abbott attended a community event in Castlereagh, western Sydney. He later condemned a 'brutal' shooting in Denmark as an affront to free speech . One man was killed when a cafe hosting an event where a cartoonist who had caricatured the Prophet Mohammed was speaking was sprayed with bullets, and another fatally shot in the head just hours later at the city's main synagogue. In a statement issued on Sunday, he said the thoughts of all Australians were with the Danish people. 'As with the Charlie Hebdo atrocity in Paris, the Copenhagen attack is an affront to one of our most fundamental values - freedom of speech,' Mr Abbott said. 'We stand with the people and government of Denmark in confronting this cynical attempt to undermine that fundamental right.' Mr Abbott reaffirmed his government’s pledge to strengthen national security across the board .","Prime Minister pledges again to strengthen national security .

"A farmer has been ordered to tear down a castle he secretly built and hid beneath haystacks and tarpaulin after losing a six year planning battle. Robert Fidler built the impressive castle - complete with ramparts and cannon - on his land in Redhill, Surrey, in 2001 but kept it hidden under the 40ft-high stack of hay bales until 2006. The 63-year-old thought he would be immune from planning rules as his family had been living there for more than four years and nobody had objected to it. A farmer has been ordered to tear down a castle he secretly built behind haystack after losing a six year planning battle . Robert Fidler built the impressive castle - Honeycrock Farmhouse - on his land in Redhill, Surrey, in 2001 but kept it hidden under a 40ft-high stack of hay bales and tarpaulin until 2006 . Guidelines state that anything built without planning permission, but remaining unchallenged for four years or more, could not be ‘enforced against’ by planners. But Reigate & Banstead Borough Council refused to grant retrospective planning permission and he was ordered to demolish the four-bed property - Honeycrock Farmhouse - in 2007. For the past six years Mr Fidler and wife Laura has been through the appeals system as they fought to keep their home. They have been through hearings at the Planning Inspectorate and the High Court and many appeals, but were finally ordered to knock down the castle after a two-day hearing of the Planning Inspectorate, a government agency responsible for ruling on planning appeals. The report, written by inspector Sara Morgan and published last week, said Mr Fidler had kept his home ‘concealed’ behind a shield of straw bales’ and that he had ‘set out deliberately to deceive’ the council by using the four-year rule. She wrote: 'His actions in constructing the dwelling house behind a wall of straw bales, and then living in the building for over four years before the bales were removed, was intended to conceal the building and its use from the council’s knowledge and thus prevent any enforcement action being taken before it was too late.' Councillor Mike Miller, Reigate & Banstead Council’s member for planning and development, said last week: 'We are pleased with the outcome of the appeal and the planning inspector’s decision. 'It supports our argument that the building is unlawful and that our earlier enforcement notices are valid. 'Had this appeal been allowed, it would have set an unacceptable precedent for development in the green belt. Mr Fidler was relying on guidelines which stated that anything built without planning permission, but remaining unchallenged for four years or more, could not be 'enforced against' by planners . 'The council has a duty to protect the green belt from unlawful development and the character of the borough - that is what our residents want and expect of us.' Speaking at a previous appeal hearing at the High Court in 2010 Deputy High Court Judge Sir Thayne Forbes said it was ‘clear’ the castle had been built in ‘clandestine fashion’. He told the court: 'Mr Fidler made it quite clear that the construction of his house was undertaken in a clandestine fashion, using a shield of straw bales around it and tarpaulins or plastic sheeting over the top in order to hide its presence during construction. 'He stated that he knew he had to deceive the council of its existence until a period of four years from substantial completion and occupation had occurred as they would not grant planning permission for its construction. Speaking previously, Mr Fidler said he would ‘never demolish his home’ and that he would go to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary, adding: 'This house will never be knocked down. This is a beautiful house that has been lovingly created. I will do whatever it takes to keep it.' Mr Fidler was ordered to pay the council’s costs for the appeal. A spokesman for Reigate & Banstead Borough Council said today that Mr Fidler has six weeks to appeal to the High Court against the latest decision - ordering him to knock down his castle. She said that Mr Fidler also has two new planning applications in place - one for building a new barn and another for retrospective planning permission to keep the castle for ‘agricultural use’. Secret: Robert Fidler built the castle - complete with ramparts and a canon - on his land in Redhill, Surrey, in 2001 . She added: 'Mr Fidler has the right to challenge the Planning Inspector’s decision and has six weeks to appeal to the High Court if he wishes to do so.' 'These latest appeals are different to the applications that were the subject of his earlier High Court appeal - these were against our refusal of three further applications for Certificates of Lawfulness (to retain the house and patio) submitted between 2009 and 2011. 'Mr Fidler also has two new planning applications in with the council which are awaiting determination - one for a small open sided barn structure and the other for retrospective permission to retain the house on grounds of an agricultural need case.' 'We cannot comment any further at this stage as we cannot prejudice the determination of the planning applications or our legal position.'","Robert Fidler built the castle - complete with ramparts and cannon - in 2001 .

"During the dreary winter months, many of us long for lighter evenings and sun rays hitting our windows. Now there's a solution - albeit an expensive one - that creates the illusion of summer in any room of the house at any time of year. Designed by Italian CoeLux, the £40,000 ($61,000) artificial skylight mimics the appearance of the sun and sky using a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. Scroll down for video . CoeLux’s artificial skylight (pictured) mimics the visual appearance of the sun and sky using a solid layer of nanoparticles that produce Rayleigh scattering. Rayleigh scattering is what causes the sky to appear blue, for example, and when blue light wavelengths travel through the atmosphere they are scattered . CoeLux was set up by researchers from the University of Insubria, in Italy. Each artificial skylight is fitted with a solid layer of nanoparticles that causes light to scatter. Each artificial skylight is fitted with a solid layer of nanoparticles that causes light to scatter. The layer also creates an illusion of depth to make the 'sun' appear to be far away. It can specifically mimic the brightness and quality of light from the Tropics, Mediterranean and northern Europe. CoeLux 60 produces 'cooler vertical' rays with the 'maximum luminance contrast of light and shadow,' as seen in tropical regions. The Mediterranean-based CoeLux 45 skylight features a 45-degree ceiling beam that offers an equal balance of light and shade. While CoeLux 30 uses a 30-degree angle beam relative to the horizon to reproduce 'a warm, Nordic grazing light.' Known as Rayleigh scattering, this is what causes the sky to appear blue, for example. When blue light wavelengths travel through the atmosphere they are scattered by other particles to give the sky its hue. CoeLux’s technology uses a similar principle to force light from a standard bulb to scatter in the same way.

The CoeLux technology also creates an illusion of depth to make the 'sun' appear to be far away. It can specifically mimic the brightness and quality of light from the Tropics, Mediterranean and northern Europe . Rayleigh scattering occurs when light is scattered in different directions by small particles, typically smaller than the wavelength of the light being scattered. The phenomenon is commonly seen in gases, but can also apply to solids and liquids. Rayleigh scattering is what causes the sky to appear blue. When sunlight travels through the atmosphere it is scattered by other particles. Blue light is scattered more efficiently than other wavelengths of light which causes the sky to look blue the majority of the time. During sunrise and sunset, the sky appears red and orange because the sun’s rays are passing directly through the atmosphere and red light isn’t scattered as much, so passes through the atmosphere unaffected. ‘CoeLux is an optical system based on nano technology to artificially reproduce the natural light and visual appearance of the sun and sky,' said the company. ‘[It] offers a breakthrough opportunity for indoor architecture by creating the sensation of infinite space. The firm added that CoeLux is ideal for airports, offices, gyms and museums as well as underground networks and parking garages. In addition to £40,000 ($61,000) for the technology, installation costs £5,000 ($7,600) and requires at least 3.3ft (one metre) of ceiling recess for it to fit in. CoeLux is hoping that the technology could also be used to treat seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and other conditions. Chief executive and Associate Professor of Optics and Experimental Physics, Paolo Di Trapani said: 'Besides SAD, we see plenty of possible applications of CoeLux in hospitals.' 'Naturally, CoeLux is foreseen to improve the quality of the overall treatment, with respect to comfort and [relaxation], with benefit both for the patient and the hospital.'

"These Chinese fisherman know a thing or two about how to catch their supper. Using little more than a simple homespun raft and a gas lamp to light their way, these fascinating images capture the fisherman using cormorant birds to grab their catch of the day. Photographer Bobby Joshi travelled to the Li River in Guilin, China and rose before dawn to capture the fishermen at work last October, which involves first controlling the birds before attaching a snare around their throats.

"A former Premier League star is reportedly set to buy an £18.5million  Italian mansion which locals say is haunted by the curse of the Tutankhamun. Striker Samuel Eto'o - who played for Chelsea and Everton before transferring to Sampdoria in northern Italy - is said to have fallen for the luxury coastal villa despite its tragic history. The house is said to be jinxed by the Curse of Tutankhamun because it was the former home of Lord Carnarvon who uncovered the Pharaoh's tomb. His main home was Highclere Castle, famed for being used as the location of Downton Abbey, but the villa was his summer home. Tragic past: This luxury coastal villa in Italy is said to be jinx by the curse of Tutankhamun after it was once owned by Lord Carnarvon who discovered the Pharaoh's tomb.

'Loves the house': Striker Samuel Eto'o - who played for Chelsea and Everton before transferring to Sampdoria (above) in northern Italy - is said to have fallen for the luxury coastal villa despite its tragic history . Lord Carnarvon had been left with a permanent limp and badly injured lungs after an accident in his racing car. Advised by doctors to recover in a warm climate he took up work in Egyptology. Working with well-known English archaeologist Howard Carter, the two men made the extraordinary discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, the richest burial site ever found. Soon after discovering the tomb of the boy Pharaoh in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, Lord Carnavon died from an infected mosquito bite in Cairo's Savoy Continental Hotel.

Then in 2001, former Gucci model and heiress Countess Francesca Agusta, disappeared from the cliff-top villa now being sized up by the footballer. According to witnesses, she flew into a tranquilizer and whisky-fuelled rage and stormed out in a bathrobe and slippers, saying: 'I'm going for a swim'. Three weeks later, her body washed up near the southern French town of Saint-Tropez.

"Authorities suspect that Jason Hendrix (pictured) killed his parents and sister before being fatally show by police . A 16-year-old boy killed in a shootout Saturday with police in Maryland, prompted the search of his home over 500 miles away in Kentucky, where authorities found the bodies of his parents and younger sister. Friends and relatives of Jason Hendrix were struggling to understand how the boy, a faithful churchgoer who was baptized just two months ago, could end up as the suspect in the slayings. Hendrix, a Kentucky high school ROTC student and active church member, was angry at his parents for taking away his computer privileges when he's suspected of killing his family execution-style before fleeing to Maryland, where he died in a shootout with police, the town's police chief said Sunday. Police believe the victims were gunned down late Wednesday afternoon in their home, Corbin Police Chief David Campbell said. The father still had on his sport coat and tie from work when he was shot twice in the head. The mother was ambushed as she stepped into the kitchen from the garage after arriving home from work. The couple's 16-year-old son, Jason Hendrix, fled in his parent's green Honda Pilot, armed with four weapons and a backpack full of ammunition, Campbell said. 'Right now all the evidence points toward him as being the shooter,' the chief said. Baltimore County Police said Sunday the teenager shot a police officer Saturday after crashing the Honda Pilot into a silver sedan. At least six officers opened fire on Hendrix, who was pronounced dead at the scene. Maryland State Police say they initially sought to pull over Hendrix Saturday for a speeding violation. This is the home in Corbin, Kentucky, where police discovered the bodies of Kevin, Sarah and Grace Hendrix . Mr and Mrs Hendrix kept bees for making honey. Mrs Hendrix (right) was a professor at Union College . Jason's little sister Grace, 12, was discovered dead along with her parents . Police found a gas receipt showing that the teen had been in New Jersey on Thursday. The teenager was angry at his parents for taking away his computer privileges a couple of days before the slayings, Campbell said. 'The mother had talked to a co-worker and told her that he was really mad about that,' the chief said. The family members found dead Saturday in their home were Kevin and Sarah Hendrix and their daughter, Grace, who was about 12, Campbell said. The mother was shot twice in the face. The girl was shot twice in the head and once in the arm. The shooter fired into pillows at close distance, the chief said. 'He left them where they were and put the pillows over their heads,' Campbell said. Jason was killed during a shootout with police in Maryland. He was armed with a handgun and other weapons . Jason Hendrix met up with friends at church that evening and showed no signs of distress. 'They said he was just like he usually is,' Campbell said. Police didn't know why the suspect decided to flee to the East Coast. The family had no relatives in Baltimore, Campbell said. 'We have no clue why he went up there,' the chief said. Family and friends in this small southeastern Kentucky town were struggling to understand Sunday how a teenager known for being polite could be suspected of the killings. Kevin and Sarah Hendrix were beekeepers who sold honey in the local farmers market, and Grace Hendrix was a middle school cheerleader. A spokesman for Union College in Barbourville confirmed Sarah Hendrix was a professor at the school. Drew Mahan, the founding pastor of Forward Community Church where the Hendrixes attended, said officers questioned him extensively about Jason on Saturday night after discovering the bodies. He described Jason Hendrix as a faithful member of his 3-year-old church that held services at a local movie theater. Hendrix would arrive at the theater every Sunday at 7 a.m. to help set up the church's equipment and was recently baptized during a service in December. Sarah (left) and Kevin (right) Hendrix were found at their home on Saturday. They died from gunshot wounds . 'People want to ask questions. Why? How? I simply looked at folks today and said, ""I don't know,"" Mahan said after finishing the Sunday morning service. 'The guy has been here. He's been an influence on our students, he's been an influence on my own kids. They love him.' Michelle Payne, a 30-year-old mother who lived across the street from the Hendrixes, said they were 'your classic small town family,' adding she had not seen the family since Tuesday night when Kevin was walking the family's dog. And she said the school bus had not stopped at the house for several days to drop off Grace. Greg Razmus, 46, owns the theater that Forward Community Church uses for its services and volunteers at the church, said he had become close to the Hendrix family, especially Jason, whom he frequently talked with about his life. He said Jason had the same struggles common to most teenagers, including getting angry at his dad for grounding him because he texted someone he wasn't supposed to. 'Just normal stuff,' he said. 'There was never any sign of anything you would think could cause this.' Mahan said Grace Hendrix was beautiful and bubbly with 'tons of friends.' 'She was one of those girls that just seemed older than what she was,' Mahan said. 'You could tell that she looked up to Jason a lot. She was proud of her brother. That's just another reason (why this is ) so senseless to us.' The police officer who was shot was treated at the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center, according to the statement. He was released Sunday. Six Baltimore County Police officers fired their weapons during Saturday's shootout. They will be placed on administrative status pending a review of the incident.

"Disgraced NBC news anchor Brian Williams could lose his job if bosses decide he has brought himself into disrepute after it emerged he falsely claimed he was in a helicopter that came under fire while in Iraq. Williams has been suspended for six months from the show as his credibility continues to be questioned - with his reports about seeing a body floating by during Hurricane Katrina and his presence at the fall of the Berlin wall now being investigated. The 55-year-old now faces the possibility of being fired because of a 'morality clause' in his contract that says his role can be terminated if he brings himself into disrepute. Scroll down for video . NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams could be sacked if bosses find he has broken a 'morality clause' in his contract which says his employment can be terminated if he brings himself 'disrepute' Williams, who has been the nightly news anchor for 10 years, had recently signed a $10 million, five-year pact, Page Six reported. The defining clause in his contract said: 'If artist commits any act or becomes involved in any situation, or occurrence, which brings artist into public disrepute, contempt, scandal or ridicule, or which justifiably shocks, insults or offends a significant portion of the community, or if publicity is given to any such conduct . . . company shall have the right to terminate.' Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken Williams' place. The show has seen a significant drop in viewers since Williams was taken off air. In a statement, NBC chief executive Stephen Burke wrote: 'By his actions, Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News. His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate. NBC Nightly News Anchor Brian Williams revealed he incorrectly assumed a helicopter he was travelling in had been shot down after it was part of a convoy that made an unscheduled landing in Iraq in 2003 . His claims came to light after a show was broadcast, featuring Williams describing how in 2003 he had survived his helicopter being shot down by a rocket propelled grenade. His account was challenged by people who were in the actual craft that was hit and it emerged the NBC anchor was in fact in another helicopter entirely, around an hour behind the targeted helicopter. After the inaccuracies emerged Williams said he made a mistake about being in a Chinook helicopter that was shot down in 2003 because he was scared and in a warzone for the first time. NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, led by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist. Williams, who is Managing Editor of the United States' most watched network news program, has remained quiet since the allegations came to light and took himself off the air before he was temporarily suspended. But his silence has not stopped him becoming a figure of ridicule. In an awkward red carpet interview for the 40th anniversary of Saturday Night Live, comedian Jim Carrey asked Today newscaster Matt Lauer  'Where are you hiding Brian Williams?' Jerry Seinfeld also made jokes about the newscaster during the show. Williams (pictured arriving for Letterman's show in 2013) is being investigated by NBC News . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. However in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams had claimed to save not one but two puppies. In the same Esquire interview Williams also revealed that he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Berlin Wall, 1989 . Tom Brokaw was historically the only American anchor present at the fall of the Berlin Wall. But during a 2008 forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Williams claimed he was at the Brandenburg gate 'the night the wall came down.' And although in a 2004 interview Williams said he arrived at the wall 'a day after -- more like 12 hours after -- Tom Brokaw did,' at a gala in 2014 he stated: '25 years ago tonight Tom Brokaw and I were at the Berlin Wall'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Last month he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","NBC news anchor Brian Williams has been suspended for six months .

"A university has been slammed after buying prosthetic masks similar to those used in horror films to portray 'depressed and anxious' patients as part of a training course on interacting with the mentally ill. Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen introduced the masks to students on a mental health nursing course to help depict 'different patients with developing key conditions'. A character was assigned to each appearance, with ailments including depression, anxiety disorder and, in one case, being the victim of sexual violence. Robert Gordon University came under fire for using masks to illustrate mental health conditions as a means of teaching students how to interact with patients. Above, a student talks with 'Sheila', a character who was the victim of sexual abuse as a child . The 'patients' were also given names, family histories, accents and jobs as part of the exercise. 'Billy is a north-east farmer with a strong Doric accent who suffers from depression and 'has a strong odour of whisky'. 'He is a carer for his wife who is being treated for cancer. He has considered suicide and is a problematic alcohol user,' was how the university's described one character. Another, called Sheila, 'experienced sexual and physical violence as a child and suffers from an anxiety order'. Sheila is portrayed as an elderly woman wearing a head scarf and shirt. Upon learning of the masks' appearances, See Me, Scotland's largest anti-mental health stigmatisation charity, urged the university to reconsider their use. They have since been 'curtailed' from the programme which is now under review. 'It is not appropriate. Anyone can experience a mental health problem, there isn't one specific way that someone who does should look,' a spokesman for the charity told MailOnline. 'We had some real concerns with the use of the masks. The way they look is not appropriate, it's the whole package of how they look. Scars, tattoos and facial hair were used to characterise each of the characters and their various mental health conditions. Above, a professor plays the role of Jim, a labourer with three children who suffers from a bipolar disorder . A professor wearing the face of Billy, a north east farmer who has depression, holds up another of the masks made of silicone. The prosthetics are often used in Hollywood films to transform actors' appearances . 'They're not the most positive portrayals, they don't accurately represent people with mental health problems any more than they do the general public.' The university apologised for the use of the masks, adding that their 'acceptability' would be re-evaluated. 'It was not our intention to add to the stigmatisation of people with mental health problems,' a spokesman said. 'In fact we continue to see simulation and role play, which includes the use of volunteer patients and actors, as a useful part of our teaching, particularly in helping students gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of stigma. 'We intend to review our use of masks by further evaluating their acceptability and effectiveness and will again involve a wide range of stakeholders, including people with lived experience, as we have done to date in developing this approach.'","Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen bought four of the silicone masks .

In January it emerged that whoever buys the free-standing home at 19 Boonara Avenue in Bondi, just a few hundred metres from the world famous beach - may also have to pay to evict the current owners, who have previously refused to clear up the junk or move out to allow council inspectors inside. Debt collectors, on behalf of Waverley Council, arranged to sell the home - which remarkably could fetch at least $2 million in the hope of recovering the $180,000 the Bobolas family owes for the clean up costs. The new owners will have to apply for to the Supreme Court for a writ of possession to evict them, which can take four weeks, according to The Daily Telegraph. A spokesperson for Justice NSW said 'after the sheriff receives the writ, they give the occupants 30 days to vacate the premises. If they do not vacate willingly, the sheriff has the power to force an eviction.' Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news. 'I can't believe it. We have just bought a house here and moved in on Saturday. That's fantastic for the whole street,' Yael Super told The Daily Telegraph. If Mary Bobolas and her daughters Liana and Elena can recover the debt by February 17, they will keep the house, but otherwise the family will be given the remainder of the profits after the debts have been cleared . The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets' The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard . Neighbours who have have lived beside the squalid house have voiced their relief at the news the family are being evicted . The Californian-style home, which has been listed for auction with Raine & Horne Double Bay agent Ric Serrao, has been marketed as 'one of the suburbs most desirable streets'. The 550sqm block of land, which is within walking distance to the beach, 'offers plenty of scope to build you dream home (subject to council approval),' according to the real estate's advertisement. The estimated price range for the property is between $1,792,720 and $2,494,373, according to RP Data. Waverley Council have set a date to demolish the garage and remove the piles of garbage that surround the house. The Bobolas have resisted all offers to connect them with support services, and adamantly defended council clean-ups in court. The owners of the property - Mary, Elena and Liana Bobolas - have been the centre of controversy over the past few decades as Waverley Council and furious neighbours have battled to get them to clean up their yard. More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property. With empty glass bottles, cardboard boxes, discarded appliances and pieces of old wooden furniture piled high outside the home, it has not been lived in by its occupants for years.

A ginger cat has made a home for itself among the piles of cardboard boxes and old plastic containers . The property has caused trouble for infuriated neighbours who have to deal with the stench and the sight of rubbish inexplicably piled up in every spare space outside and presumably inside this home. The council cleaned the property in mid-2014, but some neighbours said the house was as bad as they'd ever seen it, describing it as 'sickening' and 'filth'. Another woman who has lived next door to the rotting property - which has trees growing through the roof and holes in the walls - for the past 15 years said 'they haven't lived inside the house for years', and she believed there was no running water or electricity. More than $350,000 of ratepayers money has been spent in a bid to control the piles of rubbish in and outside the Bondi property .

"Forty years ago this week, the nation was captivated by one of the most horrendous crimes in living memory. An unprovoked frenzied axe attack by a total stranger on a ten-year-old as she walked home from school. And as police launched one of the biggest manhunt in South Wales Police history and detectives chased down leads on the appalling crime, only one thing seemed certain: that little Paula Hughes would never leave a normal, happy life - if she survived at all. But Paula has made a remarkable recovery, defying the negligible odds she was given by medics in the wake of the shocking attack. Not only did she go on to regain movement and speech following pioneering treatment in the U.S, but she also went on to have two children - and has now welcomed her first grandson into her life. Scroll down for video . Recovery: Paula Hughes (pictured right with her mother Gennifer Hughes) was left for dead after being attacked by an axe-wielding thug as she walked home from school in Caerphilly in 1975 . Left for dead: The young girl (pictured left before the attack and right afterwards) was hit over the head 15 times during the brutal incident . Paula, now 50, said: 'I didn't think I would ever be normal but if it was not for the programme I don't know what I would have been like.' She added: 'I was just going home from school and I went to the shortcut - that was the railway track - and for no reason somebody hit me over the head with an axe. 'Now I have got Robert, who is 15 now and Emily, 18, and she is a mother as well. I'm now a nan to Baby David. He's rather funny.' Smiling as she sits next to her mother, the sight is a far cry from what the family expected when surgeons told her mother Gennifer to 'forget her daughter' and leave her to die in hospital. Medics had told Gennifer that her ten-year-old had barely any chance of survival and would be unable to walk or talk if she did make it through. Her mother said: 'I just can't believe how it has all turned out, I never imagined that I would be a grandmother, never mind a great-grandmother. 'At this point in my life, I am so very happy. We have had our problems along the way, but I am so very glad I didn't listen to the surgeon who told me to just leave her.' The attack, which sent shockwaves through the community, took place on February 13, 1975. Desperate to get home after the school bell rang at Cwm Ifor Junior School for the day, Paula had thrown on her backpack and began walking back to her home in Caerphilly, as she did every day. But, as she took a shortcut along the railway embankment, she was struck over the head by the mystery attacker, who split open her skull in one of 15 excruciating blows. Evidence: Paula sits on her mother Gennifer's lap as she talks to Chief Inspector Harry Sambrook about what happened . Manhunt: The attack, which sent shockwaves through the community, sparked one of the biggest manhunts ever carried out by South Wales Police but the attacker disappeared . Detectives search the area where Paula was attacked for clues. The incident took place on February 13, 1975 . So desperate were Paula's attempt to shield herself from the man's menacing attack that her left hand was almost severed as she tried to protect her head. In hospital, surgeons removed a piece of brain tissue the size of an egg. But, despite the work carried out by medics, they warned Paula's devastated family that, if she even survived to the end of the week, she would never walk or talk again. For her mother Gennifer, who lives with Paula and her family in Gwent, the memory of what happened is as clear as if it were yesterday. 'The cat was ill, so I was planning on taking her to the vet after work,' said Gennifer,  69. 'I had told Paula that, if she was not home in time, I would go on to the vet so as I didn't miss them before closing. 'She wasn't there, so I left her a note saying that she should stay at home until I got back. I remember clearly that the weather was dreadful and I thought twice about going, but the cat really needed to see the vet.' When Gennifer got back, she found her neighbour at home, who was 'white as a sheet'. Re-enactment: Police re-enacted the attack on Paula alongside the Rhymney Valley railway line, Caerphilly . The young girl leaves her home with her mother Gennifer to meet a police car, which was waiting to take her to the re-enactment of the attack . Return: Despite her ordeal, Paula returned to the same spot where she had been attacked 12 months later to help police re-enact the scene, in the hope of finding the mystery man . Probe: Detective Constable Wendy Parry retraces the steps taken by Paula on the day of the fateful attack. Paula's friend Jacqueline Williams (pictured front) also walked with the officer . 'I remember thinking it was strange because the neighbour had red hair and a red face, but he was white as a sheet,' she said. 'He followed me into the house and I saw immediately that Paula's coat and shoes were not where she usually left them and the note hadn't been touched. I knew immediately something bad had happened and they took me straight to the hospital, but I still didn't know how bad it was.' When Gennifer got to the hospital, Paula's father broke the devastating news. 'He told me she had been hit 15 times with an axe - 15 times,' says Gennifer. 'I don't know how I managed to stay upright. That was the biggest shock of all and then I wasn't able to see her because she was in surgery. 'When we finally got to see her, she was all bandaged up and her eyes were almost closed. There was blood on her legs because they had been so focused on the surgery they had not had time to clean her up. None of it felt very real, it was like waking up in a nightmare.' Glyn Davies (left) came to Paula's rescue following the brutal attack, after finding her in a ditch near the railway line. Police hunting the attacker issued a photofit of the suspect (right) Fear: Parents who would usually let their children walk home alone from Cwm Ifor Junior School arrive at the school to the collect them following the attack . 'They told me that if she survived the next three days, she would never walk or talk again. 'One doctor told me to go away, leave Paula with them and to forget about her. He said I was young enough to have another family, but there was no way I was going to leave my daughter there.' Despite advances in forensic science, the brazen attacker has never been caught. Cruelly, heavy rain washed the evidence away and they have never been found. But the mystery over the attacker's identity became secondary to the remarkable recovery story which was to follow. Family: Paula's children Emily, now 18, and Robert, now 15, (left) and her grandson David, 16 months . Surgeons at Cardiff Royal Infirmary tried to explain to Paula's parents how badly injured she was. 'At the end of the day, they were not giving us much hope, and said that she was likely to be a vegetable because her brain injury was so severe,' recalls Gennifer. Gennifer refused to believe the doctors and took her daughter to America for pioneering assessment at the Institute for the Achievement of Human Potential. With financial help from friends, Paula endured six years of physical and mental exercises, which lasted 14 hours a day. When they started the treatment, Paula was in a wheelchair, unable to feed herself. By the end, she was able to hold down a job in an electronics factory. Paula's health continued to go from strength to strength. She soon met John and together they had children Emily, now 18, and Robert, 15. Then, 16 months ago, Emily gave birth to David - her first grandchild. David's birth, which made Gennifer a great-grandmother, was yet another chapter in Paula's story which the family never thought they would see. Gennifer said: 'They get embarrassed when I say it, but I am so, so proud of them all. 'When Paula was pregnant first time, I didn't tell anyone, but I really hoped that she would have a girl because I could get to see a little girl grow up the way they should.'","Paula Hughes was attacked in Caerphilly as she walked home from school .

"Chaps, if you want to impress a woman, don’t talk about work. An analysis of almost 1,000 speed dates, showed that females switched off when a prospective beau started chatting about his job. Much more successful, was allowing the woman to talk about herself. And, surprisingly, interrupting her. Talking about your work rather than your date is likely to put off a woman, according to research by scientists . Researchers from Stanford University in the US, listened to recordings made during speed dating events, in which a man has just four minutes to impress a woman before moving on to talk to another one. Researchers studying videos of men and women who had never met before talking together have worked out the science of flirting. Their findings could help you spot whether someone is interested in you or not. 1-3 minutes . If someone begins talking to you by dishing out compliments and being encouraging to things you say, it is a good indicator they are interested - according to the researchers. Some people will also give a quick flirtatious glance at the start of the conversation. Crossing legs at any point, though, was a sign that a person was not interested in the other. Also, if a woman doesn't ask many questions, or shrugs a lot, she probably isn't interested. 4-6 minutes . If the person is still attracted to you, they will likely be even more affirmative, and also still quite complimentary. They will also begin ‘palming' - talking using open palm gestures. 7-9 minutes . Now, people start to do-away with compliments. Instead, men will gaze at their partner if they are interested at this point, while women might start to divulge some personal details. 10-12 minutes . At the end of the conversation, women will open up and be joyful, while still palming, if they are still interested. For women, you’ll want to look for a guy who has lowered his pitch from the earlier part of the interaction. This means they are still interested. At the end of the night, the women are asked which men they would like to see again and vice-versa. Men will typically say they’d like to see most of the women again, the females will be choosier. Both sexes must agree before a proper meeting is set up and so the women hold the balance of power. This could help explain why one of the secrets of success was to allow the woman to talk about herself. Linguist Dan Jurafsky said: ‘We went in assuming that men would talk about themselves. ‘And we were surprised to find that the stereotype just wasn’t true. ‘Women in successful dates talked more about themselves. They used the word “I” more. ‘Men talked about the woman more. They used the word “you’ more.’ Professor Jurafksy’s analysis also showed that women liked men who interrupted them. He said: ‘The men would interrupt a lot. We thought interruption would usually be a sign of taking the floor and of being rude but all of these interruptions were sympathetic interruptions. ‘They would stop someone and say “Oh, that exactly happened to me too”. ‘They were attentive listening-type interruptions. ‘And women, in a date that clicked, showed signs of engagement. They varied their pitch a lot, they varied their loudness, they got louder and softer. ‘So, on a good date, the woman was engaged and the man was attentive.’ However, women really didn’t like men who were hesitant, with time-buying phrases such as ‘kind of’ and ‘sort of’ interpreted as a sign of awkwardness. And they really didn’t like chit-chat about work. The professor told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s annual conference in San Jose: ‘The more a man talked about work, the worse the date went. Women see men who talk shop as having little personality while phrases like 'kind of' suggested hesitance . ‘We interpret that as if you have nothing to click on, no personal interaction, you fall back to talking about your work and that’s, of course, a bad thing.’ The men, in contrast, were far less choosy. Asked what the women did wrong in the speed dates, Professor Jurafksy said: ‘Oh, not much.’","Researchers at Stanford University listened to recordings of speed dates .
Women tended to be choosier than men about meeting up properly again .
In successful dates, women tended to use the word 'I' far more frequently .
Men in dates deemed to be successful, however, used the word 'you' more .
Surprisingly, men who interrupted more often were also more successful .
Rather than being rude, interrupting suggested men had been listening ."
"A gang of 13 millionaire supercar owners who took their Ferraris, McLarens and Lamborghinis to China to take part in illegal races have been given suspended sentences after they sped along private roads at 160mph. The gang - all men and aged between 36 and 62 -  crossed from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in southern China to stage the illegal race. They reportedly told police they had travelled to China because the roads in Hong Kong were  too narrow for racing. A gang of 13 supercar drivers have been given suspended sentences after they took their expensive fast cars to China to stage an illegal race there and were caught driving at 160mph on private roads, their luxury fleet is being shipped back to Hong Kong . Each was given a prison sentence of between one and six months, suspended for two years, at Bao'an District People's Court after they admitted driving at 160mph on private roads. Other motorists reported their 'sheer terror' when they tore past. Police seized 12 of the vehicles, which were stopped in November last year. Van driver Wang Ho, 39, said: 'I was doing about 100 kph (60mph) but they overtook me like I was standing still.' He added: 'My van literally shook when they went past me on both sides because of the speed they were doing. 'They were going so fast their number plates were a blur. 'I thought if they made even one small mistake at that speed they would kill me.' Other motorists said it appeared the drivers 'thought they were on a race track.' Shenzhen in southern China was chosen for the race because the roads in Hong Kong are too narrow . The fleet of luxury cars included Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Nissan GT-Rs which were taken over the border . The drivers have been fined around £70,000 and were warned by a judge they may not be so lucky next time. They were also banned from driving on the mainland for two years, the Shenzhen Daily reported. 'The street racing posed a great danger to road safety and some frightened drivers reported to police,' Xie Xingming, deputy chief of the traffic police bureau's investigative department, told the newspaper. 'The drivers raced on rainy days, posing a great threat to road safety. Some of them drove at about 270 kilometers per hour.' One of the drivers - only known by the surname Chen - said the punishment had been harsh and he 'had only hoped to have some fun by driver faster,' according to the Shenzhen Daily. Reports said the gang had been seen driving at up to 160mph on private roads in supercars which included Ferraris and Nissan GT-Rs. The cars will now be taken back to Hong Kong after motorists reported 'sheer terror' when drivers sped past . A van driver said his vehicle 'literally shook' as the vehicles tore past people in private roads in China . They were also said to reach speeds three times the legal limit on the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Riverside Highway. The gang's fleet of luxury supercars was seen being shipped back to Hong Kong after the sentences were handed down. Police tracked down the drivers after they were captured on November 6 last year, racing along the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Riverside Highway, which connects Guangdong's capital Guangzhou, Dongguan and Shenzhen. Officers also found temporary import papers the owners ad been forced to sign to get the cars into the country -  allowing them to stay there for just a week. The 13 were told by judges: 'Our roads are not a racetrack for the wealthy. If there is a next time you will not be so lucky.'","Gang of supercar owners drove their Ferraris and Lamborghinis to China .

Three of the island's prisons, Batu, Besi and Permisan, the oldest and said to take its name from the Dutch word for 'lost', were all build around a century ago. Kembangkuning prison, built in 1950, and with a bright green exterior along its roadfront is said to be the most feared of the four with a heavy persence of terrorist inmates. Then there are Narkotika for drug offenders and Pasir Putuh, with a large holding capacity of up to around 500 prisoners. A 2013 report listed 59 convicted terrorists among the inmates who had been transferred to the island because they were considered hardliners in need of close supervision. Batu prison, which a capacity of around  400 inmates, was where the three Bali bombing terrorists, Amrozi, Muklas Imam Samudra, who killed 188 people on Bali in 2002,  were housed before their 2008 execution in an orange grove in the island's central plateau.

"A St Louis archbishop embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal has claimed he didn’t know it was illegal for priests to have sex with children in the 1980s, according to a court deposition released on Monday. Archbishop Robert Carlson, who was chancellor of the Archdiocese of Minneapolis and St. Paul at the time, was deposed as part of a sexual abuse lawsuit in Minnesota involving the archdiocese and the Diocese of Winona. In a testimony filmed last month and released by the St. Paul law firm Jeff Anderson & Associates, the Catholic archbishop was asked whether he had known it was a crime for an adult to engage in sex with a child.

Archbishop Robert Carlson, who was chancellor of the Archdiocese of Minneapolis and St. Paul in the 1980s, has been deposed as part of a sexual abuse lawsuit in Minnesota involving the archdiocese and the Diocese of Winona . ‘I’m not sure whether I knew it was a crime or not,’ Carlson responded. ‘I understand today it’s a crime.’ When asked when he first realized it was a crime for an adult - including priests - to have sex with a child, Carlson, 69, shook his head. ‘I don’t remember,’ he testified. Yet according to other documents released by attorney Jeff Anderson, who is representing an alleged clergy abuse victim, Carlson showed clear knowledge that sexual abuse was a crime when discussing incidents with church officials during his time in Minnesota. In a 1984 document, for example, Carlson wrote to the then-archbishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis - John R. Roach - about one victim of sexual abuse and mentioned that the statute of limitations for filing a claim would not expire for more than two years. 'I don't remember': When asked when he first realized it was a crime for an adult - including priests - to have sex with a child, Carlson, 69, shook his head . He also wrote that the parents of the victim were considering reporting the incident to the police. Carlson’s role at the time was to investigate abuse claims. He admitted in his deposition that he never personally went to police, even when a clergy member admitted to inappropriate behavior. In the testimony, Carlson responded 193 times that he did not recall abuse-related conversations from the 1980s to mid-1990s. Carlson also said that even in 1996 he did not know that pedophilia was a disorder that couldn’t be cured.“I did not know that, but as a pastor, I was becoming increasingly concerned,” Carlson said. Carlson left the Archdiocese of Minneapolis and St. Paul in 1994, and eventually became St. Louis archbishop in 2009 . Carlson left the Archdiocese of Minneapolis and St. Paul in 1994, and eventually became St. Louis archbishop in 2009. The Archdiocese of St. Louis said in a statement on Monday that Carlson had given testimony ‘several times many years ago’ about the same allegations. ‘In this most recent deposition, while not being able to recall his knowledge of the law exactly as it was many decades ago, the Archbishop did make clear that he knows child sex abuse is a crime today,’ the statement said. ‘The question does not address the Archbishop’s moral stance on the sin of pedophilia, which has been that it is a most egregious offense.’ The trial against the Twin Cities archdiocese is set to begin in September.

"Staff at the private bank at the centre of the HSBC tax scandal were given £70million in pay and bonuses in three years, it was revealed yesterday. HSBC’s private banking unit in Switzerland increased payouts for key managers and officials by almost 40 per cent in 2013, before the true extent of the offshore tax scandal was revealed. Britain’s biggest bank refused to say how many staff were covered by the £70million paid out between 2011 and 2013 - after data from thousands of its customers’ accounts was passed to the UK taxman for investigation. Scroll down for video . Pay and bonuses: HSBC’s private banking unit in Switzerland increased payouts for key managers and officials by almost 40 per cent in 2013, before the true extent of the offshore tax scandal was revealed . Its own financial reports revealed that key staff at the private bank were given around £21million in salaries and bonuses in 2011 and 2012 respectively, but that the figure jumped almost 40 per cent to £29.2million in 2013. The bank has been accused of helping its wealthiest customers to cheat the taxman out of millions of pounds and has admitted failings in compliance and controls in its Swiss private banking wing. Its chief executive Stuart Gulliver apologised to customers and investors in a series of full-page newspaper advertisements yesterday and said the private bank had been ‘completely overhauled’. Business Secretary Vince Cable said Britain still needed ‘a proper explanation’ for the offshore banking scandal and called on the bank’s ex-chairman, former trade minister Lord Green, to give an account of his role. 'Completely overhauled': HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver has apologised to customers and investors . Lord Green was on the board of the Swiss banking unit for a decade and reportedly avoided a tax charge of up to £2.3million on a £5.8million pension pot under a scheme set up by the bank. He was appointed as a trade minister in 2011 – after HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) revealed it was examining data related to tax evasion by HSBC’s private customers – and both he and David Cameron have refused to answer whether they discussed the issue before his appointment. Mr Cable told Sky News: ‘[Lord Green] hasn’t yet spoken on his role in the matter and I would certainly like him to do so.’ HSBC faces investigations by financial authorities in Britain and the US and its chairman Douglas Flint will face questions from MPs later this month. The Treasury select committee is then expected to discuss if it should call Lord Green, an ordained Church of England priest, to give evidence. He left the bank in 2010 when his pension pot stood at £19million, one of the biggest boardroom pensions in the private sector, according to the Sunday Times. In 2006, when the Government introduced a £1.5million limit on the tax breaks for pensions, he quit the bank’s pension scheme and could claim enhanced protection for his pension pot and avoid the new taxes. An unregistered employer-funded retirement benefits scheme was then set up which was not subject to the new penalties, the Sunday Times reported. Questions: Business Secretary Vince Cable (left) called on the bank’s ex-chairman, former trade minister Lord Green (right), to give an account of his role . HSBC has described the arrangement as prudent tax mitigation and there is no suggestion it was illegal tax evasion. Lord Green was vetted by the House of Lords appointment commission before he was made a life peer and HMRC confirmed his personal tax affairs were in order. He has refused to comment on the HSBC tax row but announced this weekend that he was standing down as chairman of financial lobby group TheCityUK. Meanwhile senior tax officials at HMRC were revealed to have shared bonuses of around £250,000 since they were handed the HSBC Suisse files in 2010. The tax authority has been criticised for failing to pursue tax evaders after it emerged that only one person from the files has been convicted, although HMRC says it has recouped £135million in unpaid taxes and fines. The 20 performance-related payments included two bonuses of £20,000 to HMRC chief executive Lin Homer, on top of her £185,000-a-year salary.","Key staff at bank given £21m in salaries and bonuses in 2011 and 2012 .

"Lord Dyson (pictured), the master of the rolls and second most senior judge in England and Wales, welcomed the idea and said the justice system has been slow to take advantage of internet technology . Thousands of court cases could soon be dealt with over the internet under new proposals which aim to reduce the amount of time and money spent on conventional hearings. Online courts could be created to resolve low-value disputes about internet services and transactions, if the HM Courts and Tribunals Service gives the plans the go-ahead. The idea to 'increase access to justice' has been proposed by the Civil Justice Council and is backed by Lord Dyson, the master of the rolls, who is head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales. The online court would resolve claims worth up to £25,000 and could be based on existing services such as eBay's disagreement negotiation procedure, the plans reveal. It would allow judges to decide cases online after analysing paperwork submitted via email, with an option of telephone hearings or Skype calls if necessary. According to the Civil Justice Council, the current system of resolving disputes in a physical court is too costly, too complex and too slow. Funding from the project could come from the £75million budget the Ministry of Justice wants to spend each year on modernising technology within HMCTS, the council's report said. Professor Richard Susskind, president of the Society for Computers and Law who wrote the Civil Justice Council report, suggested ideas such as 'automated negotiation' to resolve differences 'without the intervention of human experts'. His report states: 'ODR (Online Dispute Resolution) is not science fiction. Each year on eBay around 60 million disagreements amongst traders are resolved through ODR. 'This is a well-established way of resolving disputes, appropriate for the internet age. 'Other jurisdictions, notably Holland and Canada, are already forging ahead. If we aspire to have a court system that leads the way, then we already have some catching up to do.' Professor Susskind, who discussed the working group's report at a conference in the Royal Courts of Justice in London, added that the proposed changes could also save money. He said: 'If a large number of disputes come to be resolved by HMOC, this would have significant implications for the court estate. There will be a reduction in need for many of the current buildings and the land on which they sit. 'The current system is too costly, too complex and too slow, especially for litigants in person. 'We call for support from all the political parties for [online courts] that will reduce costs and increase access to justice.' Lord Dyson, the second most senior judge in England and Wales, welcomed the proposals and said the justice system had been slow to take advantage of internet technology. He said: 'I see this as an exciting milestone in the history of our civil justice system. The plans were revealed by Professor Susskind at a conference at the Royal Courts of Justice in London . 'We have been very slow off the mark in this country in taking advantage of technology in our justice system. Other countries are way ahead of us. 'There is no doubt that online dispute resolution is an area with enormous potential. 'Its aim is to broaden access to justice and resolved disputes more easily, quickly and cheaply. 'The challenge lies in delivering a system that fulfils that objective.' An HMCTS spokesman said: 'We welcome publication of this important and thought-provoking report. 'We agree that Online Dispute Resolution is an important area and one that we are actively exploring in more detail in the context of the reform of court and tribunal services.' The proposal for the creation of an online court comes five months after a senior judge called for courts to cut down on paper and move into the digital age. In September, Lady Justice Gloster, who sits in the Court of Appeal, said the numbers of bundles of documents used in trials were similar to when she started her legal career four decades earlier. The 65-year-old judge said, in an interview with financial news agency Bloomberg, that change had to come. Earlier in 2014, the Ministry of Justice said changes were planned. In March, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said technology in courts would be updated, adding that hundreds of millions of pounds would be spent in coming years.","Online court could be set up to reduce time and money spent on hearings .

"Sir Rory Collins, who is to lead new research into the mass prescription of statins and their side effects . A renowned professor whose research led to the mass prescription of statins is carrying out a major review into their safety. Sir Rory Collins of Oxford University is to examine the records of tens of thousands of patients to establish how many may have suffered side effects. The scientist has previously carried out studies showing that prescribing the drugs more widely could save 2,000 lives a year in Britain and prevent 10,000 heart attacks and strokes. His research helped shape NHS guidelines issued last year recommending that GPs offer them to around 40 per cent of all adults. He still believes the benefits of statins outweigh the risks – and warned of ‘averse public health consequences’ if patients stop taking them. But Professor Collins has acknowledged that his earlier studies looking at the benefits of statins did not properly investigate all the side effects. These only looked at the possible risk of dying, suffering a heart attack or developing cancer. Other known side effects include muscular pain, type 2 diabetes, nausea and memory loss. There is also concern statins increase obesity and inactivity as patients see them as a ‘licence’ to lead unhealthy lifestyles. Professor Collins and his Oxford colleagues will now review patient records from all the previous studies to check how many suffered ‘adverse’ effects. Statins are prescribed to between five and ten million adults in Britain including those with heart disease or deemed at risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke in future. They work by reducing the level of cholesterol in the blood. Statins are prescribed to between five and ten million adults in Britain including those with heart disease or deemed at risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke in future. They work by reducing cholesterol in the blood . If this is too high, fatty deposits form on the walls of the arteries which can trigger heart attacks, strokes and sharp chest pain, or angina. Very little is known about the risks of taking statins, as drug companies have refused to publish the data from their trials. But according to some studies, up to one in 50 patients can develop type 2 diabetes. A further one in 50 suffers from severe muscular pain that affects their daily activities. Around one in ten patients experiences milder side effects that can include a runny nose, headaches, nose bleeds, nausea and a sore throat. Several leading doctors have also revealed that they have stopped taking statins, after either experiencing side effects or failing to be convinced that they were doing any good. These include Dr Kailash Chand, deputy chair of the British Medical Association, who took them for two years and developed muscle pain. Dr Haroun Gajraj, a vein surgeon from Dorset, took them for eight years but found his cholesterol actually came down after he stopped. Statins work by blocking the action of an enzyme responsible for regulating many systems and chemical reactions in the body, including the production of cholesterol and lipoproteins. The drugs have been used since the 1980s for their cholesterol-lowering properties, but in the last few years they have gained ‘superdrug’ status for their ability to prolong life. Professor Collins, who was knighted for his services to science in 2010, sent an email confirming his intentions last week. It said: ‘In light of the concerns that have been raised about possible adverse effects of statin therapy’, the researchers are ‘seeking individual patient data on all of the other adverse outcomes that were recorded in the trials.’ The email added that the study would attempt to work out the likelihood of patients suffering any form of side effects from taking statins. It said this would be ‘challenging’ given the vast numbers of patients involved, but ‘necessary’ in light of the concerns. Professor Collins is understood to want to refute previous inaccurate claims that as many as one in five patients suffered side effects. One of the main worries surrounding statins is that too little is known about the risks, as drug companies fail to publish data. Dr Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes and chairman of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘I’m concerned there may be side effects that have not been reported. Drug manufacturers should release all their trial data on statins so they are available for scrutiny.’ Klim McPherson, professor of public health at Oxford University, said: ‘We know these drugs have side effects but we do not know if these have been assessed properly by the drug companies.’ Last July, NHS rationing body Nice said statins should be prescribed to 17million adults, nearly 40 per cent of the population. Its guidance said GPs should offer them to anyone deemed to have a 10 per cent risk of suffering a stroke or heart attack in a decade.","Sir Rory Collins is to lead research into the mass prescription of statins .

"Ancient texts uncovered in Egyptian village Deir el-Medina (Ptolemaic temple pictured) suggest New Kingdom workers had state-supported health care . Many of us consider national health services  as relatively new innovations of the 20th century, but they appear to have much older origins. Ancient texts uncovered among the human remains of an Egyptian village suggest workers from the New Kingdom had their own version of a state-supported health care. This scheme, which involved paid sick leave and on-site doctors, made sure workers making the king’s tomb 3,600 years ago were productive and well looked after. The dig of the ancient Egyptian worker’s village at Deir el-Medina is being led by Stanford archaeologist Anne Austin. The village was built for workmen who made the royal tombs during the New Kingdom (1550 to 1070 BC). During this period, kings were buried in the Valley of the Kings in a series of rock-cut tombs. The village was purposely built close enough to the royal tomb to make sure the workers could hike there on a weekly basis. ‘These workmen were not what we normally picture when we think about the men who built and decorated ancient Egyptian royal tombs - they were highly skilled craftsmen,’ said Dr Austin. ‘The workmen at Deir el-Medina were given a variety of amenities afforded only to those with the craftsmanship and knowledge necessary to work on something as important as the royal tomb.’ According to ancient texts found on the site, as well as other historical accounts, the Egyptian state paid workers monthly wages in the form of grain and provided them with housing and servants to help with laundry, grinding grain and porting water. The worker’s families lived with them in the village, and their wives and children could also benefit from these provisions from the state. Among these texts are also numerous daily records detailing when and why individual workmen were absent from work. Nearly one-third of these absences occurred when a workman was too sick to work, for example. The village (marked) was built for workmen who made the royal tombs during the New Kingdom (1550 to 1070 BC). During this period, kings were buried in the Valley of the Kings in a series of rock-cut tombs. Deir el-Medina was built close enough to the royal tomb to make sure the workers could hike there each week . Ancient texts found among human remains (pictured with lead archaeologist Anne Austin) include daily records detailing when and why workers were sick and reveal they were also paid a certain amount of sick leave. Other papyri describe on-site physicians who would treat the workers as part of their employment . Yet, monthly ration distributions from Deir el-Medina were consistent enough to suggest these workmen were paid even if they were out sick for several days, explained Dr Austin. ‘These texts also identify a workman on the crew designated as the swnw, physician,' she continued. ‘The physician was given an assistant and both were allotted days off to prepare medicine and take care of colleagues. ‘The Egyptian state even gave the physician extra rations as payment for his services to the community of Deir el-Medina.’ This physician would have most likely treated the workmen with remedies and incantations found in his medical papyrus. These texts acted like a reference book for the ancient Egyptian medical practitioner, listing individual treatments for different ailments. The longest medical papyrus ever found is the Papyrus Ebers (pictured). It contains more than 800 treatments for eye problems to digestive disorders . Texts found on the site of Deir el-Medina identify a workman on the crew designated as the 'swnw', or physician. The physician was given an assistant and both were allotted days off to prepare medicine and take care of colleagues. This physician would have most likely treated the workmen with remedies and incantations found in his medical papyrus. These texts acted like a reference book for the ancient Egyptian medical practitioner, listing individual treatments for different ailments. The longest of these ever found is called Papyrus Ebers and contains more than 800 treatments covering eye problems to digestive disorders. The source of the papyrus is unknown, but it was said to have been found between the legs of a mummy in the Theban necropolis. A suggested treatment for a condition that had symptoms similar to asthma is listed as a mixture of herbs heated on a brick so the sufferer could inhale the fumes. Another treatment, this time for intestinal worms, required the physician to cook the cores of dates and a desert plant called colocynth together in sweet beer. He would then have sieved the warm liquid and gave it to the patient to drink for four days. While smearing a paste of dates, acacia, and honey to wool and applying it as a pessary would be used as a form of contraception by the worker's wives.

He would then have sieved the warm liquid and gave it to the patient to drink for four days. Some of these ancient Egyptian medical treatments required expensive and rare ingredients that limited who could afford to be treated, but the most frequent ingredients found in the texts tended to be common household items like honey and grease. One text from Deir el-Medina indicates that the state rationed out common ingredients to a few men in the workforce so that they could be shared among the workers. Some ancient treatments required expensive and rare ingredients that limited who could afford to be treated, but the most frequent ingredients found in these texts tended to be common household items like honey and grease. Paintings on the walls of King Merneptah’s tomb in the Valley of the Kings is shown . Egyptologist Dr Anne Austin (pictured) also said she found evidence of both health care and significant occupational stress in human bones recovered from the site. According to ancient texts the Egyptian state paid workers monthly wages in the form of grain and provided them with housing and servants . Despite paid sick leave, medical rations and a state-supported physician, it is clear that in some cases the workmen were working through their illnesses. For example in one text, a workman called Merysekhmet attempted to go to work after being sick. Dr Austin said: ‘The text tells us he descended to the King’s Tomb on two consecutive days, but was unable to work. ‘He then hiked back to the village of Deir el-Medina where he stayed for the next ten days until he was able to work again. ‘Though short, these hikes were steep [and] Merysekhmet’s movements across the Theban valleys were likely at the expense of his own health.’ Dr Austin said this suggests sick days and medical care were not ‘magnanimous gestures of the Egyptian state’, but were calculated provisions designed to make sure the workers were as productive as possible.","Dig of Deir el-Medina is being led by Stanford archaeologist Anne Austin .

"He was one of Hollywood's finest comic talents raking in almost $10m per film at the height of his fame. But Chevy Chase, 71, looked a shadow of his former self when he appeared at the 40th anniversary of the Saturday Night Live show. In an excruciating interview with Carson Daly, Chase wiped sweat from his brow and made a garbled and confused speech to the TV anchor. Scroll down for video . A plump Chevy Chase made a confused and awkward interview while at the 40th anniversary of SNL . At the height of his career, Chase was one of America's most popular comedians and a visible celebrity . Chase, whose real name is Cornelius, rose to fame as an original member of the SNL crew in 1975 . Chase, who was part of the original Saturday Night Live crew in 1975, said: 'I left after the first year because I thought this isn't going anywhere... I liked [hosting]. I liked it. 'But I missed it more for not being a part of the cast because I left after one year, I had reasons to leave. 'I'm sorry if I'm perspiring, but I just had to run through a gauntlet. But I liked it a lot, and I still like it. I love Lorne (Michaels, the creator of the show). We're like brothers now.' Following the toe-curling chat on the red carpet, viewers on Twitter commented on the 'awkward' interview saying it was one of the most cringe-worthy things they had ever seen. They also mocked Chevy's famous catchphrase 'I'm Chevy Chase...and you're not' which he used during the Weekend Update segment of SNL. One quipped: 'He's Chevy Chase and I'm not, thank God'. Viewers watching the 40th anniversary celebrations took to Twitter to comment on the cringe-worthy chat .

"A journalist decided to test how safe the streets of Paris are for Jews - by wearing a religious skullcap and filming the public's reaction using a hidden camera. Zvika Klein, a reporter for Jewish news outlet NRG, silently walked in the city for ten hours wearing a kippah - also known as a yarmulke - on his head and a tzitzit (knotted ritual tassels). And the shocking hidden camera footage shows antisemitism is rife in the French capital as he is seen harassed and intimidated. As he wanders around neighbourhoods wearing the garments associated with the Jewish faith, he is spat at, threatened and even called a 'dog'. The clip shows the reporter for Jewish news outlet NRG as he is harassed, intimidated and even spat on . Zvika Klein is seen being followed and harassed by this man as he walked the streets wearing a kippah . Klein was inspired by a YouTube video in which a New York woman filmed the sexist remarks she endured in 10 hours of walking the streets of the Big Apple . After the attack on a kosher supermarket in Paris last month, where four Jews were murdered for their faith, he decided to record what life is really like for a Jew living in Paris. Posting the video on YouTube, he wrote: 'Welcome to Paris 2015, where soldiers are walking every street that houses a Jewish institution, and where keffiyeh-wearing men and veiled women speak Arabic on every street corner.' He spent a day in Paris with a bodyguard while photographer Dov Belhassen documented the day using a GoPro camera hidden in his backpack. He wandered through Jewish neighborhoods, around the Eiffel Tower, and then through mostly Muslim neighborhoods. Tourist areas were 'relatively calm' but in some areas, he received 'belligerent remarks' and was even spat at . Zvika Klein silently walked the streets of Paris for ten hours wearing a kippah and secretly filmed reactions . In an article accompanying the video, he said tourist attractions were 'relatively calm' - 'but the further from them we walked, the more anxious I became over the hateful stares, the belligerent remarks, and the hostile body language,' he wrote. Boys shouted 'Viva Palestine' and as he passes a group of youths, one remarks: 'I'm joking, the dog will not eat you'. Fingers were pointed at him in a cafe - and moments later, thugs awaited him on a street corner, he adds. A little boy was shocked at his appearance in his neighbourhood, he reports. 'What is he doing here Mommy?' he asked. 'Doesn’t he know he will be killed?'

"Home Secretary Teresa May has ordered that special training in how to spot the signs of child abuse is given to the (NCA) More than 4,000 police officers are to be trained in specialist child protection following a series of abuse scandals. Home Secretary Teresa May has ordered that special training in how to spot the signs of child abuse be given to all 4,000-plus officers in the new National Crime Agency (NCA), nicknamed Britain's FBI. The move follows a string of child abuse scandals including the Jimmy Savile case and the exposure of grooming rings in Oxford, Telford, Rochdale and Rotherham. A senior Home Office official said: 'Every officer in the NCA is to receive specialist child protection training as part of a massive expansion in resources to deal with the threat of child abuse. 'There will be different levels of training for different officers. 'The training normal officers will receive will be on spotting the signs of child abuse, such as kids being dirty and losing weight - all the signs that were missed in the horrible case of Daniel Pelka recently.' Daniel, four, died from head injuries last year after he was starved and tortured by his Polish mother Magdalena Luczak, and her partner Mariusz Krezolek, a wanted criminal who had fled to Britain from Poland. The couple were given life sentences and ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years each for what the trial judge called their 'incomprehensible brutality'. However the jury at Birmingham Crown Court heard that local police, teachers, social workers, and doctors missed at least 26 chances to save Daniel from abuse. Between them they made dozens of visits to his home but failed to raise the alarm. Police were also called in after Daniel suffered a broken arm in 2011, doctors and social workers ruled there was no evidence of abuse. Subsequently Daniel was never interviewed. Daniel Pelka died from head injuries last year after he was starved and tortured by his Polish mother Magdalena Luczak and her partner Mariusz Krezolek . Ministers want to prevent such tragedies happening again. Currently there are only a handful of officers in each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales with specialist training in child protection. NCA officers will tackle organised crime such as human trafficking, drug importation and organised prostitution. It is believed they are more likely to come across the victims and perpetrators of child abuse then neighbourhood beat officers. NCA's role in tackling child abuse will be enhanced by the merger of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection (Ceop) agency into the organisation. Jailed: Magdalena Luczak (right) and her partner Mariusz Krezolek (left) were ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years each for starving and torturing Daniel who was just four . Ceop currently investigates paedophiles and sex abusers with specialist knowledge of internet-based crime. The director of Ceop will become the title 'Children's Champion' within the new organisation. The NCA, which will be formed in October, will also be given new powers to co-ordinate and guide regional police forces and crime fighting agencies such as the Border Force to deal with child abuse and trafficking. A Home Office spokesman said: 'Child abuse is an evil crime and we are determined to stamp down on anyone who seeks to harm the most vulnerable members of society. 'The National Crime Agency will see more resources devoted to tackling paedophiles and child abusers, whether they seek to commit their crimes in person or online. 'The NCA will carry out this vital work as part of a radical transformation in the way we tackle the damage inflicted by serious, organised and complex crime on the UK.' The NCA will replace the discredited Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA). SOCA has been embroiled in a row over the use of corrupt private investigators by law firms and insurance companies to steal private data, known as 'blue chip hacking'. The police organisation has been accused of failing to act despite holding evidence of wrong-doing by over 100 firms.","Home Secretary Teresa May ordered special training be given to 4,000-plus officers in the National Crime Agency .

"Inside the lock up garage in Heanor Derbyshire where trading standards uncovered a plant for bottling counterfeit vodka . This is the fake alcohol distillery in a lock-up garage where police found counterfeit vodka was being bottled. The discovery came as almost 2,500 litres of fake wine and spirits were seized during a pre-Christmas enforcement drive by trading standards. In total more than 1,800 litres of illegal wine and 600 litres of fake spirits and other alcohol was discovered in the UK during the campaign. A raid in Heanor in Derbyshire at a lock-up garage uncovered a plant for bottling counterfeit vodka by trading standards and HMRC officers. When the vodka that was being bottled at the plant was tested, officers found it to contain iso-propanol (IPA), which can causes intense drunkenness and is often used in cleaning chemicals. Professor Tony Hines, director of crisis management at Leatherhead Food Research, said: 'IPA poisoning causes confusion and can be very painful. 'Appreciating the difference between excessive alcohol consumption, ""binge drinking"" for example and IPA consumption, even at low levels, a couple of doubles will cause dizziness, low blood pressure, abdominal pain and nausea.' The crackdown on fake alcohol comes as part of an international campaign, Operation OPSON, involving more than 50 countries, organised by Interpol and Europol. The operation also saw the closure of an illegal factory making vodka from screen wash and saw a increase in the number of seizures of fake spirits. Minister for Intellectual Property Baroness Neville-Rolfe said: 'The UK is committed to cracking down on crime that harms proper businesses and can pose a real threat to public safety. 'Even though we have one of the safest food industries in the world, there are still criminals who want to profit at the expense and safety of others. The vodka being bottled at the plant was found to contain iso-propanol (IPA), which can causes intense drunkenness and is often used in cleaning chemicals . 'This year’s Operation OPSON results show the continued strength of the UK’s enforcement regime, led by Trading Standards and coordinated by the Intellectual Property Office, in protecting consumers and businesses.' In the Czech Republic, fake vodka resulted in the deaths of 50 people from methanol poisoning after they drank the subanstance in 2012, with a further 80 being blinded as a result of the poisoning. In 2014, two men were sentenced to life imprisonment in connection with the incident.","Trading standards launched crackdown on illegal fake wine and spirits .

"Make-or-break talks between Greek and EU finance ministers collapsed last night after just three hours – with Athens rejecting the latest bailout offer as ‘absurd’. The current bailout runs out in two weeks, and the EU had originally said Greece would have to demand an extension to the loan by yesterday. But, following the collapse of the meeting in Brussels, European officials gave the newly elected radical Left government in Athens another three days, with the possibility of another meeting on Friday. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras who has said that his government needs time to carry out reforms and put the mismanagement of the past behind it . If no deal is reached, Greece will be unable to service its debt and could run out of cash, meaning it would not be able to pay its civil servants or fund pensions. Economists have warned that this could see the country being forced out of the euro, which would spark a crisis in the eurozone and have damaging knock-on effects for the UK economy. The pound rose to a seven-year high against the euro last night as the single currency was hammered on the foreign exchange markets. Sterling rose above 1.355 euros, a level not seen since January 2008. The pound has risen by nearly 20 per cent against the euro since July 2013 – giving British holidaymakers more money to spend on the Continent. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has said that Greece is living beyond its means . Greece’s Left-wing Syriza government wants the country’s bailout to be restructured, with an end to many austerity demands. The International Monetary Fund and European Union say there should be no change to the terms of the current £178billion loan. Yesterday evening, a Greek official said the talks had come to an end without a deal being reached. ‘Some people’s insistence on the Greek government implementing the bailout is unreasonable and cannot be accepted,’ the official said. ‘Those who keep returning to this issue are wasting their time. Under such circumstances, there cannot be a deal today.’ Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the Eurogroup, which represents eurozone finance ministers, said there was still time for a deal. ‘There is time to agree on the terms of an extension,’ he said. ‘When I listen to my Greek colleagues talking about a bridging loan and so on – that’s a different word for an extension.’ The current bailout expires on February 28. Any new agreement would have to be approved by national governments, so time is running out to reach a compromise without which Greece is likely to run out of money. Leaving the meeting, European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said it was now up to Athens to request an extension – something the new Greek government has said it will not do. Before the meeting, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said: ‘The problem is that Greece has lived beyond its means for a long time and that nobody wants to give Greece money any more without guarantees.’ Greek counterpart Yanis Varoufakis said his country was ready to ‘do whatever it takes to reach an agreement in the next two days’, but Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has said that his government needs time to carry out reforms and put the mismanagement of the past behind it.","Talks on the economy between Greek and EU finance minsters collapse .

"Banned: John Alexander Reid, 24, parked his work van in the fast lane of a motorway so that he could have a nap while twice over the drink drive limit . A drink driver who parked his work van in the fast lane of a motorway to have a nap has been banned from the road for 18 months. John Alexander Reid, 24, was found slumped behind the wheel of his white Renault Tripper van with the engine and lights switched off - while twice over the drink-drive limit. The travelling handyman, of Alloa, Scotland, became tired on the journey south to Harrogate in North Yorkshire so he decided to stop in the third lane of the A1 for a sleep. When breathalysed, he recorded a reading of 60 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millitres of breath - with 35 being the maximum permitted. The father-of-one pleaded guilty to driving while over the legal limit and was fined £120 and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 surcharge. Prosecutor Hilary Reece told the court that at 4.12am on January 28 police received a 999 call reporting a stationary vehicle in lane three of the A1 southbound At Baldersby. 'When officers attended they found the defendant asleep in the drivers seat and the engine and lights were switched off,' said Mrs Reece. 'Eventually they managed to rouse him.' 'Highway traffic officers assisted and carried out a rolling roadblock so that the van could be removed safely from lane three to the hard shoulder. When interviewed Reid made no comment. 'This was clearly a dangerous and serious incidents with him parking is motor-vehicle on the outside carriageway.' Reid, who has a wife and 18-month-old child, had three points on his licence already for speeding, Northallerton Magistrates’ Court heard. Mitigating Zoe Passfield said: 'Clearly Mr Reid accepts he found himself in what could have been a very dangerous situation in the outside lane of the A1. 'Fortunately, no damage was caused to Mr Reid or or any other vehicle.' Dangerous: The travelling handyman became tired on the journey south to Harrogate in North Yorkshire so he stopped in the third lane of the A1 for a sleep . The court heard how Reid had been staying in Newcastle with his wife and family at the time - but after having a row with his partner he decided to get a lift with his cousin to Harrogate. On the journey his cousin left him and Reid opted to continue the drive alone despite being drunk. He is  a handyman from the travelling community and claimed losing his licence will make it hard to move his caravan and find work. After being sentenced, he said to the bench: 'I apologise. It won't happen again.' A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'It is extremely fortunate that no one was killed or injured because of Reid's actions in the early hours of 28 January. 'This is another shocking example of how drinking can affect your judgement behind the wheel. 'The consequences of leaving a vehicle in lane three of a motorway, during hours of darkness, could have been utterly devastating.' Reid, 24, was banned from driving for 18 months during a hearing at Northallerton Magistrates’ Court today .","John Alexander Reid found slumped behind wheel on the A1 in Harrogate .

"High-class escort and mother-of-two Samantha X has scored the role as sex editor of Penthouse magazine to make Australian men the best lovers in the world. The Sydney-based mother, whose real name is Amanda Goff, published a tell-all book last year revealing her double life  as a $5,000 a night sex worker one week, and in her children’s tuck shop the next. The 40-year-old is open about her controversial career with her two children - aged six and eight - and now wants to use her years of experience with wealthy clients to offer tips in her column to guys on how to spice up their sex lives. However, now that her book, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, has taken off and a second one is in the pipeline, Ms X plans to stop earning the big bucks as an escort and concentrate on her writing career. Scroll down for video . High-class escort and mother-of-two Samantha X has scored the role as sex editor of Penthouse magazine to make Australian men the best lovers in the world . Ms X said Australian men need to sharpen up their act in the bedroom. 'I have heard so many men complain their sex lives are non-existent and blame the wife but the key to good sex is communication,' she told Daily Mail Australa. 'Women love sex just as much as men. You don’t need to be Italian to be romantic, or French to be sexy, but you can take home a few tips from our European counterparts and become the best lovers in the world.' Last year after the release of her book,  Samantha defended her decision to open up about her job as a high-class escort and said her work is empowering for women. She said going public about her career and making her children vulnerable to school yard bullying was no different to children of gay parents who faced the same hardships. 'Children are teased mercilessly every day and their mother does not have to be working in the sex industry,' the 40-year-old said. 'I think the world is changing. My kids are in classes with kids that have gay parents, lesbian mothers, they’re not ridiculed.' Five months on, Ms X insists her children have not been ridiculed once for their mother's salacious career. 'Some teachers call out across the school yard ""I read your book and loved it"",' she said. 'I'm sure some parents think I'm terrible Muriel but they are smart enough not to say it my face.' In a deliberate plan to eventually stop working as an escort altogether, Samantha had to think twice about when the she last saw a client - and has even sold her apartment in the city as she now only takes occasional work outside of New South Wales. 'Within a year I won't be working as an escort anymore,' she said. 'I'm aware the my kids are getting older and while I'm not ashamed - the plan has always been to stop it was just a case of when.' The high-class escort, who goes by the name of Samantha X, was a former journalist who worked for New Idea and InStyle . She spends one week as a full-time mother and the next at a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD as Samantha X . She talked candidly about her profession as a sex worker to spruik her novel, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, on Channel Seven's Sunday Night. Samantha told the program she volunteered at the tuckshop of her children's school and most of the parents there knew what she did for a living. A former colleague of Ms Goff told Daily Mail Australia they were not surprised to learn of the woman's double life. 'I'm not shocked at all - she's always been a bit close to the edge. She follows her own rules. 'And I'm not surprised she's going on TV and saying it's her - I think she's always secretly wanted to be famous,' the colleague said. 'I think she's always wanted a life that's bigger than what she had. To be famous and rich. And using something to catapult her into the limelight. 'She's always been very bold and goes for what she wants. She's very single-minded. I always thought she used her looks and her boldness to get what she wants.' Ms X has hit back at criticism of her parenting skills after she publicly announced she works both as an escort and in her children's school canteen . The 40-year-old believes her decision to come out as an escort was not a 'big bloody deal' when it came to affecting her children . The mother-of-two charges $800 an hour or $5,000 a night for her time . She has worked as a journalist at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines, but now she charges $800 an hour for her services or $5,000 for an entire night. Samantha spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with her former partner - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X. 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff said. Samantha said despite what many may think, her work as an escort wasn't all about sex. 'I haven’t had sex for ages actually... I’m like a naked therapist,' she told Kyle and Jackie O's radio program Kiis on Monday. 'A lot of men have told me about putting their dogs down and I’ve wiped away a lot of tears. They’re paying for my time, so what they do in that time is really up to them. 'I have champagne and beer but they often want a cup of tea. 'It is an empowered job for a woman and I think we all have the right… as long as we’re not hurting anyone.' Ms X (pictured here three years ago) used to work at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines but is now a private escort . The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two and started escorting in 2012, two days after she visited a brothel . Ms X (left in 2010 and pictured right in the front row, far right in 2009) said most of the parents at her children's school know what she does for a living and are supportive . The escort recalled one incident where she was rushing to pick up her children at school and was sitting outside in her car when a client with a foot fetish messaged her, asking for a picture of her toes. The 40-year-old said she made a decision to come clean because she wanted to be free, saying she did not think it was 'such a big bloody deal', adding: 'Who am I hurting?' Despite potentially exposing her young children to ridicule, Ms X said she had considered the repercussions before writing her book. 'I didn’t wake up one day and say I’m going to write a book about being a hooker. I’ve thought about this very carefully, I’ve been seeing a child psychologist for a year,' she said. Ms X also claimed that her current job as a sex worker, is more ethical than her former career as a journalist in which she admits she hid in bushes and illegally hacked phones . Despite potentially exposing her young children to ridicule, Ms X said she had considered the repercussions before writing her book . The escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012 . 'My kids know that mummy is a journalist… they know she makes sad people feel happy and they know she’s creative and wrote a book. That’s all they need to know at the moment.' Despite the stigma surrounding the profession, the escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012 after visiting a brothel during her lunch break while she was still a beauty editor for a magazine. Two days later she was paid to have sex with men at an exclusive brothel in Sydney and 18 months later she moved into private escorting as Samantha X. But her parents - who live in a middle-class suburb in England - and her former partner were not as enamored with her new career path. Ms X's parents told her she was 'disgusting' when they found out the truth and her ex-husband's response was: 'Are you effing serious?'. After her time sleeping with married men who pay her more than three times the average weekly salary, she says she knows the secret to a happy marriage. Ms X said listening was key as many men complained they were not being heard to by their spouse. She said she did not think that her clients sleeping with her were committing adultery because she gave her clients an outlet to escape from their normal lives and they could go home as happier husbands. Ms X said most of her clients did not see it as straying from their wives because there was no emotional commitment.","Samantha X has scored the role as sex editor of Penthouse magazine .

"An Air Algerie plane has skidded off the tarmac after landing at Paris Orly and forced the closure of one of two runways at the airport.

"The Government's 'Business Is Great' website looks like it's for military recruitment, an MP has claimed . Women are being put off going into business - because websites encouraging female entrepreneurship use too many Union flags, an MP has claimed. Branding on the Government's ‘Great Business’ site is not seen as ‘woman-friendly’ and looks too much like a military recruitment site, a study by the Liberal Democrat’s Lorely Burt has claimed. Mrs Burt, the government’s women in business ambassador, singled out the website as a barrier for femail entrepreneurs considering setting up their own companies. She said there was too much ‘untapped talent’ in the country because of the lack of women in business. The Lib Dem MP said too many women thought entrepreneurship services was ‘not for them’. The Solihull MP said: ‘One powerful way to show women that services are for them is to be explicit about it. ‘The www.greatbusiness.gov.uk website includes a page explicitly for women in enterprise, which is welcome. It has links of particular interest to women entrepreneurs. ‘To show graphically that the page is for women the bar on the right-hand side of the page uses all-women case studies. ‘However, in all other respects the page uses the same branding as the rest of the Great Business website. ‘This branding is seen as not “woman-friendly”: the proliferation of Union flags, for example, has been compared to a military recruitment site.’ Ms Burt proposes changes to the website and notes clicking on one link leads to the ‘supposedly gender-neutral’ finance page which has three case studies, all men. Lib Dem MP Lorely Burt said Government websites were not 'women friendly' because they featured Union Flags . She said: ‘The unintended implicit message is that finance is a “male” subject. Women should be treated as a high priority if the Government aims to raise their participation in enterprise to approximately 50 per cent. ‘The link to the women's section of the website should appear at the top of the homepage. Currently it is near the bottom right-hand corner. ‘The women's section of the Great Business website is welcome but the branding should be made more inclusive.’ It adds the website is a powerful tool but needs to ‘speak to women in language they recognise’. In the report's conclusion, Ms Burt said: ‘Women's employment levels are now higher than at any other time since records began. ‘However, as long as just one business in five is owned by a woman there will be untapped talent which could be boosting the economy and creating jobs. ‘Women's entrepreneurship is a huge potential growth area which will benefit from increased government attention.’","Women put off going into business because websites not female friendly .

"Twitter users have directed their fury at a Texas man who allegedly said on social media that a Houston Islamic center should burn down. Dustin Herron allegedly wrote online about a fire that took place at Quba Islamic Institute last week, liberal website The Daily Kos reported on Friday. According to the website, Herron wrote on social media 'Let it burn...block the fire hydrant' but Daily Mail Online could not confirm the authenticity of the post. The Daily Kos reported that Herron is a Crystal Beach Volunteer Fire Department (CBVFD) volunteer. A LinkedIn profile lists a man of the same name as working for the fire department and Herron's own Facebook profile features him in front of a fire truck dressed in overalls. Scroll down for video . Online activity: Dustin Herron, pictured, allegedly wrote online 'Let it burn...block the fire hydrant' regarding the Quba Islamic Institute, which suffered a fire on Friday . Uproar: Herron allegedly posted this message on social media. Daily Mail Online could not independently confirm the authenticity of the post . Ahsan Zahid, 25, is near the wreckage  at the Quba Islamic Institute in Houston, Texas on Friday . The fire, which completely destroyed the contents of a storage shed, is thought to have been an arson and may be investigated as a hate crime . However, CBVFD said in a statement sent to Daily Mail Online early Monday that Herron is not affiliated with the organization whatsoever. The statement said 'There have been recent post on social media from someone stating they are a member of our Fire Department and have posted hate messages against the Islamic Community. 'Please know that this person, Dustin Herron, is not a member of the Crystal Beach Volunteer Fire Dept; nor has he ever been a member of our fire department. 'We are in the process of trying to track down Mr. Herron regarding the comments he made. We have also notified the Galveston County Sheriff Dept. regarding Mr Herron falsely stating he is a fire fighter within our organization. 'We have received many e-mails regarding his recent social media post and comments. 'Please know that our Volunteer's give 100% effort 100% of the time.' One tweet against Herron asked him 'why the hate? Serve and protect? Or just hate?' Another said 'you are an embarrassment to all public safety officials and volunteers, what you posted about the Islamic center is shameful!' Both Herron and a spokesman for the Galveston County Sheriff's Office (GCSO) did not immediately return requests for comment early Monday from Daily Mail Online. Authorities said that someone used an accelerant in the 5am Friday blaze at the Quba Islamic Institute, according to one of the imam's sons, 25-year-old Ahsan Zahid. Mr Zahid said that an investigator told him that the incident was a suspected arson, and that the fire was not an accident. On Friday, the Houston Fire Department (HFD) said in a release it was investigating and could not yet name the cause of the fire at Quba Islamic Institute. HFD spokespeople did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment from Daily Mail Online early Monday. The FBI said Saturday that they are monitoring the situation and could take a more active role in the investigation, according to Reuters. The Council on American Islamic Relations's Texas office has called for possible hate crime motivations to be looked at in the investigation. Federal agencies are expected to become more involved if that is the case. No injuries were reported in the fire, which largely took place in a storage building and is thought to have caused $100,000 in damage. Authorities said the blaze started at 5am and caused an expected $100,000 worth of damage before firefighters were able to put it out, according to one of the imam's sons, 25-year-old Ahsan Zahid . The Houston Fire Department is still investigating the cause of the fire, though they reportedly told Mr Zahid that it did not start by accident . The contents of the building, which housed the institute's computers, lights and equipment for a renovation, were completely destroyed. The center has a place to pray, holds community events, offers Arabic classes and also runs a Sunday School. The Quba Islamic Institute is asking for donations through their website qubahouston.org, and Zahid told Daily Mail Online that they had raised $2,500 as of Saturday afternoon. The institute said a man had driven past the institute and mockingly yelled 'Allah' on Thursday. A man with a covered face was chased away from the building earlier in the week. The Muslim center had been scheduled to host a talk by a former Guantanamo Bay guard who converted to Islam after the experience, Terry Holdbrooks, on Friday night. Zahid said that the event took place despite the fire and that 'all programs, activities, and prayers have, and will continue as scheduled'. The institute's Facebook page has also come under attack from posters who have insulted Islam repeatedly on posts where the center is explaining what happened in the fire. The Islamic Institute used its Facebook page to reach out for donations and ask for tolerance in the wake of the fire, but their posts soon saw an influx of anti-Muslim commenters . Two suspicious incidents happened in the week leading up to the fire, including a man with a covered face who had to be chased away from the building . The center's Facebook account responded to abuse on Facebook by thanking offensive users for their perspective . The institute has defended itself against the Islamophobic posts by thanking the users for their perspective and urging tolerance. The possible hate crime follows on the death of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that federal investigators are looking into for motives of religious hatred. Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were buried Thursday. Texas has the US's eighth-largest population of Muslims, according to the Texas State Historical Association . The annual Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin was targeted by anti-Islam protesters last month, the Los Angeles Times reported.

"It's been described as a 'suicidal mission' that is doomed to fail. Despite this, the Mars One project - which aims to send people to live on the red planet - has whittled down its shortlist of candidates from more than 200,000 to just 100. From this, a final crew of four will eventually be selected for a 'one-way ticket' to the red planet scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a grueling seven-month journey from Earth. Scroll down for video . It's been described as a 'suicidal mission'. Despite this, the Mars One project - which aims to send people to live on the red planet - has whittled down its shortlist of candidates from more than 200,000 to just 100. Pictured is an artist's impression of what a colony on Mars could look like . 'The large cut in candidates is an important step towards finding out who has the right stuff to go to Mars,' said Bas Lansdorp, co-founder of the Dutch Mars One mission. 'These aspiring Martians provide the world with a glimpse into who the modern day explorers will be.' The Mars 100 Round Three candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews. They include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round. The majority of the 100 applicants  come from the US, 31 come from Europe, 16 from Asia, seven from Africa and seven from Australia. The full list can be viewed here. Hannah Earnshaw, 23, a PhD student in astronomy at Durham University, is among the hopefuls. The Mars One project plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as soon as October 2016. A 'settlement rover' will then land in 2018. The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips 'much safer than moon missions'. The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade. Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days. She said: 'Human space exploration has always interested me so the opportunity to be one of the people involved was really appealing. The future of humanity is in space. 'My family is pretty thrilled. They're really happy for me. Obviously it's going to be challenging, leaving Earth and not coming back. I've had support from my friends and family and we can still communicate via the internet.' Additional teams would join the settlement every two years, with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on Mars. There, they will collect data, plant oxygen-producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation. In spite of the risks, more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the Netherlands-based group called for volunteers to join the mission. Hannah Earnshaw (left) is one five Britons who have been shortlisted for a one-way trip to Mars in 2025 . In the next stage, which may involve 'rigorous, potentially televised competitions', the current shortlist will be reduced to 40. The time frame for this next stage depends on how long it takes the team to sort through the 100 on the list. Candidates that were not selected will have a chance to re-apply in a new application round that will open in 2015. Chris Hadfield, former commander of the ISS, recently told Elmo Keep, writing in Medium that the mission may not deliver on this promise. 'There's a great, I don't know, self-defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up,' Hadfield told Medium. 'I fear that it's going to be a little disillusioning for people, because it's presented as if for sure it's going to happen.' Chris Hadfield, former commander of the ISS, recently said that the mission may not deliver on this promise. 'There's a great, I don't know, self-defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up,' he warned . Endemol, the production company behind Big Brother, said earlier last year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet. Candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice. Any chosen Mars settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million-mile (482 million km) pioneering mission. Igore Mitrofanov of the Space Research Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences told the Voice of Russia that the largest risk is the huge amounts of radiation the volunteers will receive. A Demonstration Mission will be launched to Mars in 2018 using a probe (artist's impression pictured). This will provide proof of concept for some of the technologies that are important for a human mission . Echoing Mr Hadfield's concerns, he said he doubts that the volunteers for this trip know enough science and technology to take the risk. The group had promised on its site that in 1,000 years, everyone on Earth will remember who the first humans on Mars were. A robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018, followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022. The next round will include an interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another. The third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and could broadcast on television and online. But Mr Hadfield claims Mars should not be a target for colonisation at this point, but targets much closer need to be considered.

"In a tiny village on a hilltop in India, Aarti Bhatt is sitting with a group of women taking lessons on menstrual hygiene. The 21-year-old gasps with disbelief when she learns that touching pickle when she is on her periods will not turn it rotten - and that cooking will not poison the food. But Aarti has grown up with these myths since she first started her periods seven years ago. Scroll down for video . Shilpi Bhatt, 15, (left), and Radha Maqlogha, 25, (right), pictured after attending a gathering of women aimed at debunking the myths they are fed about their menstrual cycle at a remote village in Rishikesh, India . A woman cuts pieces of recycled cloth ready to be folded and used as sanitary napkins at the Goonj NGO . Left to right: Deepa Dangwal, 28, Meena Bharti, 26, Arti Bhatt, 21, and Shivani Negi, 19, pose with the home-made sanitary napkins they received  after attending a Goonj workshop . Shockingly, for many rural women in India they are told not to touch pickle, water plants, wear white clothes, enter the kitchen or temple, do any exercise or even speak the word 'period' when they're having their time of the month. Periods or the natural menstrual cycle are seen as a deeply rooted taboo and this has fueled an innumerable amount of restrictive myths. But the humiliation is worse for women like Aarti, from Baiyal village near Rishikesh in the state of Uttarakhand, northern India, where the menstruation restrictions are even more severe because their communities are so remote from modern life. Here, women are not allowed to even touch other women, not even their mother or sisters, because they're told their touch will infect them. Coming into contact with the opposite sex is completely forbidden as they're told it might make the men sick. Aarti said: 'When I first had my periods I was 14. It was naturally a very traumatic experience but before I could accept the change in my body I was blitzed with endless restrictions. 'The most baffling ones were the restriction into the kitchen and temple as I was suddenly ""impure"" and ""polluted"". 'My aunt said I was an impure thing and that I should restrict my movement to my home for the full four days and only after can I go about my normal life again.' Unfortunately, the myths related to periods are so deeply ingrained in the minds of village women that many accept them without any question. One 21-year-old at this gathering in the remote village gasped with disbelief when she learned that touching pickle when she is on her periods will not turn it rotten and cooking will not poison the food . Women pack the finished sanitary napkins in brightly coloured bags at one of the Goonj workshops in Delhi . Goonj sends the napkins out across rural India and organises campaigns and talks  on menstrual hygiene . Deepa Dangwal, 28, at a meeting aimed at tackling the deeply rooted taboo around the menstrual cycle which has fueled an innumerable amount of restrictive myths for women in rural India . 'My mother said if I entered a temple during my periods I will pollute it and anger Gods who will punish me severely. I was terrified,' says nine-year-old Shivani Negi. 'My friends in school also go through the same agony. We are prohibited from entering kitchens or eating with others, we cannot touch plants either. 'It is said plants would dry up and die if we touch them. We cannot attend functions or religious festivals as we will make the occasion impure. 'It is so humiliating and I hate having to go through it every month. But mother says it is our tradition and we should follow the rules.' Even though these girls accept these myths and restrictions they are also left with minimal aid to stay to clean. Many do not have any access to sanitary towels. But a Delhi based non-government organisation called Goonj is changing all that. They're working to break the myths and educate women by organising campaigns and talks around the country on menstrual hygiene and providing sanitary towels made from recycled clothes in their workshops in the capital city. Anshu Gupta is the founder of Goonj, which means 'a voice', and feels the myths around women's monthly cycles in India are due to lack of basic education. He said: 'In India people treat periods as a shameful thing. Women try to hide it. They never talk about it openly. 'They are so ashamed of their periods that they even wash or dry clothes in secret, putting the strained cloth under another piece of cloth because they are embarrassed. A group of women take a break from making sanitary napkins. They are a godsend for many women . The napkins are vital for thousands of women who have no access to sanitary items during menstruation . Goonj, which means 'a voice', offers a lifeline to women who feel unable to talk openly about menstruation . Recycled clothes are dried up on the terrace and then brought down using a simple pulley system and later cut to a specific size and folded before they are then distributed to be used as sanitary napkins . Rishikesh is in the state of Uttarakhand in northern India. Many of the surrounding rural areas are remote . 'Many are always battling infections and womanly problems. 'We need to break the silence and talk so that these women understand it's the most natural thing in the world.' In India 70 per cent of women do not have access to safe and hygienic sanitary towels. Goonj is trying to help them with cheap sanitary towels made from recycled cloths and teaching them the importance of hygiene. It is during one such campaign organised in Baiyal that Goonj worker Priyanka Pahwa, 25, tried to dispel the myth of rotting pickle. Priyanka said: 'During our campaigns we have met women who are completely clueless about menstrual hygiene. 'They feel ""dirty"" and do not bother keeping themselves clean. They mostly use old and dirty rags or stuff sand into pieces of cloth instead of sanitary pads because of lack of money. 'Even washing and drying of sanitary clothes are all done in secret and are rarely properly dried in sunlight because of the shame, resulting in even more health problems.' These campaigns, though gradual, are encouraging young girls like Aarti and Shivani to break the myths and build their self worth and confidence. 'I will tell my school friends what I've learnt. I will spread the word. I wish we could all stop following traditions and talk more openly about periods. 'Rather than myths, we should be taught about our bodies and hygiene,' Shivani said.","In remote areas many women are told they are dirty and polluted on period .
Menstruation taboo means many believe they must not touch other women .

"A widow has received flowers from her late husband from beyond the grave - after he arranged for her to receive a Valentine's Day bouquet every year for the rest of her life. Shelly Golay, 52, from Casper, Wyoming, said she was stunned when flowers were arrived from her husband of 28 years, Jim, who passed away last June after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. 'Happy Valentine's Day Honey. Stay Strong! Yours Forever, Love Jim,' read a note with the flowers. Certain their children had sent the bouquet, she only learned the truth when she called the florist. Scroll down for video . Missed: Shelly Golay, pictured, was shocked when she received Valentine's Day flowers from her husband Jim, right, who passed away from brain cancer last summer .

'Until the day I die I'll get Valentine's flowers on Valentine's Day and that's just a testament of his love all over again,' she told KCWY. 'He's such an amazing man and he is just can love beyond boundaries, there is no boundaries with him. Even in death, he's just amazing.' Jim Golay, who was just 53 when he passed away, had contacted the florist to set up the gift after he was diagnosed with glioblastoma last February. Florist Jessie Row explained that he requested that every Valentine's Day his wife receives some of her favorite flowers, including assorted roses. Mrs Golay received the flowers two days before Valentine's Day and called Row. 'We all started almost bawling,' Row said. 'It was really touching to hear the story and know that he had done that for her. It seems like something that only happens in the movies or that you hear about.' Loved: She said that the gesture showed that her amazing husband could love 'beyond boundaries' Shelly said she plans to preserve the flowers from her husband to remember this Valentine's Day. The couple married in 1986 and went on to have a daughter Ashley, now 28, and son Colton, 25. The couple ran Rocky Mountain Industrial Supply together.

"It may have seemed that Mr Spock’s Tricorder would remain firmly in science fiction. But a gadget that can be used to diagnose an illness simply by holding it to the forehead, is now in the hands of consumers. Named Scanadu Scout, the small round device is able to read a number of vital signs, including heart rate and temperature. Scanadu Scout is a small round device that is able to read five vital signs, including heart rate and temperature. Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds. Most importantly, it is designed so that it doesn't need to be used by doctors . First unveiled at CES last year, the Silicon Valley-based firm behind Scanadu  won funding on crowdfunding site Kickstarter and the first batch of  devices were shipped in January. It contains a variety of different sensors alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget that together, can read vital signs, including body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen level, heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time (PWTT). PWTT is the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person’s body and is related to blood pressure. The Tricorder was used by Mr Spock (pictured) in Star Trek to wirelessly scanned a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission, to assess an individual’s medical status, and allow him to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination . The Scanadu Scout contains a variety of different sensors alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget that can read five vital signs, including heart rate, body temperature, ECG and more (shown above) A Tricorder is a scanning device used by Starfleet personnel in the Star Trek universe. There are two variations; a regular (engineering) Tricorder and a medical Tricorder. Medical Tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission. The scanning tool can determine a patient’s medical status, and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination. The company's website said: 'As if it is reading your mind, the Scanadu Scout provides valuable data about your body. All that information just by placing it on your forehead.' Its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds. Medical data is stored on a smartphone app that patients can use to monitor their health, or can be shared with doctors . The device uses a micro-USB adapter that can be hooked into a USB port, and it takes less than an hour to charge the battery. When it is being used a few times every day, the battery lasts for about a week, the firm says. Walter De Brouwer, a Belgian entrepreneur based at Nasa’s Ames Research Centre in California, who is behind the device, was inspired by Dr Spock’s Tricorder. ‘Star Trek was more than just a movie, it was a business plan,’ he told CNN’s Nick Glass. The Tricorder was used by the doctor in Star Trek to wirelessly scan a patient, either in a ‘sick bay’ on a star ship or during an away mission, to assess an individual’s medical status, and allow him to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasive examination. First unveiled at CES last year, the Silicon Valley based firm behind Scanadu won funding on crowd funding site Kickstarter and the first batch of devices were shipped in January. Users must hold the device against their forehead to take readings . However, Scanadu was designed to be used by non-medical professionals. De Brouwer said: ‘We've medicalised your smartphone. You can now check your health as easily as your email. ‘People will no longer ask if there's a doctor on the plane, but if there's a Tricorder.’ The device is not yet able to be purchased and is pending FDA approval, but  some people who obtained the device via Kickstarter have taken to Twitter to share their thoughts. Scanadu is a finalist in the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases, like a Star Trek Tricorder (pictured) David Sammuels MD tweeted: ‘It's finally here. @scanadu scout. Easy to use. Accurate readings of EKG HR SaO2 temp and BP. #mHealth #cdom’ Scanadu is also working on another device called Scanaflo – a urine test that could be used at home. But De Brouver thinks in just a decade from now, we will be using silicon lasers to diagnose ailments so that medical data could be taken simply by passing through a beam. Scanadu is a finalist in the Qualcomm Tricorder X Prize, which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases, including anaemia, tuberculosis and diabetes. According to the rules, finalists must demonstrate their devices on humans this year and three winners will be announced in 2016, with a top prize of £4.3 million ($7 million). To win the cash prize, the device has to monitor vital signs as well as diagnose 16 different conditions. Another device by London-based, ScanNurse, uses computer-vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera. The scientists hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat, say – in the same way a doctor would – and then feed it into a computer for analysis. Other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers. The tiny microfluidic devices will, they claim, work in a similar way to hospital-lab tests. DMI, for instance, has teamed teamed up with Nasa to create a device that astronauts could use to monitor their health on long trips and in zero gravity. Doctors and medical engineers point out that much of the technology is already proven available to use separately. For instance, light sensors can now track blow flow and oxygen levels within the human body. Other sensors can be used to detect gases in breath that may indicate certain diseases. Team Aezon are the youngest team competing for the Qualcomm Tricorder XPrize. Aezon's solution is a monitoring device (pictured) designed to gather five different vital signs at once, to be worn around the neck .","Device is able to read  vital signs when it is held to the forehead .

"Dressed in orange jumpsuits, a group of young children are locked in a cage in a chilling recreation of the ISIS video showing a Jordanian pilot being burned alive. Nearby, a man holds a flaming torch like the one used to set fire to Lt Moaz al-Kasasbeh in scenes that have horrified the world. Thankfully, this was just a stunt by activists calling for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's alleged atrocities to be likened to those meted out by the jihadists. Scroll down for video . Hard-hitting protest: An activist  holds a burning torch near a group of young children who are locked in a cage in a chilling recreation of the ISIS video which showed a Jordanian pilot being burned alive . Chilling echo of pilot's gruesome death: The stunt was set up by activists calling for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's alleged atrocities to be likened to those meted out by the jihadists . Inside the cage, the children, some of whom appear to be as young as three, carry banners reading: 'Stop the killing of children'. The protest, held in Douma, near Damascus, aims to draw attention to Syrians living under siege and dying from air strikes by forces loyal to Assad. It also condemned the lack of international action compared to that given to the fight against ISIS. It comes after more than 180 people - 55 of them women and children - were killed in Douma in the first ten days of this month by regime air strikes, according to British-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Syrian rebel groups vowed over the weekend to retaliate by stepping up rocket attacks against regime-held areas. Speaking in a rare interview last week, Assad denied using barrel bombs against his own people - something human rights groups have accused him of doing throughout the four-year civil war. The defiant tyrant has always denied claims of such atrocities, including allegations that chemical weapons were used in an attack outside the capital in 2013 that killed up to 1,400 people. The children, some of whom were as young as three, held banners reading: 'Stop the killing of children' The protest, held in Douma, near Damascus, aims to draw attention to Syrians living under siege and dying from air strikes by forces loyal to Assad . SOHR said yesterday that heavy fighting in southern Syria has killed scores of pro-government and insurgent fighters in the past week, forecasting even fiercer violence as the weather clears. Syria's army and allied combatants from Lebanon's Hezbollah launched a large-scale offensive in the region last week against insurgent groups, including al Qaeda's Syria wing Nusra Front and non-jihadist rebels. Southern Syria is one of the last areas where mainstream rebels opposing President Assad have a foothold. They have lost ground to hardline Islamist militants in the four-year conflict. More than 50 rebels have been killed in the fighting, the head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Rami Abdulrahman said 43 members of the Syrian army and allied groups had also died, including 12 officers. 'Now the weather is better there will be Syrian air strikes. With the air strikes they will move forward,' he said. The protest echoed the brutal death of Lt Moaz al-Kasasbeh (above) in a ISIS video released earlier this month . Barbaric: An ISIS extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26-year-old stands . State news agency SANA said Syrian forces had inflicted 'heavy losses' on 'terrorist groups' in Deraa on Sunday after killing many enemy fighters and destroying their vehicles the previous day. Syrian officials were not immediately available for comment on Sunday. State media and Hezbollah's al-Manar channel have carried regular reports on the fighting in the south. Abdulrahman, who tracks the war using sources on the ground, said around 5,000 pro-government troops were taking part in the offensive, which aims to take a triangle of rebel-held land from rural areas southwest of Damascus to Deraa city to Quneitra. Sources on both sides of the battlefront have said the offensive aims to shield Damascus, the capital, which is a short drive to the north. Carnage: Syrians inspect a site hit by what activists said were airstrikes by forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad in the Douma district of Damascus as the President insisted his army were not indiscriminately killing civilians . Obliterated: Assad denied that the army was using makeshift barrel bombs - crude barrels packed with explosives and shrapnel that are generally dropped by helicopter . An injured civilian sits inside a shelter as he waits to receive medical assistance after airstrikes on the capital . The insurgents made significant gains in the south in recent months, taking several army bases. 'The situation remains hit-and-run between us and regime forces,' said Abu Gaiath, a spokesman for the rebel Alwiyat Seif al-Sham group. Its fighters are part of the 'Southern Front' rebel alliance that has had support from states opposed to Assad. Speaking via the Internet from inside Syria, he said fighting had calmed in the past two days but the military was aiming to encircle a village northeast of Quneitra and had captured towns and villages south of Damascus. The Observatory's Abdulrahman said 10 fighters on the government side had been executed after being accused of passing information to the enemy. He also said Nusra Front fighters had been killed in battle but exact numbers were not known. Winter weather had curtailed fighting in the past few days and prevented air strikes, one of the army's most potent weapons against insurgents. Abdulrahman said the army and allied groups planned to involve 10,000 fighters in the offensive. 'Who threw that gas on who?' President Assad also denied claims that Syria's government had used chemical weapons against its own people in August 2013 in an attack outside the capital that killed up to 1,400 people .","Children as young as three dressed in orange jumpsuits and put in a cage .

"A man who had sex with a dolphin at an amusement park in the 1970s has caused shock on an Australian airwaves after revealing he tried to have sex with the family dog in his teens. Malcolm Brenner, 63, claims that he fell for Dolly, a bottlenose dolphin who lived at the now-defunct Floridaland theme park in Sarasota, after her amorous advances. Appearing on the KIIS FM breakfast show with Kyle and Jackie O, Brenner spoke of being seduced by Dolly and shared the story of their year-long affair relationship. 'I knew I had a sexual attraction towards other species and I didn't want to indulge it on the dolphin,' Brenner said. 'So I was resisting her for the first several months but she was persistent.' Dolphin Lover: Malcolm Brenner, (left in 2014 and right in 1971 with Dolly) has admitted pursuing a sexual relationship with a bottlenose dolphin in 1970s Florida . Appearing on the KIIS FM breakfast show with Kyle and Jackie O, Brenner spoke of being seduced by Dolly . But Jackie O hit back, saying what he did was considered 'bestiality, 'it's wrong' and 'illegal'. 'Wrong in whose definition of it?' Brenner responded. Jackie O continued and slammed Brenner's sexual encounter with Dolly was 'not right' but the pair were curious to find out what other species he was attracted to. 'I have had some experiences with the family dog when I was an adolescent,' Brenner said. Curious Jackie O asked: 'What did you do?' Brenner responded: 'I tried to have intercourse with it and it wasn't successful so I dropped that.' But before Kyle and Jackie O could continue to bombard their questions, the interview was abruptly 'dumped' by the radio's censor. 'This station you've been listening to has been dumped. This means someone said something inappropriate and is currently getting in trouble,' the radio said. 'I started rubbing her': In new film, Dolphin Lover, which premiered this week, Brenner discusses his taboo relationship . Sneaking off: Brenner has previously described how he was trusted to be alone with the dolphins, and waited until after nightfall to have sex with Dolly . It follows after a new film based on Brenner's love affair, Dolphin Love which was premiered in January at the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Slamdance, which takes place at the same time as the more famous Sundance film festival, is seen as its edgier alternative and hosts more niche films. In the fifteen-minute video, Brenner tells the cameras: 'I started rubbing her along her back, working my way to her flukes – her tail. 'And as I was rubbing her and moving my hand towards her tail, Dolly was slowly rolling around her long axis.' According to Fusion, Brenner went on to describe the sex in even more detail, while an 'animated interpretation' of the encounter was played. In previous interviews about this encounter, which he also turned into a novel called Wet Goddess, Brenner has claimed the relationship was consensual. The relationship reportedly lasted a year. Last year he told Britain's Daily Mirror: 'There's something quite transcendental about making love with a dolphin. 'The dolphin is very aware, the dolphin is an intelligent and creative creature and making love is a consummate act.' He added that their courtship began when Dolly 'announced her intentions to me by positioning herself so I was rubbing against her.' He then detailed how he was often left alone with Dolly and the other dolphins, whom he was photographing at the time. This allowed him to sneak off with her after closing time to have sex. In another interview, Brenner said: 'It's like being with a tiger or a bear. This is an animal that could kill you in two seconds if it wanted to.' Performer: Dolly, pictured above during a show, lived at the Flordialand theme park in Sarasota . Defunct: The park no longer exists, but used to offer sealife shows, as well as steamboat trips such as the one shown above . According to Brenner's blog, the screening of the film was 'well-received' by its initial audience, and nobody walked out. In a personal verdict on the film, he describes the sex animation as 'beautiful'. He also says it is 'oddly accurate, without being graphic or vulgar.' He also reveals that some animators turned down the project once they discovered the controversial content of the film. Brenner's acts would be illegal today. But Florida only enacted a law banning bestiality in 2011, so the encounter he described in 1971 would not be covered. Filmmakers Kareem Tabsch and Joey Daoud have defended their film's content, say that Brenner's experience is 'unique' and an 'appealing' subject for a documentary. They told the Miami New Times: 'However uncomfortable it can be as a subject matter, what Malcolm experienced is unique and very real and very serious to him. 'He is a member of a community (zoophiles) who live on the outermost fringes of society. 'Their reality is something most of us can not comprehend, relate to or know much about- all of that makes it all the more appealing to me as a subject to tackle.' While Brenner's experience is undoubtedly out of the ordinary, there are other recorded incidents of dolphins having sex with humans - or at least trying to. One well-documented case involves a female scientist who started having sex with a dolphin in the 1960s as part of a Nasa experiment to try to teach the creatures to speak English. Margaret Howe Lovatt was stationed in a flooded house in the U.S. Virgin Isles in 1963, where she was tasked with trying to teach an adolescent dolphin called Peter. 'Precious and gentle': Margaret Howe Lovatt, who had sex with a dolphin called Peter, above, in 1963, has also opened up about her relationship . At first she let Peter relieve his urges with female dolphins kept nearby - but later claimed it helped the experiment to let him have sex with her, instead. In a BBC film about the relationship, she said: 'Peter liked to be... with me. He would rub himself on my knee, my foot or my hand and I allowed that. 'I wasn't uncomfortable - as long as it wasn't too rough... It was just easier to incorporate that and let it happen, it was very precious and very gentle, Peter was right there, he knew that I was right there.' 'It was sexual on his part - it was not sexual on mine, sensuous perhaps... I was there to get to know Peter, that was part of Peter.' Dolphins also often target their advances on humans who have no interest in reciprocating. Several tourists at dolphin swimming events have been leaped on and mounted by aroused dolphins, often to the amusement of onlookers, whose videos of the events have gained significant attention. However, the dangers of an advance can in some situations be very real, given the strength and size of dolphins, who often weigh more than 400lbs. In 2002, swimmers on the English coast were warned of a dolphin which tried to attack a series of female swimmers in the sea by encircling them and isolating them from their companions.","Malcolm Brenner, 63, pursued relationship with bottlenose Dolly in 1971 .

"As a little girl, Merryl Tengesdal dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Although she never got the chance to suit up for NASA, flying at 70,000 feet in the cockpit of a U-2 spy plane, Tengesdal has come closer to the edge of the Earth's atmosphere than most people ever will. Tengesdal is only one of eight female U- pilots, and she holds the distinction of being the only African-American female pilot in the history of the high-altitude recon aircraft program, which celebrates its 50th anniversary next August. Trailblazer: Lt. Col. Merryl Tengesdal, 9th Reconnaissance Wing inspector general and U-2 Dragon Lady pilot, in front of a U-2 Feb. 9, 2015, at Beale Air Force Base, California. Tengesdal is the only black female U-2 pilot in history . Recently, the trailblazing Air Force officer has been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. ‘I feel like I've made it to the top. Being an astronaut would be the cream. But I've got the whole cake and everything. I'm good,’ Tengesdal tells NBC. Merryl Tengesdal started her career as a US Navy helicopter pilot before making the transition to the US Air Force in 2004. Over the past decade, she has logged 3,400 flight hours, 330 combat hours and served missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa, according to theUS Department of Defense. But one of her most memorable moments at the controls of her U-2 plane, affectionately nicknamed the Dragon Lady, happened stateside. A couple of years ago, Tengesdal was flying over Los Angeles when she saw a shooting star blazing across the night sky at eye level. Tengesdal says for kids growing up in the US today, the sky is the limit, and all they have to do is shoot for those stars. American hero: Tengesdal has logged 3,400 flight hours, 330 combat hours and served missions in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa . Aspiring astronaut: As a little girl, Tengesdal dreamed of joining NASA. Instead, she became a high-altitude U-2 pilot flying at altitudes of 13 miles above the Earth's surface . One giant leap for mankind: Tengesdal and her fellow U-2 pilots are required to wear full pressure suits and special helmets – not unlike NASA astronauts’ gear - and are allowed to fly only once every three days . ‘Think of how far you can go, because you can reach those. Because in America, we can pretty much do anything,’ she says. Tengesdal knows first-hand how difficult it can be to rise about one's humble circumstances. The pioneering Air Force pilot grew up in a drug-ridden part of The Bronx, but she was fortunate enough to have a strong support system, including her mother and teachers, who steered her clear of trouble. In school, Tengesdal excelled in math and was obsessed with Star Trek. In 1994, she graduated from the University of New Heaven with a degree in engineering and then enrolled in the Navy's Officer Candidate School, followed by a stint at flight training. Her first aircraft was Navy's Seahawk helicopter, but Tengesdal yearned to fly higher and challenge herself, and so she joined an elite force of less than 1,000 U-2 pilots after undergoing a rigorous nine-month training program. Career switch: Tengesdal got her start in 1994 as a US Navy helicopter pilot. A decade later, she transitioned to the Air Force, joining the elite U-2 program . Soaring at altitudes of about 13 miles above the Earth's surface, Tengesdal and her fellow U-2 pilots are required to wear full pressure suits and special helmets – not unlike NASA astronauts’ gear - and are allowed to fly only once every three days. ‘It is very uncommon, even for this day and age, to be a female pilot, much less a female minority,’ Tengesdal says. ‘My career field is very male dominated, but I hope I have helped other females with similar aspirations to realize this is an option. I think we are all limitless as to what we can accomplish.’","Lt Colonel Merryl Tengesdal joined the elite U-2 program in 2004 .

"Alex Breier, 41, was jailed for five years and 10 months after he admitted trafficking young women into the UK to work as sex slaves in brothels . A Hungarian family has been jailed after they trafficked vulnerable girls to Britain and forced them to work as sex slaves for three years. Alex Breier, 41, arranged for three girls to be brought to the UK and forced them to upload their images to a website for men to choose which one they wanted to abuse, a court heard. With the help from his wife, sister, son-in-law and even his own son and daughter, he operated from brothels in Manchester, Bolton and across the North West of England. Bolton Crown Court was told that it as only after one of the victims had enough courage to contact police that the family was tracked down and arrested. Brier admitted six charges - three of trafficking women into the UK and three within the UK for the purposes of prostitution and was jailed for five years and 10 months. The woman that exposed the prostitution ring was just 18 when she was brought to the UK in 2012 and had an unsettled upbringing in her native Hungary. She was forced into sexual servitude aged just 15 and was beaten by pimps, who told her she would not get food and could not leave unless she worked as a prostitute. It was here she was introduced to Breier, who flew her to Holland where the family forced her into sex work controlled through threats, fear and violence. She later told police how she was forced to work as a prostitute in Germany, Holland and also Belgium and felt powerless to run away. In 2012, she and a second girl, 19, were brought by ferry to the UK and then into Manchester. Over a period of 15 months, they were taken to numerous places in Greater Manchester and Lancashire owned by different members of the Breier family where they were forced to work as prostitutes with a third young woman, aged 18. They worked across Manchester and in many houses including family-owned properties in Bolton and Blackburn. All three girls were under the control of the family and were forced to upload their pictures to a website from which 'customers' could choose which girl they wanted. Bolton Crown Court (pictured) heard that it was only after one victim had enough courage to come forward that police tracked the family down and arrested them. These men were then given a specific address to visit where they would be shown in through a secluded entrance and taken upstairs and paid the Breier family cash in return for sex. The girls rarely saw any of the money they worked for and only received basic food, shelter and cannabis. When Alex Breier assaulted one girl in March 2014, she confided in a friend who convinced her to go to police. A series of co-ordinated warrants took place that month, during which various members of the Breier family were rounded up and arrested. Det Chief Insp Rick Jackson, based at Bolton, said: 'I want to paint a damning picture of exactly what Alex Breier is really like. For three years he forced women into a penniless life of sexual slavery and servitude. 'He would beat these women if they did not obey him, controlling them physically and psychologically to the point where they felt powerless to free themselves from his violent grip. 'It is that power, that control, that makes it possible for young women to be trafficked into the UK and prostituted against their will. 'One incident really sticks in my mind. At one point, Breier told the girls he would report them to police for working as a prostitute if they did not obey him. 'It may seem astonishing but such was their fear and insecurity that this ""threat"" had the desired effect. 'What makes this even more galling is that the entire family conspired together to control the lives of these girls. Breier was helped by his wife, sister, son-in-law and even his own son and daughter. Pictured is Fecitt Brown in Blackburn, where his son Kristian ran one of the brothels . 'I can't begin to imagine what a nightmare existence they lived through, virtually destitute, repeatedly beaten and living day-to-day in fear. 'However, eventually one of the girls had the courage to speak up and as a result, police in Bolton, assisted by numerous agencies across Europe, have exposed this family for who they really are. 'I would like to personally commend her for her bravery after years of living in fear. Her bravery cannot be overstated.' He added:  'This was an extremely complex investigation which took us all over Europe and brought together the National Crime Agency, the National Referral Mechanism Human Trafficking Europol and enforcement agencies in Germany, Holland and Belgium. 'Those involved in human trafficking often use multiple locations to avoid detection, but thanks to the dedication and sheer tenacity of the officers involved, this family has been brought to justice. 'I want to assure people living in Bolton, and the wider communities of Manchester, that there is nothing we won't do to bring human traffickers to justice. 'There is no stone we won't overturn and no country we won't go to expose these people for who they are: shameless cowards who profit by selling women into sex against their will. 'Tackling people trafficking is an absolute priority for police across Greater Manchester and right here in Bolton and we will continue to combine the efforts of partner agencies across the globe toward tackling this issue.' Breier's wife Alexne Breier, 43, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to keep a brothel used for prostitution. She was given a nine month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. Their son Kristian Breier, 22, of  Blackburn, pleaded guilty to the same charge as his mother and was also given a nine month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. Breier's sister, Katalin Bogdan, 39,  of  Bolton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to keep a brothel used for prostitution. She was given a conditional discharge for 12 months. Ferenci Baranyai, 32, partner of Katalin Bogdan, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to keep a brothel used for prostitution and was given a conditional discharge for 12 months. Breier's daughter, Csabane Androvics, 24, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to keep a brothel used for prostitution and was given a six month sentence suspended for 12 months.","Alex Breier, 41, arranged for girls to be brought to UK to work in brothels .

"More than 13million families are each losing £200 a year because they are on rip-off variable rate energy tariffs, it is revealed today. The total extra cost of these deals to families is an astonishing £2.7billion a year. Some 60 per cent of customers with the Big Six firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, EDF, E.ON and Scottish Power – are on standard variable tariffs, for which tiny price cuts have been announced in recent weeks. Some 60 per cent of customers with the Big Six firms – British Gas, SSE, Npower, EDF, E.ON and Scottish Power – are on standard variable tariffs . But industry experts say that, even after the cuts, these tariffs are £200 to £250 a year more expensive than fixed rate deals available from the Big Six and smaller rivals. And the households on these tariffs tend to be those who have been with their supplier for many years – meaning they are being penalised for their loyalty. The details are revealed as an inquiry by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is this week expected to reveal a culture of exploitation by the Big Six firms, which are accused of failing to pass on huge falls in the wholesale cost of gas and electricity in the past year. The £2.7billion rip-off has been estimated by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, which is today launching a 'Power to Switch' campaign to encourage people to escape these expensive tariffs. More than 13million families are each losing £200 a year because they are on rip-off variable rate energy tariffs . The campaign is being backed by Martin Lewis, of financial advice website MoneySavingExpert, who said people need to wake up to the 'ugly truth' about the standard tariffs. 'We need to shout loud about the benefits of switching tariff,' he said. 'Too many people think energy firms are all the same. That's far from true, there are huge differences on both price and customer service. The easiest way to switch is to use one of 13 price comparison websites accredited by the industry regulator Ofgem. It is possible to agree to switch in as little as five clicks on these sites. You will need your 'annual summary', a document sent by energy firms to all customers, which includes key facts about your tariff, such as energy use over the previous 12 months in kilowatt-hours. The switching website will ask for your current supplier and tariff, annual usage, preferred payment method and postcode. It will then show two lists of tariffs that are cheaper, highlighting the potential annual saving. The first list will be for suppliers where the comparison website can begin the switch immediately. The second list will be for the entire industry, including firms you will need to contact directly. More information on how to switch is available at www.BeAnEnergyShopper.com or by calling the Energy Saving Advice Service on 0300 123 1234. 'The worry is that news of recent price cuts, even though they were paltry, will have given many false confidence that they're on a decent deal. 'Examine the figures and the ugly truth is very different. 'Even after price cuts, someone on a Big Six supplier standard tariff with typical use will pay £1,158 a year, whereas switch to the cheapest tariff and they'd pay just over £900 a year.' Trade association Energy UK, which represents the suppliers, said: 'New, cheaper tariffs are being launched every week, meaning that customers could save hundreds of pounds on their annual bill. 'The savings are even greater for households who haven't switched in a long time.' Energy expert Emma Bush, from comparison website uSwitch, said: 'If more of us switched from expensive standard tariffs to cheaper deals, suppliers would work harder to attract and retain customers with lower prices and better customer service.' The CMA investigation is expected to focus on the poor treatment of long-standing customers and to argue that the profits of the leading firms are far higher than they admit. The companies claim their profits margins are around 5 per cent of what customers pay. But the CMA is predicted to use a different measure, which could reveal 'eye-watering' profits. Later this week, Centrica, which owns British Gas, is set to report profits of nearly £1.6billion for 2014. Energy secretary Ed Davey said: 'The power is in people's hands to get a better deal and save. Millions of people can switch supplier and save hundreds of pounds today.'","Rip-off variable rate energy tariffs are costing families £2.7billion a year .

"Eddie Ray Routh told a ranger he shot dead famed Navy SEAL Chris Kyle because: 'If I did not take down his soul, he was going to take down mine.' A tape of his confession was played in court in Stephenville, Texas on Monday as Routh's murder trial entered its second week. The former Marine, 27, is accused of shooting dead Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield after they took him to a gun range in February 2013 as he battled PTSD. In the taped confession, which was taken just hours after he was arrested, Routh told Texas Ranger Danny Briley that he killed the men because he thought they were 'headhunters' who were 'trying to hunt everybody down'. Ultimately though, he said they not as well trained as him so he was able to take them out. He shot dead Kyle first - because he recognized him more - before shooting dead Littlefield, he said. Scroll down for video . Confession: A tape of Eddie Ray Routh's confession was played to the court in his murder trial on Monday . On the footage, he can be seen resting his head on the table before the ranger questions him about killing former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield at a gun range in 2013 . Bizarre: At some points, he rambled, according to the ranger, and he also said he was sorry for the killings . 'I try to be as normal and as reasonable as I can... I'm pretty damn reasonable,' he told the ranger, according to coverage by The Dallas News. 'I was reasonable and fair with them boys.' He also revealed how he had told his sister: 'I had to kill a man today... I had to get out of that situation today'. He also admitted to fleeing after shooting the men at the gun range. He stole Kyle's truck and was ultimately arrested by police following a high-speed chase. 'I didn't know what else to do,' he said. 'My adrenaline was pumped so high. I didn't know what was right. I didn't know what was wrong.' Still, he showed remorse for his actions and said if he could speak to the families of his victims, he would apologize. 'I would tell them I'm so sorry for what I've done,' he said. In other parts of the confession, Routh, who was seen yawning at times in the interview and laying his head down in the table, rambles on about the world being a 'soulless place'. 'I've got tons of people eating on my soul right now,' he said. 'The warlords aren't very happy with me. I know that. Everyone knows that in town.' Ranger Briley took the stand on Monday and recounted how Routh made little sense during the questioning. Back to court: Former Marine Corporal Eddie Ray Routh, 27, enters the courtroom during his capital murder trial in Stephenville, Texas on Monday . Key witness: Texas Ranger Danny Briley speaks about interviewing Routh as he takes the stand on Monday . 'Some of the stuff, I had no clue what we were talking about,' he said. 'I wanted to know, did you know what you were doing was wrong? Clearly, he knew what he was doing was wrong.' He said he knew immediately that the killings were intentional. 'This was a brutal killing,' he told the court. 'There was no question that I was dealing with someone very violent…You can't accidentally shoot someone that many times.' Briley's testimony came after a former Secret Service agent testified about calls the men exchanged in the days leading up to the deaths - including a bizarre message Routh left on Kyle's phone. 'Kind of a sad day when it rains,' Routh said in the voicemail. 'It's a good sad. Rain will come and rains will leave. I guess that's what they do.' His attorneys have claimed the defendant, who had post-traumatic stress disorder, was in a psychotic state. The voicemail message gives some insight into Routh's mental state at the time. Jeff Shaffer, a former Secret Service agent who analyzed calls between Routh and Kyle, said Routh left four messages and spoke with Kyle several times - for up to 15 minutes - before the murders. The other voice messages are more straightforward and show Routh asking Kyle, who often took veterans to a shooting range after they returned home, simply to give him a call back. Shaffer also repeated text messages between Kyle and Littlefield saying that 'this dude is straight up nuts' after they took him to the shooting range. The messages were first heard last week. On the stand: Erath County Sheriff's Deputy Kenny Phillips said on Monday that Routh was 'under the influence maybe' after he was taken into custody by officers and then detoxed while in custody . In court: Taya Kyle, whose husband Chris Kyle was gunned down by Routh, is pictured in court on Monday . On Friday, Gene Cole, a former patrol deputy in Erath County, revealed for the first time a possible motive in the case as he took the stand. He told the court: 'I heard Mr Routh say, 'I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me. I was just riding in the backseat of the truck, and nobody would talk to me'.' Also taking the stand on Friday, Routh's uncle, James Watson, described his nephew's actions in the wake of the murders - and revealed they had both smoked 'strong' marijuana beforehand. Watson said he smoked weed with Routh and that his buzz lasted for three hours. Authorities also said they believed Routh had consumed whiskey before leaving with Kyle and Littlefield. While at the shooting range, he shot Kyle six times and Littlefield seven times, killing both. He then stole Kyle's truck. When he arrived at his uncle's home and said, 'I'm driving a dead man's truck', Watson misinterpreted 'dead man' as Routh himself, he said. 'He thought people were out to get him,' Watson testified. Gunned down: Former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, left, and his fellow veteran Chad Littlefield, right, were killed . Surrender: Routh eventually stops and surrenders and climbs out of the car with his hands raised . Arrested: Nash holds up an image of Routh handcuffed in the back of a police car on the night of his arrest . Routh also showed his uncle a black 9mm handgun, which was owned by Kyle and which he used to kill Littlefield at the range of Rough Creek Lodge and Resort, authorities have said. There is no doubt over the fact that Routh was responsible for shooting Kyle, a married father-of-two with the most kills to his name in U.S. military history, and his friend. Instead, the defense and prosecution are trying to prove whether or not he was driven by mental illness when he carried out the murders. Also on Friday, a ranger testified that he found whiskey, drug paraphernalia and medicine for schizophrenia in Routh's home the day of the shootings - giving some insight into his troubled life. Routh was a small arms technician who served in Iraq and was deployed to earthquake-ravaged Haiti before leaving the Marines in 2010. If convicted of capital murder, he faces life in prison without parole. The case has gained national attention due to 'American Sniper' - the movie starring Bradley Cooper and based on Kyle's memoir - which was released to critical acclaim.

"Conan O'Brien has become the first late night host to film an episode of his show in Cuba since the embargo of 1962. O'Brien spent Presidents Day weekend in Havana, Cuba, filming an upcoming segment for an episode of his TBS talk show which will air next month. The network said the host is taking advantage of President Barack Obama's efforts to improve relations with the country. Scroll down for video .

"Dining in Bilbao can easily slip into a game of tapas roulette. Or perhaps that should be pintxos roulette, as that is what the diminutive plates of bar food are called in this Basque region of northern Spain. Mrs C is not a seafood connoisseur. I first convinced her to try fish a decade ago - and she has become more daring. Art and soul: The magnificent Guggenheim gallery is Bilbao's most striking landmark . But 'really fishy seafood', as she terms it, remains a challenge, which is problematic here. Delicious plates of pintxos line every bar. And it's not clear what they contain. And since most of the labels for these dishes are printed in Basque, with its excessive use of the letter x, it becomes almost impossible to tell what you are about to chow down. Still, it's hard not to love this form of dining - and harder still not to love Bilbao. Everything seems tasteful, with striking sculptures dotted here and there. Even the graffiti on the main bridge in the centre of town looks like it's been considered. We explore the back streets to the old town, and the fish market (stopping for more pintxos), before heading back to our hotel along the wide riverside path . The modern offices blend in seamlessly with the classic Spanish buildings and large parks, such as at Dona Casilda. Our hotel - the splendid Gran Domine Bilbao - is a good example of this. Every room has its own work of modern art, and it sits over the road from the Guggenheim Museum. Opened in 1997, this dazzling titanium, granite and glass shell is a must for devotees of modern art and architecture. Even before you enter, you are given a taste for the creativity/ bonkers-ness that awaits inside, in the form of the 40 ft topiary Puppy, by Jeff Koons, that sits outside. Inside hang works by Andy Warhol, Gilbert & George and Wassily Kandinsky. Hope you're hungry: The Basque region is famous for its pintxos - but it helps if you have a liking for seafood . But it's the enormous rusted 10 ft-high walls of curved metal in the main hall that really catch our imagination. They have been sculpted to form waves that merge to form mazes that you can actually get lost in. Later that day we take a trip up to the Vizcaya Bridge. This transporter suspension bridge, built in 1893, is 200 ft high and still carries half a million cars and four million people from one side to the other every year in gondolas that hang from steel cables. It's a staggering work of engineering and is a World Heritage Site. Fares start at about 35 cents - so plenty of change left over for another plate of pintxos. Kirker Holidays (020 7593 2283, www.kirkerholidays.com) offers three nights' B&B at the five-star Gran Hotel Domine in Bilbao from £589 per person, including return flights, private car transfers and entrance tickets to the Guggenheim, Kirker guide notes to sightseeing, and the services of the Kirker concierge.","Bilbao is a fine alternative option to Barcelona for a Spanish city break .

"A TV programme that will recreate the death of actor Robin Williams has been branded 'grotesque' and 'beyond comprehension'. His death will be played out in a documentary series called Autopsy that has also examined the last hours of celebrities such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Brittany Murphy. It is thought the man portraying him in the episode is a professional Robin Williams lookalike from France called Alain Poudensan, who has also starred in adult films under the name Alain L'Yle. His website shows a picture of him grinning in front of the camera with his arm around Williams. The main picture on the impersonator's website shows him with his arm around the Oscar winning actor . A family friend told the Daily Mirror: 'With each passing day the pain for Robin's family eases just a fraction but something as disturbing as this just takes them backwards. 'Why anyone would want to make such a programme is beyond comprehension. His wife and family will be utterly dismayed that someone is seeking to profit from Robin's death in such a grotesque way. 'The producers should be ashamed of themselves. I hope people refuse to watch.' The father-of-three was found hanged at his home in Marin County, California, in August, aged 63 . Lookalike Alain Poudensan (left) with fellow impersonator David Born share a joke - it is believed Poudensan will portray Williams in the upcoming documentary examining his death . The 63-year-old Oscar-winning actor was found dead in his California home on August 11 in what authorities soon ruled a suicide. A coroner's report ruled Williams died from asphyxia due to hanging. He had been suffering from the early stages of Parkinson's disease at the time of his death, his wife said. Susan Schneider said her husband had been sober but 'not yet ready to share publicly' his struggles with Parkinson's. She added that he had also been suffering from anxiety and depression. The Oscar winner had been suffering from the early stages of Parkinson's disease at the time of his death . Williams shot to fame in the late 1970s as an alien in the US TV comedy series Mork & Mindy. But it was his role as an irreverent DJ with the US Armed Services Radio station in Good Morning, Vietnam in 1987 which won him huge acclaim. His roles ranged from serious and dramatic in films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, to comedy in Mrs Doubtfire. He was nominated for an Oscar three times before winning an Academy Award for his performance as a psychologist in Good Will Hunting in 1997. Channel 5 confirmed to MailOnline it is filming the documentary about the actor. It is unknown if it will also air in the US. The broadcaster refused to comment any further.","TV documentary series Autopsy will examine the death of Robin Williams .

"Hearing: Jason Dors-Lake, 45, appeared in court accused of punching a former lover who had said his famous parents had abused her . The youngest son of actress Diana Dors has been cleared of punching a girlfriend who he 'fell in love with' after she told him his famous parents were paedophiles who abused her, a court heard today. Jason Dors-Lake, 45, had a five-month relationship with Chloe Black even though she claimed she had been subjected to sex attacks by 'the English Marilyn Monroe' and her third husband Alan Lake. Diana Dors died of cancer in May 1984 and five months later Alan Lake died after he shot himself in the head in their son Jason's bedroom. The abuse claims emerged after Mr Dors-Lake was accused of punching Ms Black  in the head during a drunken late-night row. Mr Dors-Lake was arrested last October after they argued in her car on their way home from a birthday party at a Thai restaurant. But the case was thrown out by a judge because Ms Black changed her story four times, Highbury Corner Magistrates Court heard today. Describing his police interview, prosecutor Manjit Dogra said: 'He said they were both drunk. 'He stated he and Chloe argued in the car on the way home. He said the argument was about her accusing his parents Diana Dors and Alan Lake of sexually abusing her. 'She had sought him out five months ago and accused his parents of being paedophiles. They then fell in love. 'The suspect does not believe Chloe and states he is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and stated she had also accused members of the royal family of abusing her.' Ms Black was reluctant to discuss the allegations in court, but pressed by Jade Coleman, defending, she admitted she had said his parents were paedophiles. 'It was not the first part of the argument, but it certainly was why he was screaming at the top of his voice about it,' she told the court. 'If he doesn't want any of my so-called dragging his family name through the dirt, I am totally shocked about how he is behaving. Famous: Blonde bombshell Diana Dors with her third husband Alan Lake taken three years before they both died in 1984 . 'He is the one screaming and shouting about it,' she added. She claimed she tussled with a drunk and abusive Dors-Lake when she tried to retrieve her house keys from his jeans pocket. 'He then made a fist with his left hand and he bashed the side of my left cheek bone and temple,' she said. She told the court she had initially tried to cover for her now ex-boyfriend because she did not want her alleged past experiences to be exposed. Dors-Lake denied hitting her, but did not have to give evidence after Judge Moffatt decided he had no case to answer after hearing Ms Black had now given four different accounts of the incident. Family: Diana Dors, Alan Lake and their son Jason outside their Sunningdale mansion. He said outside court today he 'was exposed to a lot of things when I was younger, but never anything between adults and children' The judge said she had no reason to believe something did not happen, but could not be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the offence occurred. On being told he was free to go Dors-Lake thanked the judge and said: 'I would never, ever strike a woman in any way.' Dors-Lake added: 'Be careful who you fall in love with.' The actor and musician co-penned a tell-all book about growing up the son of blonde bombshell Dors, revealing details of wild parties at their Berkshire mansion, Orchard Manor. His mother, who once described herself as 'the only sex symbol Britain has produced since Lady Godiva', became legendary for hosting sex and drug-fuelled orgies. Dors-Lake insisted outside court: 'I was exposed to a lot of things when I was younger, but never anything between adults and children.' He said everything he had to tell had already been written in the book, Connecting Dors: The Legacy of Diana Dors, by him and Niema Ash, which was published two years ago. Dors died of ovarian cancer on 4 May 1984, aged 52, when her son was just 14 years old. Five months later his father, Alan Lake, walked into Jason's bedroom and killed himself by firing a shotgun into his mouth, aged 43. Orchard Manor along with the bulk of the house's contents were sold off to pay taxes and solicitors' bills, leaving little for Jason, who went to live with his half-brother Gary Dawson in Los Angeles. Dors claimed to have stashed a £2million inheritance, which could only be located by cracking a code handed to her son Mark Dawson. The 'key' was allegedly left with Lake and despite her son's best efforts to locate the money the legacy has never been found. Dors-Lake, of Notting Hill, west London, was cleared of a single count of assault by beating. Orgies at 11 and offered drugs aged five: How Diana Dors' son revealed wild parties were the norm in his childhood home . Diana Dors' youngest son Jason used a tell-all book to reveal how he took drugs at the age five and had seen orgies by the age of 11 because of the party lifestyle of his world famous mother. His mother was one of Britain's most famous women who became a Hollywood legend. After two failed marriages, Diana had son Jason with the love of her life, actor Alan Lake, who she met in her late thirties. She already had two sons from her second marriage, who lived with their father Richard Dawson, and had a reputation for being an insatiable party animal. Diana Dors described herself as 'the only sex symbol Britain has produced since Lady Godiva', pictured (left) in the 1950s and (right) in 1964 . The couple held orgies and in Jason's book, Connecting Dors: The Legacy of Diana Dors, written with Niema Ash, it describes the sex parties. It said that participants were offered 'alcohol and erotic stimulants' before each couple 'was led to a special room and . allocated fifteen minutes, unaware that the room was fitted with two-way . mirrors'. Diana Dors later married Alan Lake and the arrival of their son Jason, who she doted on, did not sway her from ending the parties. The book says: 'Diana was reluctant to renounce the parties, the clubs, the fun. She wanted to keep the good times rolling, especially as she could now share them with Alan'. As a result, Diana and Alan's mansion, Orchard Manor in Sunningdale, Berkshire, became a regular haunt for wild parties, which Jason saw as a child. The author Niema Ash told MailOnline previously that aged 11 Jason saw 'sex parties at the house where couples were invited to use the guest bedrooms where a camera was set up inside. A live feed then linked to a giant TV screen in the living room downstairs.' Close: Jason Dors-Lake said he enjoyed a loving relationship with his mother, pictured when he was three-days-old, but used a tell-all book to describe his parents' party lifestyle . And his introduction to drugs was even younger. The book says: 'At the tender age of five, Jason's nursery education was supplemented by an introduction to the joys of recreational drug. In the book  it says Jason, then aged five, woke and stumbled into a next door room to find his father's friends passing around what looked like 'a giant white jelly bean' that they cracked open to inhale a white smoke. The youngster insisted on trying the 'candy'. After initial reservations, the party decided to let Jason sniff it 'for fun' as long as he promised not to tell his mother. He said as an adult he has no idea what he took but recalls 'laughing until his tummy ached' after inhaling it. Despite his unusual upbringing, Jason said he has happy childhood memories of his time at Orchard Manor and he never doubted the love his doting mother and father. But he went off the rails after the death of both  his parents when he was just 14. Famous: Diana Dors was one of Britain's most famous women and starred in hit films at home and abroad . His mother Diana died of ovarian cancer when she was 53 and his heartbroken father Alan shot himself five months later in Jason's bedroom. He went to live in the U.S. with his half brothers and the party lifestyle he had become accustomed continued. He had a daughter when he was 22 and attempted suicide during one drug-induced episode. Jason's co-author has said his life is back on track. Living in Kent, he has reestablished his relationship with his daughter and attends AA meetings.","Jason Dors-Lake, 45, cleared of punching his ex-girlfriend Chloe Black .

"A gang of computer hackers is believed to have stolen tens of millions of pounds from UK banks in the largest cyber-crime ever detected. The massive theft was part of a bold £650million raid, meticulously orchestrated over the past two years, on more than 100 financial institutions around the world. Attacks by the gang, thought to be based in Russia but with members in Ukraine and China, are feared to be continuing, despite being investigated by Interpol and international authorities. A gang of computer hackers is believed to have stolen tens of millions of pounds from UK banks by ordering ATM machines to dispense cash at pre-determined times – even without a bank card. It is unknown which banks have been targeted, and the scale of losses to British banks has not been disclosed (file photo) The computer scam was so sophisticated that the gang, known as Carbanak, was apparently able to order ATM machines to dispense cash at pre-determined times – even without a bank card. The cyber-criminals would pull off a raid by first gaining entry into a bank employee's computer. They did this by sending authentic-looking emails that unsuspecting recipients then clicked on, inadvertently infecting the bank's machines with Carbanak malware – a technique known as 'spear phishing'. Hackers were then able to infiltrate the internal network and track down administrators' computers for video surveillance. This allowed them to see and record everything that happened on the screens of staff who serviced the cash transfer systems, which meant the fraudsters got to know and could mimic every last detail of bank clerks' work. The cyber-criminals were able to hack into a bank employee's computer, allowing them to record everything happening on-screen and then mimic workers online to transfer money into dummy accounts (file photo) They used this information to impersonate bank staff online, in order to electronically transfer tens of millions of pounds from the bank into dummy accounts. On average, each robbery took between two and four months, from infecting the first computer at the bank's corporate network to making off with the money. Another method used was where the criminals would gain access to someone's account and inflate the balance many times over before transferring the cash. The raids, which date back to 2013, were finally detected by Russian cyber security firm Kaspersky Lab, after a Ukrainian ATM was found to be giving out notes at random times - when no one had put in a card or touched a button. The scale of the crime was global, with banks in the US, China, Russia and Europe targeted. Security experts are trying to identify the banks hit but say customers, such as this man, have not been affected (file photo) Security cameras showed how money would be picked up by customers who appeared to be in the right place at the right time. Kaspersky's principal security researcher Vicente Diaz said the theft was unusual as it targeted banks directly, rather than individuals' bank accounts, and that the hackers seemed to set their limit to around £10million before moving onto another bank. 'In this case they are not interested in information. They're only interested in the money,' Mr Diaz said. 'They're flexible and quite aggressive and use any tool they find useful for doing whatever they want to do.' A spokesman for the firm added: 'The Carbanak criminal gang used techniques drawn from the arsenal of targeted attacks. The plot marks the beginning of a new stage in the evolution of cyber-criminal activity, where malicious users steal money directly from banks, and avoid targeting end users.' The scale of the crime was global, with banks in the US, China, Russia and Europe targeted, and the attackers thought to be expanding throughout Asia, the Middle East and Africa. In one case, an unnamed bank lost $7.3million (around £4.7million) through ATM fraud. Another financial institution lost $10million (around £6.5million) after the attackers exploited its online banking platform. Kaspersky has not identified the banks hit by the scam, and is still working with law-enforcement agencies to investigate the attacks, which the company says are ongoing. Losses to UK banks have not yet been disclosed, but are thought to run into tens of millions of pounds. However, as the scam targets institutions rather than individuals, customers' accounts have not been affected. Despite the fact the fraud has been uncovered, it is feared that banks could be hit again, as once installed the malware can operate almost independently of the gang and is difficult to detect. Sergey Golovanov, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, said: 'It was a very slick and professional cyber-robbery'. Sanjay Virmani, director of the Interpol Digital Crime Centre, said: 'These attacks again underline the fact that criminals will exploit any vulnerability in any system.' 'Scale of the crime was global.' The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a non-profit organisation that alerts banks about hacking activity, said in a statement that its members received a briefing about the report in January. 'We cannot comment on individual actions our members have taken, but on balance we believe our members are taking appropriate actions to prevent and detect these kinds of attacks and minimize any effects on their customers,' the organisation said. 'The report that Russian banks were the primary victims of these attacks may be a significant change in targeting strategy by Russian-speaking cyber-criminals.' US authorities are putting an increasing focus on cybersecurity in the wake of numerous data breaches of companies ranging from mass retailers like Target and Home Depot to Sony Pictures Entertainment and health insurer Anthem. The White House wants Congress to replace the existing patchwork of state laws with a national standard giving companies 30 days to notify consumers if their personal information has been compromised.","Theft part of £650m raid on more than 100 financial institutions world-wide .
