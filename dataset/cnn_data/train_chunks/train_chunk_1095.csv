"Any hopes London Welsh may have had of kick-starting a survival battle on Sunday were swiftly banished as they went down 38-7 to Newcastle at Kingston Park. The Falcons scored six tries - and had the try-scoring bonus point wrapped up by half-time - as they registered their biggest Aviva Premiership win for eight years. Three of those tries came in a seven-minute first-half spell and effectively ended any hopes London Welsh may have had of sparking a fightback. Ally Hogg of Newcastle Falcons scores a try during the Premiership clash with London Welsh . Newcastle's first-half hat-trick came shortly after the visitors squandered an early chance, when big Tongan number eight Opeti Fonua broke from the base of the scrum. His offload to Peter Browne should have led to a score, but the flanker could not hold the pass. It proved a costly miss, with Newcastle stepping up the pace to score those three tries in seven minutes to lead 19-0. Tom Catterick nearly cut through on the 22 to set up a series of forward drives and Kieran Brookes was stopped right on the try line. Sinoti Sinoti of Newcastle Falcons challenged by Paul Rowley during the 38-7 victory for the home side . That led to the opening try by Sinoti Sinoti, with Ally Hogg picking up from the base of the scrum and flicking the ball out to Sinoti, who stepped inside Elliot Kear and outside Paul Rowley to score. Newcastle were quickly back on the attack when Welsh failed to clear a long kick and then conceded a penalty which the Falcons put in the corner and drove prop Rob Vickers over for a try converted by Catterick. The third try followed when Sinoti blasted through and passed inside overhead for Mark Wilson to send in Mike Blair and Catterick again converted for 19-0. Tom Catterick went over to score one of Newcastle's three first-half tries in the win over London Welsh . Nick Scott briefly raised Welsh hopes by brilliantly snapping up Will Robinson's clever dink down the touchline to score, and Robinson landed the extras for 19-7 in 24th minute. However, Newcastle's superiority in the rolling maul was demonstrated again when Will Welch was driven over for a try in the 33rd minute to give the Falcons a 24-7 half-time lead and the try-scoring bonus point. Much as they had done in the first half, Welsh started the second period well but failed to make it count and they again paid the price. Hogg took a pass from Juan Pablo Socino and galloped 50 yards up the touchline, bumping off Scott and Olly Barkley for a try which Catterick converted in the 55th minute for 31-7. Josh Furno of Newcastle rides the challenge of Koree Britton (right) as London Welsh fell to another loss . Both sides made use of their benches in the second half and the continuity went right out of the game - particularly in Newcastle's case, but Welsh were unable to profit, and their frustration was never more evident than when Tom May had a chance to score only for the ball to be passed behind him and straight into touch. That ruined the chance of a try-scoring homecoming to the club he started his career with 19 years ago, and on his last appearance here after announcing his retirement at the end of the season. Almost inevitably, with three minutes left George McGuigan snapped up a loose ball and Alex Tuilagi slipped it to Catterick, who scored with an outside run and converted his own try for 38-7.","The Falcons scored six tries for their biggest league win in eight years .
Four first-half tries put the home side 19-0 up at the break .

"Bernie Ecclestone will make a further attempt to cut Formula One's extravagant costs on Thursday. Ahead of a meeting of the Strategy Group that comprises the 'big five' - Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull and Williams, plus the sixth-placed team from the recent championship, Force India - Ecclestone is to propose another engine change. There is no doubt considerable blame for the financial crisis that engulfed the sport at the end of the season was laid at the door of the introduction of the new 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units that replaced the old 2.4-litre V8s. Mercedes dominated 2014 in Formula One, winning the constructors' championship with ease . Lewis Hamilton claimed the drivers' championship after a thrilling duel with Nico Rosberg . Bernie Ecclestone is set to propose to the five biggest teams a return to old engine power units . The three power unit manufacturers in Mercedes, Ferrari and Renault spent millions of pounds in development, and in a bid to recoup some of their costs have naturally charged their customers accordingly. It meant from an annual outlay of around £5million for the V8s, teams were suddenly asked to find around £15-20m, ultimately forcing the likes of Caterham and Marussia out of business. As for Force India, Lotus and Sauber, the trio suggested a far more equitable distribution of the sport's £575m revenue to ease their financial concerns, but that ultimately cut little ice with Ecclestone despite numerous talks. Now Ecclestone is to head into the Strategy Group meeting proposing a potential return to the V8s, or even V10s. 'We recognise the biggest problem these teams have is the amount they have to spend on the power unit,' said Ecclestone. 'I believe if you got everybody in the room, secret ballot, there would only be one company interested in retaining this engine, and that is Mercedes. 'You can't blame them because they have done a super job, and the others haven't, so they've a big advantage. 'Is that good for Formula One? I think not, because we can all put our money together and have a wager they will win the championship next year, and probably the year after, which is not really the sort of thing we are looking for. 'I have been proposing, and am going to propose, at the next meeting we go back to a normally-aspirated engine with some hybrid bits built into it. Caterham, whose driver Kamui Kobayashi crashed spectacularly in Australia in March, went bust this year . 'The teams, manufacturers will have to call it a ""McLaren hybrid"", ""Ferrari hybrid"" or a ""Williams hybrid"". 'It's so we get across the message they are hybrids, but nobody tells anybody. 'It's the best-kept secret actually as to what this engine is for, why it was designed and what have we achieved with it because it is a fantastic bit of engineering, it really is.' Suggested to Ecclestone that Mercedes would quit F1 if the sport reverted back to a V8 or V10, he replied: 'I think they'll do it when it suits them anyway. 'We've noticed in the past manufacturers have done that, but I would be surprised if they did.' Marussia, for whom Brit Max Chilton was a driver, were also put out of business due to engine costs . As to a timescale, Ecclestone is proposing its introduction in 2016, adding: 'These are my ideas. 'Nobody can do anything with the engine we currently have, apart from spend a lot of money. 'I have spoken to one of the engine people and they thought the type of engine we are talking about, the development costs would be really small. 'I have always thought, though, it would be an uphill struggle to get Mercedes to ditch what they have built, and honestly we shouldn't ask them. It would need to be them volunteering. 'But what are they going to say? Them saying ""The other people are useless, we are great, so we're happy to help"" is not going to happen is it? 'But if they're prepared to reduce the cost of the engine then the problem disappears, then there's no need for a new engine. We keep what we have.'","Caterham and Marussia went out of business last season .

"In-form centre Jonathan Joseph has renewed his contract with Bath.  The 23-year-old has scored seven tries in 15 games for Bath this season and his performances earned him a call-up by England coach Stuart Lancaster as injury cover ahead of the QBE Autumn Internationals. Joseph did not play in any of those matches but has won six England caps in total since making his international debut against South Africa in 2012. A Bath statement did not include any details about Joseph's new contract but the Derby-born back, who moved to The Rec from London Irish in 2013, said: 'I feel I've really developed as a player since I've been here at Bath. Bath centre Jonathan Joseph clears his lines during his side's 39-26 victory against Wasps on Saturday . Joseph made his international debut against South Africa at Ellis Park in the summer of 2012 . 'With the help of the great coaches here I've added more elements to my skillset, so I definitely wanted to stay here.' Head coach Mike Ford added: 'JJ is an incredibly talented young player, who is on the brink of breaking into the England squad, and deservedly so. 'He has been on fantastic form for us, providing a real threat in our back line and his defence is international class too. He's matured as a player over the last year or so, and we're delighted he's staying with us.'

"Only a week of the tennis season has gone and already an alarming number of players have been calling in sick to tournaments or withdrawing, in the case of John Isner, because he is 'tired'. Rising gloriously above all this is Roger Federer, a player for the ages, who registered his 1,000th ATP Tour victory by winning the final of the Brisbane Open against Milos Raonic. With his 6-4, 6-7, 6-4 victory the 33-year-old Swiss became only the third player in the modern era to get into four figures of professional wins, behind Ivan Lendl and all-time leader Jimmy Connors. VIDEO Scroll down for Roger Federer claims 1,000th win to earn Brisbane International title . Roger Federer earned his 1,000th career win with a hard-fought victory against Milos Raonic . Federer celebrates his win in front of the Brisbane crowd on Sunday . The milestone gives Federer plenty of momentum heading into the Australian Open . Just six weeks after filling in the last gap on his c.v. by lifting the Davis Cup trophy Federer was being feted again, this time with a presentation from Australian greats Rod Laver and Roy Emerson. While fans have their favourite aspects of Federer — his free-flowing style, for example — increasingly he is being recognised for his extraordinary durability and consistency in an era when men's tennis is among the most physically demanding of sports. Of all the stats being trotted out in tribute yesterday, arguably the most remarkable of his career remains the 36 consecutive times he reached the quarter-finals or (usually) better at the Grand Slams between 2004 and 2013. While there are comparisons with Lendl and Connors, an equally apt one is with Serena Williams, the all-conquering American who was born less than two months after him. She stands on 684 career victories, a mark which illustrates the Swiss master's astonishing consistency of effort. Federer reached the landmark after seeing off Raonic 6-4 6-7 (2/7) 6-4 in Australia . Raonic made life difficult for Federer but was eventually beaten in three sets . Sunday represented his 83rd career title, and hard fought it was against the huge-serving Canadian. It sets him up beautifully for a run at the Australian Open, which begins a week today. Realistically you would expect him to overtake Lendl's tally of 1,071 but even Federer will struggle to overhaul Connors's final figure of 1,253. They are three very different personalities, but what they have in common is an absolute lust for winning and severe dislike of losing. Of going past Connors the Swiss admitted: 'I doubt that it's going to happen but you never know.' He was nonetheless delighted with this latest notch of greatness. 'I've played a lot of tennis over the years so to get to 1,000 wins means a lot to me,' he said. Only Ivan Lendl (left) and Jimmy Connors have achieved more career victories than Federer . 21 — most wins against one player – Andy Roddick . 19 — most wins against current player – Novak Djokovic . 22 — wins over five sets . 737 — straight-set wins . 1st — tour win was over Frenchman Guillaume Raoux in 1998. 500th — tour win came in 2007 (vs David Ferrer) 706 — next highest active player wins belong to Rafael Nadal . 210 — most wins in one country: 210 in USA . 111 — most wins against players from a country — the French . 131 — wins on grass courts . 'It's a special moment, no doubt about that, I will never forget this match. Looking back, it's almost nicer winning it this way, in a final with nerves and humid conditions against a great player.' Raonic was aware of the historic occasion but rather overestimated Federer's achievement. 'We all know today was a significant milestone for Roger,' said the world No 8. 'When we were warming up, I heard all those titles; I honestly thought he was playing for 2,000 match wins today! I think he needs to step it up!' Two thousand wins will be beyond even Federer, but you would expect him to get past Lendl, on the proviso that his body and sometimes troublesome back can hold up, as it did last year but struggled to do in 2013. When Federer's second set of twins arrived in May he was asked whether they would distract him from the tennis court but he has already answered that one. His smooth technique puts less strain on his body than most other players and his life runs like a Swiss clock, supported by his formidable wife Mirka, as became apparent at the O2 Arena in November. Serena Williams was born two months after Federer but stands on 684 career victories . The man with whom he fell out there, Stanislas Wawrinka, looks to have played himself into form in time for the defence of his Australian Open title. On Sunday, he won the ATP Chennai Open by beating qualifier Aljaz Bedene 6-3, 6-4. By reaching the final and beating some tough Spaniards along the way Bedene showed how useful he is, and it could yet be that by this time next week he will have switched his allegiance to Britain, as his change in citizenship from Slovenia appears imminent. Stanislas Wawrinka looks to have played himself into form in time for the defence of his Australian Open title . Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has pulled out of the forthcoming Australian Open with an arm injury . Jimmy Connors: 1,253 . Ivan Lendl: 1,071 . Roger Federer: 1,000 . Guillermo Vilas: 929 . John McEnroe: 875 . Andre Agassi: 870 . Stefan Edberg: 801 . Someone who will not be in Melbourne is US Open champion Marin Cilic, whose withdrawal through a shoulder injury should see Londoner James Ward get an automatic entry into a Grand Slam field for the first time. Cilic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga seem to have paid for putting in a full stint at the International Premier Tennis League in the off-season. Federer was smart enough to restrict his participation to a couple of days. There was good news for Britain in the doubles yesterday, as two players won titles. Jamie Murray (left) celebrates his Mens doubles victory in Brisbane with his partner John Peens . Jamie Murray made the perfect start to the season in the company of his Australian partner John Peers when they defeated Alex Dolgopolov and Kei Nishikori 6-3, 7-6 in the final at Brisbane. Murray wants to make a case for a return to the British Davis Cup team this year. And 2012 Wimbledon doubles champion Jonathan Marray won his second career title in Chennai. He and partner Yen-Hsun Lu beat Raven Klaasen and home favourite and eight-time men's doubles Grand Slam winner Leander Paes 6-3, 7-6.","Roger Federer defeated Milos Raonic to earn 1,000th career win .

"A long journey across the Atlantic ocean to play a regular-season game in London not something that many NBA players experience, but it is a trip that Jason Kidd is getting very used to. Kidd played at the O2 Arena two years ago when the New York Knicks beat the Detroit Pistons and then returned 12 months later as coach of a Brooklyn Nets team that was far too strong for the Atlanta Hawks. On Thursday night, Kidd will once again return to the same building as coach of the Milwaukee Bucks as they face his former team the Knicks. Jason Kidd has assembled a young and exciting team at the Milwaukee Bucks this season . Coming to London in the middle of the season is a trip that Kidd enjoys, and his previous two experiences stand him in good stead to rack up a hat-trick of regular-season victories in England. ‘Wherever I’m at we get signed up for this game, Kidd laughed. ‘I love it and the last two years it has been great and I look forward to it again. ‘Being a player the first year, I understand the schedule that we had. I used it the following year for Brooklyn and I thought it helped us adjust to the time zone and also adjust to having practice when the time difference is big. ‘We will copy the same things we did last year and hopefully try and find a way to win.’ Since his move from Brooklyn in the summer, Kidd has created a young and exciting team in Milwaukee that travel to London with a winning 20-19 record and fifth place in the Eastern Conference. The Bucks have beaten the Knicks both times they have played this season, including earlier this month . When the contest against the Knicks in London was announced last year by the NBA, the Bucks were something of an unknown quantity and a mere supporting act to one of the league’s most popular teams. But with the talent that Kidd has assembled in Milwaukee, along with the Knicks’ struggles this season, the Bucks are a team that are going places and they will be favourites to win on Thursday. ‘We can’t take anybody lightly, Kidd said. ‘There is nobody in this league that we can overlook. Derek (Fisher, New York Knicks head coach) is going to have his guys ready to play and they have got a lot of talent so we will definitely bring our A-game. ‘We are not built around one guy. Everyone plays. We have some very young talent, but when you look at the pieces we have with guys who play at a very high level, we are still the second youngest team in the league and we are fun to watch. The Bucks travelled to London with a 20-19 record and in fifth place in the Eastern Conference . ‘I wouldn’t want to be in no other place than with a young team being able to grow as a young coach so I’m in a perfect environment and love the city of Milwaukee – it’s been great. ‘This is a close team already so being able to do team functions and something different always gives the experience, win or lose, of understanding what we can learn from doing something that isn’t just the norm. ‘We always try and talk about the future but we have got to stay in the present and my job is to make these guys understand what it takes to win and what it means to play hard and also what it means to do your job to a very high level.’ Kidd is only in his second season as an NBA head coach after almost two decades as a player, but already he has been through a lot. Kidd played for the New York Knicks in their win over the Detroit Pistons at the O2 Arena in January 2013 . Kidd returned to London last year to coach the Brooklyn Nets to victory over the Atlanta Hawks . His start in Brooklyn last season wasn’t the best, but eventually he got his team in order for a play-off run before being traded to Milwaukee. His opposite number at New York, Derek Fisher, is going through a similarly rough spell in his rookie season as a coach with the Knicks on a 15-game losing streak and holding a 5-35 record. ‘Coaching is different to playing,’ Kidd said. ‘It isn’t always going to start off great but this is a marathon and it is how you end. Coach Fisher is going through a tough time right now, but there is still a lot of basketball to be played and a lot of games to turnaround and they have the talent.' Kidd grew up in California and initially started playing football. Two years ago, the former Knicks point guard joined some of his team-mates in watching Chelsea play Southampton in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge the day before their game against the Pistons. ‘As a kid it was my first sport and it was great to see soccer become a little more popular here in the States,' Kidd said. ‘But it is great to see those athletes and what they do and the fans who sing songs. The enthusiasm of going to a game is incredible.’ The Milwaukee Bucks take on the New York Knicks at NBA Global Games London 2015 at The O2 on January 15.

"Fabricio Werdum won the interim heavyweight title when he stopped Mark Hunt in the second round on Saturday night at UFC 180. Werdum (19-5-1) got off to a slow start, but hit Hunt with a right knee to the face to secure the win in the UFC's debut in Mexico. It was the fifth consecutive victory for the Brazilian fighter. 'I respect Mark Hunt, he hit me hard, but I stayed here a long time in Mexico to win this title, this one is for my family and all of Brazil,' Werdum said. Brazil's Fabricio Werdum goes on the attack against New Zealand's Mark Hunt at UFC 180 . The event was supposed to be a showcase for Cain Velasquez, the Mexican-American champion who has a strong following in Mexico. Instead, the oft-injured Velasquez hurt his right knee and dropped out of his bout against Werdum last month, sending the UFC scrambling for something to show the 21,000 fans who sold out the Arena Cuidad de Mexico in eight hours. Hunt (10-9-1), a 40-year-old brawler based in Australia with a history of thrilling fights, got the call from the UFC one month after he stopped Roy Nelson in Japan for his fifth win in seven fights, losing only to former UFC champion Junior Dos Santos in that stretch. Werdum lands a kick on Hunt during their interim Heavyweight title fight in Mexico City . But Hunt was unable to continue his positive stretch. 'I didn't see that one coming,' Hunt said of the knee that ended the fight. Velasquez was part of a sold-out crowd at the raucous Arena Ciudad de Mexico.

"Harry Allen's eyes dim when he digs into the memory bank and talks about the look on his parents’ faces. Their immediate reaction to the news, he says, was one of the most painful moments of his 12-month ban for cocaine abuse. ‘It’s quite weird to relive it because I’ve tried to bury it,’ said Allen, 23, speaking publicly for the first time since his suspension ended with him playing his first game for his new club London Irish last weekend. ‘My dad is my biggest fan. I drove home and told my mum, then waited for my dad to get in from work. ‘I broke down a bit. When it all falls on top of you, you think, “I’ve potentially ruined my life here”. It reduces you to such a low level, you think, “Wow”. I won’t forget the look on my dad’s face when I told him. That’s enough for me to not ever do anything that stupid again.’ Harry Allen is determined to make the most of his second chance at London Irish after a year-long drug ban . Allen made his Premiership return for the Exiles last weekend against Saracens . The England age-group hooker received the results of his positive test on December 19, 2013, his 22nd birthday. Then at Harlequins, Allen was called into a meeting after training with club coaching staff and an anti-doping officer, who revealed that benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, was present in his results. The one-year ban began immediately and Quins had no option but to release him. ‘It was a test after an A League semi-final,’ said Allen. ‘It was quite a bad time. I had my contract terminated on my birthday, then Christmas was really weird and I was in a bit of a void. After Christmas it dies down a bit and you think, “I’ve made a really, really bad mistake”. 'You talk about embarrassment but it was more a feeling that I let people down. I definitely let my mum and dad down, and my family. Quins as well; I let Conor [O’Shea] and all them guys down.’ Between the initial drugs test and the start of the suspension, Allen had made his first-team debut for the west London club. Having played previously for Saracens and England Under-18s, his career seemed to be set on an upward trajectory. He does not come across as the ‘party animal’ type but says he turned to the drug because of ‘personal issues outside the game’, despite being fully aware of the repercussions. He will not explain further. Now 23, Allen took to mixed martial arts during his time away from rugby and says is provided him with focus . Allen was a fast mover in his 10 months as an MMA fighter, reaching a semi-professional level . ‘When I got tested, I knew,’ said Allen. ‘It was out of character for me [to take drugs]. It wasn’t something that appealed to me in any way; it was just something that happened. Straight after I knew exactly what I’d done. I beat myself up quite badly. it wasn’t a habit.’ Allen headlined a fight night in London during his exile from professional rugby due to a drugs ban . It was the buzz of competition that provided Allen with his real highs. Torn away from his love for rugby with a suspension that did not even permit training, the youngster from Kent took up mixed martial arts. Former England prop Matt Stevens, who previously served a two-year ban for cocaine use, started Brazilian jiu-jitsu during his time out but Allen found comfort in cage fighting. He said: ‘The MMA gave me something to focus on. Some people may go missing and take loads of time off but I knew from the start that I made a mistake and needed to keep my head right. It was hard, a dark place. ‘There’s a lot more to MMA than just being a man, hitting people hard and having a fight. I wasn’t too bad, considering 10 months in I got to the semi-pro level. 'I fought for a light-heavyweight title. I lost by a split decision but it was important to me, just to really bring home that I really went for something that year. I never sat there and felt sorry for myself.’ While Allen was banned for the recreational drug use, he questions claims that rugby’s culture encourages the use of performance enhancing substances. There is increasing pressure on young players to bulk up to meet the physical demands of the game but Allen’s perception is that sufficient levels of education are in place. ‘Everyone is getting bigger and stronger but there are teams in place to help you achieve that naturally,’ he said. ‘The people who do that [take drugs] are the people who don’t want to work hard and want to take short cuts.’ Allen poses for his Harlequins portrait in August 2013 - three months later his career was in turmoil . A talented teenagers, Allen is tackled during an England Under-18s match against Italy in 2009 . Cage fighting kept Allen in shape and he was given a lucky break by London Irish. The Exiles asked him to play for the club’s reserves before, in a series of ‘honest’ conversations, he convinced director of rugby Brian Smith that he had overcome his problems. ‘I got a phone call from [former lock] Nick Kennedy,’ said Allen. ‘He said, “We’re short on hookers, do you fancy coming and playing an A League game for us?”. I jumped at the chance. My ban was up on the Saturday and I was back playing at a very good standard on the Monday. ‘Before that I was looking at playing National One for Blackheath or something along those lines. I was prepared to start at the bottom and work my way up.’ Irish found themselves with extensive injury problems and signed Allen on a week-by-week contract. He says he was treated like any other member of the squad on his return, with his new team-mates recognising the willingness to own up to his mistakes. Now he feels he is back on the right path. ‘I want to be a Premiership hooker and all the dreams I had as a kid are very much on my mind,’ he said. ‘Perhaps before I lost that hunger, but now I’ve got that hunger to do what I need to do.’","Harry Allen served a one-year drug ban and was released by Harlequins .

"Mikel Arteta may have played his last game for Arsenal after he was sidelined for three months through injury. The Arsenal captain, who is out of contract at the end of the season, has been missing from first-team action since November after he was substituted in the 2-0 Champions League victory over Borussia Dortmund at the Emirates Stadium. The 32-year-old was expected to be out for around a month but a subsequent problem with his ankle means rehabilitation will take 'approximately three months'. Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta has been ruled out for three months after surgery on his ankle . Arteta was substituted in the victory over Borussia Dortmund in November and has not featured since . Mathieu Debuchy will also be sidelined until April following shoulder surgery on the injury he sustained in Arsenal's 3-0 win against Stoke. The France international has only recently returned to action after he suffered an injury in the 2-2 draw against Manchester City at the Emirates in September. 'It's very unfortunate for Mathieu, it's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season,' said Arsene Wenger. Mathieu Debuchy dislocated his shoulder after colliding with Stoke's Marko Arnautovic in the 3-0 victory . 'He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again. I count three months out for Mathieu because contact will be a problem for the shoulder.' On Arteta, manager Wenger added: 'Mikel has had surgery which went well. I have just seen him, he is back with us at the training ground. 'He had a limited mobility in his ankle and some persistent inflammation that had an impact on his calf. 'That meant we had to make the decision to have surgery and it's a proper solution which gives him the best chance to recover.'","Mikel Arteta had surgery on ankle and faces three months of rehabilitation .

"Everton winger Kevin Mirallas will wait until the season is over before deciding whether to sign a new contract at Goodison Park.

"When Everton's Joel Robles and West Ham's Adrian were trying to put off those taking penalties during their FA Cup shoot-out, referee Neil Swarbrick was losing patience with the goalkeepers. Robles and Adrian were warned by the official for their antics several times and told to return to their line to wait for the penalty to be taken. But, with Robles already cautioned, the 24-year-old was on thin ice, especially when Swarbrick approached him with a yellow card in his hand. So, could the Everton goalkeeper have been sent off for a second bookable offence during the shoot-out that finished 9-8 in West Ham's favour? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Holland's Tim Krul use the tactic during the 2014 World Cup . Referee Neil Swarbrick speaks with Joel Robles of Everton during the penalty shoot-out on Tuesday night . Everton's Robles and West Ham's Adrian (pictured) were trying to put off those taking penalties at Upton Park . 'If the goalkeeper is sent off during the taking of kicks from the penalty mark, he shall be replaced by a player who finished the match.' FIFA and FA rules state  a goalkeeper can be sent off during a shoot-out, whether for a second yellow or straight red, and only a player that finished the match can replace him in goal. At Upton Park, Swarbrick approached Robles to give him a telling off, holding a yellow card in his hand, though the referee could have been using it to pencil in those that scored and missed their spot-kicks. But the Spaniard was one wrong move away from being dismissed, and he would not have been the first in football either. The only other reported sending off for a goalkeeper during a penalty shoot-out came in a Cosafa Cup quarter-final between Botswana and Malawi on May 25, 2003. Botswana goalkeeper Modiri Marumo got a pat on the back by opposite number Philip Nyasulu, and reacted by 'punching him in the face'. Adrian took his gloves off to take the winning penalty against Everton as Robles lost the shoot-out 9-8 . Adrian runs away in celebration after scoring the winning penalty for West Ham against Everton . Botswana goalkeeper Modiri Marumo was sent off for 'punching' his opposite number 'in the face' in 2003 . 'I over-reacted in an exchange of words between myself and my counterpart,' Marumo said. 'This unbecoming behaviour has not only embarrassed me, but also the organisation that I work for, the Botswana Defence Force (BDF). 'I hope my apology would be recognised and I pledge my commitment in serving the nation.' Putting off those taking penalties was taken to another level by Holland's Tim Krul during the 2014 World Cup, with Louis van Gaal bringing the Newcastle United goalkeeper on purely for the shoot-out. Krul screamed 'Vamos!' in the face of Costa Rica's every penalty taker in Salvador during the quarter-final, but the Dutchman did not regret doing so as it earned Holland the win. ‘I don’t think I did anything wrong. I didn’t shout in an aggressive manner,' insisted Krul. ‘I did everything in my power and I would be happy to do it again, absolutely no problem. 'There are no regrets. I was ready for the moment. I told them I knew where they were going and I had analysed it. I tried to get in their heads and it worked.'

"Striker Peter Crouch hopes a deal can be agreed to extend his stay at Stoke past the end of the season. The former England international is out of contract in the summer and so could now open negotiations with foreign clubs over a potentially lucrative Bosman free transfer abroad. However, the much-travelled frontman - who joined Stoke from Tottenham in late August 2011 and has been reported to be interesting former Potters boss Tony Pulis at West Brom - would prefer to stay on at the Britannia Stadium, with manager Mark Hughes keen to retain him. Peter Crouch faces an uncertain future, with his deal at Stoke due to expire at the end of the season . Crouch, pictured in action against Arsenal on Sunday, is keen to extend his four-year day with the Potters . 'I don't know what will happen in the future but at the moment, for the foreseeable future, I am happy playing for Stoke,' said Crouch. 'My contract is up at the end of the season so I don't know what the future will hold, but at the moment I will just continue to do what I do - that is work hard and hopefully score some goals.' Crouch added: 'It is nice to hear when the manager has got belief in you and hopefully I can stay here for a few more years after this.' Stoke could not unsettle Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday in the same way they had in the home Barclays Premier League game before Christmas, and were well beaten 3-0. Crouch enjoyed his battle with Gunners defender Per Mertesacker, even if the German kept him quiet . Crouch, though, relished his 'gigantic' battle with 6ft 6in German defender Per Mertesacker. 'I have always enjoyed it, I don't want to give any defenders an easy ride and hopefully you can put yourself about to unsettle them,' he said. 'I have tried to do that and always try to do.' Stoke fell behind early after sloppy defending allowed Laurent Koscielny a free header in the six-yard box, and from then on could just not contain the rampant Gunners as Alexis Sanchez struck twice either side of the break. Crouch said: 'We have to try to stop them playing, to get in about them. They have world class players so if you let them play they are going to punish you and that is what happened. Asmir Begovic tries in vain to stop the ball crossing the line during Stoke's 3-0 defeat at the Emirates . 'In the game at home we did not let them play, we did not let them have any space and we played to our strengths. 'The early goal here killed us and we were not able to get back from that.' The defeat was a first in four games and Stoke are 11th ahead of the visit to Leicester. Crouch said: 'I think it has been a good season and that we can finish in the top half of the league. Apart from at Arsenal we have been in every game we have played. Even in the games we have lost we have given a good account of ourselves.'","Peter Crouch's contract at the Britannia Stadium is up in the summer .

Mauricio Pochettino claimed Roberto Soldado did not 'need to apologise' for his glaring six-yard miss in Tottenham's 4-2 FA Cup third-round replay victory over Burnley. Spain striker Soldado unwittingly diverted Ross Wallace's free-kick goalwards as Burnley plundered a two-goal lead in seven minutes at White Hart Lane.

'He's training in the last few weeks; his training sessions have been very good.' While big-money import Soldado continues to be upstaged by homegrown talent Kane, Burnley boss Sean Dyche also backed Soldado to come good in front of goal. 'He was in the right place: I've no problem with my strikers if they miss when they're in the right place,' said Dyche. 'I'm not bothered by mistakes if my players are in the right place.' Burnley manager Sean Dyche was concerned by his side's capitulation after taking a two-goal lead . Dyche was more concerned by his side's defensive errors that turned the game on its head. 'I don't know if we let it get away, they are a good side,' he said. 'But when you're 2-0 up and you make mistakes like we did, it will be tough. 'It was just the details that really hurt us tonight. They supplied the details and we didn't. You can't get away with that as this level.' Burnley now face a blank weekend on January 24, but Dyche does not expect any far-flung warm-weather training jaunts. 'Maybe we'll go to Scarborough!' he joked. 'Joking apart, I don't know what we'll do yet. 'We'll have to decide beyond that. Who knows if we'll benefit from that rest, there's no guarantee.

"Paul Jewell walked out of West Bromwich Albion after only a week in the job after being asked to accept a pay-cut that in turn would cover the salary of another new coach; Gerry Francis. In consultation with his legal team the former Wigan, Ipswich and Derby manager is now understood to be considering a case of constructive dismissal. Having agreed the terms of his employment to become assistant head coach to new boss Tony Pulis – indeed he was even sent a draft of his contract by the club – Jewell was then staggered to find himself being asked to accept a revised salary package. Paul Jewell left West Bromwich Albion after only a week as assistant head coach to Tony Pulis . This, Sportsmail understands, was a request made by Pulis but only after it was made clear to Pulis by his new employers that he could not add Francis to his team if it meant spending more than the agreed figure on his new backroom staff. Jewell and fellow coach Dave Kemp were asked to consider a pay cut – believed to be less than £20,000 each – last Friday, with Jewell returning on Monday to say that, having given the matter some thought, he was leaving after only seven days into his new role. While the 50-year-old had not signed the original contract, believed to be worth well in excess of £100,000 a year, he had already begun working for the club on those fiscal terms and he felt his new employers had unilaterally altered his payment. The news comes as a blow to Pulis, who is looking to guide West Brom to Premier League safety . While West Brom do not deny the request for a pay-cut was was behind Jewell’s departure, they insisted they had not broken any agreement with Jewell. 'We would dispute most strongly any suggestion that we have reneged on a deal,' said a spokesman. But a club that has been accused of penny-pinching in the past does appear to have lost a valuable member of its new coaching staff over what seems to be a relatively small amount of money. Angered by reports in Wednesday’s newspapers that he had left by mutual consent, Jewell issued a statement of his own. Gerry Francis has replaced Jewell at West Brom, continuing a seven-year working partnership with Pulis . ‘My departure was not by mutual consent,’ he said. ‘It is in the hands of my lawyer. I will not be making any further comment at this stage.’ An official club statement issued on Tuesday night said only: ‘Paul Jewell decided that he will not be continuing his recent assistance on a more formal basis.’ Jewell’s appointment represented a bold move by Pulis, who likes to surround himself with experienced deputies. His working relationship with Francis now enters a seventh year. The former QPR and Tottenham manager had been helping West Brom informally on a part-time basis since the 7-0 Cup win over Gateshead earlier this month. Asked by Sky on Wednesday if he was unaware of the reasons behind Jewell's departure, he said: ‘I've no idea. He was there Saturday, I was there Saturday at the game. I don't really know what the situation is from that point of view. I only found out myself last night.' The situation leaves Pulis now searching for another assistant, given that Francis only works part-time. While Jewell has already been linked with a move to Hull to assist Steve Bruce.","West Brom boss Tony Pulis added Paul Jewell as assistant head coach .

"Adrian insists there was never any doubt he would finish off the last penalty to down Everton and carry West Ham through their epic third-round FA Cup tie. The West Ham goalkeeper had already saved Steven Naismith's penalty only for Stewart Downing to miss their last, which would've won them the game but instead sent the shootout into sudden death. But after another four penalties had been scored by both, Adrian saved fellow goalkeeper Joel Robles's effort, then threw his gloves to the floor before running up and slotting in to win 9-8 after two sets of 90 minutes and extra time could not separate the sides. Adrian steps up to take the penalty that sealed West Ham's place in the FA Cup fourth round . Adrian celebrates scoring the winning penalty for West Ham in their FA Cup replay against Everton .

Afterwards Adrian declared: 'In that moment I felt so quiet and relaxed and I didn't have nerves. I thought: ""I'll take off my gloves, this game is over and I struck the ball"". 'I never took a penalty before – only in training for a joke, but not serious. Never in my life had I struck a penalty in an important game. 'I think this is my best moment for West Ham. I feel really, really happy for keeping us in the FA Cup. My team-mates kept working in the game. 'It was a crazy game for us, because they scored two goals with 10 men and it was really hard for us. We kept going and going and after that they shot their penalties so well. 'I took my gloves off so quickly because I was worried that the referee might blow his whistle and give me a yellow card for time-wasting!' Adrian dives to deny Everton's Steven Naismith during West Ham's penalty shootout . Adrian was in impressive for West Ham at Upton Park on Tuesday night . Since they lifted the FA Cup in 1995, 14 teams have won one of the three major domestic competitions... West Ham manager Sam Allardyce hailed his match-winning goalkeeper as one of the best in the Premier League. Adrian revealed that was the first goal he has ever scored in his professional career, after originally playing as an forward before moving between the sticks as a youngster. He added: 'I have celebrated my saves before normally, but never scoring a goal. 'Since I came to West Ham United, the fans have had a special relationship with me and I feel so happy. It's the first time I've scored an important goal so I celebrated with them and my team-mates. 'It's a big win because we now have so much confidence. The team played well and worked so well. The game was long but we needed to keep going and finally we got a nice win.' Now Adrian is hoping for a call-up from Spain manager Vicente Del Bosque after a series of stellar displays for West Ham, although Real Madrid’s Iker Casillas and Manchester United’s David de Gea stand in his way.

Celtic's Charlie Mulgrew (right) speaks to manager Deila during a training session in Gran Canaria . ‘I think the Kris Commons situation is the strangest situation in football just now,’ said the 56-year-old. ‘He will be squeezed out of the door if he doesn’t get what he wants. ‘Celtic are a poorer side without him, there’s no doubt about that. He is the one player in the team who has got a spark. ‘It could make the difference between Celtic winning and losing the league if Kris Commons leaves this month.’","Gary Mackay-Steven looks set to quit Dundee United for Celtic .

"Walter Smith has ruled out a return to Rangers in any official capacity. The Ibrox legend admitted on Tuesday that he regrets becoming a non-executive director under Charles Green’s regime in November 2012, before being elevated to chairman six months later. He resigned from that role in August 2013 – citing a ‘highly dysfunctional environment’ – and is adamant that his only future involvement at the club will be as a fan. Former Rangers manager Walter Smith speaks to the press in Glasgow on Tuesday . Three years ago, Smith was involved in a takeover bid that included Douglas Park - whose consortium is still awaiting an answer on the £6.5million emergency funding package they have offered the current board. However, while insisting Park would be well capable of restoring ‘trust’ between supporters and the hierarchy, the 66-year-old wouldn’t be tempted by a comeback to a formal role under any regime. ‘No, I wouldn’t go back onto the board again,’ said Smith, speaking at the launch of Level5 PR, a Glasgow-based media relations and sports management company. ‘I found it was an environment I wasn’t particularly comfortable in. I went on (the board) for what I felt were the right reasons. I thought at the time I could maybe help. As it turned out, I was wrong. Smith (left) and Rangers captain David Weir parade the club's trophies at Ibrox stadium in May 2011 . ‘I had resigned on two occasions and then eventually, being more or less the last man standing, I took the chairman’s position for a wee while to see if I could help. ‘I quickly realised that wasn’t going to be the case. There was nothing I could do to make any difference so I stepped away. I wouldn’t become involved as a director or anything like that again.’ Asked if that reluctance would extend to a technical position, such as director of football, he added: ‘Walter Smith as a manager would never have had anything to do with a director of football. ‘If you are a football manager you run the club. ‘I’m not going back. I’ll go back as a supporter. I’ve been along to a few of the games. That’s really what I’ll be doing now, taking my grandkids to a few of the games. I hope they can maybe support a Rangers more like the one I used to support myself.’ Smith (right) sits alongside former Celtic player Murdo MacLeod at the launch of Level5 PR on Tuesday . Smith, who won 10 league titles over two spells as Rangers boss, still reflects ruefully on accepting the directorship in the first place. ‘Is it a regret? Yes, it is,’ he said. ‘I did what I thought was best to try and help out. I think that if you were seen not to be trying to help after what happened with Craig Whyte then people would have said you know a bit about the club and should go back in. But it turned out that wouldn’t have mattered anyway. ‘I don’t think anyone would have thought all this would have carried on over three or four years. It has been turmoil more or less throughout this time.’","Walter Smith has admitted he regretted joining the Ibrox board in 2012 .

"The bizarre decision to stage 2015 Rugby World Cup matches at Leicester’s football ground rather than Welford Road is demonstrated by the rugby club’s plans when the three group games are played. Leicester Tigers will be putting on their normal pre-match entertainment at Welford Road - just a short walk from the King Power Stadium - and giving their fans the chance to watch the games on big screens. This follows the demand by Tigers supporters to savour the World Cup on rugby premises rather than live at the football ground, where none of the matches have yet sold out. Welford Road cannot be used to host games because the International Rugby Board say the width of the pitch is two metres too short. Tigers chief executive Simon Cohen said: ‘There’s no doubt our fans would much prefer to watch World Cup rugby at Welford Road rather than the football ground and we are planning accordingly.’ Football club Leicester City's King Power Stadium will host 2015 Rugby World Cup matches .

It’s a sign of these politically correct times that Sky felt it necessary to explain Nicholas’ comment - knowing they would be damned if they did or didn’t. Nicholas also pointedly apologised to anyone offended by his remark rather than the words themselves. The last time Sky made such a high-profile apology came after cricket pundit Andrew Strauss described Kevin Pietersen as a ‘total c***’ believing he was off air. This was a rather more obvious decision to make than the Nicholas one. Charlie Nicholas apologised for the comments on Sky Sports News but it was Ian Condron's decision .

"Bradford manager Phil Parkinson apologised to his players for losing his cool but insisted his first-half dismissal did not overshadow another memorable night after his side knocked Millwall out of the FA Cup with a 4-0 third-round replay win. Parkinson and assistant Steve Parkin were both sent to the stands for their part in a mass melee in a frenetic first period that saw Millwall defender Mark Beevers dismissed and the home side score three times as Bradford produced another cup upset at Valley Parade. Parkinson and Parkin, whose side defied the odds two years ago to reach the Capital One Cup final, were ordered from the dug-out by referee James Adcock for remonstrating with Millwall defender Alan Dunne, whose challenge had sent Bradford striker James Hanson crashing into the advertising hoardings. James Hanson heads League One side Bradford ahead after just eight minutes at Valley Parade . Hanson celebrates his early strike as Bradford started the brighter during their FA Cup replay with Millwall . But after Billy Knott had added to goals from Hanson, Jon Stead and Andy Halliday to book a coveted fourth-round tie at Chelsea, Parkinson could not hide his delight. He said: 'There was a big prize at stake, to get the club into the fourth round for the first time in 15 years, so the tie at Stamford Bridge, we wanted to achieve that and we focused on the factors that would help us. 'I thought the lad that pushed James into the hoardings - I thought it was a dangerous challenge because there's a wall just behind them. 'Me and Steve reacted and ran down, as well as some of their staff, and the ref's decided to send me and Steve to the stands. 'I said to the lads at half-time I had to apologise for that because I had to ask them to keep their cool and stay on the pitch. 'But I'm glad it didn't ruin a great night.

Bradford striker Jon Stead takes his chance to fire the home side 2-0 up after just 17 minutes . Bradford will take on Chelsea on Saturday, January 24 and Parkinson is aware of the prestige surrounding a trip to the Premier League leaders and the subsequent cash windfall. 'I'm not sure (of) the amount but it will be worth a considerable amount of money when you look at it as a percentage of our overall budget,' the former Colchester and Hull boss added. 'So we're pleased with that and we set out with a focus to get there. It makes things easier all round for the club like it did with the trip to Wembley two years ago.' Millwall defender Mark Beevers was shown a straight red card for hauling down Hanson in the sixth minute and the Londoners never recovered. It was a forgettable night in a wretched season for Ian Holloway's side, FA Cup semi-finalists themselves two years ago. They are third bottom in the Sky Bet Championship table, have now won only two of their last 22 matches and boss Ian Holloway kept his players in the dressing room after what was a fifth defeat from their last six matches.

He did insist he would turn things round at the club. 'The lack of confidence in the team and in each other, we let a goal in almost straight away,' Holloway said. 'You could see how bad it is for everybody and in all my time in football I've never seen a team capitulate as bad as that. 'All I can do is apologise to the fans. We've got so much work to do. The lads don't look like a Millwall team, they didn't have any fight in them, they don't look like my team. 'Well done to Bradford. To a man they looked like they wanted it more than my lot after the sending off.' Both Bradford and Millwall fans were chanting 'You're getting sacked in the morning' and Holloway admitted those words hurt. 'It's football at the moment isn't it? I've been doing it 19 years and 860-odd games and this is football at the moment,' he added. 'I said it would be tough when I came here, but I didn't think it would be as tough as this.'

"When it comes to beating the buzzer, this is a near-impossible move.

With only 0.2 seconds left on the clock, Booker executed an over-the-head slap of the ball with two hands that landed with a swish, in what will undoubtedly become the basket of the year. Making the move even more incredible is that NBA rules require 0.3 seconds to complete a full catch and shooting motion, so any shot Booker made at the time had to be a tap.

"The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport Leagues in the world and every Thursday, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside. NEWSMAKER . Kobe Bryant – The Los Angeles Lakers star has never been afraid of speaking his mind, and he's taken a strong stance on the current state of American basketball. The 36-year-old claimed that European basketball players are better than American ones. Kobe said: ""I just think European players are just way more skillful. They are just taught the game the right way at an early age. They're more skillful. It's something we really have to fix. We really have to address that. We have to teach our kids to play the right way.” LA Lakers ace Bryant (left) passes the ball as Clippers' forward Blake Griffin defends the net in Los Angeles . One of the reasons Kobe believes European players are surpassing domestic ones is youth club basketball. Kobe added: “It's stupid. It doesn't teach our kids how to play the game at all so you wind up having players that are big and they bring it up and they do all this fancy crap and they don't know how to post. They don't know the fundamentals of the game. It's stupid.” Bryant (left) battles for position with Clippers' player Matt Barnes during Lakers' 89-114 defeat in Los Angeles . GOOD WEEK . Dirk Nowitzki - The Dallas Mavericks forward scored 15 points in Monday's 96-88 overtime win over the Brooklyn Nets to move past Moses Malone for sole possession of seventh place on the NBA's all-time scoring list.

The German sharpshooter entered the game with 27,397 career points, needing just 13 to surpass Malone's 27,409. Though he finished regulation with just 12 points, Nowitzki then got to move up the scoring list in dramatic fashion, nailing a contested three-pointer with 34 seconds remaining in overtime to extend his team's lead to an insurmountable 96-88. Nowitzki will now take aim at Shaquille O'Neal, who sits in sixth place on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 28,596 points. BAD WEEK . David Blatt - Losers of five of their past six games, the Cleveland Cavaliers have a plethora of concerns.

He never needed one. It was never a question."" It's natural for Griffin to be defensive about Blatt, whom he handpicked this summer to lead the Cavaliers. Remember that the last Cleveland regime, GM Chris Grant and coach Mike Brown, was viewed as a package deal. After the Cavs fired Grant last February, they relieved Brown of his duties just three months later.

"Jamie Carragher believes Manchester United would be unable to stop David de Gea from joining Real Madrid if the La Liga giants were to make a move for the Spanish goalkeeper. De Gea has been stringently linked with a move to the La Liga giants and talk a possible move to the Santiago Bernabeu heightened following Victor Valdes' move to Manchester United. And Carragher insists United would be powerless if Real Madrid were to come calling. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal discussing David de Gea . Jamie Carragher believes Manchester United will struggle to keep hold of David de Gea . Real Madrid target De Gea has been in fine form for Manchester United so far this season . Cristiano Ronaldo and Xabi Alonso left the Premier League when Real Madrid came calling . Speaking on Sky Sports' Super Sunday show, Carragher said: 'When Real Madrid come in - no matter who you are - they can still take them. 'They done it with Cristiano Ronaldo here [at Old Trafford]. Unfortunately as he's Spanish it may be that dream move for him one day. It was the same with Xabi Alonso at Liverpool. 'The worry for Louis van Gaal may be how close is De Gea to signing a new contract. That maybe in the back of his mind.' The former Liverpool defender also stated he does not believe Valdes will be happy playing second fiddle next season, if De Gea was to remain at Old Trafford. Carragher does not believe a keeper of Victor Valdes' calibre will be happy on the substitutes' bench . Carragher added: 'The start of next season Victor Valdes - due to his reputation and what he's won playing at Barcelona - will want some game time. 'He may get that as we expect Manchester United to be in the Champions League. So he will have more games to play but I don't see him ever overtaking De Gea. 'They have problems defensively but they don't concede that many goals because of him. Their defensive record is quite good. 'The manager has come in and every manager will want a good back up goalkeeper. He's maybe looked at Anders Lindegaard and thought he's not the answer. 'He knows Valdes from Barcelona and maybe they have a good relationship. I think the thing for Valdes between now and the end of the season will be about his fitness. He's had a long-term injury. He needs to get back, sharp and proper coaching at a big club, which he is used to.' Anders Lindegaard could be allowed to return to Scandinavia following Valdes' arrival at Old Trafford .","Jamie Carragher believes United will struggle to keep hold of David de Gea .

"Darren Webster dumped seventh seed Simon Whitlock out of the PDC World Championship with a shock 3-1 first-round victory at Alexandra Palace on Saturday. Webster made a fantastic start to the match and did not drop a leg on his way to winning the first set as an out-of-sorts Whitlock struggled to get a foothold in the game. Whitlock cut a relieved figure when he squared the match at 1-1 but that was as good as it got for the 2010 finalist. Danny Webster gestures to the crowd in delight during his match against Simon Whitlock . Whitlock congratulates Webster after a shock defeat in the first round of the PDC World Championship . Webster upped his game to take the third and fourth sets and averaged more than 94 points to his Australian opponent's 87 for the match. 'Simon wasn't at his best but I just tried to keep concentration today,' a delighted Webster told Sky Sports after securing his place in the next round. 'I was determined to try to win one for a change. I am so happy. Unbelievable.' Gary Anderson avoided Whitlock's fate by sealing a 3-1 triumph against Scott Kirchner. American Kirchner had earlier overcome New Zealander Mark McGrath to earn his first-round encounter against number four seed and 2011 finalist Anderson. Gary Anderson avoided Scott Kirchner's fate by beating Scott Kirchner on Saturday . The Flying Scotsman, who beat Adrian Lewis to win the Players Championship last month, did not look like his usual relaxed self early on but nevertheless took the first set. Kirchner responded superbly by winning three unanswered legs to draw level at 1-1 before Anderson's third-set win set him up and the 43-year-old sealed the victory after racing into the lead - after losing the first leg to his opponent - in the fourth to progress. Robert Thornton was in impressive form as he booked his place in the next round with a 3-0 victory over Andrew Gilding. The 47-year-old Scot lost just two legs in the comprehensive victory to set up a second-round showdown against Ronnie Baxter. Thornton hit two 180s in the first set and used his last dart on all three finishes to take the lead, with Gilding pinching just the one leg in reply. Thornton grabbed another pair of maximums on his way to second-set victory, before upping his game to clinch the third set and the match by hitting tops in the first, then pulling out a superb 144 outshot and wrapping it up in the next to seal a 97.6 average. Robert Thornton punches his fists in delight during his comprehensive victory over Andrew Gilding . Another significant upset of the first round saw Lawrence Ryder edge to a 3-2 victory over Justin Pipe. Australian Ryder fought back from 2-1 down to clinch victory courtesy of a strong finish that saw him win six straight legs to stun 17th seed Pipe. Ryder will face Terry Jenkins in the second round after he was a 3-1 victor against John Weber. Jenkins, a semi-finalist in 2011, was in control from the outset with no fewer than five 180s accrued in an extremely comfortable victory against his Australian opponent. Daryl Gurney fought back from 3-0 down to claim a 4-3 preliminary-round victory against Scott Mackenzie, but he was then outclassed by Baxter who moved into the second round with a 3-1 win against the Northern Irishman. Ronnie Baxter showed his class as he saw off a valiant effort from Daryl Gurney . Gurney pushed his opponent throughout but Baxter demonstrated his class when it mattered and sealed victory with a superb 12-darter including a 180 and a 104 finish. Ronny Huybrechts won all but two legs as he swept Andy Smith aside 3-0 to seal his progression to the next round. Missed doubles cost Smith dearly, with the Englishman missing four darts at doubles in the opening set, and two more at the start of the second as Huybrechts won the first six legs to set up a comfortable victory. Kyle Anderson also won through to the next round courtesy of a 3-0 triumph against Steve Beaton - who beat him by the same scoreline in the first round of last year's tournament. Anderson managed three 180s during the match, and the 27-year-old Australian wrapped up victory with a double five to set up a second-round encounter against Andy Hamilton.","The No 7 seed Simon Whitlock suffered shock defeat to Darren Webster .

"Sixteen-time world champion Phil Taylor will face Gary Anderson in the World Darts Championship final after he saw off Raymond van Barneveld 6-2 in the second semi-final. Taylor let a 2-0 lead slip as the Dutchman won the third set 3-0 and then punished a Taylor miss to level it up, but from then on ""The Power"" looked in imperious form as he won four sets in a row to reach his 20th world final.

Van Barneveld (right) watches on as Taylor closes out the semi-final 6-2 in sets on Saturday night . 'It was a bit of walk in the first two sets and then he came back and it was nip and tuck,' Taylor said. 'I thought to myself, ""You're in the semi-final, come on"" and I pushed on a bit. That's all I did. 'When we walked in, Gary said, ""I'll see you tomorrow in the final"". Barney's missus was behind him and she wasn't very happy but he didn't mean it like that.

"The line-up for 2015 Betway Premier League Darts has been announced with Stephen Bunting and Kim Huybrechts among those in the 10-strong list. Last year’s winner Raymond van Barneveld has been named among six wildcard selections alongside Bunting, the man he beat 5-4 in the quarter-final of the World Darts Championship at the Alexandra Palace. Among the other wildcard picks are Peter Wright, Dave Chisnall, Huybrechts and James Wade.

"The 2015 World Darts Championship is almost upon us with the festive fun set to commence at the Alexandra Palace in London on Thursday. Michael van Gerwen begins his defence of the title he won last year, but the likes of Phil Taylor, Adrian Lewis and Gary Anderson are all hungry to wrestle the Sid Waddell Trophy away from the Dutchman. Twenty sessions of top tungsten spread over a 17-day period over Christmas and New Year will decide who is the best darts player on the planet, and here is our guide to the big tournament. Peter Wright, Michael van Gerwen and Phil Taylor get ready for the 2015 World Darts Championship . Taylor (left) and Van Gerwen (right) are the two favourites for the title at Alexandra Palace . The PDC tweeted a picture showing Alexandra Palace being set up for the tournament . VIDEO 2014 World Champs: Standout moments . Phil Taylor has more world titles, but I'll buy more houses... THE MAIN CONTENDERS . Michael van Gerwen . The reigning world champion and No 1 seed for this year's tournament, Van Gerwen is among the favourites to win the title again. Having been beaten by Taylor in the 2013 final, the Dutchman bounced back in 2014 to beat Peter Wright and lift the Sid Waddell Trophy. Van Gerwen has won the World Grand Prix and European Championship this year, and begins his title defence against Joe Cullen on the opening night at Alexandra Palace.

VIDEO World Championship moments - Taylor v van Gerwen 2013 . Taylor's preparations overshadowed by illness to his mother . Phil Taylor . What more needs to be said about The Power than the fact he is a 16-time world champion? Taylor has accomplished everything in the game of darts and has nothing to prove. Taylor is the pre-tournament favourite at Alexandra Palace, and he begins his quest on Friday night against German Jyhan Artut. Taylor has had some personal issues to deal with leading up to the tournament with his mum Liz suffering from a lung infection. It remains to be seen how much his mum's illness affects his performance at Ally Pally. Taylor will enter the competition on Friday night when he faces German Jyhan Artut in the first round .

Adrian Lewis . Jackpot is a two-time world champion having won the title in both 2011 and 2012. But on both occasions since then, Lewis has run into a red-hot Van Gerwen, losing 5-4 in a thrilling quarter-final in 2013 and 6-0 in the semi-final 12 months ago. Lewis enters the tournament as the No 3 seed and opens his campaign against David Pallett. It's a tricky section of the draw he finds himself in, though, with potential matches with Raymond van Barneveld and Taylor on the way to the final. Gary Anderson . The Flying Scotsman has enjoyed a resurgence this year, entering the World Championship as the No 4 seed on the back of his win at the Players Championship, his first appearance in a premier event final for three years. Anderson took Ally Pally by storm in 2011 with his stunning scoring but came up short in the final, losing 7-5 to Lewis. But Anderson's life turned upside down soon after that when he lost both his brother Stuart and father Gordon in a short space of time. Anderson admitted that times were tough, but he seems to be back to his best on the oche now. Adrian Lewis won back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012, but has been beaten by Van Gerwen both times since . Gary Anderson is returning to his best form this year and is one of the favourites for the title . Peter Wright . Having never previously been past the third round at the World Darts Championship, Wright produced a remarkable run all the way to the final in 2014. The man known as 'Snakebite' was eventually beaten by Van Gerwen in the final, but he won many admirers, not least for his extravagant hair styles and dress sense. Wright stunned everybody at Alexandra Palace last year when he made it all the way to the final . VIDEO 'Snakebite' prepares the hair . James Wade . Wade has won all there is to win in darts, apart from the world title. He has never even appeared in the final at Alexandra Palace, twice losing in the semi-finals. Wade may never get a better chance at the title than in 2012, when he was 5-1 up in the semi-final against Lewis and somehow lost 6-5. Still, his experience and performances this year make it hard to exclude him from the list of contenders for the title. Should he get past Jamie Lewis in the first round, a potential second-round clash with BDO world champion Stephen Bunting could await him. James Wade has won every major trophy in the PDC apart from the World Championship . Stephen Bunting . The winner of the BDO title last year makes his debut in the PDC version of the world championship this year. He made the switch from the BDO to the PDC in January and produced solid, if not spectacular, results, including making the semi-finals of the World Grand Prix and the German Masters. Bunting is the sixth favourite for the tournament, as his lowly No 27 seeding means he could be facing No 6 seed Wade in the second round. Stephen Bunting will make his debut at Alexandra Palace having won the BDO world title last year . Raymond van Barneveld . It has been a long time since Barney produced his best at the World Championship. Since winning the 2007 world title, the best Van Barneveld has managed is a final appearance in 2009 and semi-final defeats in 2010 and 2013. Barney is seeded as low as 14, which means a potential third-round clash with Lewis awaits him. But if the Premier League champion finds his groove at the oche, he will be a tough man to beat.

"WBA and IBF super-middleweight champion Carl Froch has revealed he is close to agreeing a dream fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Las Vegas. Froch has sought a meeting with Chavez since stopping George Groves for the first time in November 2013 and is now confident promoter Eddie Hearn will deliver the fight. Carl Froch celebrates after defending his WBA and IBF super-middleweight titles at Wembley last May . It had been rumoured Froch would look to get his revenge on Andre Ward after his points defeat when the duo met in 2011, but the Nottingham fighter, 37, is only interested in a Box Office frenzy. ‘Professional boxing is a business first and foremost, let’s not forget that,’ said Froch. ‘People talk about Andre Ward, but I don’t want to fight him, he’ll probably beat me on points. ‘I’m a fighter and if I didn’t knock him out he’d beat me on points. Julio Cesar Chavez Jr celebrates his victory over Brian Vera in Los Angeles in September . ‘He’s not a big fight. American TV don’t want to show him on Box Office. So what’s the point?’ Froch hopes the Chavez fight will take place in March and insists plans beyond that will be dictated by his performance against the Mexican. ‘Dare I say it, but we’re nearly there with the Chavez fight in Las Vegas which we’ve long talked about,’ Froch added. ‘After knocking out Groves I was talking about the Chavez fight happening. It’s nearly there and I’m very optimistic that Eddie Hearn will make an announcement very soon. ‘This fight will take me to Las Vegas. Between beating Mikkel Kessler and speaking about Chavez, I’ve had the two epic fights with George Groves. Froch (left) floors George Groves during the super-middleweight bout at Wembley last year . ‘Last year was a great year for me. But definitely my next fight is in Vegas.’ 'I've talked about retiring since I fought Lucian Bute when everybody though I was going to get beaten. 'I would have retired had I lost that fight, but since winning it I've gone from strength to strength. 'Here I am in 2015 talking about a dream fight in Vegas. Hopefully I'm getting that fight with March being talked about. 'If I beat Chavez on style and I feel great doing it, why would I retire at 37 years old? I'm not 47, I'm 37 and still feeling fresh and fit. As long as I can still do what I need to do physically, then I'll continue to box. 'It's one fight at a time, which is the way I've approached it for the last couple of years. Chavez next and then who knows? 'James DeGale is looking really good. I'm impressed with what he's doing. He's improved so much. That's a massive fight in Britain.' Since losing to Andre Ward in December 2011, Froch has posted impressive wins against Bute, Yusaf Mack, Kessler and George Groves - his bitter domestic rival who failed to go beyond nine rounds in their two contests. Ward is the division's undisputed number one but his career has stalled due to promotional issues and injuries that have rendered him inactive for the past 14 months, while the American's spoiling style also makes him a less attractive opponent. Froch (left) and James DeGale ringside as they wait for an interview at the Liverpool Echo Arena last July . Chavez, the 28-year-old former WBC middleweight champion and son of all-time great Julio Cesar Chavez, is a more aggressive fighter who has a record of 48 victories from 51 outings, although he has experienced weight and disciplinary problems in the past. 'It's an intriguing fight, because you can't say either myself of Chavez will win,' Froch said. 'I've improved since the Ward fight, had a great win over Kessler and almost found the second Groves fight easy - it wasn't hard work. When I'm producing that, why would people doubt me against Chavez? 'Chavez is a great fighter and in this weight division he'll be more comfortable. The fight carries its question marks - will he be good enough at super-middle? Have I still got what it takes to go 12 rounds because Chavez is very tough?'

"Gary Anderson produced a stirring display to reach the final of the William Hill World Darts Championship and knock out reigning world champion Michael van Gerwen in the process. The Scotsman was in impressive form throughout the match on Saturday evening, overcoming the Dutchman 6-3 in sets in a pulsating encounter at Alexandra Palace. The world No 4 averaged an impressive 102.2 and a terrific 50% on doubles as the 44-year-old avenged the defeat handed to him by Van Gerwen in the last 16 of the same competition last year. Gary Anderson celebrates winning a crucial leg in his semi final against Michael van Gerwen on Saturday . The passionate Dutchman punches his fist in celebration after winning a leg in the match against Anderson . Anderson raced into a 3-1 lead before Van Gerwen pegged him back, levelling the match at three sets all. The outcome though, seemed inevitable once Van Gerwen missed double eight twice in the eighth set, leaving the door wide open for  Anderson to take a 5-3 lead. After the match Anderson told Sky Sports Darts: 'The more I put pressure on him, the more he missed. Anderson is pictured in action during the match against Van Gerwen on Saturday evening . Reigning world champion Van Gerwen congratulates Anderson on his semi-final victory . 'There were two sets I gave away, I was up 2-0 and I lost 3-2 so I gave him those but I'm quite happy.

"Inter Milan are ready to step up their pursuit of Lucas Leiva and leave Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers with a big decision. Roberto Mancini is a firm admirer of the Brazil midfielder and has made clear his ambition to take the 28-year-old to the San Siro during this transfer window to help Inter’s pursuit of a Champions League place. The Italian club are expected to make a bid in the next 24 hours. Had Inter shown their interest in the summer, Rodgers would not have stood in his way but the situation is not straightforward now as Lucas, who has two-and-a-half years left on his Anfield contract, has been a key figure in helping stabilise Liverpool’s results. Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva has emerged as a target for Serie A side Inter Milan . Despite previously being available, Liverpool face a decision to let the Brazilian leave on recent form . Former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini (left), pictured with Javier Zanetti, is a known admirer of Leiva . Lucas has started 11 of the last 12 matches and the only game he missed was at Manchester United, when they lost 3-0. That defeat is the only reverse Liverpool have suffered since Rodgers decided to make his team more difficult to beat after they lost 3-1 at Crystal Palace on November 23. Another Liverpool midfielder could also head to the San Siro this month but it is AC Milan who want to sign Suso. They are prepared to offer £1million to secure the Spaniard’s early release, rather than waiting until the end of the season to get him on a Bosman. The Serie A side are reportedly ready to pay £1million to bring in Suso (right) before next season . Brendan Rodgers hopes struggling keeper Simon Mignolet will be up to the task against old club Sunderland . Raheem Sterling, meanwhile, should finally put pen to paper on his new contract next week. The England winger has been given some time off by Rodgers to freshen up and has spent his break in Jamaica. Rodgers takes his side to Sunderland on Saturday and hopes the return to Wearside will spark an upturn in Simon Mignolet’s form. Doubts persist over the Belgian’s suitability to Liverpool. ‘He is a wonderful shot-stopper and makes saves,’ said Rodgers, who bought the keeper from the Black Cats for £9m in 2013. ‘He is doing everything he can to be the best he can be.’ Raheem Sterling is expected to sign a new deal after being given a break to holiday in Jamaica (above)","Inter Milan and preparing a bid to sign defensive midfielder Lucas Leiva .

"Maria Sharapova beat Ana Ivanovic in the final of the Brisbane International on Saturday in a display that bodes well for her chances at the Australian Open. It has been seven years since Sharapova won her only Australian Open title but if she can take her form from Brisbane to Melbourne, a second title does not seem out of the question. Sharapova had to work hard to beat Ivanovic, coming from behind to beat her 6-7(4) 6-3 6-3 but the Serbian is a good measuring stick. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Maria Sharapova wins the Brisbane International . Maria Sharapova holds up the Brisbane International final trophy after the women's final against Ana Ivanovic . The Russian tennis star celebrates after winning the match against Serbia's Ivanovic . Sharapova not only beat Ivanovic in the 2008 Australian Open final but both women are in devastating form heading towards the first grand slam of the season, starting on January 19. 'I played four good matches against very different types of opponents,' Sharapova said. 'I couldn't have asked for better preparation.' The Russian dropped just nine games in getting to the final while Ivanovic showed nerves of steel to see off her opponents to join Sharapova, ranked number two in the world. It was a match that could have gone either way but Sharapova proved too strong once she got her nose in front in the deciding third set at the Pat Rafter Arena. Sharapova poses with her trophy while opponent Ivanovic looks in the Brisbane crowd . 'She deserved to win the first set, no doubt, but I hung in there,' Sharapova said. 'It was important to get that break. I held that and the third set came down to a few points really.' Winning the Brisbane International provided Sharapova with her 34th WTA career title and her fifth in the last nine months, a red-hot span in which she also captured a second French Open and a first China Open. The 27-year-old has won at least one title every year since 2003, an unbroken streak of 15 years. For Ivanovic, who has begun a resurgence up the world rankings in the past year, the pain of losing was compounded by an abdominal strain which forced her to seek medical attention but is unlikely to disrupt her Australian Open campaign. 'I really thought it was a high quality match from the first moment on. There were not many unforced errors. We both played a high quality match I thought,' Ivanovic said.

"The Australian Open has increased its prize money for this month's tournament to a record £24.1million. Tournament organisers announced a prize pot of £19.5m in October, an increase of £1.8m on 2014, but have ramped it up again because of the weakness of the Australian dollar. The men's and women's singles champions will each earn £1.7m while first-round losers at the tournament, which begins on January 19, will take home £18,500.

'But we have an ongoing commitment to the players that we are determined to help improve the pay and conditions of life on the international tennis tour. We are honouring that commitment. 'We as an international tennis community still have some work to do in ensuring that the life of an international professional tennis player is properly compensated. 'This increase is simply the Australian Open honouring our pledge to the players that we will continue to look at all ways and means possible to get this right. 'That involves increasing prize money as well as cutting and where possible removing the costs associated with playing our events.' Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley speaks to the media at Melbourne Park last October . A general view of Melbourne Park during last year's Australian Open tournament . The announcement means the Australian Open's prize money has doubled since 2007 and increased by 14million over the past four years. Prize money has been an increasingly hot topic in tennis over the past couple of years, with players pushing to be given a greater slice of revenue. The grand slam tournaments have all responded while the ATP recently announced increases on the main tour and the second tier Challenger Tour. The latter is a recognition that making a decent living as a tennis player is increasingly tough and the International Tennis Federation, which oversees tournaments at the lowest level of professional tennis, has also announced proposals to increase levels of pay.","The Australian Open has ramped up its prize pot to £24.1million .

"For Luis Figo, Monday’s Ballon d’Or announcement is a straight fight between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi – but there’s only one winner. The former Portugal international, who played for both Real Madrid and Barcelona, says his fellow countryman Ronaldo ‘has to’ retain his crown. And, rather amusingly, Figo claims the pair are the ‘truffles and caviar’ of world football. Cristiano Ronaldo should win the Ballon d'Or for a second year running, according to Luis Figo . Former Portugal international Figo says Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are the 'truffles and caviar' of world football . Messi has won the Ballon d'Or four times out of the last five years for his performances for Barcelona . Messi was in fine form and on the scoresheet as Barcelona beat Elche 5-0 in the Copa del Rey on Thursday . Ronaldo, whose goals last season fired Real to a first Champions League title since 2002, is the favourite to beat both Messi and World Cup winner Manuel Neuer. ‘It's hard to choose between truffles and caviar, but for me it has to be Cristiano. He’s had a fantastic year all the way through for Real,’ Figo said. Neuer – the sweeper goalkeeper to have captured the imagination long before the summer tournament in Brazil – would become the first stopper to claim the prize since Lev Yashin 52 years ago. And while Figo is insistent Ronaldo will take the gong, he does understand the clamour for Neuer. ‘I know Germany won the World Cup and I understand there are those who think Neuer, who is such a great keeper and was a big part of their success, should win it,’ he added.

He represents a type of football that transcends borders. 'As for Manuel Neuer, he's given us a new way of interpreting the role of a goalkeeper: not only is he very good with his feet, he also brings more mobility to his team. On top of that, he's obviously a superb shot-stopper and Germany's world title owed a lot to him. 'I'll chance a prediction and say the winner will be Neuer.

"Lionel Messi's days at Barcelona could be over, according to former Camp Nou favourite Luis Suarez. The Argentine superstar is rumoured to have fallen out with club president Josep Bartomeu and doesn't see eye-to-eye with head coach Luis Enrique.

'I think Messi is still happy at Barcelona because the club has helped him a lot. They have been very supportive ever since he was a kid,' Suarez told Cadena SER. 'But he might start to have doubts if a stratospheric offer were to come in. And you have to be careful when a player starts to gets doubts.

"Lionel Messi is perhaps the most famous graduate of Barcelona's famed La Masia football factory. One of the best players in the world alongside Real Madrid's talisman Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi has dazzled and delighted since a young age having joined the Spanish academy in 2000. Blistering pace, exquisite control and unstoppable skill, Messi has it all. However, judging by the current crop of young talent on show amongst the Barcelona youth ranks, the La Liga giants have a host of young stars waiting in the wings, ready to replicate Messi on the Nou Camp pitch. Lionel Messi is one of the most famous graduates of Barcelona's famed La Masia football factory . Some of the sumptuous strikes and mesmerising moves produced by the youngsters currently on Barcelona's books are strikingly similar to those of the first-team. From Xavi to Cesc Fabregas, Andres Iniesta to Pep Guardiola a host of world-class talent has been nurtured at Barcelona and the production line shows no signs of slowing. Judge for yourself... here are the top ten goals from the Catalan giants' famous La Masia football factory. Barcelona stalwart Xavi (pictured), Andres Iniesta and Cesc Fabregas all came through the club's youth ranks . VIDEO: Scroll down to watch top ten  goals from Barcelona's La Masia football factory . 10. JEAN MARIE DONGOU . Cameroonian forward Jean Marie Dongou arrived at La Masia through the Samuel Eto'o foundation and, at the age of 19, has already made one appearance for the Barcelona first-team. The striker's tidy finish, hit across his body at the near post for Barcelona B against Alcoron, begins the top ten countdown. Talented Cameroonia frontma Jean Marie Dongou arrived at Barcelona through the Samuel Eto'o foundation . Dongou, pictured up against defender Thomas Vermaelen during training, has made one first-team appearance . 9. NICOLAS FUENTES . Pint-sized Nicolas Fuentes may share Messi's haistyle and slight frame but also glides across the pitch like the Barcelona No 10. Playing for the Catalan side's Under 12 D side in November the youngster weaved his way past a Cornella defender before sending a powerful left-footed effort past the goalkeeper and into the corner of the net. Nicolas Fuentes shares Messi's sumptuous ball control as well as the player's hairstyle ad slight frame . 8. AITOR CANTALAPIEDRA . Aitor Cantalapiedra must be a defender's nightmare with his weaving runs causing mayhem. In at No 8, the Barcelona Under 18s star cuts in from the right, races towards goal and  leaves his first victim on the floor and jinks past two more opponents before coolly curling the ball into the back of the net. Aitor Cantalapiedra's skills left one defender on the floor before cooly curling the ball into the back of the net . 7. PAU SERVAT . Some of you may remember little Pau Servat. The youngster went viral back in 2013 having shed some tears following a missed penalty. Luckily for Servat, he managed to bag the winning goal in the second half! In this rundown, Servat found the net once more, launching a powerful left-footed rocket high into the corner of the net. Pick that one out! Pau Servat once missed a penalty for his side but left the goalkeeper with no chance with this stunning strike . 6. IKER ALMENA . Iker Almenia completed a tidy team move with the cheekiest of backheel's. The finish would have made Nwankou Kanu proud (Remember that goal for Arsenal against Middlesbrough) as well as fellow Spaniard Ayoze Perez who pulled off the same trick to score for Newcastle against Tottenham this season. Iker Almenia produced a cheeky backheel which compatriot Ayoze Perez would have been supremely proud of . 5. IKER MERINO . Iker Merino wasn't even born when Macedonia's Artim Sakiri curled the ball up and over England goalkeeper David Seaman from the corner spot back in 2002. However, that did't stop young Merino producing a carbon copy of the goal almost 12 years later. Iker Merino produced a stunning curler from the corner spot which looped high over the helpless goalkeeper . 4. ABEL RUIZ . Under 14 striker Abel Ruiz was coolness personified against Girona at No 4 in the countdown. The young Barcelona frontman received the ball in the area with the goalkeeper closing in before delicately chipping the ball into the net. Abel Ruiz, a member of Barcelona's Under 14 side, kept his cool to chip the goalkeeper  against Girona . 3. LIONEL ENGUENE . Another young Cameroon player in the La Masia academy courtesy of the Samuel Eto'o foundation, Lionel Enguene looks an incredible talent. Facing PSG in the UEFA Youth League, the 19-year-old started a blistering run from the centre circle into the area before sending the goalkeeper the wrong way. Wearing the No 10 shirt like Messi, it's a goal the Argentina international himself would have bee proud of. Lionel Enguene scored a brilliant solo effort against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Youth League . Cameroonia striker Enguene arrived at Barcelona also arrived in Spain through the Samuel Eto'o foundation . 2. ALEN HALILOVIC . Having amassed seven caps already for the Croatia national team, Alen Halilovic has been impressing for Barcelona's second string following his March arrival from Dinamo Zagreb. Starring against Girona the 18-year-old receives the ball in his own half and gallops forward. Showing great feet the midfielder charges into the box before thundering the ball home. Seemingly like so many of the other great goals in this list, this particular strike and movement certainly bares a resemblance to the shooting style and forward running of another Barcelona graduate... Alen Halilovic, signed from Dinamo Zargreb, ran with the ball from his own half before firing the ball goalwards . Alen Halilovic has impressed for Barcelona B and has already played for the Croatian national team . 1. RIQUI PUIG . Barcelona are famed for their brilliant team moves and the distinctive style of play has clearly been passed down the academy. Riqui Puig, who only turns 16 in August, start and ends the move which takes the No 1 spot in the list of La Masia goals. 'Pass and move, pass and move' is the only thing going through the minds of these young Barcelona hopefuls as the team move up the field perfectly threading the ball to each other before Puig cooly places the ball to score at Baladona. Riqui Puig started and finished a stunning team move to claim No 1 spot in La Masia's top ten goals .","Watch the top ten goals scored by Barcelona's incredible youth teams .

"The moment that Ahmad Benali decided that English lower league football was perhaps not for him came when he was told to train on his own for two weeks for wearing a hat. A former England youth midfielder - born and raised in the shadow of Maine Road - Benali was on loan from Manchester City at Rochdale in 2011 when he reached what he views now as a fork in the road of his career. 'I had captained all the youth teams at City and had been told I was one for the first team in the future,' Benali reflected in his broad Manchester accent. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ahmad Benali scores a screamer for Brescia vs Cittadella . Ahmad Benali (left) in action for Manchester City as a youngster and for current side Brescia (right) Benali (left) pictured during the club's launch of the 'ecademy' with the likes of Reece Wabara (right) and Jeremy Helan (second left) 2014-15 - Brescia - Four goals in 20 appearances . 2013-14 - Brescia - Four goals in 34 appearances . 2012-13 - Brescia - 10 appearances . 2011-12 - Rochdale - 2 apperances . 'I went on loan to Rochdale but wasn't in the team. They were just lumping it up to the strikers and that wasn't my style so I was on the bench. 'I turned up for a game one Saturday and was wearing a woolly hat - it was cold - and that was it. 'I was hammered by the manager and spent the next two weeks training on my own. I decided then that I had to do something else.' For Benali - who had been at City since he was eight - the choices were stark. A change of ownership at his boyhood club had eventually led to a change of manager and words of encouragement from Mark Hughes were not followed up by his successor Roberto Mancini. In the summer of 2012 - at the age of just 20 - Benali left Manchester to join Brescia in Italy's Serie A. 'It was obvious that when City got all the money things would change and they did,' he reflected. 'I used to train with the first team at that time and I saw a future there if I proved myself good enough. 'I had been given a pro contract by Sven Goran Eriksson and I saw other young English players like Joey Barton and Michael Johnson breaking through a few years ahead of me. 'All I wanted to do was play for them and I really thought I would one day. Benali in action for the Serie A side against Reggina in May 2014 . Benali watches on as Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery goes on the attack during a pre-season in July 2013 . 'But after the club changed hands doors began to close for people like me. I saw the big foreign players like Robinho being bought at the top level and I knew it was over. 'I could have gone in to the lower leagues but the Rochdale experience scarred me. 'At clubs at that level the coaches talk about nice tactics and systems in pre-season but as soon as they lose a few games they panic and just start whacking it up the pitch. 'In England, you get thrown in like that and it can ruin you if you are a smaller, skilful player. 'I have seen too many good young, technical players get lost in the English league system. They go down the leagues and never come back. They disappear. 'It was depressing and I didn't want that to happen to me. When I got the chance to move to Italy I took it with both hands. 'It was scary as I was so young. But I thought it may save my career and it did.' Two-and-a-half seasons on, Benali is a Libyan international and vice-captain of his Italian club. A regular in his Brescia's midfield, he returned to Manchester for his winter break recently to reflect on his time at a club that has now been hit by financial troubles. Ben Mee - a former City youth graduate like Benali - has performed admirably for newly-promoted Burnley . The day we met, in a cafe in the suburb of Didsbury, Benali was due to fly back to Italy to resume his season. That morning he had been paid for the first time in three months and he has decided to leave when his contract expires at the end of the season. There is an offer from Inter Milan - ironically coached by Mancini - but Benali knows the intention would be to loan him out. 'I have learned so much in Italy and have become a much better player,' he recalled. 'I would come back to England to play now if I got the right club. It's my home, after all. But I have an open mind as to where I go next. 'It was a real eye opener when I went there two and half years ago. I didn't speak Italian and had to learn quickly. And the training there is so different from England. 'It's all tactics and eleven v eleven games. Kieran Trippier (right) - pictured vying for the ball with Harry Kane (left) - has also impressed for Burnley . 'I have become a tactical robot. I know every system on the planet now! 'The Italian players can't believe the days off the English get. They don't want time off. They want to learn. They develop you. 'I arrived as a nobody and I am a senior player now. I would never have believed that. 'I have a wife and two children and I am proud of all that.' Benali is not bitter that he didn't make it at City. Other City graduates of similar age - such as Burnley duo Ben Mee and Kieran Trippier - have gone on to play in the Premier League and that only serves to encourage him. He is rightly proud of the rather different road he has travelled and laughs when told about the new facilities his old club have at their new £200million academy. 'It wasn't quite like that at the old Platt Lane but I loved it there,' he said. 'I wouldn't change it.'","Ahmad Benali is currently on the books of Serie B side Brescia .

"Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard has promised that he will move to New York City FC at the end of the Premier League season.

'David de Gea is the best goalkeeper in the world' - and click here for his view on the man he'll battle for a place in the United line-up . Manchester United have moved a step closer to securing David de Gea on a new contract on the very day they confirmed the arrival of his new No 2 Victor Valdes. United have handed Valdes an 18-month deal with the option of an extra year's extension and Old Trafford manager Louis van Gaal confirmed that the 32-year-old will slot in as the club's No 2 goalkeeper. However, it is the future of De Gea that is concerning many fans and it is understood that United are now confident of agreeing a lucrative new deal with the 24-year-old very soon. Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea is close to extending his current deal at Old Trafford . Red Devils ace De Gea has been in fine form during the course of the season . Former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes (left) has joined Manchester United as De Gea's understudy . Sportsmail recently reported that United and De Gea's agent Jorge Mendes wanted to conclude a deal quickly and sources at the club have now confirmed that the matter is moving rapidly in the right direction. De Gea is now recognised as one of the best goalkeepers in the game and only has 18 months left on his contract at United. Indeed his compatriot Valdes suggested on signing his own deal that De Gea now has no peers in world football. Valdes, speaking to MUTV, said: 'I think now, at the moment, he is the best goalkeeper in the world. 'His performance every day and in every game shows everybody that his level is very high. He has had a great year and it is very nice. Now I think he is the best goalkeeper in the world.' On the anticipated rivalry, Valdes added: 'I am here to help everybody. Always in my career, I have played to help my team-mates, to help my coach and to help everybody. I am a part of the team and I am not a problem, I am just a part of the team.'

"In 2013, Manchester United's goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek gave an interview to a Dutch newspaper in which he spoke at length about Victor Valdes. His appreciation is clear. 'Victor is a goalkeeper but he is also the 11th outfield player and capable of constructing play. [Chelsea's Thibaut] Courtois for example is physically imposing and has charisma but he does not have this ability to construct the game.' 'The work of Valdes at Barcelona consists 80 per cent of the time in constructing play, while the other 20 per cent of the time he does the normal work of a goalkeeper. He receives very few shots against his goal.' Victor Valdes (centre) watches Manchester United play Chelsea at Old Trafford back in October . The former Barcelona goalkeeper has agreed an 18-month deal to join Manchester United . United goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek (left) is a huge admirer of Valdes' style of play . Given the way that United have defended at times this season, Valdes may soon see those percentages radically change and he may find himself tested with an unfamilar regularity. Nonetheless, Hoek was making reference to one of Valdes' greatest strengths as a goalkeeper. The first roots of the Barcelona model of possession football were laid by Louis van Gaal and he imposed a school of thought that a goalkeeper must contribute to different phases of the game and is not only there to prevent the ball going into his net. It means he is there to build attacks, to mop up the danger and prevent the opposition from creating opportunities. Hoek is the advisor that Van Gaal leans on most heavily and he is believed to be the world's best at developing this kind of goalkeeper, the sweeper-keeper. Manuel Neuer is deemed to be the best at this but Valdes has been at it for some time now. Pepe Reina is another Hoek protege. David de Gea, equally, is more than adept with the ball at his feet - he played for his school team as a striker until the age of 14 - but he does not impose his personality on the game excessively. That may be something to do with the more conservative instincts of his previous coaches, principally Emilio Alvarez Blanco at Atletico Madrid and Eric Steele at Manchester United. What they admired above all in De Gea was his tranquility. When I asked Blanco whether De Gea is now a match for Neuer, he answered: 'Better than Neuer, even. Neuer is an unbelievable goalkeeper with extraordainary ability, but for me he can be a little too impulsive. For me, a goalkeeper is someone that is usually calm and should not create moments of insecurity for the team. David never does this.' David de Gea, pictured celebrating his side's equaliser against Stoke City, is United's current No 1 . Valdes rushes out to prevent Wayne Rooney scoring against Barcelona in the 2011 Champions League final . 'David, at the very start, was defined by his calmness in the goal. This is the most important quality for a goalkeeper. David showed a maturity beyond his years, he understood the tactical, technical and mental aspects of the game. 'For me, he is the perfect goalkeeper in the modern game. in terms of his height, his weight, his pace, agile, if we were to make goalkeepers in a factory, he wouldn't be far off. If we were to design a goalkeeper on a computer programme, in terms of height, pace, agility, the length of his arms, his reach, the size of his hands, it would come out with David de Gea.' Van Gaal and Hoek appreciate De Gea's talents - how could you not this season? - but this may be one part of his game that they are keen to develop. Those who watch United frequently will notice that De Gea has begun to take a more commanding approach in recent months and take a few more chances to deal with danger. His improved English undoubtedly has contributed to this but the Hoek effect is also taking shape. His game has also noticeably come on since Valdes began training with United in the autumn. That may be a coincidence but De Gea is somebody that responds well to competition. As a teenager at the Atletico Madrid academy, he spent time behind Everton's Joel Robles in the pecking order. To break into the senior team, he had to dislodge two goalkeepers, Sergio Asenjo and the experienced Roberto. He will not be frightened by Valdes' reputation, only energised. This is the environment that Hoek will be aiming to create. De Gea pulls off a save during United's 1-0 win against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in November . Valdes (left) works out, wearing a Red Devils snood, with United's first-choice keeper De Gea . Valdes, pictured making a save for Spain, is recovering from injury and has not played since last March . Hoek's status in European football could barely be higher. In 2013, he was invited by Manchester City to address their entire academy. On a special day visit, he fielded questions from City's coaches and then led a meticulously-prepared session on possession football and playing out of defence. One observer revealed that City were 'blown away' by the extent of Hoek's knowledge and expertise. In Catalonia, they still marvel at Hoek's dedication and talent. At Barcelona, he monitored Valdes' progress regularly during Van Gaal's first spell between 1996 and 2000, when he would take responsibility for the coaching of goalkeepers throughout the entire structure of the club. He would often go along to the Under 15 and U16 team to put on a session for Valdes and his contemporaries. Last month, I spent some time with Martinez Vilaseca, who worked at Barcelona for 29 years and directed the famous La Masia academy. 'Frans Hoek, for me is the best goalkeeper coach in the world,' Vilaseca began, 'I have never seen anybody else like him in the football world. 'With Van Gaal, he was training the goalkeepers from age 10 and 11 through to the first team. Hoek did stunning work with Victor Valdes, Pepe Reina, now I think that De Gea has improved rapidly with this coach. Hoek, pictured with Holland's Tim Krul, is regarded as one of the best goalkeeping coaches in the world . Valdes launches himself into the air to claim a cross against Manchester City in February last year . 'De Gea is now the No 1 goalkeeper for Spain and Hoek is the best in the world. De Gea has always had the potential, we all knew that in Spain. He has come through the age groups, U17 World Championships etc. With the coaches he has had, he has developed his authority and composure.' As things stand, De Gea remains first choice but he will be challenged. Yet challenges await Valdes, also. Van Gaal knows him well - he handed him his debut at Barcelona in 2002 - but he is not the sympathetic kind. Long-term injuries are mentally, as well as physically gruelling. He may privately have wondered whether his body will be the same again. Will he still be as fast? Will he still be as agile? Can he rediscover the form that leads many in Barcelona to believe he is the club's greatest goalkeeper? In European games against English sides, he sometimes appeared vulnerable under the high ball. There may be the kind of culture shock that De Gea experienced in his early days, although his experience, you would think, would prevent major problems. Valdes will need to improve his English significantly but he is already placing roots in Manchester. His family will move over and they will find a seven-seater car already waiting for them. He is now house-hunting in the Wilmslow area. Evidently, he is not at Old Trafford to twiddle his thumbs. At Barcelona, he won 21 trophies, including three UEFA Champions League medals. United now have two world-class goalkeepers. Let the battle commence.","Victor Valdes has agreed an 18-month deal to join Manchester United .

'Victor is a very experienced goalkeeper and his record speaks for itself. 'I have said on many occasions that Manchester United will always be interested in the best players. 'Victor has remained very professional throughout his rehabilitation from injury and has been very impressive during his training sessions with the first team over the past weeks. 'He joins the club as the No 2 goalkeeper and is a great addition to the first team.' Valdes played a major role in Barcelona's success during his 12-year stint at the Catalan giants, winning six La Liga titles and the Champions League on three occasions during his time at the club.

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is confident significant funds will be available to strengthen his squad. Pardew left Newcastle to take over at Selhurst Park last week and is now tasked with securing safety for the Eagles, who are currently 18th in the Barclays Premier League. Palace are eager to boost their attacking options before the transfer window closes on February 2, and chairman Steve Parish is reportedly ready to sanction a club-record offer for Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomis. Alan Pardew needs to make signings to strengthen Crystal Palace's survival bid . Former Newcastle boss led the Eagles to a 4-0 FA Cup victory over Dover in his first game in charge . 'Is that the kind of backing I'd hope for? Of course,' Pardew said. 'I can't say anything about the financial side - I think that's unfair on any club we're talking to. 'But the chairman and the board are keen to try to bring a player or two and I know they're working hard towards that. 'We have to wait and see, it's complicated securing any player and particularly a striker.' Pardew added: 'I spoke to Steve on my arrival here, after the club initiated the transfer. Crystal Palace have reportedly prepared a club record offer for Swansea striker Bafetimbi Gomes (right) 'I told him we're going to need some funding because we need to get new players and he gave me the assurances that he would do his very, very best to do that.' Palace winger Yannick Bolasie has impressed during the first half of the season but Pardew insists it would take an 'extraordinary' offer for the 25-year-old to be sold. 'Like with any player you can never say never, and I learned that at Newcastle, losing Andy Carroll on the last day of the window,' Pardew said. 'So never say never but I think it would take an extraordinary bid to take him away from this football club in the situation we are in. 'I would be very surprised if any club wanted to make that phone call.' It would take an 'extraordinary offer' to tempt Crystal Palace to sell Yannick Bolasie (right) in January . Pardew's first league game in charge on Saturday sees the Eagles host Tottenham, who will be in confident mood after a superb 5-3 win over Chelsea on New Year's Day. 'It's important when you're fighting relegation you don't hit teams in red hot form and Tottenham are, so it's not the greatest of starts,' Pardew said. 'They were terrific against Chelsea. The fact the Europa League campaign has closed down has helped them because that's a huge factor, which we suffered with at Newcastle. 'This is a great period for them and we're going to have to try to knock them out of their stride.' Pardew added: 'What I do know is from the welcome I've had, the place will be jumping for us and we need to exploit that.'","Alan Pardew is confident of strengthening his squad in January window .

"Ronald Koeman has heaped pressure on rival manager Louis van Gaal by insisting Manchester United have to be challenging for the Barclays Premier League given the money he spent in the summer. United are nine points behind leaders Chelsea and Manchester City, both on 46 points, and face Koeman's Southampton in a crucial match on Sunday. Van Gaal was backed in the transfer market last summer to the tune of £150million – which included buying British record signing Angel di Maria for £59.6m – yet he has twice played down his side's chances of winning the title.

Van Gaal's United welcome Southampton to Old Trafford on Sunday in a meeting of third and fourth . Just one point separates Manchester United and Southampton in the Premier League table . But Koeman, who has shared a fractious relationship with his counterpart since they fell out at Barcelona, claims Van Gaal has no excuses for not challenging for the title this campaign. 'They have great players so it's normal that they will fight for titles,' Koeman said. 'They have to. How you can spend that money, how can you sign that kind of players, and not be fighting to win titles? 'Everything is up to Manchester United. They have a very successful coach, they have great players, they have money, they have great fans, a great stadium. It's normal that you win titles. 'We had some problems in the past. We shake hands and I hope he will do well with United. It would be special to beat him, but I lost the last time and we try to put it right this time.'

Old rivals Van Gaal and Koeman shake hands before the match at St Mary's on December 8 . Southampton deserved at least a point against United when they lost 2-1 at St Mary's back in December, but two clinical goals from Robin van Persie decided the game. The match at Old Trafford on Sunday could see United pull four points clear of Southampton or result in the south coast club leap-frogging their opponents into third.

"Sam Allardyce is adamant that West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan agreed with him that they should sign Andy Carroll over Wilfried Bony in 2013. The Hammers boss admitted that the club could have signed the 26-year-old Ivory Coast international - who is currently being targeted by Manchester City - for just £8m before he joined Swansea, but instead chose Carroll, whose time at the club has so far been blighted by injury. Allardyce, however, has denied recent claims by Sullivan that they chose to spend £15m on the English striker instead on his insistence, telling the Evening Standard that it was a joint decision. Swansea City striker Wilfried Bony has been targeted by Manchester City this transfer window . Andy Carroll's West Ham career has been largely blighted by injury since his £15m move . 'Bony is a player who could have come to us a couple of seasons back.' said Allardyce. 'David Sullivan has said recently that he could have signed him for £8m but that I wanted Andy Carroll. 'My recollection was that, yes, we knew about Bony but we all agreed to go for Carroll — with the caveat that if the deal didn’t work out for any reason, we would switch to Bony.' West Ham are set to travel to the Liberty Stadium to face Bony's Swansea side on Saturday, although the Ivory Coast striker will be absent on African Nations Cup duty. The 26-year-old was the Premier League's top goalscorer in 2014, bagging 20 during the calendar year, but Allardyce has insisted he has no regrets over signing Carroll instead. Sam Allardyce says the decision to sign Andy Carroll over Bony was a joint decision . West Ham co-chairman David Sullivan has said recently that the club signed Carroll on Allardyce's insistence . 'Whatever anyone says now, at the time a bid for Bony, unproven in English football, would have represented a bigger risk than Andy, an established Premier League player. 'The likelihood of achieving success, had we signed Bony, was far less than with Carroll. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but, at the time, we were looking at these two possibilities. 'In my experience over more than two decades in football management, you always have to minimise the risk.'","Sam Allardyce adamant that club chairmen agreed to sign Andy Carroll .

"He is a Kop icon, the warrior-captain who has inspired Liverpool to many famous victories during an eventful quarter-century association with the club. But Steven Gerrard has revealed an awkward secret - he owned a Manchester United kit as a kid. The aspiring footballer, who grew up in the Huyton area of the city, had divided loyalties prior to joining Liverpool's academy at the age of eight and admits he could have ended up supporting their greatest foes. Liverpool idol Steven Gerrard has revealed he owned a Manchester United kit as a child . Gerrard has inspired Liverpool to many famous victories, including the 2005 Champions League triumph . The Liverpool captain announced this week that he will be leaving for LA Galaxy at the end of the season . He told FourFourTwo: 'Up until the age of eight I could have supported anyone. 'When I was younger I had all kinds of different kits: Tottenham, Norwich, Real Madrid, Barcelona... I even had a United kit. 'We had a few Everton fans in the family who were trying to get me down the Blue road, but once I started understanding the game and listening to my dad and brother talk about Liverpool's great history, that was it.' A picture of a seven-year-old Gerrard wearing an Everton kit and posing with the League trophy and the Charity Shield at Goodison Park emerged a few years back. But owning a United strip is a new revelation. Gerrard pictured in an Everton kit at Goodison Park as a child. The kit was bought by his uncle Leslie . Gerrard is adored by the Liverpool fans having been associated with the club for 25 years . Former England international Gerrard, 34, has certainly played a full part in that 'great history' but his association with the club as a player will finish when he moves to the Los Angeles Galaxy this summer. At least Gerrard has proven his loyalty to the Liverpool cause by scoring regularly against United - he has eight goals in 33 appearances against them.","Steven Gerrard has revealed he owned a Man United kit as a child .

"Australia survived a scare against Kuwait in their opening Asian Cup match as they came from behind to triumph 4-1. Veteran Tim Cahill sparked the tournament hosts' comeback, while Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak also got on the scoresheet for Ange Postecoglou’s side. The victory at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium sees the Socceroos get off to a perfect start in Group A which also contains South Korea and Oman. James Troisi scored Australia's final goal in their 4-1 Asian Cup win against Kuwait on Friday .

But after just eight minutes of the competition's curtain raiser that wasn't the case in front of sell-out 25,000 crowd as the unfancied Kuwait took a shock lead. Nabil Maaloul's side won a corner which defender Hussain Fadhel nodded past Australia goalkeeper Mat Ryan at his near post with a diving header. Ranked as the second-worst team in the tournament, Fadhel's goal stunned the partisan home support into silence. The Socceroos are hosting the tournament for the first time in their history and their supporters flocked to Melbourne in their droves as they illuminated the stadium in  green and gold. And it was a familiar face in Cahill that sparked the home fans into raptures when he equalised just after the half hour mark. The three-time World Cup star deftly met a pass from man- of-the-match Massimo Luongo just outside the box before driving a shot into the roof of Hameed Youssef's net.

Cahill's goal energised the Australians, who pinned Kuwait deep in its half over the ensuing minutes. And by half-time their pressure had told as they went to into the interval with the lead through Luongo. The 22-year-old capitalised on a long pass to head over the outstretched hands of Youssef. Luongo's goal saw the naturally defensive-minded Kuwait have to change their gameplan as they searched for an equaliser in the second half. However, Maaloul's men instead made their task harder as Australia extended their lead on 62 minutes. Australia were awarded a penalty just after the hour mark when Robbie Kruse (bottom) was fouled .

"Former United States defender Alexi Lalas has warned Steven Gerrard that he faces a huge challenge in Major League Soccer when he joins LA Galaxy in the summer. The Liverpool captain's move to the California-based club was confirmed on Wednesday and Gerrard will link up with his new team in July after spending 17 seasons in the Reds' first team. During his first interview for the club Gerrard said he was not moving to MLS for a holiday and Lalas, who was capped 96 times by the US and played for LA Galaxy for two seasons, insists it won't be plain sailing for the 34-year-old.

"Adebayo Akinfenwa looks and sounds like a man living the dream. He bounds in for this interview and shoots a beaming smile, still buzzing from a surreal couple of days in which he went from lower-league cult hero to a globally-trending superstar. The shirt given to him by Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard after AFC Wimbledon’s courageous FA Cup third round efforts on Monday night hasn't left his side since. He keeps glancing towards it, smiling. You sense he’ll never tire of telling that story. Adebayo Akinfenwa has enjoyed quite a week after heroics for AFC Wimbledon against Liverpool on Monday . Akinfenwa picked up the perfect souvenir - a signed shirt from his Liverpool idol Steven Gerrard . Akinfenwa (second right) celebrates after scoring against Liverpool in Monday night's FA Cup tie . The striker reacted quickest to bring Wimbledon level at 1-1 but Liverpool went on to win the tie 2-1 . Akinfenwa is marked by Liverpool's Mario Balotelli at a corner during Monday's game at Kingsmeadow . It is a predictably firm handshake. You don’t earn a nickname like ‘The Beast’ for being a scrawny shrinking violet. Akinfenwa is certainly a big guy and a big personality and he plays perfectly to the fan’s love of anyone who for whatever reason doesn't conform to the stereotype of what a footballer should look like. Here are the numbers of ‘The Beast’: he is 32 years of age, stands at 5ft 11in and weighs in at about 16st. He can bench press 180kg - or two-and-a-half Raheem Sterlings. He has played for 12 clubs in a career often described as ‘journeyman’ and plundered 160 goals. The 160th of those came in the 36th minute at Kingsmeadow on Monday when, despite his perceived slowness, he was quickest to react when goalkeeper Simon Mignolet flapped at a corner and drew the League Two side level at 1-1. Sportsmail's Adam Shergold challenges 'The Beast' to an arm-wrestling contest . The contest produced a predictable result as 'football's strongest man' Akinfenwa effortlessly claimed victory . Were it not for Gerrard’s two inspired interventions, Liverpool could easily have fallen victim to the greatest Cup shock of modern times. Still ‘The Beast’, having threatened to punch any team-mate who objected, gained the perfect souvenir from his idol. ‘Yeah, he signed it for me,’ he said, glancing again at the crumple of red on the table. ‘I’m grateful and I’m happy. It’s getting framed by the end of this week. I’m going to put it with the shirt I wore and have a little souvenir of a momentous day.’ Whether they’d previously seen Akinfenwa terrorising League Two defences or seen him play for the first time on BBC One on Monday, fans have wanted to know what makes up his diet and gym routine. Akinfenwa celebrates after AFC Wimbledon beat rivals MK Dons in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy . Akinfenwa in action for Northampton Town during the League Two play-off final in 2013 . Swansea City is one of the 12 clubs 'journeyman' Akinfenwa has played for in his career . Lifting the LDV Vans Trophy alongside Lee Trundle after Swansea's victory in 2006 . Here’s a typical day on the ‘Beast Diet’: ‘Breakfast is Weetabix with honey. At training there will be some kind of chicken. Our chef personally does chicken for me and that makes me very happy. ‘Then a shake in the afternoon. For dinner, again it’s probably chicken, potato and coleslaw. My partner is half-Nigerian, half-Caribbean so it may be the curry goat, rice and potato. It’s the carbs I need to eat. ‘I throw in the odd Nandos. Quarter-chicken, medium breast, chips, corn on the cob and five wings. I don’t deviate.’ Then something of a surprise: ‘Medium spice though, I can’t take hot. I know people keep thinking I do but I’m not a spicy kind of man.’ He then adds: ‘My fitness guy doesn’t think I eat enough. He always tries to get me to eat more.’ Wow. Such feasts certainly explain Akinfenwa’s size but what about the power and strength that makes him so difficult to defend against. That is explained by daily visits to the gym - the ‘Beast work-out.’ The 32-year-old in action for Wimbledon during their high-profile FA Cup tie with Liverpool . Akinfenwa was quickest to react to fire home Wimbledon's equalising goal against the Reds . GK - Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich and Germany) RB - Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich and Germany) CB - Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid and Spain) CB - Vncent Kompany (Manchester City and Belgium) LB - Jordi Alba (Barcelona and Spain) MID - Andres Iniesta (Barcelona and Spain) MID - Paul Pogba (Juventus and France) MID - Eden Hazard (Chelsea and Belgium) RW - Lionel Messi (Barcelona and Argentina) LW - Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid and Portugal) ST - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City and Argentina) ‘I can’t forget the notion I’m a footballer, so I can’t just keep pumping and pumping because I’ve still got to run around,’ he said. ‘Gym sessions will always consist of 40 minutes to one-hour cardio. I try to stay off the treadmill because of the pounding, so it’s the rower or the cross-trainer. ‘Then I go on to the stuff I really enjoy - the weights. Depending on the day, it’ll be the shoulders or arms or back. ‘I’ve done the 180kg [bench press] when I go to the gym with my younger brother - he’s my trainer and he pushes me. The big weights come into play. But I do maybe 120kg every day. I know what I need to do.’ And that regimen - day-after-day, season-after-season - has built ‘The Beast’. Akinfenwa already has a clothing line called ‘Beast Mode On’ and I suggest his next business venture could be a ‘Beast’ cookery show on Saturday morning TV and a ‘Beast Body’ DVD out in time for Christmas. ‘That’s quite a good plan,’ he smiles. Akinfenwa has issued an appeal to former Dons star Vinnie Jones, seen here in 1998 film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, for a part in his next movie . The point is, Akinfenwa is unique. Few lower-league players have their own fashion label, few go viral on Twitter and few are considered such an authority that they sit around a table with Rio Ferdinand, Joey Barton and Kyle Walker to pick their FIFA 15 Ultimate Team. But then, as the player with the highest strength rating on the wildly popular video game, nobody is going to argue with him. And the next target in the Beast’s quest for world domination could be Hollywood, using his Dons connections to land a part in Vinnie Jones' next movie. ‘He hasn’t even hit me up. Hey Vinnie! Vinnie, if you’re reading this… let’s do a movie together,’ he said. ‘I want to do something different to the stereotype - me being a security guard or a bouncer or a hitman. I’m thinking something like the love interest - I take Vinnie’s girl or something. I could work that. ‘In the end, we do a sing-song. They wouldn’t see that coming.’ It could well be a blockbuster.

"Wimbledon legend Dave Beasant has criticised his former team-mate John Fashanu over claims he made during a recent documentary about the infamous Crazy Gang. The documentary followed the path of Wimbledon from their arrival in the old First Division in 1986 to their FA Cup success in 1988. The programme portrayed the dressing room as violent and often cruel place dominated by a few individuals, but former goalkeeper Beasant was keen to point out that certain aspects had been exaggerated. Wimbledon players celebrate pulling off one of the greatest FA Cup final upsets in modern history . Former Wimbledon goalkeeper Dave Beasant was talking about the show  while on BBC One . Speaking on BBC One, Beasant said: ‘There’s been a lot said about the Crazy gang of late and lot of what has been said was self-promotion of certain individuals. ‘A major factor in a recent documentary has been John Fashanu and he’s brought to light an incident with Lawrie Sanchez which actually happened two years after the FA Cup final so for him to bring that in and make such a part of it and say that they didn’t like each other in the cup final – Fash goes over and gives him a kiss and that was before kissing had started. ‘They fell out later. For him to bring that into the documentary I feel was a wrong decision.’ Lawrie Sanchez (blue) heads in what was ultimately the winning goal for Wimbledon . John Fashanu (centre) revealed he had to celebrate with his 'arch enemy' Sanchez . Fashanu (centre) supposedly ruled by fear but fellow Crazy Gang member Terry Gibson questioned it . Beasant isn't the only member of the Crazy Gang to voice his displeasure with certain aspects of the documentary. Terry Gibson wrote on his blog: 'Do people really believe that John Fashanu controlled and dominated our dressing room, ruling by fear of him? 'Does anybody really believe him when he said he locked people in a boot of a car, that he would tell someone they wouldn’t be allowed to eat for 2 days and that someone was going to be watching over them 24/7 so that they couldn’t? 'The bloke is deluded. In truth WE tolerated him and laughed at him, he really was and still is a clown.'

"World Cup cast-off Ben Stokes gave England's selectors a reminder of his talents with a big-hitting half-century on his Big Bash debut for Melbourne Renegades. Stokes, left out of England's final 15 for the impending global tournament in Australia and New Zealand after an unproductive 2014, could still be a late inclusion as a replacement should injury befall any squad member. Arriving only as an injury replacement too for the Renegades, following Jesse Ryder's defection, the 23-year-old wasted no time confirming his liking for Australian conditions. Ben Stokes smashes 77 from 37 balls in his Melbourne Renegades debut in Australia's Big Bash League . No part of Hobart's Blundstone Arena was safe as Stokes demolished the Hurricanes' Attack . Stokes (77), the one shining light of England's miserable Ashes tour last winter, smashed eight fours and five sixes from just 37 balls in the Renegades' much-needed 37-run win over Hobart Hurricanes at the Bellerive Oval. Former England captains Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen were predictably on cue with their views on Twitter. Vaughan wrote: 'When I watch @benstokes38 I can only think England haven't quite got it right with him yet ... Huge talent ... Kevin Pietersen, who is playing in the BBL for the Melbourne Stars, has a dig at the England selectors . Former England captain Michael Vaughan tweeted before Stokes made his Renegades debut . Vaughan marvelled at Stokes' talent during the innings in Hobart . 'Just a reminder @benstokes38 was the only England player to stand up in Australia last winter ... He likes the conditions ...' Pietersen, also left out of England's plans after his sacking 11 months ago, was another to remind the selectors of his talents this week with a Big Bash half-century. He tweeted: '@benstokes38 is a star in the making. He's showing it this eve! Good on him! I cannot for the life of me believe he's not in WC.' Stokes, who was left out of England's 15-man squad for the tri-series and World Cup, hits another big one . Hurricanes captain George Bailey takes the catch that finally dismisses Stokes . Stokes was a near ever-present, when fit, for England last year but mustered a limited-overs output of only 200 runs and 14 wickets in 17 matches across the two formats. After his continued poor form in the one-day international series defeat in Sri Lanka, he ended that tour out of the team and was then not chosen shortly afterwards in England's World Cup squad. There was no cheer for England, who arrive in Australia on Wednesday in time their pre-World Cup tri-series, when Alex Hales - in his last Big Bash appearance before joining up with them - could make only seven as the Hurricanes faltered to 126 all out in reply to 163 for seven.","Ben Stokes was left out of England's 15-man squad for the World Cup .

"New Zealand completed a series whitewash against Sri Lanka with what ultimately proved to be a comfortable 193-run win in the second Test at Wellington. Kane Williamson and BJ Watling had laid the foundations for a declaration on day four with a record unbeaten 365 and Sri Lanka came into the final day needing 345 to draw the series with the home side requiring another nine wickets. And the Black Caps got them before tea with Mark Craig recording figures of four for 53 while Lahiru Thirimanne's unbeaten 62 supplied the only real resistance.

The tourists got off to a terrible start as nightwatchman Dhammika Prasad exited to just the 10th ball of the morning. Trent Boult found a thick edge outside the off-stump and James Neesham was on hand to see off Prasad for six at second slip. The next wicket was to be the key however and it was Boult again who dismissed Sri Lankan talisman Kumar Sangakkara in controversial fashion. The left-hander swung at one outside off and although the finger did not go up, Brendon McCullum reviewed and Sangakkara, who had registered 203 in the first innings, was forced to depart for five with Watling gathering behind the stumps. Thirimanne joined Kaushal Silva at the crease and the opener got to his 50 in 119 balls but was gone just two later without adding to it, edging Doug Bracewell to Craig at second slip. Williamson had been the hero on day four as he accumulated 242 not out and he played a crucial role again in claiming a stunning catch to remove Angelo Mathews (eight) before lunch.

Prasanna Jayawardene dug in with Thirimanne but the scoring was predictably slow before the wcketkeeper slapped a loose one from Craig to Williamson at cover for 10. Sri Lanka were staring down the barrel now and two wickets in two balls from Craig saw them slip to 156 for eight. First Dinesh Chandimal (13) got a faint edge behind to Watling and then Rangana Herath followed lbw, although Suranga Lakmal survived the hat-trick ball. Lakmal was next to go though as he was run out for six and victory was assured when Tim Southee left Nuwan Pradeep's (one) stumps in a mess.","New Zealand earn 193-run victory over Sri Lanka in second Test .

"England seamer Stuart Broad believes Kevin Pietersen's sacking last year was 'unnecessary' and the maverick batsman should have been dropped for a lengthy run of poor form rather than for misbehaviour. Broad also appeared to set himself apart from the England management by saying the situation could have been handled differently. Pietersen's international career was brought to a juddering halt by the ECB last February in the fallout of the Ashes whitewash defeat. Kevin Pietersen's international career was brought to a halt by the England and Wales Cricket Board last year . But Broad thinks Pietersen's indifferent form when he averaged under 35 in his final 12 Tests meant he could have just been dropped. 'It just became a bit of a media uproar. The whole sacking, it just seemed a bit unnecessary when every other player in the history of the game just gets dropped for poor form,' Broad said in an interview on Radio 5 Live. 'His form was pretty poor over 18 months, every other player just gets dropped. Obviously Kevin's very disappointed . . . it could've been handled very differently, I think, by everyone.' Pietersen's name continues to linger around the England team — despite him criticising team-mates, including Broad, and the ECB in his controversial autobiography — and the 34-year-old himself remains determined to resume his international career. Stuart Broad (left) speaks to former England teammate Pietersen prior to his axe from the international set-up . Yet Broad thinks that is unlikely due to Pietersen focusing solely on the Twenty20 format in the last 12 months, as well as the emergence of players such as Joe Root and Gary Ballance. 'He's not played any red-ball cricket for a year so I don't think a return in Test matches is very likely and he's not set the world alight in white-ball format either,' Broad added. 'The three Test matches we won in the summer against India were probably the strongest performances I've played in the 74 Tests I've played, and they were without Kevin Pietersen . Kevin Pietersen is currently playing for the Melbourne Stars . 'The guys who have come in — Joe Root, Gary Ballance — have been the shining lights of the England team. 'When you lose a great player, younger guys come in and perform, so actually if Kevin Pietersen was still in the side would Joe Root have taken the responsibility on this summer and averaged 99? Probably not, but he became the shining light of the England batting line-up.'

"Differences in opinion led to Andy Murray parting ways with his long-term hitting partner and assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green, the British number one said on Saturday. Vallverdu had been a near-permanent presence by Murray's side since the duo met at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Spain more than a decade ago. But rumblings that all was not well in the Murray camp came to light following the Briton's decision to appoint twice grand slam champion Amelie Mauresmo as head coach last June. Andy Murray admits that differences in opinion led to him splitting with hitting partner Dani Vallverdu . Vallverdu had been part of Murray's team for over a decade after they met as juniors . It led to Venezuelan Vallverdu and Green to snap ties with Murray in November. 'The most important point in any team is that everyone has the same vision, everyone wants to move forward together,' Murray told The Independent in Perth, where he is fine-tuning his preparations for this month's Australian Open. 'I feel that's what I have now. Maybe the last four or five months of last year it wasn't like that. It's not as much fun travelling when that's the case. If everyone isn't right into it, that isn't how you want to work.' Asked if Vallverdu thought he should have been promoted to the top job following the departure of Murray's former head coach Ivan Lendl last March, the world number six replied: 'That's possible. '(But) if you look at last year I spent only one tournament... with Ivan, at the Australian Open. The rest of the time I was with Dani every single week. I didn't have another coach travel with me at all. 'So he was the coach responsible for my training and all my practices at all of the tournaments. Maybe it didn't go as well as either of us would have liked and that's why I felt like I needed someone else.' Murray celebrating his 2012 US Open win with Vallverdu, Jez Green (second right) and Andy Ireland (right) Murray has been working with former Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo since last June . While Murray was frustrated at his inability to reach a grand slam final for the first time in five years in 2014, Vallverdu was promptly hired by former Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych. 'For him to get the opportunity to work with someone like Berdych is fantastic. He's obviously a top player and it will be a good challenge for him,' added the 2013 Wimbledon champion. Murray, who has now fully recovered from the back surgery that hampered him during the early part of last season, has also been working with a sports psychologist in the hope of returning to the grand slam winner's circle. 'I think when it comes to psychology it has to be something that the player wants and the player buys into,' Murray said. 'When it's someone else's suggestion in the past I haven't felt like it's worked. But just now I think it's working well.'","Differences in opinion caused Andy Murray to part with his hitting partner .

"Sam Allardyce was in such a jovial mood after West Ham's penalty shootout win against Everton on Tuesday night that he decided to take the mickey out of Phil Neville on live television. The West Ham boss, who was speaking alongside Neville on BT Sport, took the opportunity to poke fun at the pundit's inability to make hot drinks. The former Manchester United man recently admitted that he made his first ever cup of coffee for Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton in December and that he needed advice from his wife Julie to do so. West Ham boss Sam Allardyce (second from left) is interviewed after his side's win against Everton . Allardyce turns to pundit Phil Neville and says: 'I just want to say one thing... can you make us a coffee?' Presenter Jake Humphrey, Neville, David James and Steve McManaman (L-R) laugh as Allardyce leaves . Allardyce was clearly aware of Neville's shortcomings around the house and, after concluding his live post-match interview, turned to the 37-year-old and said: 'I just want to say one thing... can you make us a coffee?!' Neville saw the funny side of it and enjoyed a laugh with host Jake Humphrey and fellow pundits David James and Steve McManaman as Allardyce left the pitch-side set. Describing how he made his first cup of coffee earlier this month, Neville said he 'sprinted into the kitchen' and phoned his wife to ask 'how the hell do I make a cup of coffee?' after Sportsmail's Lawton asked for one during an interview at the couple's £3.6million Cheshire home. The father of two later told how he made it with a 'kettle… two little scoops of coffee', and laughed: 'I've lived in a bubble all my life.' Neville's wife Julie also revealed in a radio interview that he had never used a vacuum cleaner, mop, dishwasher or washing machine.

Phil is an amazing father and husband – just not domesticated in any way.' Speaking about her husband's first attempt to make a cup of coffee, the 39-year-old said: 'If you'd seen it you would not have thought it was classed as a coffee. I didn't taste it, but it didn't look good.' But Sportsmail's Lawton was more generous, saying: 'For a first go, it was very good.' Earlier this month the former Everton captain laughed at himself by tweeting an image of himself with a vacuum cleaner, a mop and a variety of cleaning products, along with the caption: 'Time to get started......#nescafe'.","Phil Neville made his first cup of coffee for Sportmail's Matt Lawton .

"Ian Bell was handed the chance to take a massive leap from the periphery of England's one-day squad on Sunday to become their World Cup opener in place of Alastair Cook. Eoin Morgan, the new England one-day captain, confirmed here in Canberra that it is the veteran Bell who will be given the first opportunity to claim Cook's place ahead of the more expansive Alex Hales when England begin a one-day tour that will culminate with the World Cup here next month. Bell, who averaged 45 in 38 matches as Cook's opening partner over the last two years, will open in Sunday night's first warm-up game ahead of a triangular series against Australia and India here against a Capital Territory team along with Moeen Ali. Ian Bell looks set to open the batting for England with Moeen Ali at the World Cup in February . Bell chats to England batting coach Mark Ramprakash during Saturday's nets session in Canberra . Bell partnered Ali in a practice match on Saturday, giving the clearest indication yet that the pair will open . 'The top three in the first game will be Ali, Bell and James Taylor,' said Morgan ahead of his first match officially in charge. 'The first opportunity goes to those guys. All three look in great form. Opportunity lands with them and we'll see how they go.' There will be disappointment among many supporters who want England to replicate the aggressive cricket seen more readily among one-day opponents and are hoping that Cook's sacking would provide a prolonged chance for Hales. But Morgan clearly echoes the view of the England coaches who want to marry experience with the younger more explosive talents in the England top order and are simply replacing the out of form Cook with Bell. 'Belly is a class act, somebody we've looked to for a long time to score a heavy weight of runs,' said Morgan. 'He's pretty key at the top of the order.' Morgan was appointed captain in a last-gasp move by the selectors when Cook ran out of chances to regain the form which he displayed in one-day cricket when he first took over from Andrew Strauss. Bell's one-day career had looked in jeopardy but he was given a late reprieve after Alastair Cook's sacking . 'It's been interesting,' said the Irishman of his early days at the helm. 'It took a bit if time to settle in but it's a huge honour to captain your country running into a World Cup. It's a massive opportunity given the side we have, which is brilliant. It's great to finally get started. 'Cookie was the first person to message me once I got the news, which sums up the guy. I've had a great relationship with Alastair over the last number of years when he's been captain. He's been fantastic to me. It is unfortunate the way it ended but it is the decision that's been made.' Morgan does not believe there will be a great change in captaincy style. 'I don't think it will differ in a huge amount,' he insisted. 'There will be certain things Alastair will do that I wouldn't just because it is his character and mine. 'When I've captained in the past I've tended to strip things back to the basics Keep things as relaxed as possible because things can conjure up into high-pressure situations and you want guys to be at their best when they make decisions. That's my method. Chris Woakes (right) is in a battle with Chris Jordan and Steven Finn to be England's third seamer . Stuart Broad (right) and James Anderson are certain to take two positions leaving one more up for grabs . 'Over the last seven or eight months I think we've seen a considerable change in the method that we've used both batting and bowling. That will continue to go in the same direction and guys will be encouraged to play with freedom.' Kevin Pietersen's offer to play against England for the Australian prime Minister's XI in Wednesday's second warm-up game, presumably made tongue in cheek, was officially dashed on Saturday when Chris Rogers was called up to replace the injured Mike Hussey. Pietersen made his offer while playing for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash and Morgan added: 'I think it was a very ambitious offer. It's a hugely prestigious game, for the Prime Minister's XI to give an opportunity to somebody who is not Australian is pretty ambitious. 'When sides tour England and we put out Lions teams we give opportunities to our youngest and best. I don't think it would have spiced up the game at all if Kev had played.

"Kevin Pietersen has insisted his offer to play against England during their tour of Australia next week is a serious one. England are due to face a Prime Minister's XI in Canberra on Wednesday as a warm-up to the tri-series against India and Australia, and Pietersen said he was keen to replace Mike Hussey, who has been forced to withdraw with a calf injury. ""In the Prime Minister's game on Wednesday, Mr Michael Hussey's missed out. Jeez, I fancy that,"" Pietersen said on the players' microphone while playing for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League, screened by Sky Sports 2. Kevin Pietersen is currently playing for Australian side Melbourne Stars in Australia's Twenty20 Big Bash . Commentator Adam Gilchrist, the former Australia wicketkeeper, asked: ""Are you telling us you're available?"" Pietersen replied: ""Mate, I'm always available."" As if to prove a point, Pietersen went on to hit a run-a-ball 49 in his team's nail-biting victory over the Melbourne Renegades. Andrew Flintoff, who is playing for Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash, responded to Pietersen's comments on Twitter. ""If @KP24 plays for the primeministers XI they'll need a turnstile at the bowlers end, they'll be queuing up,"" he tweeted. Former England teammate Andrew Flintoff is clearly keen on granting former captain Pietersen his wish . Later, responding to comments on Twitter that his offer to play was ""banter"" with the commentators, Pietersen said: ""No it wasn't. I want to play. I'd smash it! End of!"" He then tweeted Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, saying: ""Dear @TonyAbbottMHR - I'm available x."" The 34-year-old was sacked by England almost a year ago, but has been on hand with regular barbs ever since a confidentiality agreement between the two parties expired. His explosive autobiography included many unhappy reflections on his international career, not to mention claims of a bullying dressing room culture. England exile Pietersen bats against Melbourne Renegades during the Twenty20 Big Bash in Australia . Pietersen supposedly covets an unlikely Three Lions recall, but the South African-born batsman again used the press conference as a chance to settle scores with his former team-mates. He claimed his lucrative Indian Premier League contract caused resentment and he prefered playing in the BBL, where many players participate in franchise cricket in other countries. ""There's no jealousy here. That's the fact,"" he said of life with the Stars. ""None of these guys are jealous of anything. We're just good guys, hanging out and playing cricket. All these guys play in franchises around the world, they've all benefited from the IPL. ""The England lads - too much jealousy. I was the only one profiting - very, very well - out of India and in an auction, if you don't get picked up, it's pretty demoralising.""

"Anyone expecting England to undergo a radical last-minute change of World Cup heart and come out all guns blazing under Eoin Morgan can think again. Alastair Cook may have gone but the one-day game-plan remains the same. Morgan’s first public appearance as the new one-day captain, a low-key affair here ahead of the warm-up game against a Capital Territories XI, would have dashed the hopes of those expecting a dramatic transformation. In confirming that Ian Bell has the first chance to step into Cook’s World Cup shoes Morgan emphasised that Alex Hales has it all to do if he is to become the flag bearer at the top of the order for a new, more dynamic 50-over England. Eoin Morgan will captain England's one-day team for the first time since taking over from Alastair Cook . Morgan addresses the press ahead of his side's match against a Capital Territories XI . Ian Bell looks set to open the batting for England with Moeen Ali at the World Cup in February . Bell was due to open with Moeen Ali at the Manuka Oval and will be given every chance to complete an unlikely journey from the periphery of the one-day side to taking on Mitchell Johnson and Co. in the World Cup opener on February 14. It means that even though Cook has been jettisoned at the last minute England remain committed to having an experienced, more ‘orthodox’ player as opener to try to play the anchor role rather than two big ‘Twenty20’ hitters. Bell gets the nod even though he was dropped after two matches of England’s one-day series defeat against Sri Lanka and would have almost certainly missed out on being in the squad at all had Cook survived the cut. Now, though, a last, big one-day opportunity comes knocking at 32 for one of England’s classiest Test players but a man who has often under-performed in one-day cricket, scoring just three hundreds in 150 50-over appearances. ‘Belly is a class act, someone we’ve looked to for a long time to score a heavy weight of runs,’ said Morgan while insisting that there is still time for Hales and others to stake a claim. ‘He’s pretty key at the top of the order.’ The new one-day captain sounded very much like the old one when asked whether England need to be more aggressive if they are to make any impact in the triangular series that begins on Friday and next month’s World Cup. Morgan confirmed in Canberra it is the veteran Bell who will be given the first opportunity to claim Cook's place . New England one-day captain Morgan (left) does not believe there will be a big change in captaincy style . ‘I think we have been aggressive,’ insisted Morgan. ‘We’ve made the change slowly and we saw glimpses of it in Sri Lanka. It will be a continuation of that in this World Cup but what I’d like to see is us combining that aggression from the younger players with one or two experienced ones to bat around them.’ So the tactics will remain the same but Morgan is sure to be his own man as England captain. ‘My method has always been to strip the game back to its absolute basics and make sure the atmosphere in the camp is pretty relaxed,’ said the Irishman. ‘The only differences to Alastair will be in character and a little bit of a change in beliefs. I have a simple way of viewing things as a captain.’ An example of his laid-back manner came in the way he slept through all England’s attempts to contact him in Sydney before Christmas to tell him he was succeeding Cook. ‘I woke up to a lot of voicemails,’ smiled Morgan. Stuart Broad (right) and James Anderson are certain to take two positions leaving one more up for grabs . Chris Woakes (right) is in a battle with Chris Jordan and Steven Finn to be England's third seamer . ‘The first person I spoke to was Jimmy Whitaker who offered me the captaincy — and I obviously said yes — and then Gus Fraser phoned me and said “You must have slept well” because I had 25 missed calls. To be fair, it was 4am!’ Once the news sunk in Morgan remembered that captains usually get a big say in selection. ‘Jimmy gave me an inkling of what the squad was going to be. He asked me if I would have any changes and I said “No, that’s our best squad”.’ That means there was no attempt by Morgan to try to find a way back for his exiled friend Kevin Pietersen, who he has publicly supported during England’s civil war while also managing to remain close to Cook. ‘The decision was clearly made a year ago that Kevin wasn’t going to be part of England cricket moving forward,’ said Morgan. ‘It was repeated on the day I became captain. I didn’t think about asking for that to be changed.’ Morgan described as ‘ambitious’ the offer made by Pietersen, presumably at least with part of his tongue in his cheek, to play for the Australian Prime Minister’s XI in England’s second warm-up match here on Wednesday. As it is any hopes Pietersen may have had of playing against England were dashed when Chris Rogers was called up to replace the injured Mike Hussey. Bell partnered Ali in a practice match on Saturday, giving the clearest indication yet that the pair will open . Bell chats to England batting coach Mark Ramprakash during Saturday's nets session in Canberra . ‘It’s a prestigious game so to think they might give a place to someone who is not Australian is ambitious,’ said Morgan. ‘But I don’t think it would have spiced the game up if Kev had played against us. It really doesn’t bother me.’ What has bothered him are the feelings of Cook, who looked certain to be England’s World Cup captain right up until a late change of heart by England. ‘Alastair was the first person to message me to wish me well,’ revealed Morgan. ‘We get on very well. When a decision like that is made it’s not very nice but it sums the guy up that he wished me all the very best. ‘I felt for him massively. It will be difficult for him but that’s the decision that was made and once we start here it will be a case of moving on.’ Another captain with much to contemplate is Michael Clarke who admitted he has his work cut out to play in the World Cup even though he was named in a formidable looking Australian squad. Clarke has been given to Australia’s second cup game against Bangladesh on February 21 to prove his fitness otherwise he will be replaced, so it looks increasingly like he will at least miss the date with England at the MCG on Valentine’s Day that launches the tournament.","Eoin Morgan was named England captain after Alastair Cook was dropped .

"Kevin Pietersen's unlikely bid to take on England in a tour match in Canberra next week is over after Chris Rogers was called up to captain an Australian Prime Minister's XI. England limber up for the Carlton Mid Tri-Series and the subsequent World Cup with a game against an ACT XI on Monday before taking on the PM's representative team two days later at the Manuka Oval. The hosts were due to be captained by Mike Hussey, but the veteran Ashes winner was ruled out after suffering a calf injury in the Big Bash. Kevin Pietersen's unlikely bid to take on England in a tour match in Canberra next week is over . Pietersen misses out after Chris Rogers was called up to captain an Australian Prime Minister's XI . A high-profile replacement was required to lead the side in his absence and Pietersen, controversially sacked by England a year ago and engaged in a toxic war of words with his former employers ever since, cheekily put his hat in the ring. While playing for Melbourne Stars on Saturday, he declared himself 'always available' while chatting with commentators on the player mic and later tweeted Prime Minister Tony Abbott to reiterate his hopes of featuring. But his advances came to nothing, with Australia Test opener Rogers instead handed the prestigious role. The 37-year-old will now go head to head with one-time Middlesex team-mate Eoin Morgan, who was named as England's one-day captain in place of the sacked Alastair Cook last month. Asked about Pietersen's eagerness to line-up against his old colleagues, Morgan played a reassuringly straight bat in his first media conference as skipper. 'I think it was very ambitious,' he said. 'It's a hugely prestigious game, for the Prime Minister's XI. To give an opportunity to somebody who is not Australian is pretty ambitious. Pietersen (pictured fumbling a catch this week) cheekily threw his hat into the ring to become the replacement . 'When sides tour England and we put out Lions teams we give opportunities to our youngest and best. I don't think it would have spiced up the game at all. It doesn't really bother me.' Announcing the change to his side, Prime Minister Abbott said: 'It is disappointing that Mike Hussey won't be available to take his place as captain on Wednesday but I wish him a speedy recovery from his injury. 'I am pleased that Chris Rogers has accepted the invitation to take Mike's place as captain. Chris has a wealth of international and domestic experience and after a successful Test series he is well placed to lead the team.' Speaking about his appointment as captain, Rogers said: 'It's a great honour for me to be selected as captain of the Prime Minister's XI to take on England.

"There were blue and white beachballs, a few inflatable bananas and even a pink flamingo flying around the away end of St Mary’s before kick off. But the Ipswich fans’ celebrations came too early as their side battled to a draw against Southampton to force an FA Cup replay. Mick McCarthy’s Championship side took a surprise early lead against their Barclays Premier League opposition, but Southampton levelled to take the tie into another game. The travelling support came in force and will have many more behind them on January 14 when another 90 minutes of football, plus the possibility of extra time and penalties, will decide who progresses and if they can celebrate properly. Morgan Schneiderlin cancelled out Darren Ambrose's opener by netting in the 33rd minute . Southampton midfielder Schneiderlin celebrates with his team-mates after levelling the scoring . Ambrose beats Ryan Bertrand in the air to score his side's opening goal of the FA Cup encounter at St Mary's .

The Ipswich manager joked afterwards: ‘I just said to lads, “Well done, it’s the last thing we really wanted.” I said it tongue-in-cheek, I didn’t want to lose. ‘Why can’t I have a cup run as well? I want to continue our good run of form. I came down here and watched Arsenal lose to Southampton and they were worthy winners. ‘I knew we had a big support coming and was conscious of that in terms of team selection. We had a strong team out.’ The visitors netting the first goal sparked the match into a proper FA Cup tie and the flicker of an upset began to fill the stadium. On 19 minutes full-back Tyrone Mings, who Arsenal are interested in signing, played in a deep cross from the left and Darren Ambrose did well to loop a header into the top right corner from eight yards out. The ball seemed to hang in the air for an age before dropping over the dive of Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster and in. But then the home side started to stamp their league superiority on the game and equalised in the 33rd minute. A ball into the box by James Ward-Prowse, playing the unusual role of right-back, caused havoc amongst Ipswich’s defence and Morgan Schneiderlin snuck in to lob Ipswich goalkeeper Dean Gerken from close range. From then on, Southampton dominated. Before the goal, Gerken used his feet to deny Steven Davis when through on goal and dived to keep out Ward-Prowse’s free kick which was curling into the bottom left corner. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman was angry with the officials afterwards for not awarding a penalty in the second half when Mings challenged Long on the right and only a free kick was given. ‘I watched on the television afterwards,’ Koeman said. ‘It’s clear it’s in the box. Maybe the referee can’t see properly but the linesman has to see it. ‘They had unbelievable spirit in team, they had 5,000 fans supporting the team. I was afraid and the final result is that. What I don’t like is that we have to play a replay.’ Koeman and his players will now have a long journey to Ipswich on a Wednesday night sandwiched either side of trips to Manchester United and Arsenal, where victory will be far from guaranteed.

"Guy Luzon is the hot favourite for the Charlton Athletic job but former boss Jose Riga is keen for a return. Luzon is a 39-year-old Israeli that has managed Maccabi Petah Tikva, Hapoel Tel Aviv, Beni Yehuda in his homeland between 2001 and 2010, before coaching the Israeli Under-21 side for three years. Most recently, he managed Standard Liege in Belgium, where he secured a second place finish last season. However, he left in October after a terrible start to the season saw Liege in 12th position. It is understood that the club have made contact with Luzon and a deal could even be completed within 48 hours. Guy Luzon is tipped to be the next Charlton manager following Bob Peeters' sacking on Sunday . Charlton are owned by Belgian businessman Roland Duchatelet, who has appointed managers with links to his country since taking over last year. Chris Powell was sacked in March 2013 to make way for Belgian Jose Riga, who then exited at the end of the season, before Bob Peeters took over in the summer. The Belgian was sacked last week after guiding the club through a dreadful run in the Championship, with Charlton winning only two of their last 15 matches. Riga was particularly popular with the Charlton fans, keeping them in the Championship with seven wins in their final 15 games. Jose Riga managed Charlton during 2014 and won seven of his 16 games in charge of The Addicks . Riga would be happy to return to The Valley and is particularly eager to stay in English football after turning down several job offers in his native Belgium. His representative Chris Nathaniel told Sportsmail: 'Jose is now feeling refreshed and ready for a new challenge. He has an existing affinity with Charlton and their fans.' Charlton declined to comment. Peeters was sacked as Charlton manager after a run of just six wins from 25 league games .","Former Standard Liege boss Guy Luzon is favourite to replace Bob Peeters .

"CLICK HERE to see the top 10 shirtless goal celebrations of all time . They are the men who are happy to pick up a booking in return for a public outing of their prized pecs and bulging biceps. The men who spend hours in the gym perfecting their sculpted physiques. Southampton’s Dusan Tadic became the latest member of football’s Mr Muscle club when he ripped off his shirt following his winner at Old Trafford, unveiling his toned torso in front of 75,000 onlookers. It barely touched 5C at Old Trafford on Sunday and the Southampton substitute had only been on the pitch for five minutes, but that didn’t deter him from braving the biting north-west air. Dusan Tadic strikes a shirtless pose in front of Southampton fans after his winner at Old Trafford . The Saints winger admitted he has never removed his shirt before but got caught up in the moment . The Serbian was unsurprisingly shown a yellow card under Premier League regulations . Tadic is joining a muscle-bound band of brothers, Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Alexis Sanchez and Mario Balotelli among those never shy to showcase their upper body. But is it all one big vanity project? Is there any advantage to be gained by spending as much time in the gym as on the training pitch? Mark Leather is head of performance at Bolton Wanderers and an authority on the physical conditioning of footballers. He told Sportsmail that players such as Tadic and Ronaldo must be applauded. ‘There is some debate as to whether the motivation with these players is cosmetic or for fitness and strength reasons,’ he said. ‘But what they are doing is getting the very best out of their bodies and allowing themselves to perform to the maximum of their ability. Cristiano Ronaldo pulled perhaps the most famous shirtless pose during the 2014 Champions League final . The Ballon d'Or winner stripped off for his photo opportunity after scoring in the final minute of extra-time . Italy forward Mario Balotelli arguably started the Hulk pose trend in the semi-finals of Euro 2012 . Zlatan Ibrahimovic is another star with an over inflated ego who is prone to removing his shirt . ‘Looking at Tadic, he obviously has extremely low body fat. He wasn’t overly bulky but had quite a lean frame and was very toned and defined. ‘If look you at his abdomen, the muscle around there might be superficial, but beneath that are muscles which give you great core strength and support your upper and lower body. It definitely makes you a better all-round athlete. ‘I look at some players and think they will always fall short of how good they could be because they don’t look after their body and don’t have the dedication of these guys.’ Arsenal sensation Alexis Sanchez (right) reveals his muscular torso after scoring against Manchester City . Brazil international Hulk lives up to his namesake by striking a pose usually associated with a green superhero . City striker Edin Dzeko shows he may need more gym time to keep up with his  contemporaries . Jack Rodwell flexes his muscles after scoring in Everton's 3-1 win against Manchester United . Diego Forlan couldn't resist getting semi-naked in front of the Kop after scoring for Atletico Madrid in 2010 . Ronaldo’s explosion from the skinny teenager at Manchester United to the ripped superstar of Real Madrid has been well documented — it is said he does more than 1,000 sit-ups each day. And Leather admits no player is born with a six-pack. ‘That is not naturally given,’ he said. ‘You have to spend a lot of time on your own to achieve that. Whether you’re winning or losing, playing well or poorly, these players will have a strict programme that they stick to. ‘That will include daily work in the gym but also their diet, which will be centred around protein and rebuilding the muscle they break down during exercise.

Wolves' Kevin Doyle looks in need of some sunshine after ripping off his shirt against Burnley in 2009 . Removing one's shirt isn't reserved for the top flight, as Millwall's Danny Shittu proves in 2013 . ... and here's what they used to look like as Kevin Keegan and Jimmy Case celebrate a victory in 1977 . ‘They will probably never stray from that and alcohol and takeaways will be off-limits. Saying that, I personally don’t think there’s too much wrong with the odd Chinese or Indian meal in moderation.’ But not every top footballer boasts a beach bod. Leather points to Barcelona’s Lionel Messi. ‘Look at Messi — his body is very slight and he’s all about a low centre of gravity,’ he said. ‘Building his upper body might take away from what his game is about. ‘There are some players who actually put on too much muscle and it’s about getting what is best for you in terms of the position you play and strengths as a player.’ One advantage for Andy Murray of training in blistering Melbourne heat is that it gives him the chance to show off his impressive upper body. As the shirtless world No 6 stepped up his preparation for the Australian Open, which starts next Monday, he looked unrecognisable from the lanky teenager who first emerged as a major British talent. Murray ended his seven-year relationship with fitness trainer Jez Green in November, but his physique doesn’t seem to have suffered.

"Jose Aldo battled to an absorbing victory in his rematch with Chad Mendes before delivering a stinging rebuke at the watching Conor McGregor.

Aldo, meanwhile, had won his first fight with Mendes in the first round two years ago with a knee to the face but he was taken the five-round distance on this occasion before prevailing 49-46 on all three scorecards. ‘I deserved to win,’ added Aldo. ‘He hit me a few times but I hit him a lot more. It was a great a fight and I’m sure everyone enjoyed it.’ Aldo is now unbeaten since 2005 after his seventh successful title defence while defeat would have left Brazil without a UFC champion for the first time in eight years.

Mendes had won five fights since his first defeat to Aldo and was aggressive from the start, landing with kicks and punches to open a wound on Aldo’s nose. But the Brazilian recovered quickly and finished the first round strongly, twice knocking Mendes down with powerful strikes. ‘He rang my bell for sure,’ said Mendes. ‘I was just going so hard I didn’t know what was going on. I was just trying to push myself and obviously just out-strike him and mix things up well.’ Mendes (left) lands a kick to Aldo's face during the featherweight championship bout in Rio de Janeiro .

And Mendes connected with an uppercut-hook combination in the third but Aldo recovered to edge the rest of the five-minute session, landing a series of blows. The pace slowed in the penultimate round as Mendes attempted to seize the initiative with both men trading shots in the closing stages.

"West Bromwich Albion are facing the prospect of losing further sponsors, depending on the outcome of the Football Association's investigation into Nicolas Anelka's 'quenelle' gesture. The Black Country club counts German clothing company Jack Wolfskin among its partners and the firm has issued a statement in which it does not rule out the possibility of ending its backing. Gesture: Anelka is to discover his fate after an FA investigation into his goal celebration at West Ham . Tackle: Anelka has asked the FA to drop the charges for his quenelle gesture in December .

And now Marvin Troemer, a corporate communications spokesman for Jack Wolfskin, said: 'We are following the developments closely but has no decision has been taken yet. 'The FA is waiting for a statement of Nicolas Anelka before coming to a final judgment. We consider the charges as serious and strongly disapprove of any gestures or statements which are meant to discriminate a single person or a certain group of people. 'We are now awaiting the judgment of the Football Association before taking further steps. Absent: Anelka was selected in Monday's 1-1 draw with Everton, but was largely unimpressive .

Zoopla.co.uk is a property website and is part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division of DMGT plc, the company which owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline. Anelka meanwhile has until 6pm on Thursday to ask for a personal hearing following the charge that he made an improper gesture that was an aggravated breach as it included 'a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief. In a new post on his Twitter feed, the 34-year-old has written 'Rien a ajouter', which when translated reads 'Nothing to add'. Pertinently, Anelka includes a link to a video clip on Le Figaro that shows an interview with Roger Cukierman, president of Crif, the council representing French Jewish institutions. Bittersweet: Anelka performed the salute after scoring the first of two goals in a 3-3 draw with West Ham . Discount: A sale in the West Brom club shop offers up to 60 per cent off shirts donning the sponsor Zoopla . In the short 40-second segment, Cukierman claims Anelka's gesture was not anti-Semitic and that he should not be heavily punished. The FA have the power to sentence him to a minimum five-match ban. Cukierman said: 'It seems a bit severe to me because it seems to me that this gesture only has an anti-Semitic connation if the gesture is made in front of a synagogue or a memorial to the Holocaust. 'When it's made in a place which is not specifically Jewish it seems to me that it's a slightly anarchic gesture of revolt against the establishment, which doesn't deserve severe sanctions.' No more: West Brom announced the that Zoopla would not extend their contract with the club . Other pressure groups, however, have called for Anelka to be handed more than a five-game suspension due to his lack of an apology. Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: 'I know under the rules that on a first-time offence there is a minimum five-game suspension. 'But I think what he did was sufficiently serious to justify a longer suspension than five matches. 'He has not indicated one bit of remorse or regret or apologised for his actions.

"The German football world has reacted to Manuel Neuer's defeat in Monday night's Ballon d'Or – and they're not happy. In Germany, as across the globe, few were surprised when Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned footballer of the year. Many, though, were hugely upset by the margin of the Portuguese' victory, and by the fact that Neuer only came third in the voting. Franz Beckenbauer was the most vocal critic, moaning on Sky TV that the result was 'an injustice'. He went on to attack Ronaldo, claiming that the Real Madrid player's appeal was more about his personality than his achievements as a footballer.

So, they created their own poll of 15 suggestions, including 'a drunken bear' and 'a deer in the mating season'. CLICK HERE TO ANSWER THE POLL . 'In 2013, Ronaldo won nothing, and Franck Ribery won everything. But Ronaldo beat him then, too. Apparently, footballing success doesn't count for much in these votes. It's all about your personal image', said the German legend. The German media also stuck the boot into Ronaldo. Berlin newspaper Der Tagesspiegel sarcastically argued that he deserved the award because, 'in a team sport, Ronaldo has always just been an individual player'. It then reminded its readers that 'the German team beat Ronaldo's Portugal 4-0 at the World Cup'. Others were visibly annoyed by the victory cry with which Ronaldo closed his speech. Bild provided its readers with a list of 15 things the roar might have been mistaken for. Among them were 'Vladimir Klitschko's opponent after the second round', 'a deer in the mating season', and the cruellest of all: 'a drunken bear'.

Bild created this poll for users to describe what Ronaldo's roar reminded them off, roughly translated . Across Monday evening and Tuesday morning, almost every major figure in German football piped up to say that Neuer should have won the award. Former Bayern and Dortmund coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said that 'strikers have it easier than goalkeepers, because people are more interested in goals'. Even Ronaldo's Real Madrid team mate Toni Kroos got in on the act. 'That Manuel only got third place is surprising and completely undeserved', said Kroos. Then there were those who didn't want to complain, and so simply crowned Neuer moral winner of the Ballon d'Or. 'For me, he is the player of the year', Bastian Schweinsteiger tweeted after the ceremony. Former Schalke player and Twitter personality Hans Sarpei referred to Neuer as 'Player of the year in our hearts and minds'. Germany could, at least, take some consolation in the fact that they won almost every other prize available on Monday night. The prizes for Women's Player of the Year, Women's Coach of the Year and Coach of the Year all went to Germans. Only Ronaldo got in the way of a full house.

Alan Pardew knows a thing or two about being punished for laying hands on  match officials. The Newcastle boss was sent to the stands, given a two-match touchline ban and fined £20,000 for pushing linesman Peter Kirkup during a 2-1 win over Tottenham in 2012. That didn't calm Simeone down, though, as the 44-year-old paced back and forth in the terraces and witnessed his side beat Real 1-0 on the night and 2-1 on aggregate. Before leaving the touchline, Simeone instructed the home faithful to get noisier as they tried to keep Real quiet. That hot-headed approach made its way on to the pitch, as Real midfielder Luka Modric was sent off for a second yellow card in the dying moments. The game between the Madrid and La Liga rivals saw a total of eight yellow cards as the Spanish referee took a no-nonsense approach to the hefty challenges flying in on Friday night.

"West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka has released a statement via his Facebook page asking the FA to drop charges on him for his 'quenelle' gesture. Anelka has long maintained the . gesture he made after scoring in West Brom's 3-3 draw at West Ham on . December 28 was not anti-Semitic, as condemned by many, but instead . anti-establishment. The row over the gesture has caused club sponsor Zoopla to decide not to renew their £3million-a-year deal beyond this season, and could also see German sponsors Jack Wolfskin end its backing. Gesture: Nicolas Anelka performs the controversial 'quenelle' gesture after scoring against West Ham . On Wednesday, Anelka posted on his .

'He also explained precisely and when the gesture could have such a connotation. 'I . therefore ask the English Federation kindly removed the charges alleged . against me. And I repeat, I am not anti-Semitic or racist.' West Brom are facing the prospect of losing further sponsors, depending on the outcome of the FA's investigation. Charged: Anelka has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the FA's charge over the 'quenelle' gesture . The Black Country club counts German clothing company Jack Wolfskin among its partners and the firm has issued a statement in which it does not rule out the possibility of ending its backing. So far this week, property company Zoopla, West Brom's club sponsors, have confirmed they will be finishing their £3m-a-year deal with the club at the end of the current campaign. And now Marvin Troemer, a corporate communications spokesman for Jack Wolfskin, said: 'We are following the developments closely but has no decision has been taken yet. 'The FA is waiting for a statement of Nicolas Anelka before coming to a final judgment. We consider the charges as serious and strongly disapprove of any gestures or statements which are meant to discriminate a single person or a certain group of people. Discount: A sale in the West Brom club shop offers up to 60 per cent off shirts donning the sponsor Zoopla . No more: West Brom announced the that Zoopla would not extend their contract with the club . 'We are now awaiting the judgment of the Football Association before taking further steps. 'And depending on what our partner West Brom says, which measures they will take and considering our legal possibilities (contract) we would also consider to end our sponsorship as one option.' One other sponsor, Holler Watches, have also admitted to monitoring the events at the Hawthorns after Zoopla's announcement earlier in the week. Zoopla.co.uk is a property website and is part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division of DMGT plc, the company which owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline. Anelka earlier offered a cryptic insight into how he might plead after the FA charged him over his controversial salute. Absent: Anelka was selected in Monday's 1-1 draw with Everton, but was largely unimpressive . Anelka . has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the charge he made an improper . gesture, and that it was an aggravated breach in that it included ""a . reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief"". Click here to read our chief sports writer's debate column on Anelka's nasty strain of anti-Semitic Nazi posturing . His conviction appears to be unwavering. In a post on his Twitter feed on Tuesday night, the 34-year-old has written 'Rien a ajouter', which when translated reads 'Nothing to add'. Pertinently, Anelka includes a link to a video clip on Le Figaro that shows an interview with Roger Cukierman, president of Crif, the council representing French Jewish institutions. In the short 40-second segment, Cukierman claims Anelka's gesture was not anti-Semitic and that he should not be heavily punished. The FA have the power to sentence him to a minimum five-match ban. Cukierman said: 'It seems a bit severe to me because it seems to me that this gesture only has an anti-Semitic connotation if the gesture is made in front of a synagogue or a memorial to the Holocaust. Cryptic: Anelka tweeted 'nothing to add' and linked to a video from a prominent French Jewish leader . Controversy: Anelka (right) has been charged by the Football Association for his improper gesture . 'When it's made in a place which is not specifically Jewish it seems to me that it's a slightly anarchic gesture of revolt against the establishment, which doesn't deserve severe sanctions.' 'Zoopla . pay £3million to sponsor West Bromwich Albion. That gives them the . right to spoil the famous striped shirts a little, but not to pick the . team.' Click here to read. Other pressure groups, however, have called for Anelka to be handed more than a five-game suspension due to his lack of an apology. Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: 'I know under the rules that on a first-time offence there is a minimum five-game suspension. 'But I think what he did was sufficiently serious to justify a longer suspension than five matches. 'He has not indicated one bit of remorse or regret or apologised for his actions. 'He has simply said he wouldn't do it again and that is not good enough.' Salute: The 'quenelle' gesture originated from Anelka's friend, the French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala . The quenelle has been described as an inverted Nazi salute and was created by French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who has been prosecuted for anti-Semitism. Anelka is a friend of Dieudonne's and the player has insisted his salute was a gesture of support and aimed at the French establishment. Mark Gardner of the Community Security Trust, which advises the Jewish community on security and anti-Semitism, said the FA should take action against Anelka. He said: 'Anelka has introduced a very ugly phenomenon into British football. 'Anelka's action risks the 'quenelle' being taken up by actual anti-Semites and used against British Jews: as it has been in France and elsewhere. 'The FA should throw the book at him.'

"Illegal immigrants making desperate bids to reach Britain have turned the port of Calais into a lawless 'jungle', according to the French far-right leader. Marine Le Pen seized on escalating tensions in the town by calling for the urgent reintroduction of internal border controls that have been banished across much of Europe. The leader of the anti-immigrant National Front party made the remarks during a visit to the northern port town where riot police this week used teargas to ward off hundreds of immigrants seeking to jump on to lorries bound for Britain. Scroll down for video . Marine Le Pen has called for the urgent reintroduction of internal border controls that have been banished across much of Europe . French police used tear gas on crowds of migrants this week in Calais when around 300 attempted to storm lorries heading for the Channel . Le Pen denounced what she described as the 'phenomenal scandal' of a town left to its own devices in the face of a rise in the number of illegal immigrants seeking to get across the Channel . 'It's time to wage war on this phenomenon,' Le Pen, whose party won about 14 percent of the vote in Calais town hall elections last March. Roughly 2,300 immigrants, many of them from Africa, are roaming the streets and sleeping in makeshift camps in and around Calais while waiting to attempt the final leg of their bid to reach Britain, according to estimates from the local prefect's office. Illegal immigrants making desperate bids to reach Britain have turned the port of Calais (pictured) into a lawless 'jungle', according to the French far-right leader . Her comments come days after riot police used teargas to ward off hundreds of immigrants seeking to jump on to lorries bound for Britain . The number was 1,500 just a few months ago. Police, who had to deploy tear gas to contain hordes of immigrants on several occasions this week, kept dozens of supporters and opponents of Le Pen apart as the National Front leader arrived in the town, with some minor scuffles reported. 'The rule of law no longer holds sway in Calais. Now it's no more than a jungle where violence and the survival of the fittest reign,' said Le Pen. The port has long been a magnet for illegal migrants trying to reach Britain, where they believe they are more likely to find work. French riot policemen force out migrants who were hidden in a lorry making its way to the ferry terminal in Calais earlier this week . A policeman climbs into a lorry to remove a migrant who has been trapped in-between the cargo and the lorry in Calais . Nat Snet Kfley, 17, has living in the rubbish-strewn migrant camp in Calais for three months . Britain is not one of the 26 European states who have abolished internal borders under the Schengen agreement. In September, the French and British governments announced that the Calais port layout would be changed to make it easier to carry out controls and improve traffic flow, with barriers put up along the bypass leading to the port area. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has also promised a day-centre will be opened to cater to the hundreds of illegal immigrants who roam the streets and live in squats or makeshift camps. Denis Robin, prefect in the Pas-de-Calais region, said the centre should be open in November but that the authorities were determined to ensure it would not become a massive residential camp of the kind that was run by the Red Cross - the Sangatte camp - before ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy ordered it shut in 2002 at Britain's request.","National Front leader Marine Le Pen makes call for internal border controls .

"Tyson Fury is aiming to turn Old Trafford into the Theatre of World Title Dreams and make his mark on the famous old stadium like his Manchester United idol Eric Cantona. Fury became the mandatory challenger for Wladimir Klitschko's WBO heavyweight title after dismantling Dereck Chisora at the Excel Arena last month. He will once again headline a bill in London, at the O2 Arena, on February 28 before attentions turn to arranging a world title showdown with WBA, WBO and IBF king Klitschko in the summer. VIDEO Scroll down to see Tyson Fury up the ante on Klitschko . Tyson Fury is the mandatory challenger for Wladimir Klitschko's WBO heavyweight title . Promoter Frank Warren has set his sights on arranging a huge stadium show like the May 31 blockbuster topped by Carl Froch and George Groves at Wembley Stadium. Warren has suggested the national stadium or the Emirates, home of his beloved Arsenal, as suitable venues for Fury's world title challenge, be it against Klitschko or for the vacant WBO crown should the Ukrainian choose to relinquish the belt. But lifelong Manchester United fan Fury has other ideas. 'I don't know what these guys are on about,' he said, in reference to Warren and his own promoter Mick Hennessy, 'because they're from London they want to fight here all the time. Wladimir Klitschko holds the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles . 'I'm a big Manchester United fan so my dream fight would be at Old Trafford against Klitschko. 'These guys want it at Arsenal or Wembley but they're not my team, United is my team. Bar a few thousand tickets, it's basically the same attendance by the time the chairs are on the pitch and all that. I'm from Manchester so it makes sense to do it in the north west. 'The No 1 stadium in the country is obviously Wembley – it's the capital city and the biggest capacity so I understand why promoters want to put on fights there. But I'm not from London, I'm from Manchester so I believe it should happen where I'm from. 'If I'm going to fulfill my dream of fighting for the world heavyweight title and winning it then I want to do it at Old Trafford. It's called the Theatre of Dreams and it's where my dream will come true.' Old Trafford memorably played host to the 1993 rematch between Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank when the fierce British rivals drew their WBC and WBO super-middleweight title clash in front of the Stretford End. Ruthless Fury dismantled Dereck Chisora at the Excel Arena last month . Since then, the city's premier boxing venue has become the 21,000-seater Phones4u Arena, where local lads like Ricky Hatton and Scott Quigg have had world title fights. But Fury reckons the time is right to take boxing back to the 104-year-old home of Manchester United. Fury, currently unbeaten after 23 fights, said: 'I think the town deserves a world heavyweight title fight. They've got the two best football teams in the world so it deserves a big title fight in a stadium. 'It would be a great night for me, as a lifelong United fan, and a big night for the city as well. It has never had a big heavyweight title fight there before and it could be a massive opportunity. Manchester United fan Fury wants to fight Wladimir Klitschko at Old Trafford . Fury says he shares many similarities with Manchester United legend Eric Cantona . 'I've been down there quite a lot this year, I do a lot of charity things and events as well as go to games so I'm down there often. I get mobbed on match days – it's good.' Fury also revealed he has always admired one of the most controversial United icons of his generation – French great Eric Cantona. The gifted striker is considered one of the club's best ever players after scoring 89 goals in 193 games following his £1.2m move from Leeds in 1992. But he also made headlines off the pitch, most memorably in January 1995 when he was banned for nine months and ordered to do 120 hours community service after an infamous flying kick on 20-year-old Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons, who had goaded the Frenchman from the stands. And, although he has so far refrained from sticking one on a punter, Fury is considered one of the most colourful characters in British boxing and thinks he and Cantona have a lot in common. Promoter Frank Warren (second left) has his sights set on London showdown . He added: 'I've supported them all my life and my United idol is Cantona. He's my hero of all time. People say there are similarities between us – we're both crazy, we both say what we think and do what we want.' Fury has his doubts that Klitschko will ever agree to fighting him, and it has been suggested that the long-time champion, who calls himself Dr Steelhammer, does not want to deal with any of the Englishman's antics. When asked whether Wlad, the new father-of-one, might be cautious of travelling to Old Trafford to fight Fury in his won backyard, the 6ft 9in traveler admitted: 'I don't know. It's just about getting him in the ring. Listen, I would fight him in this room in front of 100 people, that's how confident I am. It doesn't matter if it's in his back garden or anywhere, he's still going to lose the fight.'","Heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury is lifelong Manchester United fan .

"Promoter Frank Warren is keen on staging a St Patrick’s weekend showdown between Andy Lee and Billy Joe Saunders. Lee claimed the vacant WBO middleweight world championship with a sixth-round stoppage win over Russian Matt Korobov on Saturday night, with the victory setting him on a collision course with European champion Saunders. While Lee will celebrate the win at a civic reception in his native Limerick on Wednesday, Warren is already planning for a spring blockbuster with his man Saunders, the WBO’s No 1 contender, and he could yet have a major say in fight plans as the promoter of the mandatory challenger when he sits down with Lee’s manager and trainer, Adam Booth, and US promoter Lou DiBella. Andy Lee stopped Matt Korobov in the sixth round in Las Vegas in win the WBO middleweight world title . Lee celebrates with his new belt (left) and referee Kenny Bayless brings the fight to a halt (right) The British champion had been in line to fight for the title but ended up taking on bitter rival Chris Eubank Jr, whom he defeated on a split decision. Warren maintains that his fighter is first in line for a shot and, favouring a March date, claims he is open to the idea of a St Patrick’s Weekend battle. ‘That sounds good, doesn’t it? There’s lots of different connotations for this fight. It’s two Travellers, and there’s all sorts of ways you can look at it,’ said Warren. ‘The WBO have ordered it, that was part of the deal. I agreed with Adam [Booth] that we’d step aside to let the [Korobov] fight happen, which is what we’ve done, so we just want to get it on. March would be perfect for it.’ Both former Olympians have said they are willing to fight but Lee has insisted that he will only defend his title in Ireland, challenging Saunders to fight in Dublin or Limerick. Billy Joe Saunders (right) will be Lee's first challenger after his victory over Chris Eubank Jnr last month . Warren suggested he is open to the idea of Saunders crossing the Irish Sea, but on Lee’s demand for a title defence in Ireland, he said: ‘There’s no stipulation on that at all. There’s never been a discussion and we don’t know what’s going to happen with that. It’s all about us sitting down and the fight going where it makes the most money, that’s the bottom line. 'I absolutely understand that, but we’ll see what happens when we get together,’ added Warren on Lee’s wish for a home date. ‘I’m always open to putting a show on in Ireland, I’ve got no problem with that but obviously we’ve got to get everyone agreeing to that.’ On the possibility of purse bids, he said: ‘Adam Booth and I had an agreement and obviously that will be honoured. He [Lee] wouldn’t have got the shot if it weren’t for the fact that we stepped aside. ‘We’ll let them get back from the States. We’ll get together and go through it and see where we’re going to go with it. I’m looking forward to getting it on. It’s a good fight for the Irish and the Brits.’","Andy Lee beat Matt Korobov to win the WBO middleweight title .

"Treated to a hero’s welcome at Shannon Airport and a civic reception at Limerick’s City Hall on Merchant’s Quay on Wednesday, it is surely a feeling Andy Lee could get used to. The new WBO middleweight champion is the 21st Irish boxer to claim a legitimate world title (current IBF super-bantamweight kingpin Carl Frampton coming before him) and the Castleconnell native has expressed his firm intention to defend the belt on home soil. In the ring following his sixth-round stoppage of Russia’s Matt Korobov in Las Vegas last Saturday, Lee declared in his post-fight speech: ‘I’m a champion now and I want to defend my belt in Ireland.’ Andy Lee, with his mother Anne, enjoys a hero’s welcome at Shannon Airport on Wednesday . But while he is a proud Irishman, having represented the country at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Lee’s fighting story began at the famous Repton Boxing Club, originally a landmark of London’s East End. Born in Bow, near Whitechapel, the son of settled Travellers, a young Lee followed his elder brothers into Repton. Back-to-back British Schoolboy titles were won in 1998/99 before his family moved back to Castleconnell, where he continued his boxing career at the St Francis club, going on to claim a silver medal for Ireland at the World Junior Championships in 2002 (where he was spotted by future coach Emanuel ‘Manny’ Steward) and a bronze medal at the 2004 European Championships in Croatia, which secured his place as Ireland’s only boxer in Athens. After opting to turn pro under Steward in 2006, moving to Detroit in the process, the Limerick man began a paid career which has so far lasted eight-and-a-half years. He dedicated his victory last weekend to Steward, ‘the man who made me’, but he has now come full circle in his boxing career, linking up with London-based trainer Adam Booth and relocating to the English capital where he relaunched his career following a failed 2012 title challenge to then WBC champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. Andy Lee stopped Matt Korobov in the sixth round in Las Vegas in win the WBO middleweight world title . With champion Peter Quillin vacating his WBO title, Lee took advantage by capitalising on the high (No 4) ranking earned from his knockout of Julian Jackson last June to book a date with mandatory No 1 contender Korobov, stopping the Russian in style. Not only has the win seen Lee fulfil his ultimate ambition of becoming a world champion, but it may also secure his financial future. Lee, however, claimed he is not in it for the money. ‘That was never the motivation,’ said Lee last weekend. ‘It was to do something in my life that was bigger than me and it’ll never be taken away from me now. I’ll always be a world champion.’ His principles and desire are characteristics which have helped him gain a deserved reputation as the gentleman of Irish boxing, but financial realities may yet have an influence on his future moves. While, ideally, Lee wants to fight in Ireland, he may not be able to dictate terms despite being the champ. The opportunity to fight for the vacant title came as No 2 contender Billy Joe Saunders opted to take on domestic rival Chris Eubank Jr, whom he defeated on points last month, and Saunders, the European and British champion (who is also a former Olympian) is now the mandatory No 1 challenge . Lee celebrates with his new belt (left) and referee Kenny Bayless brings the fight to a halt (right) Speaking to Sportsmail this week, his promoter Frank Warren claimed that an agreement had been made with Booth that allowed Lee to fight Korobov for the vacant title on the understanding the new champion would fight Saunders early next year. It is a fight that Lee claims he is more than happy to take, but only in Ireland. In reality, the supposed agreement between Booth and Warren is likely to mean the latter will have to acquiesce to such a proposal — something Warren has not ruled out — but the promoter could push for a March date in London, possibly on St Patrick’s weekend. Failure to come to terms would likely lead to purse bids for the promotional rights to the fight. But one thing is for sure — Lee is likely to enjoy his biggest pay day yet when it comes to his first defence, a likely six figures. His purse against Korobov was $69,000, but that figure would have been negotiated on the basis of getting the opportunity to fight for the title. A better indicator of his future purses was his opponent’s pay, as Korobov, mandatory challenger for the vacant belt, took home $160,000. Quillin, who opted not to defend against Korobov, walked away from what would have been a career-high $1.4m pay day. The fact that Lee is rated by US TV network HBO plays into his favour as TV money still pays the bills in big-time boxing. On the same Las Vegas bill as Lee-Korobov, headliner Tim Bradley earned €2million, while across town on the same night Amir Khan, a US TV regular, made $950,000. Lee’s previous fight may be an even better barometer of his potential bank balance, considering the money splashed out that night. While Lee made $70,000 taking on Jackson, the headline fight that night between Miguel Cotto and Sergio Martinez saw Cotto earn a $3m purse ($7m in total), with Martinez making $1.5m plus pay-per-view TV money. Billy Joe Saunders (right) will be Lee's first challenger after his victory over Chris Eubank Jnr last month . Cotto, the WBC world champion, is one of the sport’s main money earners. Whatever about Lee’s eagerness to defend his own title, the financial rewards for fighting Cotto would be astronomical while there is also the lure of his WBC belt and lineal championship. Speaking in September, Lee said: ‘He [Cotto] is the [lineal] middleweight champion of the world and, for me, I think he’s one of the easier champions to fight style-wise.’ The fact there are four ‘major’ world champions is a subject which irks most boxing enthusiasts as well as causal fans, but it is a reality Lee accepts. While he holds the WBO title, Cotto is the WBC champion and ‘the man who beat the man’ with his lineal title traced back to the original champion. Gennady Golovkin holds the WBA championship (and is rated by most as the best middleweight in the world) while veteran Jermain Taylor holds the IBF title. ‘Golovkin’s considered the world champion, really,’ said Lee, speaking to 4Thumps Irish boxing podcast. ‘I know, in the purest sense, having one championship belt is a nice thing and it would probably be better, genuinely, to sort everything out. But where there’s more belts more people get to fight and then champions can hopefully fight each other.’ Ideally, that is what Lee would aim for — a unification clash — but the shadow of Saunders looms. Otherwise, a domestic dust-up against Matthew Macklin remains an option, despite his recent loss. If Booth were to negotiate with Warren to allow Lee to have a keep-busy fight in the new year before meeting Saunders, it could open a path to a spring clash with the likes of Macklin, where a win would set up a summer blockbuster against the mandatory challenger at Thomond Park. Fanciful thinking since a March date with Saunders seems inevitable, but dreams sometimes come true — just ask Andy Lee.","Andy Lee beat Matt Korobov to secure the WBO middleweight title .

"There is another fight of significance for British boxing taking place here, in Las Vegas, on Saturday. Amir Khan will be the star attraction as he battles Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand Garden. But just a stroll down the Las Vegas Strip at the Cosmopolitan, Ireland’s Andy Lee will be taking on Matt Korobov for the vacant WBO middleweight title. Billy Joe Saunders, whose victory over Chris Eubank Jnr established him as the mandatory challenger to the winner, will be in London watching with keen interest. Andy Lee is preparing to fight Matt Koborov for the vacant WBO middleweight title on Saturday . Not only is his big chance coming, at just 25, but if Lee prevails he will beat both Saunders and Tyson Fury in the race to be the first member of the travelling community to win a world title. Even so, Saunders will be rooting for Lee. ‘We’re mates and I won’t be jealous if he pulls it off,’ he said. ‘I will be delighted for him. And if he does come through it will make for a massive domestic fight for us next year.’ Lee, whose only previous world-title shot ended in defeat against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr, is again the underdog. Korobov enjoyed a stellar amateur career, winning multiple world titles. But it has taken the talented Russian time to adapt to the professional ring. Lee (left) has earned his second shot at a world title having lost to Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr previously . However, he seems to have settled into the paid ranks now and is a heavy betting favourite to see off Lee. Saunders sees it differently, believing Korobov would be the easier opponent and saying: ‘I think his style would suit me perfectly. He’s good but the way to beat him is to keep him busy, keep the pressure on, wear him down — and that’s what he will get from me if we meet. ‘With Andy you have to bring your A-game or you’ll be in trouble. He will be dangerous in the first few rounds.’ Nevertheless, Saunders slightly favours Korobov to prevail, saying: ‘I keep wavering between the two but in the end I think Korobov will edge it on points.’ Billy Joe Saunders (right) could fight the winner of Koborov or Lee after beating Chris Eubank Jnr last month .

"Barcelona still look set to part company with coach Luis Enrique, despite winning 5-0 in midweek, and former Brighton manager Oscar Garcia is the surprise name on a list of possible replacements. Catalan television reported last night that Barca president Josep Bartomeu had met Leo Messi, made it clear he sided with him in his fall-out with Luis Enrique, and was already looking to replace the 44-year-old coach. Finding a new manager could be problematic because any new appointment would only be offered a short-term contract due to elections that have been called for the end of the season and that makes Garcia one of the candidates. Former Watford manager Oscar Garcia could replace Luis Enrique if the Barcelona coach quits the Nou Camp . Enrique future at the Catalan club is in doubt after a fall-out with senior players .

Messi is understood to have also mentioned a possible return for Frank Rijkaard in his conversations with the president. Garcia narrowly missed out on taking Brighton to the Premier League in 2013 and is a former Barcelona player, who has worked at the club as a youth team coach, taking the Under 19 side to an unprecedented treble in 2011. He turned down the chance to replace Andoni Zubizarreta as sporting director earlier this week because he wants his next job to be in management and he would fit the profile of a coach who knows the club and is available.

"Nigel Pearson is confident Leicester City will be able to obtain a work permit for new £9million signing Andrej Kramaric - because Chelsea launched a bid too. The Premier League’s bottom club will need to win their case on appeal as the Croatia striker does not meet current criteria, but Pearson thinks the high-level interest in him provides a strong argument. Kramaric, 23, has scored 28 goals this season for Croatian team Rijeka this term and found the net twice in his five international appearances. Andrej Kramaric arrives at Leicester City, where he's signed in a deal worth £9m pending a work permit . Striker Kramaric (centre) is hoping to join the bottom-placed Foxes from Croatian club Rijeka . Kramaric scored 28 goals in 31 games for Rijeka this season and has attracted interest from Chelsea . ‘It would be fair to say he has a very bright future and hopefully that will be taken into consideration,’ said Pearson. ‘The very fact there has been interest from some very big clubs would be significant in the sense that he is a player who is rated domestically and certainly across Europe. 'I think we have a pretty strong case with his international status and his form, internationally and at club level. He has represented Croatia at every level. 'It is never easy to get these situations finalised but I have been very impressed with him as a person and I think he will be a very important signing for us. It speaks volumes for the lad that he is prepared to come to us in our own situation.' Chelsea had looked to be edging ahead in the race for Kramaric’s signature before the Premier league leaders were unable to guarantee him a place in their squad next season. Pearson hopes Kramaric can fire the goals that get Leicester to safety. The 23-year-old striker (left) has scored two goals in four international appearances for Croatia . Foxes boss Nigel Pearson says they have a strong case for Kramaric given his form and growing profile . 'He is a player we have had on the radar for a while,’ he said. 'It is really important for us to strengthen. Clearly his goalscoring record speaks for itself. He has good energy levels. It is just a very important signing for us.’ As the Foxes await news on the Kramaric deal, the club have re-opened talks with Mainz over striker Shinji Okazaki. Sportsmail revealed this week that Leicester had made an £8million offer for the Japan international but Mainz want £10million. Leicester have been rebuffed in other bids for Shaun Maloney at Wigan Athletic and Danny Ings at Burnley while Jermain Defoe is awaiting other offers.

"Despite having a fine strike force with the likes of Diego Costa, Loic Remy and Didier Drogba, Chelsea had been keen on bolstering their front line with striker Andrej Kramaric. But Leicester City at the bottom of the Barclays Premier League are desperate to find a striker to fire them to safety. Sportsmail's Matt Barlow gives you the lowdown on the 23-year-old from HNK Rijeka. Typical Chelsea, eh? Quick out of the blocks when the market opens, signing reinforcements up front. It's true, they were close to signing Croatia international striker Andrej Kramaric for a fee thought to be around £8million. The deal is not to go ahead this week after being complicated by Premier League Rule V.7.1, which would prevent him from being loaned to Leicester immediately as he was not intended to go into Jose Mourinho's squad this season. The move stalled as the club wanted him to move immediately out on loan as soon as he completes the transfer to Stamford Bridge but Chelsea failed to guarantee he would return to west London at the end of the season, too. Croatian striker Andrej Kramaric is in London to discuss a move to Chelsea or Leicester City . Chelsea had planned to loan Kramaric to Leicester, here's why they can't... Premier League Rule V.7.1 . 'A Temporary Transfer to a Club may not take place in the Transfer Window in which the Transferor Club acquired the Player's registration.' This PL rule wrecked the plan for Chelsea to sign Kramaric from Rijeka then loan him to Leicester and complicated the move. But the rule only covers loan deals between PL clubs. It would not have stopped Chelsea signing Kramaric and then loaning him abroad, as they did with Kurt Zouma last January. Chelsea now seem to have backed out of the deal altogether, leaving Leicester to pick up negotiations to sign him permanently. To Leicester? Premier League's bottom side has joined the chase . Yes they are in talks, and Juventus have expressed an interest along with various big clubs around Europe. Apparently, Leicester offered a bigger fee than Chelsea but once Chelsea were interested Kramaric made up his mind that he wanted to move there and agreed personal terms. There seemed to be a compromise plan hatched to let him join Leicester on loan from Chelsea for the rest of the season but this is no longer possible. He did not want to spend his time on loan elsewhere next season, either. As the Chelsea move has stalled, Leicester are now exploring the possibility of offering extra bonus payments to entice Kramaric to them despite their precarious position but wouldn't loan him out. Croatia has been in the European Union since July 2013 but are still subject to work permit regulations. This should not stop an international footballer, who would be classed as 'highly skilled' by the Home Office, but there will be hoops to jump through. If he does sign for Chelsea, Kramaric could move on loan abroad, possibly to Vitesse Arnhem, in Holland. Kramaric, in action against Italy for Croatia, could be lining up for Chelsea or Leicester in the Premier League . Don't they have a special connection to Chelsea? They do have a very close relationship and like to reward each other with favours. Three Chelsea players are already on loan there: Wallace, Josh McEachran and Bertrand Traore, who has impressed as a centre-forward this season but has recently joined up with Burkina Faso ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations. Vitesse would love to acquire Kramaric to help them cope without Traore. Feyenoord were also interested after he scored three against them in the Europa League. Vitesse seemed to be the favourites a few days ago but CEO Joost de Wit said this weekend that they were no longer sure of signing him, either. Lille are the latest name linked to Kramaric. It appears to be a transfer cluttered and confused by lots of agents. The 23-year-old has managed to score 28 goals for Rijeka so far this season in the Croatian HNL . Why all the fuss? The goals: he has 28 in 31 games in all competitions this season for his club HNK Rijeka. He represented Croatia at all youth levels (he won 53 caps through the age levels) and has four senior caps (two goals) since his debut in August. But there are doubts about his quality at the highest level. Kramaric is 23, so no longer a kid fresh from his Academy. He emerged through the ranks to great acclaim at Dinamo Zagreb, but was unable to establish himself at Croatia's biggest club. He enjoyed a prolific spell on loan at Lokomotiva but when he returned to Dinamo again failed to break into the team and left under a cloud to join Rijeka in 2013. Immediately, he hit goal form again. He scored 27 last year, winning the Croatian Cup and is getting better. He helped Rijeka beat his former club Dinamo Zagreb to win the Croatian Super Cup and scored five in one game against Lokomotiva. So he could be the next Davor Suker? Or the next Bosko Balaban? Doubts remain about his ability to play up top. Does he have the mental strength to perform at a big club, under pressure? Lots of clubs have watched him. He is a right-footed centre-forward but not a target man. He is technically adept, finds space in the penalty box and threatens goal. He is mobile but not keen to run behind defences into the channels. Instead, he prefers to move towards the ball, link-up play and then time his runs into the box. Croatia boss Niko Kovac compared him to former Arsenal and West Ham striker Davor Suker, but some English clubs who have watched Kramaric closely and concluded he might be better suited to the more precise football played in Italy, Spain or Holland.","Striker Andrej Kramaric has been in talks with Leicester and Chelsea .

"Martin Keown believes Steven Gerrard is leaving Liverpool too soon, but Jamie Carragher has backed his former team-mate's decision to depart. The 34-year-old is set to announce that he will quit Liverpool in the summer when his contract expires, ending a 26-year association with the club. However Sportsmail columnist Keown believes the former England captain still has much to offer Brendan Rodgers' side. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard applauds the fans after the 2-2 draw against Leicester on Thursday . 'I think you keep hold of these great players for as long as possible,' he said on Match of the Day. 'You’ve got to think it’s his decision because they’ll want to keep him, Brendan Rodgers wants that, you need that to integrate the old and the new. You certainly can’t blame Gerrard for where they are in the table this season.' But Carragher tweeted: 'Sad day for Lfc & English football with the Gerrard news, I think it’s the right decision all things considered. ‘Leaving or retiring is a great confidence booster, this morning my timeline was full of “why's Gerrard starting” now it’s “Gerrard best ever”.

'But probably I think the time is right. I think he’s been a magnificient servant and one of the best Premier League players ever. 'The problem is where do you play Steven Gerrard now. Do you play him number 10? A defensive midfielder? I’d play him in a back three, which he is more than capable of because playing Gerrard in the middle of the park at his age you miss Jordan Henderson’s energy.'

"Kevin Russell was handcuffed to a police bench, his face still raw from the pepper spray as his little girl's life ebbed away and now he is facing three counts of criminal charges for the events that transpired the night his 16-year-old daughter killed herself. On the evening of March 17th, Kevin, his wife Julissa and their son, Brant, found their daughter and sister, Brooke, lying in the park behind their Joplin, Missouri, home, having shot herself in the head. Frantically rushing Brooke to meet an ambulance at the local police station with Julissa and his son Brant, Kevin lost his temper with an EMT when his daughter fell off the gurney and claims that police proceeded to pepper spray him and his son, arrest them and now instead of mourning they are facing three misdemeanor charges -- assault, disturbing the peace, and obstruction - of the EMT. Devastated: Kevin Russell is struggling to deal . with the grief from his daughter (right) Brooke's suicide let alone the . criminal charges stemming from the night she died . Tragedy: Brant Russell (left) dad, Kevin, mom, Julissa and Brooke- in a family picture taken before Brooke's suicide on March 17th, 2013 . Family: Brooke (left), Kevin, Brant and Julissa pose for a family picture before the tragic death of Brooke earlier this year . 'To me time was everything, I was going 'let's go, get her to the hospital, hurry up, hurry up,' Kevin remembers saying to the EMT after being instructed by emergency services to meet the ambulance at the station instead of going straight to the hospital. Feeling he has been left with no choice but to go to the media after failing to get the police to drop the charges through legal means, Kevin told KSPR that everything spiraled out of control when he and his panicked son met the people they hoped would save Brooke's life. Kevin says that as the EMT turned to ask what Brooke's condition was, he turned away for a moment and his daughter slipped off the gurney. Losing his cool at the time, Kevin told KSPR, 'I started screaming and said 'do your f*****g job, get her to the hospital,' and the EMT put his finger in my face and said 'calm down sir.' I was screaming 'please get her to the hospital.' 'And right about that time a police officer ran up on the sidewalk and I saw Brant go down.' His son Brant - who is enrolled in the military and has had his deployment postponed because of the charges - had been pepper sprayed. Harrowing: Brooke went for a run on the evening she died and was found in the public park at the back of the Russell's house . Mother: Brooke's mother Julissa says she wasn't allowed to travel with her daughter in the ambulance after her husband and son were arrested following an incident at the ambulance on the night of her girls suicide . Handcuffed: This is the holding room where Kevin and Brant Russell were held in cuffs attached to the bench while Brooke passed away from a self-inflicted gunshot wound . Memories: These are the photographs that adorn a mirror in Brooke's room at her home in Joplin, Missouri . 'I was on the pavement, I couldn't breathe and another officer put a knee in my back and told me to get up and he said if I didn't get up he was going to tase me,' Brant said to KSPR. Suddenly, Kevin found himself sprayed too and arrested. They were both taken into the police station and handcuffed to a bench. Three and a half hours later, they were released and discovered to their horror that Brooke had died. 'I had been thinking they're going to save her, everything always works out, she's going to be okay,' said Kevin to KSPR. According to Kevin's sister, Julissa was also pushed away from the ambulance as her daughter was rushed to the hospital - unable to ride along with her critically injured girl. In a posting on social media website reddit to raise awareness of his case, Kevin Russell describes in detail as he remembers it some of the events of that night. As they arrived at the police station with Brooke, Kevin says, 'We put her on the gurney that was halfway out of the ambulance, and I screamed that my daughter had shot herself, and we needed to get her to the hospital.' Misery: Kevin Russell stares at pictures of Brooke - over six months on from her tragic death . 'At this point, I backed away because I thought they would put her in the ambulance and drive away. But they didn’t. The paramedics turned to me to ask what happened. I then saw Brooke fall on her back on the pavement and I screamed at them.' Kevin then describes what happened to him and his son, Brant: 'There were a lot of police officers around us. One of the officers was on my right. 'I then heard a policeman to the right of my son tell him to calm down, but my son was doing nothing except standing next to me and crying. 'I then saw my son go down because he was pepper-sprayed. I heard someone tell me to calm down or they would pepper-spray me, and then I saw the spray shoot out. I turned my head to the left and felt it land against the back of my head. 'The fumes made it hard to breath. I turned around, still screaming to get my daughter to the hospital, and then another stream of pepper spray hit me right in the eyes.' Describing what happened when he and his son were taken to the station, Kevin identifies one officer as kindly. 'An older police officer took me back to the shower and told me to strip to wash off all of the pepper spray. He was the only officer who looked sad for what had happened.' The teenager was described by her family as happy and normal and they thought her moodiness was down to her teenage years . Found: This is the park behind the Russell's Joplin, Missouri home where they found Brooke's seriously injured body on March 17th . And then tragically, after he was released, charged along with his son for assault, disturbing the peace, and obstruction - obstruction of an EMT officer - Kevin described the scene at the hospital. 'I ran down the hall to the door. I opened the door to the small consultation room,' writes Kevin Russell. 'There was a police chaplain, a very nice woman from the hospital, my mother-in-law, father-in-law and brother-in-law. I looked at Julissa and cried. 'Is she alive?' I said, and she shook her head no. I ran to her and started screaming.' However, Joplin Police Chief Lane Roberts told KSPR, that despite Kevin Russell's complaints, he does not have the option of going public with his officers side of the story. 'What I'll tell you is that the conduct that's alleged is directly contradictory to our values, our mission statement, our code of ethics,' the chief explained. 'Those are not the things we engage in.' Described by her family as 'funny' and 'sweet', Kevin Russell says that even though she was moody, he attributed this to his daughter being a teenager. Ten days before she died, she ran away and it was on Saturday, March 17th, when she did not return home from a run that Julissa went looking for her. 'I got a call from my wife and she was screaming, I couldn't even understand her,' Kevin said. 'I knew something was wrong, I never heard her scream like that, and I said 'Julissa please slow down,' and I heard 'gun,' I heard 'blood.' Painful: The Russell family agonized over whether to release part of their daughter's suicide note . When Kevin and Brant arrived at the scene they thought that Brooke might have survive. 'I remember saying, 'Oh my God.'  I threw my phone down while I was on with 911 and I ran to her.  I checked for a pulse but didn't feel a pulse and there was just a little mark, I really couldn't tell, the back of her head,' said Kevin to KSPR of the wound. 'And I looked into her eyes and her eyes were halfway open like she was sleeping with her eyes open.' Kevin claims the police will not drop the charges and want him to take anger management, but all that he can still think of his the final paragraph of the suicide note his daughter left him. 'Keep me in my warm clothes because I hate the cold and bury me underneath a tree.  I love you.  The next life has more to offer me,' wrote Brooke.","Brooke Russell, 16, shot herself in the head on March 17th and was found by her family in the park behind her house in Joplin, Missouri .

"Here’s to health and wellbeing (and gorgeous skin!) with the new year in mind. Liz Earle lifts a glass to the benefits of juicing . The beauty benefits . Liz Earle . I’ve been singing the praises of juicing for 30 years and I’m more excited than ever to share in my new book (see page 66) the many varied health, beauty and wellbeing benefits. To give you an introductory flavour, the recipes on these pages include some of my favourite beauty and skin-boosting juices. Beauty, like health, comes from within, so what we eat plays a vital role. Good skincare can help us look good on the outside, but nothing will last if it doesn’t also come from within. Sparkling eyes, clear, glowing skin, vim and vigour are all signs of a healthy working system. Raw fruit and vegetable juices aid the body’s natural functions of cleansing and repair to keep us looking young and feeling great. They are also bursting with vitamins, minerals and other very valuable micronutrients that help build stronger, clearer and more youthful-looking skin. Fruit and vegetables – especially the most colourful kind – are key here. The pigments in fresh produce correlate to the nutritional compounds contained within; for example, the orange colour of carrots, apricots and mangoes means a rich source of carotene, while the red, purply blue tones of cherries, blueberries and red cabbage come from antioxidant-rich anthocyanins. These nutrients are particularly useful when it comes to preserving our collagen and elastin fibres, the springy network of elastic tissues that gives skin its youthful plumped-up glow. Choose your blitz kit . On the subject of juicers, the centrifugal kind fits the bill. These work by means of a rapidly spinning blade and centrifugal force whizzing around a central cavity, forcing pulp one way and juice the other. Most kitchen appliance brands have their own versions (some brands make several different varieties). The main difference tends to be the power of the motor – the more powerful the machine, the faster it will juice. The more powerful machines may also be slightly better built, as they need a sturdier housing for the motor. They can be a good investment if you’re intending to juice on a daily basis, as, being more robust, they tend to have a longer working life. Much has been written about the benefits of ‘slow juicers’ which – as their name suggests – crush fruit and veg in a slower way, more akin to a cold-pressing action. The theory is that this preserves nutritional values by avoiding excess heat in the blades, but research has shown that high-speed juicers are more efficient at extracting the juice (and therefore higher levels of nutrients), so may be a better option. My favourite juicing machine is one with a high-powered motor and wide feeding tube to accommodate whole apples and larger pieces of veg – which also saves time chopping. We're loving the range of juicers at sageappliances.co.uk, featured earlier this year in YOU. Pictured: the powerful Nutri Juicer Pro, with 1500W motor, £299.99. Their basic Nutri Juicer, £149.99 , was named Best Buy in rigorous tests by Which. Juice by Liz Earle will be published by Kyle Books on 8 January, price £14.99.

"John Malkovich and Gary Sinise in the 1992 film adaptation of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, which is set to be dropped from the GCSE syllabus . US literary classics are to be dropped from English literature GCSEs under plans that have triggered a backlash against Michael Gove. To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee and John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men are among the American novels being ditched by an exam board, along with the Arthur Miller play The Crucible. The OCR board said it had taken the decision because of the Education Secretary’s desire for the exam to be ‘more focused on tradition’ and because there were fewer opportunities to include American texts on the new British-dominated syllabus. But the decision has sparked a storm of protest, with complaints on Twitter and thousands signing a series of online petitions to keep American classics on GCSE syllabuses. Authors, academics and booksellers have condemned the shake-up, with some describing it as ‘backward-looking’ and a traditionalist attempt to reinstate the idea of a ‘canon’ of English literature. The Department for Education has insisted that its document about content for the subject, published in December, ‘doesn’t ban any authors, books or genres’. The new GCSE course will include at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one 19th century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and ‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’. Exam boards can add extra books, but experts say the rules leave very little room for 20th century writing outside Britain. Paul Dodd, OCR’s head of GCSE and . A-level reform, said in an interview: ‘Of Mice and Men, which Michael . Gove really dislikes, will not be included. 'It was studied by 90 per cent of teenagers taking English literature GCSE in the past. Michael Gove said that was a really disappointing statistic.’ Yesterday . he criticised the DfE ‘restrictions’, saying: ‘The essential thing is . that in the new GCSE you cannot do fiction or drama from 1914 unless it . is British.’ One . online petition, signed by 2,567, states: ‘Modern texts from outside . the UK are equally, if not more, important as British texts.’ Children’s . Laureate Malorie Blackman said on Twitter: ‘Surely diversity in the . curriculum is vital to encourage more extended reading and to expand our . teens’ minds?’ Waterstones in Braehead, Glasgow, . tweeted: ‘Don’t be alarmed if we put your copy of To Kill A Mockingbird . in a brown bag. We hear Michael Gove might be doing spot checks.’ The Crucible, which was adapted into a film featuring Winona Ryder and . Daniel Day-Lewis, is another text being dropped by exam board OCR due to Michael . Gove's desire for the exam to be 'more focused on tradition' Bethan Marshall, chairman of the National Association for the Teaching of English, described the new syllabus as being ‘out of the 1940s’. She said: ‘Kids will be put off doing A-level literature by this.’ The country’s exam boards must submit their GCSE English literature specifications to regulator Ofqual this week for accreditation. It is understood that Willy Russell’s play Educating Rita is on one exam board’s syllabus. A spokesman for Edexcel said it was still finalising its English literature GCSE specification. AQA, the other main exam board, has yet to reveal its specifications. A DfE spokesman said: ‘In the past, English literature GCSEs were not rigorous enough and their content was often far too narrow.’","Famous US literary classics set to be dropped from English literature exam .

"The husband of a mother-of-two found strangled on the back seat of her Mercedes Benz has reportedly failed a lie detector test. Bob Bashara, who gave a series of emotional interviews following the discovery of his wife's body, is a 'person of interest', police said.

Her husband of 26 years was interrogated by police for four hours on Friday, ABC 7 reported. During that time he took a polygraph test. While Bashara, 54, is not being treated as a suspect, he is the only person of interest, police said. Victim: Marketing exec Jane Bashara was found strangled in her car . Investigators have searched the family's home and seized computer hard drives. Cadaver dogs also sniffed through the house for evidence. 'He has continued to cooperate with our investigation. He is a person of interest within our investigation,' police chief David Hiller told WJBK. 'The evidence seized at the home will be turned over to our detectives and investigators for their review.' Mrs Bashara's body was found in her car parked in an alley in east Detroit, although police said they do not think she was killed in the vehicle. Her cellphone and purse were found close by - but Mr Bashara has said his wife would have had no reason to be in the area. She had last spoken to her husband on her way home from work on Tuesday, . Bashara . told police he returned to home around 8 p.m. to find the TV on and . that her work ID was there - suggesting she had made it home. Discovery: Her body was found in her SUV eight miles from her home . 'I got home and she wasn’t around and I relaxed and figured she was out running an errand,' Bob Bashara told 7 Action News on Thursday. 'As 9:00 and 9:30 approached, I became much more concerned and I got more people involved,' he said. 'I called my kids to see if they had heard from her and they hadn’t. 'I had been calling her cell phone to find out and then as time got on I involved the police because I was concerned there might be something wrong.' Gone: When Jane's husband Bob returned to their Grosse Point home, the TV was on and his wife's car, purse and cellphone were missing . Mystery: Jane Bashara's Mercedes Benz SUV was found near Hoover with her strangled body in the back . After friends and relatives told him they had not seen her, Bashara reported her missing. Speaking to the Detroit Free Press last week, he said: 'I have no clue. Someone obviously had made their way into her car or attacked her and . did what they did to her and dropped her, stashed her car somewhere. 'My heart is broken, and I'm very sad. And it's terrible to think what she had to go through . in the last moments of her life.' No motive has been suggested for the brutal murder of Jane - who has been described as a beloved wife and mother-of-two. Mysterious: Mrs Bashara, a mother-of-two, was last seen by co-workers . 'Emotional': Bashara had given a series of interviews following the discovery . Jane Bashara worked as a senior marketing manager at Kema Services, an energy consulting and testing and certification company. The Detroit News reports that Bob Bashara is president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club and was involved in various charities. 'They were just a great couple,' neighbour Alex Jones told ABC 7.

See below for video . video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .",Bob Bashara declared a 'person of interest' in investigation into murder of his wife of 26 years .
"Police may be close to arresting the husband of a marketing executive found dead in January, despite fervent statements to the contrary. Authorities have reportedly spent the last few months gathering a case against Bob Bashara of Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan. His wife, Jane Bashara, was reported missing by her husband on January 23. The next day, her body was found behind the wheel of her Mercedes SUV, which was parked in an alley in Detroit. Scroll down for videos . Strangled: Jane Bashara, left, was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 - eight miles away from their Grosse Point Park home - a day after her husband Bob, right, reported her missing . Innocent: Bob Bashara and his daughter Jessie spoke to GMA with both insisting Bob had nothing to do with the Michigan mother's murder . The 56-year-old had been strangled to death, and bruises on her body and broken finger nails proved she 'fought for her life', according to police. While police have long considered Bob Bashara a person of interest in his wife’s murder, he has not been charged - but reports say that may soon change. Joe Gentz, a local handyman who admitted in January that he was hired to kill Mrs Bashara by her husband, was arrested in March and charged with the murder. Gentz also faces charges of conspiracy, an indication that authorities believe more than one person was involved. Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to Detroit . Fear: Bashara insists he has no reason to kill his wife of 26 years and is petrified of spending his life behind bars . Since his wife’s murder, Bob Bashara has vehemently denied being involved, but Gentz tells a different story, saying Mr Bashara promised him money and a used car if Gentz killed Mrs Bashara. In an email to Ohio’s The News-Herald, Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney spokeswoman Maria Miller said: '[The case is] still under investigation’. However, the paper reports that word from the Wayne County Prosecutor’s Office indicate Bashara will be brought in either this week or next week to face charges. Murdered: Jane Bashara was strangled in the back of her Mercedes SUV in January . In the meantime, The News-Herald reported that Bob Bashara has collected about 24 letters from character witnesses to use in court if he’s charged with the murder in an effort to secure a release from jail on bond. In an appearance on Good Morning America in February, Bob Bashara, 54, with his daughter Jessie proclaimed his innocence in the case. He said: 'I did nothing wrong. I didn't commit murder. I didn't pay to have my wife killed. I'm going to see this through to the end. And I'm innocent. 'And all the badgering, and all the bad words, and all the negativity, I'm going to have to live through'. Police again searched the Bashara's Grosse Pointe home in February and found blood in the garage - something they said they missed in their initial extensive search of the property and the surrounding area. Bob Bashara said he finds it 'fishy' that it's the first time they found it despite extensively searching the home two weeks ago. On the day of Jane's memorial service, Gentz, a man known to the family, turned himself into police and said Bashara pointed a gun to his head and made him kill his wife, something he said he was paid $2,000 for. It also emerged that Bashara was having an affair with a woman called Rachel Gillette and was planning on buying a house with her. But he told GMA he had 'no reason' to kill his wife of 26 years and that he loved her very much: 'We had a very good, open relationship. I'm frightened about this. To know that I could spend the rest of my life in jail for a crime I didn't commit is a very scary thing.' Arrested and charged: Joe Gentz, right, stood with his attorney Don Aubrey last month when he was charged for his role in Jane Bashara's murder . The 54-year-old said he came home to find his wife missing and the lights and TV left on in their home. Mr Bashara said he last spoke to his wife when she was driving home from work but phone records showed no such phone call took place. The local businessman admitted he and Gentz, 48, had a dispute over a $600 bill and Mr Bashara's attorney believes Gentz may have showed up at his home and demanded money from  Jane before getting into a struggle with her. Deceit: Though they had been married for 26 years, Mr Bashara was said to be having a relationship with a woman who he was planning on buying a house with . Police said the mother-of-two was murdered in her home and then dumped in her own car. Her husband told police that Gentz's version of events was absurd and said he does not even own a firearm. He told GMA the allegations are a 'sick assessment' that 'shows how deranged he is'. 'I do believe he's the one that did it. He wanted more money from me. He badgered me. And yes, I do believe he's capable of it,' Mr Bashara said. It has been reported that Gentz has the IQ of a third grader. He told police he turned himself in as he did not want to be wholly implicated in the crime but that Mr Bashara was the mastermind behind it all. Property: Bashara was said to have a 'sex dungeon' with whips and chains in the basement of the Hard Luck bar and Lounge . Investigators also confirmed they found an 'S&M sex dungeon' in the basement of a bar Mr Bashara owned called the Hard Luck Lounge. A Detroit dominatrix named Lady Geanna told WXYZ-TV that Mr Bashara hosted S&M sex parties there. She said: 'Several of my clients or slaves have called me today. Since this has come out I've had like over 20 phone calls. 'They are all people who have been to his parties and asked if I was involved with them,' she said on Friday. Some of them were worried there might have been hidden cameras, things like that'. Sources confirmed the room was filled with whips, chains and a bed and that Mr Bashara had been drinking at the Hard Luck Lounge the night his wife was murdered.

"Teenagers will study African kingdoms and the rise of Islam as part of a new history A-level aimed at broadening lessons beyond 'Hitler and the Henrys'. Examiners yesterday proposed a range of extra topics to be added to history A-levels under Coalition reforms aimed at making public exams more rigorous. They include the rise of the Islam between 550 and 750, African kingdoms between 1400 and 1800, Genghis Khan, the Arab Spring, Chinese rulers from 1839 to 1989 and the Mughal Empire in India. The new syllabus has been drawn up in response to complaints that school history has been dominated by the Second World War and the Tudors. Teenagers will study African kingdoms and the rise of Islam as part of a new history A-level aimed at broadening lessons beyond 'Hitler and the Henrys'. Pictured is the holy Islamic site of Mecca . Education Secretary Michael Gove has also ordered exam boards to ensure that history covers at least a 200-year sweep instead of 100 years under the current syllabus. But the changes may prove controversial among those who advocate a strong focus on British history. Mr Gove himself has stressed the importance of teaching British history, declaring in the Commons history lessons must ensure 'we can celebrate the distinguished role of these islands in the history of the world, from the role of the Royal Navy in putting down the slave trade, to the way in which, since 1688, this nation has been a beacon for liberty that others have sought to emulate'. Another subject that could be taught is the Mughal Empire in India. Pictured is Kunwar Anop Singh of Devgarh . The new-look A-level has been developed by the OCR exam board - the same board which infuriated the Department for Education with plans earlier this month to include Russell Brand and rapper Dizzee Rascal in an English syllabus. The planned new history A-level will also include new British history topics including a study of King Alfred and 'the making of England 871 to 1016'. British history will account for 25 per cent of the marks in the new qualification - the same proportion as currently. Professor Peter Mandler, President of the Royal Historical Society, said it was important to broaden school history. 'The aspect of recent reforms to GCSE and A-Level most widely greeted with approval by academic historians has been the push to broaden the curriculum beyond the 20th century,' he said. 'History tells us not so much about who we are as about who we have been and what we might yet be. We welcome efforts by the examination boards to bring recent academic research on hitherto under-explored histories within reach of school pupils. 'It is particularly important not to tell the history of the non-Western world solely through its contact with the West.' The new A-level – which will need to be submitted to exams watchdog Ofqual for approval - will be first taught in schools in September 2015. Leading universities have been overseeing the development of syllabuses and recommended that a 200-year sweep of history is studied instead of 100. OCR said its course would cover about 1,700 years. Some educators feel the syllabus is too focused on 20th Century developments in the West. Pictured, Soviet soldiers raise a red victory flag over the Reichstag in Berlin after the German capital's capture in May 1945 . Some 58 topics covering British and international history are already available; a further 10 are now being added. Mike Goddard, OCR Head of History, commented: 'School history has been criticised, sometimes unfairly, for being too repetitive and for having a 20th century, Western focus. 'Hitler and the Henrys can dominate. Universities tell us they want incoming students to have greater breadth of knowledge. It's vital that schools and colleges have an opportunity to deliver, for example, the history of pre-colonial, non-western civilisations, alongside British history. 'OCR's new African Kingdoms c 1400 - 1800 topic for example, developed with help from experts in higher education, will give students, for the first time, the chance to discover the economic and political power of four pre-colonial kingdoms, which had far-reaching global trade and diplomatic connections.'","The history of a wider range of countries will be taught under new plans .

"A North Carolina police officer who authorities say fatally shot an unarmed man as he sought assistance after he crashed his vehicle early Saturday morning has been charged with voluntary manslaughter in the man's death. Authorities in Charlotte say former Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University football player Jonathan Ferrell appears to have crashed his car down an embankment about 2:30 a.m. and then knocked on the door of a nearby residence shortly after looking for help. The homeowner opened the door thinking it was her husband. When she realized it was 24-year-old Ferrell - a stranger - she closed the door and called 911, according to reports. 'Killer': Authorities say Officer Randall Kerrick shot an unarmed man who may have needed help after an auto accident . When officers arrived, they found Ferrell a short distance from the home, and he matched a description given by the homeowner, police said. The statement said officers approached Ferrell to investigate the original call. Ferrell ran toward the officers and one officer fired a taser, however it failed to discharge, police said. Ferrell continued to run toward police when Officer Randall Kerrick, 27, fired his weapon, hitting Ferrell several times, according to WSOC. Ferrell was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities said Kerrick fired his weapon with 'excessive' and 'unlawful' force. Victim: 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell may have been seeking help when he was shot by police . A wrecked vehicle was later discovered in woods nearby. 'We believe that vehicle belonged to the individual who was shot. It's quite possible he was seeking assistance. Based on his accident, it was a pretty serious accident,' Monroe said. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe said the accident was so serious Ferrell would have been forced to climb out of the back window of the vehicle, WSOC reported. He apparently walked to the nearest house and banged on the door. Monroe told a news conference that he didn't think Ferrell was trying to rob the woman. 'I don't believe threats were made,' the chief said. The former Florida A&M University football player had recently moved to the area. Monroe also said he had spoken with Kerrick. Help: Authorities believe Ferrell knocked on this door looking for help. The homeowner called 911 . 'He is pretty shook up,' the chief said. 'He's devastated.' Kerrick has been with Charlotte-Mecklenburg police since April 2011. Monroe said at a news conference that Kerrick was in custody. Police say he was charged with voluntary manslaughter after an investigation found that the shooting was excessive. He handed himself in on Saturday. 'The evidence revealed that Mr Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr Ferrell was excessive,' police said in a statement issued late Saturday. 'Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.' Two other officers at the scene have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a probe into the shooting, according to the station. Monroe said his heart went out to the victim's loved ones. 'My hearts goes out to the Ferrell family, quite naturally, as well as the main members of the CMPD family,' he said. 'This is never something easy to deal with, never something easy for us to quite grasp, but we are going to rise form this as we have from other things.' FAMU interim athletic director Michael Smith confirmed that Ferrell played the safety position for the Rattlers in 2009-10.","Jonathan Ferrell appears to have crashed .

"A lawyer who wrote in defence of Ched Evans after the footballer was convicted of rape has been appointed to world sport’s ‘supreme court’. Stuart Gilhooly, a solicitor for the Professional Footballers’ Association of Ireland (PFAI), sparked outrage after appearing to suggest the 26-year-old player was innocent. In the same article he described the rape for which Evans was jailed as an ‘alleged crime’. Scroll down for video . Solicitor Stuart Gilhooly, pictured with Luis Suarez, will sit on the panel at the Court of Arbitration for Sport . Despite the controversy over his remarks, Mr Gilhooly will sit on the panel at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which works with organisations such as Fifa, the international governing body for football, its European equivalent Uefa, and the International Olympic Committee, to settle disputes. Former Sheffield United striker Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to have been too drunk to have given her consent to sex. Last week, The Mail on Sunday revealed how the victim has been forced to move five times after being identified by internet trolls. The Ministry of Justice stepped in yesterday to prevent Evans, pictured with Natasha Massey, resuming his career overseas . In his article Hanging Ched – Double Jeopardy In The Court Of Public Opinion – published on the PFAI website, Mr Gilhooly wrote: ‘If having sex with a drunk woman is rape, then thousands of men are guilty of rape every day... degrees of intoxication are a very difficult concept for young men to grapple with when they themselves have had plenty to drink.’ In the same article, Mr Gilhooly attacked those protesting over Evans’s attempts to resume his career. Our report last week about Evans's victim . Many soccer fans reacted angrily to Mr Gilhooly’s appointment. Johnny Keegan, of Dublin, tweeted: ‘Is this the same PFAI solicitor who tried to convince us that convicted rapist Ched Evans is innocent?’ Paul Hartnett, of Cork, Ireland, wrote: ‘Baffled.’ Mr Gilhooly said yesterday: ‘My appointment to CAS has nothing to do with the article.’ PFAI general secretary Stephen McGuinness said: ‘Stuart Gilhooly’s article on Ched Evans was taken down from our website 14 hours after it was posted because the opinions expressed were Mr Gilhooly’s and not those of the PFAI.’ The Ministry of Justice stepped in yesterday to prevent Evans resuming his career overseas. Maltese side Hibernians had offered him a deal, but the MoJ said that as a convicted sex offender on licence, Evans was barred from working abroad.","Solicitor Stuart Gilhooly wrote in defence of Ched Evans after his conviction .

"Not even a shooting could quench the desire for a new pair of basketballer LeBron James trainers. Atlanta Police are not charging the shopper who shot in 'self-defense' an armed man who attempted to rob customers queuing for sneakers at the front of Wish Clothing in Little Five Points about 5.30am yesterday. After the shooter got back in line and the would-be-thief's body removed, customers continued waiting for the coveted denim shoe. Dozens of people were queuing at the front of Wish Clothing in Atlanta for sneakers when the shooting occurred yesterday .

Witnesses said a man queuing in front of the Moreland Avenue store then pulled out a gun and shot the would-be robber, before getting back in line. His identity has not been released. The suspect then ran a few yards before collapsing. Atlanta Police Department spokesman, Officer John Chafee, said police have not charged anyone and currently consider the shooting to be self-defense.

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans will not be able to resume his football career overseas, following a Ministry of Justice intervention. Maltese Premier League club Hibernians announced yesterday they had offered the 26-year-old former Sheffield United and Wales striker a six-month deal. But in a statement, the Ministry of Justice said that as a convicted sex offender on licence, Evans was effectively barred from working abroad. Scroll down for video . Convicted rapist Ched Evans was spotted buying fish and chips in Cheshire today . The MoJ said that as a convicted sex offender on licence, Evans was effectively barred from working abroad . A spokesman said: 'We are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders, to stop them re-offending and to protect victims. 'Probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings - this effectively rules out working abroad. 'The offenders will also be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones, non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes.' Evans has been without a club since he was jailed for rape in 2012. Earlier, Malta's prime minister Joseph Muscat had warned Hibernians their decision to offer a contract to Evans risked damaging the country's reputation. A tweet on the verified Twitter account of Muscat's office read: 'Footballers are role models. Hibs decision will define them + to an extent Malta. I hope (management) understand this clearly before final decision.' But justice minister Owen Bonnici said the convicted rapist deserved the chance to resume his football career. He tweeted: 'Ched Evans should be given a second chance. If we believe in rehabilitation of ex-prisoners we should practice what we preach.' Malta prime minister Joseph Muscat warned Hibernians about signing convicted rapist Evans . Convicted rapist Ched Evans had been offered an unexpected route back into football by Maltese team Hibernians . Evans had an offer to train with his former club Sheffield United but that was retracted in November after a public outcry. Television presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron, Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane and two shirt sponsors threatened to walk. Tranmere Rovers, Oldham Athletic and Hartlepool United have all also rejected the opportunity to sign the Wales international after showing a degree of interest. Evans, pictured alongside girlfriend Natasha Massey, has been without a club since he was jailed for rape in 2012 . Yesterday, Hibernians vice-president Stephen Vaughan said: 'We are looking to secure the services of a top striker and Ched fits the bill. 'We've spoken to his agent and have offered a deal from now until the end of the season.' Hibernians technical director Jeffrey Farrugia told Sky Sports News he believed a deal is close. 'I think we are quite close,' he said. 'We are waiting for his agent to call.' He added: 'Our vice-president has offered the contract until the end of the season to this glorious player to come over to Malta and play for our top team. We are leading the table at the moment.' Asked if he had spoken to Evans, Mr Farrugia said: 'Me personally, no, but Mr Stephen (Vaughan) yes, he met him in the UK. They sat down with his agent so they can speak about a contract.' The Maltese club said they had 'no problem' signing Evans and that the Wales international deserved a second chance . He went on to say there would be no outcry in Malta if the club were to sign the convicted rapist. 'We have no problem with that,' Mr Farrugia said yesterday. 'He was punished and he did his sentence so he should have a second chance, and our club is ready, the door is open for him to start his new career again in professional football. 'I don't think it's a wrong message. Everybody in life has mistakes, so you should have your second chance.' He added of the possibility of protests against Evans at Hibernians' stadium: 'There won't be anything of this at our club. And I can't understand sometimes how English football, English clubs, think about all these things. Everybody must have a second chance. He paid for what he did, for us it's not an issue.' Mr Farrugia added: 'For a player like him it's good to come to Malta to play these 26 games. He will be in the window for end of season, many clubs I'm sure they will go for him, so it's good for him to come here and enjoy the game of football. '(He's) a big asset for our club, (to have) the big quality of this player join our club. We need players like him in Malta.' Evans wants to return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011.","Ched Evans will not be able to resume football career overseas, MoJ say .

"A dashboard camera in a state trooper's car has captured the dramatic moment a father taking his children on a road trip pulled out a gun and shot an officer who then returned fire and killed him. John Van Allen, 34, was driving with three of his children when he was pulled over on Interstate 84 east of Portland, Oregon by Trooper Matt Zistel, 26, for speeding. But what was supposed to be a routine traffic stop soon escalated into violence when Van Allen emerged from the car and, despite Zistel urging him to get back inside, pulled out a gun. The dramatic footage was released to The Oregonian after a public information request from the paper following the August 29 death. Scroll down for video . Pulled over: A trooper's car dashboard camera shows John Van Allen, 34, climbing out of his car after being pulled over for speeding in August. He keeps his hand behind his back as the trooper orders him inside . Dramatic: But he ignores the trooper and suddenly pulls out a gun and walks towards him, shooting . 'Please sit back in the car for me, you . were speeding,' Zistel can be heard telling Van Allen. 'Sir, get back in the car for me now. Sir, please get back . in the car for me. You were speeding.' But Van Allen moves quickly towards Zistel before shooting at him several times. He then moves around the police car's hood, still firing. After several seconds, he heads back to his car, a black Cadillac, and drives off as Zistel desperately calls for help. 'Shots fired, I've been hit in the side, I'm okay,' Zistel says. 'Suspect left.' Even though Van Allen was hit in the chest in the exchange of fire, he does not appear to be injured as he returns to his car. Relentless: He walks to the other side of the car, still shooting at the officer who is returning fire . Retreat: Van Allen eventually skulks off after hitting the trooper, Matt Zistel, once in the side . Running away: Even though he appears uninjured, he actually sustained a gunshot wound to the chest and responding officers found his car half a mile away with his body inside . Responding officers found Zistel suffering a non-life-threatening gunshot wound and came across Allen's car on the shoulder of the freeway half a mile away. He was dead inside, with a gunshot wound to the chest. Three of his five children - a 10-year-old girl and two boys, aged 13 and 15 -  were also at the scene but they were not hurt. The three children were taken into the care of the Department of Human Services. Zistel was treated for his wound and released. He has been on paid leave and will continue to be until he is well enough to return to work. In a later investigation, Sherman County District Attorney Wade McLeod said that Zistel was justified in shooting Allen, The Oregonian reported. Killed: The DA determined that Zistel was justified in shooting Van Allen, pictured, a former Army Reserve . Altercation: Trooper Matt Zistel, left, is recovering from his gunshot wound. Family members of Van Allen, right, still maintain that the shooting was out of character for the father-of-five from South Carolina . Relatives said Allen, a father of five and an Army Reserve veteran who worked as a construction engineer between 2009 and 2012, was returning to his native South Carolina at the time of shooting. He was caught traveling at 76 mph in a construction zone before he was pulled over. His family said it was out of his character for him to pull a gun on an officer. 'He would have never shot at a police . official or anyone of the law,' his cousin, Will Wright III, said. 'He would not have missed . the kill shot either.'","John Van Allen, 34, was pulled over by trooper Matt Zistel for speeding in Oregon in August; he had three of his children in the car .

At around 1am on March 21, Rekia Boyd was shot in the head . by Det. Dante Servin as she stood with friends outside a property in Chicago’s . Lawndale neighbourhood. According to James Montgomery the family’s lawyer, Servin . pulled up to the group in an unmarked vehicle and told them to ‘shut up’. Gunned down: Rekia Boyd was shot and killed during an argument between a group she was standing with and a Chicago police detective . A verbal altercation then began between one of Boyd’s . friends and Servin which culminated in the Chicago policeman firing a volley of . shots at the group. As the friends scattered Boyd was hit in the head and . 39-year-old Antonio Cross was struck in the hand. Almost 24 hours after the shooting, Boyd died in Chicago’s Mt. Sinai Hospital while Servin escaped arrest by claiming that Antonio Cross had . approached him with a gun and that he fired in self-defence. '(He) rolls the window down and says, ‘Hey guys, keep the . noise down.’ At that point, one of the offenders comes at him as he’s sitting . in his car,' said Chicago Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden . Tragic: The Chicago Police have admitted that Rekia was an innocent by-stander . 'The offender has a weapon in his hand. The officer announced he’s . police – ‘Drop the gun! Police!’ 'The offender continues to advance on him, at that point, . the officer fires, in fear of his life.' While Chicago Police maintain that Cross was armed and that . the shooting was justified, distraught members of Boyd's family told NBC Chicago that he . was carrying a cell-phone. Gathering evidence: Boyd was with a group of friends around 1 a.m. near 15th Place and Albany Avenue when off-duty Chicago Police Det. Dante Servin pulled up in an unmarked vehicle . Furthermore, Cross has been charged by police with misdemeanor . aggravated assault and to date no weapon has been recovered from the scene. ‘Rekia Boyd was shot . and killed on March 21, 2012, without any legal justification,’ Montgomery said . during a press conference on Friday 6 April to announce the legal action . brought by the family against the city and Servin. ‘Her young life was snuffed out by an aggressive, . intimidating police officer who provoked the confrontation and when met with a . verbal rejoinder took the life of an innocent young woman.’ Distraught: Martinez Sutton (left) and family attorney James Montgomery (right) speak at a press conference on Friday April 6 and announce legal action against the City of Chicago . ‘The police spokesperson publicly claimed that the officer . fired in defence of his life when a man approached his vehicle and pointed a . gun at him. ‘Incidentally, no gun was ever found.’ While Chicago Police have not denied that Boyd was an . innocent bystander, Servin, who lives on the same block as the shootings has . not commented. At the end of March a protest of 200 people took to the . streets of Chicago to raise awareness of Boyd’s death and the fact that . Servin has not been charged. Unsatisfied: Family attorney James Montgomery demands answers from the City of Chicago and Detective Servin . ‘This young beautiful . girl dead in the streets. Why?’ said Boyd's brother, Martinez Sutton in an interview with ABC. ‘All we want to know is what happened?’ While Sutton and Darian Boyd, another brother of the victim . have set up a website and petition to seek justice for their sister, several . witnesses have reported that they believe that Servin was drunk when the . shooting occurred. Speaking of an apparent history between Servin and the local . community in the Lawndale area, Darian Boyd, the victim’s oldest brother was . reported to have made comments to news outlets about the detective’s attitude. Killed: A picture from Facebook shows Rekia Boyd (right) with an unidentified friend . ‘He basically said, ‘What do I have to do to get some peace, . quiet and respect…shoot someone?’ With no party denying that a verbal altercation took place . between Antonio Cross and Detective Servin, the victim’s family are pushing the City of Chicago for answers.

Llana Rosenzweig said in a statement that they have identified several . witnesses and gathered evidence from the scene. Investigation: Chicago Police maintain that one of the group Boyd was with produced a firearm which is disputed by witnesses . According to local CBS News Servin is still working with the Chicago Police . Department while his actions are investigated. 'I couldn't believe it,' Martinez Sutton said during the Friday .

But he said he had looked at the surveillance footage and did not recognize the man caught on camera. The tragic discovery comes a day after Machus's mother addressed a bank of TV cameras to appeal to her daughter's abductor.

"There was agony for England's netball team as they lost by a single point to Australia after Caitlin Bassett made it 49-48 with just seconds left on the clock at the SECC.

Desperation: Sasha Corbin of England leaps for the ball in front of Sharni Layton of Australia . Australia fought back to trail by a point at half-time with the score at 27-26 in England's favour, but they doubled that lead by the end of the third period. In a nail-biting final quarter - which saw Australia adopt an increasingly robust approach - the lead changed hands a number of times, and it was left to Bassett to break English hearts with a dramatic late finish to seal Australia's win. England shooter Joanne Harten burst into tears at the final whistle, having missed a chance just seconds before Bassett won the game for Australia. Afterwards, Serena Guthrie told BBC Sport she believes Australia were 'over the top' with their physical play during their win.

"The anxiety had niggled away at me for a week. I knew what I had to do - I just didn't know if I had the courage to do it. Standing at the front door of my friend Sarah's idyllic cottage in the Gloucestershire countryside, I realised I couldn't put the moment off any longer. After I knocked, I could hear her singing in the hallway as she approached to open the door. Momentarily, I considered heading back down the garden path and leaving before she could see me. My heart was hammering with nerves. Dilemma: What would you do if you saw your friend's husband with another woman? Then the door was flung open and my friend, whom I had known for more than 20 years, was hugging me in greeting, eagerly accepting the bottle of red wine I proffered and ushering me inside for what she thought would be one of our regular girlie evenings. 'Is Tim around?' I asked, trying to sound casual. She told me he wasn't. Her husband of several years was 'working late'. 'He works such long hours,' she said. 'But I shouldn't complain; he wants to build an extension and we need the money. Still, at least we can have a proper catch-up without interruption.' I winced, for I had a very good reason to believe Tim was doing anything but working at that precise moment. I knew he was having an affair. This knowledge presented me with one of the most painful and destructive decisions I have ever had to make, and one that still leaves me confused. For as I have learned to my cost, there is never a correct way to tell your friend that her husband is being unfaithful. It's not good to talk: Sharing a secret didn't work out well for Sonia (posed by models) At a Christmas drinks party  and then at a barbecue at their house, I'd picked up the frisson between Tim and a neighbour. The flirtatious twiddling with her hair, the way she held his gaze a little too long, the touching of his sleeve and the way she laughed at his jokes just a little too enthusiastically (Tim, who is a quantity surveyor, is not that funny) set every alarm bell ringing. Yet Sarah was oblivious. She described the woman, a divorcee, as a friend with whom she and Tim shared evenings out. Of course, I didn't say anything about my suspicions. Then one evening I'd been to the village pub with a colleague when I spotted Tim kissing this woman in his car. He didn't see me, and so I scurried away to worry about what to do next. I tried to imagine what I'd want if the circumstances were reversed. Though in a relationship now, I was single for many years after splitting with the father of my 16-year-old daughter when she was a baby. Trust and honesty are extremely important to me and I'd like to think my friends wouldn't stand by and let me be duped and ridiculed if I ever found myself with someone unfaithful. Yet the other side of the argument was equally persuasive: it was their business, their marriage. Why should I interfere? What swayed me was imagining how I'd feel if I found out Sarah had withheld information from me. I would not consider her a true friend. I decided I had no choice: I had to tell her the truth. 'I need to tell you something,' I said, my voice cracking. 'I don't know how to say this...' 'Say it,' she demanded. 'I think Tim has cheated.' She let out a yelp like a wounded animal before bursting into tears. I hated being the messenger of her misery and kept saying: 'I wish it wasn't me who had to tell you.' We talked for hours and she drained every last detail out of me: where the car was parked, the time of evening, what she was wearing, what he was wearing. Sarah called me the next day. She had confronted Tim when he arrived home at midnight and he had admitted everything. Apparently, it had started as a drunken flirtation, but 'got out of hand' and they had been having an affair for a few months. He blamed work stress and said it was 'only sex'. He said he still loved Sarah and they agreed to work on their marriage. I respected her decision, even though I struggled to understand it, and for the next few weeks my friendship with Sarah seemed to continue as normal. Coffee and cake dates are over: Being honest with her friend cost Sonia her friendship (posed by models) We met several times and talked on the phone as well as exchanging emails and texts. Then one morning, a month after I had told her about Tim, I received an email from her. It said simply: 'I'm sorry, Sonia, but we can't be friends any more. Tim and I are making a go of our marriage. It isn't easy obviously and, unfortunately, having you around is a permanent reminder of what happened.' She was dumping me. I was shocked and very hurt. What would cause her to do this? Was she angry that I had been honest with her? Had I committed an enormous social faux pas by reporting on Tim? Baffled, I spoke to various friends - without revealing Sarah's name, - and discovered this extreme reaction is common. Apparently, if you inform someone their partner is having an affair, you can become the scapegoat: all the pain, resentment and heartbreak gets transferred onto you. I didn't want to lose my friend, so I rang her. Despite my pleas that I had her best interests at heart, she was adamant. 'If you hadn't told me it would have fizzled out and I would have been none the wiser. As it is, you have created massive problems in our marriage by interfering. Please don't contact me again.' I was left confused and hurt. I struggled to understand how she had 'kept' Tim, her betrayer, while chucking me. Counsellors say this is a survival technique when people are trying to save their marriage. If you're in a happy marriage with most of your needs met and your partner cheated, would you want to know the details? Many don't want to know. For people like Sarah, it feels simpler and easier to live in the lie of infidelity. Normal, blinkered life can then resume. It's been a year since Sarah ended our friendship. I moved to London and have heard nothing more from her. We didn't exchange birthday and Christmas cards. Mutual acquaintances tell me she and Tim are still married and that life continues normally - ostensibly at least. I expect in time Sarah will want to renew her friendship with me, either after Tim strays again or when she sees him for the weak-willed, untrustworthy snake he is. And I will forgive her - of course, I will. However, this whole experience has convinced me that I will think very, very hard about revealing an affair should such a situation arise again. I tried to do the right thing but, for my dear friend, it was the wrong thing. When it comes to affairs of the heart, honesty might not always be the best policy. Some names have been changed.","Sonia caught her friend's husband with another woman .

"When Angeline O'Grady's husband Brian James O'Grady died in October 2011 from cancer, she planned to take his remains back to their hometown of Hull, England to rest. The Trumbauersville, Pennsylvania resident boarded a US Airways flight back to England with her husband's ashes safe in her checked baggage. But when she got off the flight and opened the bag, they weren't there. Luggage lawsuit: Angeline O'Grady, left, is suing US Airways after her husband, right, Brian James O'Grady's ashes went missing from her checked baggage on a flight to return his remains to their hometown in 2011 . Now she's suing the company for losing his remains. The lost urn was just the culmination of a terrible day at the airport. Initially, . Mrs O'Grady planned to take the urn on board with her, but was stopped . by TSA agents who told her she wasn't allowed to bring the cardboard box . containing his urn through security because 'it's contents were not a . solid substance'. So she went back to the airline's front desk and put the box in her checked luggage. Airport security: Mrs O'Grady wasn't allowed to take her husband's ashes through security, so put them in her checked baggage instead . Because of that delay she nearly missed her flight as well. By the time she got to the gate, she was too late and the airline had already given up her seat. Mrs O'Grady had to buy a $500 first-class ticket just to stay on the same flight. But the real shocker happened after she arrived at her sister-in-law's house in Hull. She opened the bag she checked, and the box of ashes was gone. Since reporting the disappearance, she says the company hasn't been helpful in trying to recover it. 'My kids, everybody's upset and US Air just blows us off,' she told WCAU in January 2012. She filed a lawsuit yesterday in Common Pleas Court. Where did it go? When she arrived at her sister-in-law's house in Hull, England, Mrs O'Grady opened her luggage and the box of her husband's ashes was mysteriously missing . Ignored: Mrs O'Grady reported the lost urn to US Airways, but says they have been unhelpful in trying to locate it . 'US . Airways, rather than Mr and Mrs O'Grady, has had the last word in . determining Mr O'Grady's final resting place,'  the lawsuit reads. 'He . is not at peace.' Airline spokesman Andrew Christie issued a statement to the Philadelphia Daily News: . 'While we certainly send our condolences to Mrs O Grady, US Airways' investigation into this matter did not uncover any information . indicating that US Airways is responsible for this unfortunate incident. We, of course, will defend ourselves against this suit.' Goldman responded saying that he wants to know what kind of investigation they conducted. 'To merely say that our investigation did not reveal anything is inadequate and it's an insult,' he said. 'He was a great guy - he doesn't deserve this,' Mrs O'Grady said.","Brian James O'Grady died in October 2011 after suffering from cancer .

"France's entire Socialist government was dissolved yesterday as . President Francois Hollande desperately fought to assert authority in . the face of economic crisis. The upheaval comes as a key minister . launched a rebellion by claiming the president is leading France to . ‘catastrophe’ by seeking to make cuts ‘on German orders’. Left-wing . economy minister Arnaud Montebourg defied Mr Hollande’s authority by . publicly urging him to discard austerity and break with what he . described as deficit-cutting measures imposed on the eurozone by ‘the . most extreme orthodoxy of the German Right’. Scroll down for video . French President Francois Hollande (left) and French Prime Minister Manuel Valls shaking hands at the Elysee presidential palace in Paris after a weekly cabinet meeting. Hollande asked Valls to form a new government, which will be presented on Tuesday . Earlier this month . German president Angela Merkel had rejected calls from Mr Hollande to . soften eurozone deficit targets that France had failed to meet. As . his party was plunged into civil war, Mr Hollande yesterday called on . Manuel Valls, his prime minister, to form a new cabinet ‘consistent with . the direction he has set for the country’. The head of state’s approval . rating has plunged to 17 per cent – by far the lowest in the history of . modern France. It follows a disastrous two years in power, which . has seen the French economy stagnant for the past six months, and . unemployment is running at more than 10 per cent. Mr Valls’s . government has been in power for only five months. The value of the euro against the  US dollar slumped yesterday following the upheaval in  France. As Francois Hollande dissolved his government, the euro fell to 1.3185 against the dollar, its lowest level since September 2013. In London, the stock exchange was closed for the Bank Holiday. When it closed on Friday the pound was at 1.25 against the euro. France, dubbed the ‘sick man of Europe’, has seen its economy grind to a halt, registering two consecutive quarters of no growth. The value of the single currency has also been eroded by weak confidence that the eurozone economies can eke out growth. Figures last week showed there was zero growth for the 18-country bloc in the three months to the  end of June. Senior Bank of England official David Miles said Europe’s economy was ‘dead in the water’. The last one, under . Jean-Marc Ayrault, was dissolved in March after the disastrous . performance of the Socialist Party in local elections. Two ministers, Mr . Montebourg and education secretary Benoit Hamon, have publicly . criticised the direction in which Mr Hollande’s hapless administration . is heading. Mr Montebourg, 51, said forcibly slashing deficits was . ‘economic madness’. He also attacked Germany, saying it should not be . allowed to ‘push around’ his country. He told Le Monde newspaper: . ‘The priority must be the existing crisis and the dogmatic reduction of . deficits should come second.’ Mr Hamon was similarly scathing towards Mr Hollande, effectively saying he supported the rebellion launched by Mr Montebourg. Justice . minister Christiane Taubira meanwhile sent a message to the two rebels . saying ‘bravo’ for speaking out. Culture minister Aurelie Filippetti . also tweeted her greetings to the two ministers in a veiled show of . support – which forced her resignation before tomorrow’s reshuffle. Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy (right) and German chancellor Angela Merkel (left) walk the last part of the Way of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, northwestern Spain on Sunday as they talk about European Affairs. French economic minister Arnaud Montebourg attacked Germany for 'pushing France around' New start: Hollande's office said in a statement a new government would be formed by Valls (right) on Tuesday in line with the 'direction he (the president) has defined for our country' President Hollande has ignored two years of dissent from Mr Montebourg in the interests of holding together his divided party. But . Mr Valls is understood to have threatened to resign if Mr Hollande had . failed to act, accusing Mr Montebourg of crossing ‘a yellow line’ as he . announced the cabinet’s resignation. But the economy minister told a . news conference yesterday that he had to speak out to try to avert the . European Union’s ‘descent into hell’. He said: ‘I informed the prime . minister... that if he deemed my convictions counter to the direction of . the government he leads, then in that case I thought it necessary for . me to be let go.’ Both Mr Hollande and Mr Valls believe the key to . success is their so-called Responsibility Pact, which offers businesses . tax breaks in exchange for creating jobs. But the Left wing of the ruling Socialist Party is furious over this shift to centrist economic policies.The . crisis comes on the day Paris was meant to be focusing on the 70th . anniversary of its liberation from Nazi rule during the Second World . War. As his political fortunes plummeted, Mr Hollande cut a sorry . figure as he made an open air speech in pouring rain on the Ile de Sein, . off the coast of Brittany. Soaked, and with his glasses steamed up, . he read from a prepared script about France’s wartime history, without . once referring to his government’s dissolution . Why has Frances’ Socialist Prime Minister resigned along with his entire government? Senior cabinet members, including Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg, are in open revolt at the austerity drive imposed on France by Europe, and sanctioned by President Francois Hollande. They say it is has stifled economic growth, and caused unemployment to rocket to above 3.3 million. They also believe that economic woes are leading to the success of extremist parties, such as the National Front, who won 26% of the popular vote in European elections in May. What happens next? A new government will be formally appointed by Mr Valls, in consultation with Mr Hollande, on Tuesday. It is likely to be a ‘compromise’ government, aimed at uniting left-wingers with more centrist cabinet members, while allowing the Prime Minister and President to continue with their economic policies. What is wrong with France's economy? Critics argue that just over two years of Socialist administration has plunged it into chaos. Mr Hollande came to power as a tax-and-spend left winger who admitted to disliking the rich. A top rate of income tax of 75% was among measures which caused wealth creators to flee the country, along with wealthy celebrities. Mr Hollande has adopted a more moderate stance in recent months, but there has been zero economic growth this year, as unemployment rises along with the cost of living. Will a new government fix it? Commentators fear that a new Socialist government – one which will amount to the third this year alone – will simply lead to more failure. Mr Hollande is a notoriously indecisive leader who does everything possible to keep everybody happy, at the expense of getting anything positive done. Mr Montebourg is likely to lead further challenges to the authority of Mr Hollande and Mr Valls, along with numerous allies on the left of the Socialist Party. A party at war is unlikely to sort out France’s chronic economic problems. Does the French crisis affect other countries in Europe? Yes – France’s decline within the EU project is having huge repercussions across the Eurozone, not least of all on near-neighbours such as the UK. Global economies are all interlinked, with economic experts frequently warning that a ‘sick man’ France will pull all others down with it. This could mean disaster for the EU.","PM Manuel Valls offered up his Socialist government's resignation Monday .

"As Muslims from 160 countries descend on Mecca for the Hajj pilgrimage, understandably the holy city is abuzz with excitement. Scores of pilgrims gather inside the Grand Mosque  in anticipation of a religious journey that is considered one of the Muslim faith’s greatest acts of worship. Every adult Muslim is required to complete the Hajj pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime as long as they are physically and financially capable of making the expensive and difficult journey. Unity: Muslims from around 160 countries are descending on Mecca for Hajj . Central: Pilgrims will gather around the Kaaba - the most holy point of Islam . Believers: Last year over £1.3 million Muslims made the pilgrimage to Mecca . Pilgrims wear unstitched folds of white cloth as they make the trek to Mecca’s Grand Mosque, Islam’s most sacred mosque. And as these incredible photographs show, it's a chance for Muslims to come together as one, as well as take pride in their great act of worship. Pilgrims will gather around the Kaaba - a cuboid building in the middle of the Great Mosque which is also known as the Sacred House.

"Harry Redknapp has told Shaun Wright Phillips to leave QPR and continue his career elsewhere – but says the midfielder is not prepared to take a pay-cut. Wright Phillips, who earns in the region of £60,000-per-week, has played just 78 minutes for QPR this season in the Capital One Cup and has not started a league game since September 2013. And the 33-year-old, who is out of contract in the summer, says it is ‘burning him up’ not knowing why he is not playing and claims when he went to see Redknapp to ask why, the discussion became heated and turned into a row. Shaun Wright-Phillips hasn't featured for QPR since the defeat by Burton in August . Wright-Phillips said he went to speak to manager Harry Redknapp about his absence from the team . But Redknapp said: ‘Shaun knows I have asked him to go on loan. But he is not going to go when he has a great deal here. ‘I can’t understand why someone does not want to play. We all get upset with people’s attitudes, but he is not going to move. ‘It’s not the player’s fault. It is the person who gave him the contract, it’s their fault’ Blackburn, Bolton and Charlton have all shown interest in signing the player that Chelsea paid Manchester City £21million for in 2005 – only for the player to turn them all down. Redknapp also confirmed QPR would let Wright Phillips leave permanently on a free transfer – but says there has been no interest from anyone in the Premier League and Championship clubs would not be able to match his current wages. Redknapp added: ‘It is very difficult when you earn that much money to go and play anywhere else. ‘When you are earning x amount of pounds and somebody wants to pay you a fraction of that, you are not going to move. ‘Now shifting him when he is not in your plans is difficult.’ Redknapp said Wright-Phillips (left) did not want to leave QPR because of his 'fantastic' contract . Redknapp admits the midfielder (left) trains hard and doesn't blame him for staying at the club . The 67-year-old boss claims to have a great relationship with the club's hierarchy . Wright Phillips is highly unlikely to feature for QPR in today’s game with Manchester United at Loftus Road. And despite pressure mounting on Redknapp with his side in the bottom three, he does not feel the extra burden. He added: ‘Pressure is all self-inflicted. It’s the pride of wanting to do well, that’s what keeps us all going. None of us want to do badly, we all want to win. ‘I love my chairman Tony Fernandes, but if he says to me ‘Harry, we are going to go down a different route’ then fine, it’s his choice. What can I do? ‘You do your best. That’s all I can do.’ Redknapp is not worried about his QPR job ahead of the visit of Manchester United on Saturday .","Shaun Wright-Phillips has only played 78 minutes of football this season .

"Accused: Iran state TV identified the man as Amir Mirzaei Hekmati . An American accused by Iran of working for the CIA could face the death penalty, it was reported today. In a closed court hearing, the prosecution asked for capital punishment for suspect Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, said the semi-official Fars news agency. Hekmati is alleged to have 'admitted' receiving training in America and planned to imply that Iran was 'involved in terrorist activities in foreign countries' after returning home. The prosecutor said 28-year-old Arizona-born Hekmati entered Iran's intelligence department three times. Hekmati  repeated a confession broadcast on state television on December 18, according to the Fars report. Under Iranian law spying is punishable by death only in military cases . His lawyer - identified just by the surname, Samadi - denied the charges. He said Iranian intelligence blocked Hekmati from infiltrating and in Iran, intention to do so is not a crime. The lawyer claimed Hekmati was deceived by the CIA. No date for the next court hearing was given. Spy allegations: Iranian TV claims that Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, 28, sought to infiltrate Iran's secret services . Identification: Hekmati was shown saying he entered the U.S. Army after finishing high school in 2001 and received military and intelligence training . Hekmati's family is of Iranian origin. His father, who lives in Michigan, said his son is not a CIA spy and was visiting his grandmothers when he was arrested. Iran charges that as a U.S. Marine, he received special training and served at U.S. military bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before heading to the country for his alleged intelligence mission. But his father Ali Hekmati, a microbiology professor at Mott Community College in Flint, Michigan, said: 'He is not a spy. It's a whole bunch of lies on my good son.' He added: 'They have lied about any American ... captured in Iran for visiting or tourism, or for any other reason.' With U.S. forces: Iran's Intelligence Ministry said its agents identified Hekmati at Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan . Broadcast: Several photos of the man identified as Hekmati, some of them in military uniform, together with U.S. army officers were shown on state TV . The CIA declined to comment, as did State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Iran and the U.S. are locked in a complicated intelligence and technological battle, and the video of Amir Hekmati comes weeks after Iran first displayed a nearly intact American spy drone that it claims it captured and forced down electronically. U.S. officials say the unmanned aircraft malfunctioned and has demanded Iran return the top-secret aircraft, but Iran has refused. Ali Hekmati said his son was a former Arabic translator in the U.S. Marines who entered Iran about four months ago. Captured:  The video of Amir Hekmati comes weeks after Iran first displayed a nearly intact American spy drone that it claims it captured after forcing it down . At the time, he was working in Qatar as a contractor for a company 'that served the Marines,' his father said, without providing more specific details. Ali Hekmati said of the visit to Iran: 'My wife tried to talk him out of it. The first two weeks went without incident. The third week in Tehran, some people visited him and took him away. Nobody heard from him in the next three months.' He later saw on a YouTube broadcast of an Iranian program that said Amir was 'locked up' and accused of 'being a spy for the CIA.' In the video broadcast on several Iranian TV channels, Hekmati was shown saying he entered the U.S. Army after finishing high school in 2001 and received military and intelligence training. 'Their [U.S. intelligence] plan was to initially burn some valuable information, to give it free so that [Iran's] Intelligence Ministry would see the good things and then would contact me,' said in a part of the confession that was broadcast. The voice of an unnamed announcer on the video said U.S. intelligence was certain that Iran's secret services would not ignore the data. Therefore, they provided a mix of correct and false information to mislead Iran's intelligence but tempt it at the same time. In September, Iran released two Americans held in a Tehran prison for more than two years after they were arrested. Iranian officials accused them of spying, but they say they were innocent and had got lost while hiking.",Arizona-born suspect 'confessed' to CIA training .

"A letter sent to President Obama is being tested for ricin after it contained the same chilling text as mail laced with the poison that was sent to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, it has emerged. The letter to the president was received on Thursday at a mail screening facility and did not reach the White House, law enforcement sources told NBC4. Authorities fear the letter could also contain ricin as it bears the same message sent to Bloomberg and his anti-gun group: 'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you.' CBS reported that the letter was postmarked from Shreveport, Louisiana, which was also the postmark for the two letters sent to Bloomberg. One of the letters sent to Bloomberg was retrieved at the City Hall, and the second arrived at the headquarters of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg . operates and personally finances. They contained threats warning him to stay away from the gun laws debate, authorities said. NBC reported that the text warned that anyone who goes to the sender’s house will 'get shot in the face'. Scroll down for video . Under threat? A threatening letter sent to President Barack Obama is being tested for ricin after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was sent two similar letters laced with the poison last week . Sources also previously told CBS News that the letter said, 'this . is a taste of what’s to come if you come to take my gun' - though the . exact wording was not disclosed. NYPD officials said . the threatening letters were opened on Friday in New York at the . city's mail facility and on Sunday in Washington at the headquarters of . the nonprofit. Three . members of the NYPD fell ill after being exposed to the letters, which . contained a 'pink, orange oily substance', authorities said. Their . symptoms have since subsided. 'The . writer, in letters, threatened Mayor Bloomberg, with references to the . debate on gun laws,' said Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the . New York Police Department. Speaking about the letters on Wednesday night, Mayor Bloomberg said that he did not feel threatened and that the mail would not scare him away from engaging in the debate over gun laws. Targeted: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured at the Real Estate Board of New York on May 30th, was sent two letters laced with the poison ricin. The attack left three members of the NYPD ill . Destination: The letter containing ricin addressed to New York City Mayor Bloomberg arrived here at 100 Gold Street - it was also where three members of the NYPD were exposed to the poison . 'There's 12,000 people that are going . to get killed this year with guns and 19,000 that are going to commit . suicide with guns, and we're not going to walk away from those efforts,' he said. 'And I know I . speak for all of the close to 1,000 mayors,' in Mayors Against Illegal . Guns, he said. 'This is a scourge on the country that we just have to . make sure that we get under control and eliminate.' It has not been made public yet why it took the FBI and the NYPD five days to announce the disturbing discovery. The matter is being investigated by . the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force which said that the letter sent to . Manhattan for billionaire Bloomberg arrived at 100 Gold Street - the . home of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Both . the New York and Washington D.C. notes were addressed to Bloomberg and . contained threats referencing the debate on gun laws. Ricin Plot: Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg attends a press conference for the CitiBike Program on Memorial Day . Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. The beans can be safely made in to castor oil, but ricin is a part of the waste 'mash' from the oil production. It can be made into a powder, a mist or a pellet and is poisonous if inhaled, injected, or ingested. Chewing the beans can also release the harmful substance. For ricin to poison people, it would have to be a deliberate act, according to the CDC. The only accidental injuries could come through ingesting castor beans. Ricin gets inside the cells of a person’s body and prevents the cells from making proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. It can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and circulatory symptoms and can lead to death 36 to 72 hours after exposure. In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella which had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin. The second letter to the mayor was . opened by Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, who has . not been reported to have fallen ill. Mr. Bloomberg never received either letter which was addressed to him . and no civilians have fallen ill due to either letter sent. However, . according to Browne, three members of the NYPD Emergency Service Unit . who came into contact with the open letter in Manhattan were exposed and . fell ill. They . experienced minor symptoms of ricin poisoning but are currently under . medical supervision and they are said to be responding well to . treatment. The NYPD confirmed preliminary testing indicated the presence of ricin. 'The FBI has an investigation ongoing and so things like the exact . wording and the postmarks, etc. we’re not going to disclose,' NYPD . deputy commissioner Paul Browne told WCBS 880. 'It was a pink-orange . oily substance that subsequently, in the preliminary tests, indicate the . presence of ricin.' Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. It's not clear if the letters were related to other threatening, ricin-laced letters sent to other lawmakers recently. Deadly: This stock picture shows a sample of deadly ricin - which kills through causing a lethal build up of fluid on the lungs . The letters allegedly originated from . Shreveport, Louisiana according to a statement from the American Postal . Workers Union Website. The first two letters were postmarked May 20. Authorities are now 'in the process of searching to determine if there may be additional letters,' according to the statement. The letter writer made references in his notes to the ongoing debate on gun laws. Mayor . Bloomberg is an outspoken critic of current gun laws and has campaigned . nationally and on Capitol Hill for stricter gun legislation - using his . own considerable wealth to fund commercials. The . confirmation of ricin present in both letters came through on Wednesday . from the National Bioforensic Analysis Center in Maryland. Disappeared: Everett Dutschke, the chief person of interest in the case of deadly ricin letters being sent to President Obama, was arrested on Saturday. He went missing earlier this week . Investigation: A hazmat official enters a taekwondo studio previously operated by James Everett Dutschke in Tupelo, Mississippi on Wednesday . Ricin symptoms depend on the amount . of exposure and dose received, but within a few hours lead to cough, . fever, nausea, tightness in the chest and heavy breathing. Death follows through fluid build up in the lungs. Several . ricin-laced letters have been sent to U.S. politicians over the past . few months - including one addressed to President Obama in mid-April. A . Mississippi man, James Everett Duschke stands accused of making the . poison ricin and sending those letters - which also went to Senator . Roger Wicker and a Mississippi judge. Initially, a friend of Dutschke's, Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested, but he claimed he had been framed after he was released.","New York City police say two anonymous letters sent to Mayor Michael Bloomberg contained traces of the deadly poison ricin .

There will also be a push to share more data on passengers, but this will run into difficulties in the European parliament on civil liberties grounds. The airline flight lists measure is among a number of emergency powers which will today be unveiled by David Cameron. It follows a warning by the king of Saudi Arabia that terror groups could attack in the West within a month. He said: ‘If neglected I’m sure they [terrorists] will reach Europe in a month and America in another month. The evils of terrorism must be fought with force, reason and speed.’ At the centrepiece of Mr Cameron’s plans will be a temporary ban on British citizens from coming home if they have travelled to fight alongside Islamist fanatics. David Cameron is to unveil new measures to stop extremists re-entering Britain after fighting abroad . This would stop short of stripping suspects of their British citizenship and making them stateless – a breach of international law – but at the same time prevent them from re-entering. Under existing laws, the Government has the power to block only foreign nationals, those with dual citizenship or naturalised citizens. Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg were last night thrashing out the final details ahead of a statement in the Commons this afternoon. They acted after intelligence chiefs raised the UK’s terror threat level to ‘severe’ – the second highest level – after warnings that a jihadi atrocity was ‘highly likely’. A temporary ban is likely to require major changes to air transport legislation. A Downing Street source said: ‘We need to make sure this is legally robust. It is a difficult thing to achieve, putting a temporary ban on people without making them stateless, but it is vital we achieve it.’ Ministers are also considering strengthening Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures – so-called Tpims – which replaced control orders. The Government is also expected to make it easier to seize the passports of potential terrorists to prevent them travelling to trouble-zones. So far, 23 potential jihadis have been barred from leaving. Under the plans, border guards would be allowed to revoke a fanatic’s passport. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said new measures were needed to deal with ‘gaps in our current armoury’ against terrorism. At least 500 people from the UK are thought to have gone to fight in Syria, but the number could be as high as 2,000. Security chiefs believe some 250 have already returned home and may have been brainwashed into launching strikes here. Up to 20 Britons are believed by Turkish authorities to be waiting in safe houses for instructions to cross into Syria. Intelligence and anti-terror specialists are also examining entry records of all Britons to Turkey, cross-checking those who have left, how long they stayed and those who have overstayed the 90-day visa period. Some are said to be using the passports of fellow fighters of similar age and appearance to avoid detection .","Airlines would be forced to handover more information about passengers .

"Former MI6 chief Richard Barrett (pictured) said Britain should do a deal with jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria to encourage them to 'come home' Britain should do a deal with jihadists fighting in Iraq and Syria to encourage them to ‘come home’, says a former MI6 chief. Richard Barrett, who was a counter-terrorism director at the secret intelligence service, said returning British extremists could be an ‘invaluable asset’. His call came as it emerged that five British men who signed up to fight with Islamic State (IS) have found life too tough and want to come home. The volunteers became disillusioned by the brutality of their leaders and the discomforts of living in a war zone. But they are now held in an IS punishment camp in Syria, where they are being tortured, according to intelligence sources. Mr Barrett said British Muslims disillusioned with taking up arms for terror groups could dissuade potential fanatics from becoming radicalised. It has been reported that as many as 30 British jihadists are looking at ways of returning, but fear being jailed in the UK. Mr Barrett said: ‘Many of the people who have been most successful in undermining the terrorist narrative are themselves ex-extremists.’ He said such people would be able to ‘explain why going abroad to fight is a bad idea’. ‘These are the people who can expose the true nature of IS and its leadership,’ he added. ‘Their stories of brutality and the motives behind it will be far more persuasive than the rhetoric of men  in suits.’ Researchers at London’s International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation have recently been contacted by British jihadists in Syria who say they would take part in de-radicalisation programmes but fear being jailed for terror crimes.

'He comes in, everyone says ""wow, it's Stuart Pearce, legend! Psycho"" and all of that and he has that instant respect. 'He gets teams going but after a while, players aren't stupid, they're not naive and they start to suss him out. He doesn't have the depth of football ability to back it up.

"Arsene Wenger has criticised Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic for his ‘unnecessary’ push on Mathieu Debuchy that has ruled the defender out for three months. Debuchy has undergone surgery on his dislocated shoulder following a collision with the Potters forward in the 3-0 win at the Emirates last Sunday.

Wenger said: 'He is destroyed because he is such a keen player, so professional, so willing. 'It is his first year here and of course he is embarrassed. But it is not his fault. He was pushed. The push was not needed. 'I watched it again and in that situation he was a bit unlucky as well because there is a little divot just after the touchline and maybe that made it worse.' Asked whether he felt action should be taken against Arnautovic, Wenger added: 'I don’t know. I just think that Arnautovic had no chance to get the ball. That’s what I mean. I don’t think it was malicious but it was not needed because he had no chance to get the ball. Debuchy will miss three months of the season following surgery on his shoulder . The 29-year-old was treated for six minutes before being substituted in the first half . 'I am not a specialist and these subjects are always very sensitive because I don’t really know what his intention was. It is difficult. It is not obvious. I don’t think he wanted to hurt him but it was not needed.' Wenger will also be without Mikel Arteta after the midfielder had surgery on his ankle. He added: 'Both had surgery. Debuchy for a shoulder problem that you saw last week against Stoke and Arteta for an ongoing problem with his ankle that provoked certain injuries in his calf.'

Federer celebrates his win in front of the Brisbane crowd on Sunday . The milestone gives Federer plenty of momentum heading into the Australian Open . But the Swiss was forced to earn his success on Sunday, with Raonic hitting back from a break down in the second set to force a decider before eventually being pipped in a titanic battle that lasted two hours and 13 minutes. Federer showed flashes of his brilliant best in the opening set, with 15 winners and just three unforced errors, as he set out to claim his eighth win in nine matches over his Canadian opponent. The top seed broke in the third game and was never threatened on serve to seize control of the final. It got no better for Raonic as he double faulted to drop serve at the beginning of the second set although the third seed discovered his touch and reeled off eight points in a row. The set went with serve to force a tie-break, where again Raonic went a run, losing the first two points before storming back to win the next seven and take Federer the distance.

"Sir Ben Ainslie and Georgie Thompson have spoken of their gratitude to Sir Richard Branson after he came to their aid after their boat suffered mechanical problems during their honeymoon. The newlyweds had been sailing close to Branson's Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, after tying the knot in December when their boat developed a problem with its sail furling system and they messaged for help. Members of the island's watersports team helped to cut the sail and prevent the stricken vessel being wrecked on a reef, and Branson duly invited them to stay on the island for a few days. Necker Island staff members (from left) Marco Bava, George Lambert, Adam Chubbock pose with Georgie Thompson and Sir Ben Ainslie after they helped rescue them following a technical fault on their yacht . The furling system on the yacht broke, meaning ithe sail couldn't be hoisted or lowered . 'Unfortunately we had a mechanical failure with the mast furling system which, for just the two of us, was a bit much to try to fix on our own,' four-time Olympic champion Ainslie told Sky Sports News. 'We were very lucky that we were right next to Necker Island and some of the guys from the sailing centre, I have to say, were absolutely amazing and between the four of us we managed to sort out the situation. 'Then Richard very kindly phoned up and invited us over for dinner.' The newlyweds didn't let their sailing disaster dampen their honeymoon and joined Sir Richard for a few days on Necker Island . Sir Richard tweeted about the incident and wrote a post on his blog saying he had never expected to rescue an Olympic sailor from a boat . Thompson, pleased to put the ordeal behind her and spend some time onshore, gladly accepted Branson's offer. 'Dinner became a two-day stay which was lovely because right at the end of our honeymoon, having been on a boat for three weeks, I think that was very welcome that we were able to have a couple of days in luxury without any mechanical failures happening onboard,' the TV sports presenter said. Branson and Ainslie have had troubles at sea together when they had to abandon an attempt to set an Atlantic crossing record in 2008 when powerful winds and high waves damaged their boat. Ainslie, the most decorated Olympic sailor in history, has won medals at each of the last five Olympics and in 2013 helped Oracle Team USA overturn an 8-1 deficit to win the America's Cup.

It came four days after Holloway’s side had sunk further into relegation danger at the foot of the Championship after losing to his old club Blackpool. ‘I said when I first took the job that it was going to be tough, but I didn’t expect it to be this tough,’ he admitted. ‘I’ve never seen a team capitulate as badly as that. I’m absolutely fuming because as a player I never gave a performance like that. ‘They didn’t look like a Millwall team or my team. They didn’t have any fight in them and that’s what we’ve just been talking about in there. ‘That was embarrassing. I didn’t know what they doing or where they were going. I don’t blame the fans after that. All I can do is apologise to them.’ The speculation over Holloway’s future came at the end of an eventful third-round replay that saw Mark Beevers sent off in the sixth minute, seven players booked and Bradford manager Phil Parkinson and his assistant Steve Parkin both sent to the stands by referee James Adcock following a brawl in the first half. It erupted when Bradford striker James Hanson chased a ball to the touchline and was sent crashing into the advertising hoardings by a push from Alan Dunne.

Coaching staff intervened as both sets of players became embroiled in a nasty brawl in the first-half . Both sets of players and members of the coaching staff became embroiled in the melee, with Millwall goalkeeper David Forde particularly lucky to avoid being sent off after he appeared to aim punches at Jon Stead and Billy Knott. Parkinson said: ‘I thought it was a dangerous challenge because there’s a wall just behind the advertising boards. ‘Me and Steve reacted. I was trying to make sure there was no brawl but it certainly wasn’t to instigate anything. The ref said it was for leaving the technical area. ‘You can get a yellow card for trying to injure an opposing player but me and Steve got sent to the stands, which is a bit harsh. I apologised to the boys at half-time because I asked them to keep their cool and stay on the pitch, and in the heat of the moment I reacted to a dangerous challenge. ‘We’ll have to take that on the chin and I’m glad it hasn’t ruined a great night.’ Bradford went three goals ahead before half-time after Beevers was shown a straight red card for dragging Hanson to the floor as he raced clear on to Rory McArdle’s through ball. They took the lead two minutes later when McArdle headed Andy Halliday’s cross to the far post where Hanson was lurking to score from close range, and doubled their lead when Andrew Davies headed down a free-kick from former Chelsea and Millwall winger Filipe Morais for Stead, who had far too much time and space to fire home from 10 yards. Halliday then turned in a cross from Morais six minutes before half-time and Knott added a fourth in the second half to book a trip to Stamford Bridge that will be worth an estimated £500,000. ‘There was a big prize at stake,’ said Parkinson. ‘It’s quite a considerable amount when you consider our overall budget.’ Bradford manager Phil Parkinson and his assistant Steve Parkin were send to the stands for their part .

"Six months have passed since Alexis Sanchez arrived at Arsenal for £35million and one nagging question remains: what do you think they were smoking over there at the Nou Camp? People are entitled to the occasional mistake — Wojciech Szczesny lost his place for taking a crafty puff on a cigarette, for example — but Barcelona’s is on another level. With every passing week, with every goal and every assist in the colours of Arsenal, the decision to sell the Chilean last summer becomes more absurd. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's big match stats: Arsenal 3-0 Stoke . Alexis Sanchez scored twice to help Arsenal to a 3-0 Premier League victory against Stoke on Sunday .

CLICK HERE to read more from our brilliant Match Zone service . Sanchez made the first and scored two himself here, drifting between brilliant and sublime in this rhythmic destruction of Stoke City. Arsenal were interrupted, at times, by Stoke’s agricultural approach and their willingness to look for a fight at every opportunity. What the visitors got in return was a football lesson. Sanchez operated at a different pace to those around him. In this kind of form he can play wherever he wants. He has now scored 12 goals and engineered another seven in the Barclays Premier League since he said his goodbyes to Lionel Messi and Neymar. Arsenal, gathering momentum now, used the cushion of a three-goal lead to bring Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil from the substitutes’ bench in the second half. They are still a little way off, but when Arsenal play on the front foot like this, a team full of conviction and purpose, Arsene Wenger can afford to wait a bit longer for them.

The 29-year-old was treated for six minutes before being substituted in the first half, suffering a suspected dislocate shoulder . Sanchez was mesmerising, waiting patiently for Laurent Koscielny to sprint back into the penalty area when the Arsenal defender had served him with the chance to set up the opener. Sanchez paused, checking his movement until he could find Koscielny and then looked on with a good deal of satisfaction as the Frenchman directed his header beyond Asmir Begovic. He scored a beauty in the 33rd minute, collecting Tomas Rosicky’s pass on the edge of the area and gliding past the outstretched legs in Stoke’s defence. The finish was top-quality, deceiving Begovic and the rest of the Stoke defence by giving it the eyes before opting to drill his effort inside the keeper’s near post. He deserved full marks for improvisation. This was a decent response by Arsenal, putting the midweek trauma of Szczesny’s censure behind them with a performance full of conviction. David Ospina is first choice between the sticks for the time being — and he kept his second successive clean sheet. The reality is he only had two saves to make here. Arsenal controlled this game, adding a third when Sanchez’s 49th-minute free-kick somehow made it through the wall and into the back of Begovic’s net. There was also another side to this game, a knock-on effect of Arsenal’s 3-2 defeat at the Britannia Stadium on December 6. Some scores were settled. Mathieu Debuchy will be out for a good few weeks, nursing a dislocated shoulder after Marko Arnautovic shoved him into the advertising hoardings. ‘I didn’t see it,’ claimed Stoke manager Mark Hughes. Amazingly, Wenger said the same. ‘1-0 to the football team,’ chimed Arsenal supporters as Debuchy was carried off for an X-ray — and it was hard to disagree. Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross and Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud squabbled repeatedly, childishly holding each other’s shirts throughout. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) of Arsenal races away from Glenn Whelan and Philipp Wollscheid . Sanchez curls the ball around the legs of Ryan Shawcross to score his first of the afternoon and put Arsenal into a 2-0 . The former Barcelona man continued his run of brilliant form with an assist and a goal during the first 45 minutes . Peter Crouch also escaped when referee Jon Moss failed to spot the Stoke forward elbow Nacho Monreal in the side of the head when they collided mid-air. Had Sanchez not put this game well beyond Stoke, it certainly had the potential to spill over. Instead, Arsenal cruised in the second half. The 3-0 lead gave Wenger the opportunity to field Walcott, sending him on to replace Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with just over 20 minutes left. He should have scored when Sanchez put him through, racing away from Philipp Wollscheid and Erik Pieters before skewing his effort wide of Begovic’s far post. Sanchez has now scored 12 Premier League goals following his double on Sunday afternoon . Ozil dusted off the cobwebs as well, making his first appearance in the team since rupturing knee ligaments in the defeat at Chelsea in October. A dissatisfied Giroud made way and it seemed to make sense when he went and sat out the final 18 minutes of this victory alongside the brooding figure of Szczesny. It will take some time for Ozil to get up to full speed again and Wenger admitted it could be two or three weeks before the World Cup winner is ready to start. This appearance was a taster, a reminder of the good life at Arsenal after such a long period spent on the sidelines. By the time the Germany international was on for Giroud, the damage had been done because Sanchez had put this game way beyond the limited ambitions of this Stoke side. The man who cost a packet when he moved from Barca continues to leave everybody short of breath. Crystal Palace want to sign Yaya Sanogo on loan this week, despite the Frenchman missing a medical on Friday. The Arsenal striker was booked for the procedure at the end of last week but didn’t show up, leaving the move in jeopardy. However, Palace are still hopeful of getting the deal over the line this week, with boss Alan Pardew keen to bolster his strikeforce. Arsenal will ramp up their interest in Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko this week. Sissoko is a £16million target for the Gunners and said yesterday: ‘If (Arsene) Wenger calls, I’ll have a man-to-man discussion with him and then we’ll see. Arsenal has always been the club of my heart.’ Travel chaos meant Stoke fans had a nightmare journey home. A problem between Rugby and Milton Keynes affected trains from Euston station in London. Their defeated team, who have never won at the Emirates in any competition in seven attempts, travelled home by coach. Stat of the day - Arsenal have won their last 13 home games against Stoke .

"West Ham United have been rocked by news their main shirt sponsor Alpari has entered into insolvency. The foreign exchange broker is one of the largest casualties of Thursday's frantic trading of the Swiss franc. The news raises fears over the continuing validity of the deals between the east London club and the City firm, while the Hammers insist they already in 'advanced discussions with potential new shirt sponsors for next year'. West Ham's main shirt sponsor Alpari, a foreign exchange broker, has gone into insolvency . Alpari have been West Ham's main shirt sponsor since February 2013 when they signed a deal worth £3million . A club statement read:'West Ham United has enjoyed a good working relationship with Alpari (UK) Limited since 2011 and is therefore saddened by today's news that it has entered into insolvency. The Club would like to offer its sympathies to any Alpari staff affected by the announcement, particularly those that have worked closely with us over the past few years. 'The Board would like to reassure supporters that Alpari (UK) Limited's situation will have no impact on West Ham United. The Club remains in a strong financial position and just last month published accounts showing record revenues and a group profit of £10.3m before tax. 'The Club has received huge interest and is already in advanced discussions with potential new shirt sponsors for next year.' Alpari became the Hammers' shirt sponsor in a deal worth £3m a year in February 2013 – which was later renewed for a further three years. The company also signed a three-year deal to sponsor the West Stand at the 35,016-capacity stadium in Upton Park, and the club are in discussions to rename it. The Alpari stand (left) at Upton Park could be renamed - the club are in discussions over next year's sponsors . A statement on the company's website said: 'The recent move on the Swiss franc caused by the Swiss National Bank's unexpected policy reversal of capping the Swiss franc against the euro has resulted in exceptional volatility and extreme lack of liquidity. 'This has resulted in the majority of clients sustaining losses which has exceeded their account equity. Where a client cannot cover this loss, it is passed on to us. 'This has forced Alpari (UK) Limited to confirm that it has entered into insolvency. Retail client funds continue to be segregated in accordance with FCA rules.' The Hammers were delighted when the deal was first announced, vice chairman Karren Brady told the club's official website: 'We are enthused and excited to enter into this new partnership with Alpari. 'This landmark deal, along with a host of other significant strides forward our business has made recently, is yet further evidence of the growth we have witnessed and I can only see things getting better.' At least two brokerage firms say they have gone bust after suffering losses on the Swiss franc's massive surge this week, one of the most acute moves seen by a major trading currency in decades. Alpari had also signed a three-year deal to sponsor West Ham's West Stand at Upton Park .

"Dylan Hartley returns from suspension against the Ospreys in the European Cup on Sunday after spending three weeks painting Northampton’s changing rooms. The hooker’s latest ban, his fifth, was imposed for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith and he kept busy during his lay-off by painting Saints’ changing room in club colours. ‘Maybe he thought he could add something to the psychological value of the room,’ said team-mate Phil Dowson. ‘But it was awful and it’s been re-done.’ Dylan Hartley is ready to return to action against Ospreys on Sunday after his latest ban . Hartley, 28, now hopes to show he has learned his lesson and put in a couple of solid performances before England’s Six Nations opener against Wales on February 6. Dowson added: 'Dylan understands he has made a mistake and he wants to get back on the horse. 'It is a great opportunity for him to show his maturity and his experience.

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has challenged Wilfried Zaha to show why Manchester United paid £15 million for the winger when the Eagles travel to Burnley. Pardew has vowed to raise Zaha's 'profile and spirit' with the 21-year-old on a season-long loan back at first senior club Palace. Substitute Zaha teed up Jason Puncheon's winner in Palace's 2-1 Premier League victory over Tottenham last weekend, as part of an influential cameo. Wilfried Zaha is back on loan at first club Crystal Palace after failing to impress at Manchester United . Zaha tussles for possession with Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker during the Eagles' 2-1 at Selhurst Park . New Palace boss Pardew admitted it must be tough going for Zaha to be back for a second loan stint at Selhurst Park since joining United in January 2013. 'I intend to have a word with him,' said Pardew, ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Turf Moor. 'He's an important player. 'In terms of finding himself at perhaps the biggest club in the world bar one or two, and not getting an opportunity and having to come back to his former club - I think that's difficult. Zaha signed for Manchester United for £15m in 2012, but failed to hold down a regular starting place . 'Mentally I think that's difficult for a young player. 'So I feel sorry for him, a little bit. 'And I'll do my best to raise his profile and spirit for us, and for Manchester United because I'm sure they've got one eye on him hopefully still to be a success for them.' Pardew has guided Crystal Palace to two successive victories since taking over at Selhurst Park this month . Pardew has vowed to hand the entire Palace squad a clean slate as he continues to make his mark after replacing Neil Warnock, who was sacked on December 27. Forwards Puncheon and Dwight Gayle looked to be heading for a January transfer window exit under Warnock, but both have already impressed since Pardew's arrival. The former Newcastle manager said he will not allow any outside opinions to influence his team selection. 'If you come in and do well you'll stay in the team,' he said. 'I really could not care less of the value you put at your name, or your stature with the chairman, or your following in the crowd. 'I pick a team I think will win at Burnley, and one that hopefully will beat Everton. 'And everyone gets an even chance. 'But if everyone does the job asked of them, if they are asked to defend or to create and hurt the opposition, and if they do what they've been asked, then they'll stay in the team. 'And all those players are on an even keel with me.' Palace forward Jason Puncheon celebrates after scoring the winner against Spurs last weekend . Palace and Burnley are both locked on 20 points after 21 Premier League games, with Pardew forced to admit the Eagles face a relegation six-pointer this weekend. 'I think it's a very important game for both clubs,' said Pardew. 'I don't like using those terms (six-pointer), but even so it's significant in terms of league position, especially if you manage to win. 'This is a different challenge from Spurs. Burnley are not Spurs and you need to have a team that can cope with that. 'So it's a different test and I'll find out more after Burnley about what we have in the squad.'

"Yes, they can do it on a cold night at Portman Road? Perhaps it wasn't an emphatic performance by Southampton - but that doesn't matter in the FA Cup. Following their heroics at Old Trafford on Sunday, Ronald Koeman's side had to raise themselves for the less glamorous surroundings of Ipswich or face being on the end of a shock defeat. Southampton striker Shane Long celebrates after scoring the winner with an instinctive finish on 19 minutes . Long fired in a first-time finish after the ball fell to him following James Ward Prowse's run into the box .

Ref: Graham Scott 6.5 . Att: 27,933 . The Dutchman's side answered all the questions levelled at them on Wednesday night, strolling past the Championship without getting out of second gear. However, Koeman has more unwanted questions to find answers to as the injury concerns pile-up for the Dutchman. Morgan Schneiderlin missed Wednesday night's clash with an adductor injury that is expected to keep him out for the next four weeks. And no sooner had the club confirmed the Frenchman's absence, they were facing up to a central midfield crisis after Victor Wanyama limped off on the stroke of half-time's with a hamstring injury. With key defender Toby Alderweireld also due to miss the next four weeks with a hamstring strain, the injury problems are piling up for Koeman. 'The injuries are a big negative because we already have injuries. I spoke with Victor and [Steven] Davis and we said they would play 45 minutes each - if only Victor could hold on for 12 more seconds. 'Victor is a hamstring, so he will be out for four or five weeks. 'The problem we have is in our numbers. We have good youngsters but we don't want to put too much on them. 'We can handle it at the moment, but one or two more injuries we might have to look at it. I'll talk to the club.'

On his side's display, Koeman added: 'I'm proud of them, it was a serious performance from us, it was difficult and a typical English cup game.' Southampton, though, were handed an almighty fright inside the opening five minutes, Noel Hunt racing clear of the Saints backline to slide the ball under Fraser Forster, only for the effort to ruled offside. But that was the highlight for the home side as Southampton cruised to victory after Shane Long finished off a good move involving Nathaniel Clyne, Dusan Tadic and James Ward-Prowse in the 19th minute.

Saints captain Jose Fonte (3rd left) embraces Long as Ipswich defenders return to the centre circle with their heads dipped . The goal took the wind out of the Tractor Boys' sails. The intensity and exuberance of their early play vanished as the Premier League side asserted their authority with such ruthlessness. Ipswich rarely threatened Fraser Forster after Long's decisive striker as Southampton - led by the excellent Jose Fonte - nullified the home side's threat to set up a fourth round tie against Crystal Palace. One chance, one goal. That's what happens in the Premier League - and Ipswich found out to their detriment. A tame Darren Ambrose header was all Ipswich had to show for their second half performance, which was full of work-rate - but woefully short on quality. 'The game was a damp squib, we were okay until they scored and then they killed the game,' admitted Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy. 'We wanted it to be a rip roaring cup tie, but they didn't let it happen. They are a damn good side. There's no shame in losing to Southampton.'

Zaha has struggled to adapt to life at Manchester United after moving for £15m in January 2013 . From being one of the most sought after young players in Europe, Zaha has fallen off the radar. Sir Alex Ferguson's final-ever signing hasn't lived up to his billing. Of course - he still has time on his side. He arrived at Old Trafford in January 2013 as the premier young talent in British football. What United found, however, was a player who wasn't even ready to train with United's expensively-assembled squad on a daily basis. Those in and around Carrington during the first few months of his United career would speak of Zaha's struggles with the intensity of training sessions. The fear with elite young players is that if they leave their nest too early in search of more glamourous surroundings, their development can be affected. That certainly seems the case with Zaha. Did he leave Crystal Palace too early? In hindsight, yes. Zaha in action for the England Under 21 side against Serbia in October 2013 . Having helped the Eagles to top-flight promotion under Ian Holloway, the benefits of playing regularly in the Premier League would have been invaluable. But by the time time Kevin Phillips' penalty booked Palace's return to the big-time, Zaha's move north was already completed. There was no turning back. Except that Zaha has been forced to go back. With no place in Louis van Gaal's plans at Manchester United, the winger has found himself back at Selhurst Park on loan until the end of the season. There were early signs of that old Zaha sparkle, scoring on his second debut for the club in a 3-3 draw at Newcastle. Zaha reacts to the crowds with a thumbs up as he is taunted during Palace's FA Cup win at Dover Athletic . However, he hasn't netted since. Having worked so hard to bring him back to Selhurst Park, the man who first discovered Zaha, manager Neil Warnock, benched the forward for the final two matches of his reign. Zaha's end product, or rather a lack of, was a major concern for Warnock and his coaching team. Getting into good positions, the forward would often over-hit crosses, try one too many tricks or simply chose the wrong option. It's key to remember, of course, that those blistering Zaha performances that made him the talk of England's scouting network were in the Championship. Since stepping up to the biggest league of all, he has struggled to make an impact. The forward celebrates scoring his second goal during Palace's Championship play-off win at Brighton . But now, under new Palace manager Alan Pardew, there is renewed hope for Zaha. In Pardew, the 22-year-old knows he has a manager who believes in him, who wants to work with him. The manager tried to sign Zaha during his time at Newcastle United, recognising his talent as a potential match-winner. 'I really like him, I have always liked him, I enquired about him when I was Newcastle manager a couple of time and could not get him,' admitted Pardew following Saturday's win over Tottenham Hotspur. 'I wouldn’t say that he has been lost. When you go to Manchester United it is very, very difficult. Zaha came off the bench for Palace against Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend and is liked by Alan Pardew . 'He has come out on loan and perhaps it has not gone as well as he would have liked. You would expect that a little bit. He needs to get that confidence.' Having started Pardew's first game in charge - the comfortable 4-0 FA Cup third round win over Dover - Zaha was back on the bench against Tottenham. But in his 17-minute cameo, Zaha provided tangible evidence that the magic in his speedy feet remains. He was excellent, running at defenders with the pace, power and trickery that forced Ferguson to fork out £15million for him. Zaha leaves the field following a Championship match between Palace and Bolton Wanderers in 2013 . 'His performance against Spurs will do him no harm and we need to build on that cameo,' said Pardew. 'If he plays like that for 90 minutes he will get in every week. He has done himself no harm.' There was a time when Palace fans would chant: 'He's just too good for you'. Well, Wilf, it's time to prove it.","Wilfried Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson's last-ever Manchester United signing .

"A worried neighbour of two toddlers, allegedly murdered by their mother in an exorcism ritual, called police the night before they were killed to report a child had been left in a car for 45 minutes. One-year-old Norell Harris and his two-year-old sister, Zyana, were found dead in their beds at their home in Germantown, Maryland on Friday morning.

In . the first call, made on Thursday at around 10.15pm, the neighbour . is heard saying: 'I have a baby in the car that's been here for 45 . minutes.' He then tells the receptionist that two women were coming after him. He is then heard saying: 'Back up off me, ma'am. That is my business, a kid in the car for an hour that is my business.' The caller later claims that the woman was 'talking to herself'. Police . said they did respond to that first call, but when they arrived at the . address the women and the children were already inside, and they did not . persue the matter.

The . second 911 call was received at 9.23am on Friday. A different neighbour . reported hearing noises the previous night and then finding a knife . with blood on it inside a parked car. The . caller says: 'In the car outside there is a knife with blood. The car . has the door open, the house has windows open up there. 'I . heard loud noises in the night, I just woke up. I heard, like, jumping. I didn't know, they have 4 children, so I don't know if the kids are . just doing that every day.' 'So . I didn't know. I just didn't think anything. I took my kids to school . and I saw the knife with blood outside, I see the car with the door . open, I see the windows open. I don't know if something happened there. The knife is still there.' Tragically . later that morning police discovered the two youngsters dead and their . five-year-old and eight-year-old siblings suffering from stab wounds.

Police discovered the discovered the two younger siblings dead and their their five-year-old and eight-year-old siblings suffering from stab wounds . According to Montgomery County police captain Marcus Jones, Avery told detectives she 'thought the devil was in the kids.' 'That's . sort of the thing she centered it around as to why she had to conduct . an exorcism,' he said. 'She just thought that there were evil spirits . within the kids.' Avery was arrested when authorities say she tried to flee from a . townhouse near the vehicle. Police found the two children dead inside . the home, and their siblings and Sanford were taken to the hospital with . injuries. Police said Sanford was arrested Saturday after being released from the hospital. Arrest: Zakieya Avery is being held without bond charged with the murder and the attempted murder of her children .

The two youngest children were pronounced dead at the scene. Yesterday the children's grandmother Ida Johnson, 90, told of her shock, describing the two young victims as the 'sweetest things'.She said: 'I . will cherish those memories forever,' she told MailOnline. 'Their lives . were cut short and they had no say so whatsoever. It doesn't make . sense.' Mrs Johnson said the children's father, her grandson, Martin Luther Harris Jr. has traveled to . the Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. to be with his . surviving son and daughter who were both listed in stable condition . Sunday. Johnson said she didn't know if Avery had a history of violence or when the woman's relationship with Harris deteriorated. 'I don't know what was going on between the family, all I know is they were sweet kids,' she said. The . great-grandmother added: 'It's heartbreaking. Something should be done . about who did it. But at the same time, it's not going to bring the . children back. I just hope they get (what they deserve).' Avery's stepgrandmother, Sylvia Wade, told The Washington Post that Avery was 'humble and meek' and said she loved her children. 'I . don't know what triggered it,' she said. 'She wasn't herself. When a . person is not of themselves, they are not responsible for what they are . doing. They are in another zone.'

The two . women had been living together at the house in recent months. Jones said the women are believed to have met each other at a church, which he identified as Exousia Ministries in Germantown. The . pastor of that congregation, Darryl Jones, declined to discuss the case . after services at an elementary school Sunday or even confirm that the . women worshipped there. 'This . is a tragic situation. We're keeping the family in (our) prayers and we . are respecting the privacy of the family,' he said.

"A California jury recommended the death sentence for the 29-year-old convicted of killing his girlfriend's family when they told her to dump him in 2007. The 12 person jury in the murder case of Iftekhar Murtaza deliberated for three hours Thursday before coming to their decision. Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals waited until Monday to make the decision. Murtaza was convicted last month of killing his ex-girlfriend Shayona Dhanak's father and sister by burning down the family's Orange County home after becoming 'upset' when the then 18-year-old dumped him. At the time, she said her Hindu parents threatened to stop paying her college tuition if she didn't leave her Muslim boyfriend. Maximum sentence: Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, was convicted last month of murdering his ex-girlfriend's father and sister following their break-up. Today, a jury recommended the death penalty for Murtaza . The cold-blooded killer was found guilty of two counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and one conspiracy count on , but declined to convict on kidnapping and murder during a burglary charges on November 22. 'We're very pleased with the verdicts,' prosecutor Howard Gundy said after the receiving the guilty verdict last month, adding he was ready to move to the next phase. Two of Murtaza's friends were previously convicted of the killings. Vitaliy Krasnoperov was sentenced to life in prison, and Charles Murphy Jr. is scheduled to be sentenced in December. Attack: Murtaza torched his ex-girlfriend's family's Orange County home when he got 'upset' about their break-up . Religious differences: Murtaza dated Shayona Dhanak when she was 18 in 2007. She broke up with him when her Hindu parents allegedly told her they would stop paying her college tuition if she continued to date the Muslim man . Dhanak's parents were practicing Hindus and told her Mr Murtaza and his Muslim family came from a line of 'beggars and servants'. From the outset of the trial, prosecutors claimed he planned the murder plot and paid a friend $30,000 to help him kill the teen's parents so he . could be with her. Mr Murtaza . said he went home after the break-up, took ecstasy and starting chatting . with a friend online about how he wished Dhanak's parents were dead. 'I didn't want to kill them,' he told the court, according to Fox News. 'It was just a figure of speech.' 'I was frustrated, I was upset,' he continued, 'I just wished they would accept me.' 'It's almost like I am not human to them, based on the family that I was born into.' Mr Murtaza said he repeated his wish that the Dhanaks would die or disappear to dozens of friends out of his sense of frustration and despair and that his relationship would be fine if not for them. The prosecution contended Dhanak wanted to end the relationship with the disturbed man because he had become controlling and violent. Didn't do it alone: Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in connection to the killings . Killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . Bloodbath: Autopsy reports showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body set alight . Leela Dhanak broke down on the stand as she talked about still hearing her spouse’s screams of terror in her sleep years later. Mrs Dhanak told the Orange County courtroom that she was attacked when she came home in May 2007 and fell unconscious. She was found on the front lawn of a neighbors property by police, who had responded to a fire at Mrs Dhanak's home. The woman woke up from a coma three weeks later to discover the family’s Anaheim Hills mansion had been burned, and her husband, 56-year-old Jaypraykash Dhanak, and eldest daughter, Karishma Dhanak, 20, killed. Last month, a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak was alive when her throat was slit and her body was doused with gasoline and set on fire. Autopsy results showed Jayprakash Dhanak suffered 29 stab wounds to his body. He also had his skull fractured, resulting in a fatal brain injury. Their bodies had been found in a park in Irvine about two miles from the University of California dorm where Shayona Danak lived. The scorned ex-boyfriend was interviewed by police within the days of the horrifying plot and was soon arrested at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport with a ticket to his native Bangladesh and more than $11,000 stashed in his luggage. So happy together: Mr Murtaza (left) tied the knot with fellow suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti (right), 20, in a 2011 jailhouse ceremony - the newlyweds were separated by a chain-link fence . During her testimony, Mrs Dhanak admitted she didn't particularly like Mr Murtaza, but had her daughter truly loved him, she would have supported the young couple. ‘She was too young to fall in love with any guys,’ she told the court. In June 2011, Mr Murtaza married 20-year-old suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti in a jailhouse ceremony after exchanging letters for five months. Ms Bilotti is charged with first-degree murder, burglary, and robbery. She faces 32 years to life in prison for helping a friend, Derek Christopher Adams, murder a man in 2010.","Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, was convicted last month of killing his ex-girlfriend's family in a  fiery attack on the family home in 2007 .

"The Mars bar is getting a slimmer sister with 20 per cent fewer calories. The Mars Caramel, which does not have the original's thick layer of nougat, has already been a success in the US, Canada and Australia and will be available here next month. It weighs 45g and contains 204 calories, compared with a regular Mars bar weighing 58g with 260 calories. The new limited edition Mars Caramel bar that will be launched by Mars. It is smaller than the original, and doesn't have a nougat layer . The new Mars Caramel will see the original Mars bar (pictured here) lose its nougat layer and weigh in at 45g and 204 calories . The introduction of the smaller caramel bar is expected to be followed by slimmed down versions of the traditional Mars and the company's other big brands, which include Snickers, Galaxy, Maltesers, Bounty, Twix and Topic. The measures are part of a so-called Responsibility Deal Pledge where the company has promised that all its chocolate snacks will be cut to less than 250 calories by the end of 2013. For some this will involve a change in the recipe by, for example, cutting the amount of fat, however in most cases it will mean smaller bars. The company said Mars Caramel has already enjoyed success in the U.S., Canada and Australia, and would tap into growing consumer preference for caramel - now one of the top three flavours in the chocolate category. In June, Mars UK managing director Fiona Dawson said reformulation might not be enough to hit the 250 calorie target and that some bars would have to shrink. She told the trade magazine The Grocer: 'We're looking at the options and experimenting with a number of different sizes with customer groups.' Chocolate maker Mars is planning to slim down famous brands like Mars, Snickers and Maltesers . Consumers may well question the health claims given by Mars for cutting the size of the bars. Historically, chocolate manufacturers have a record of shrinking their products without delivering a matching cut in price. As a result, customers get less for their money, while the manufacturers are able to protect their profit margins. The UK arm of the company cut the size of the Mars and Snickers bars by 7.5 per cent in 2009, bringing them down from 62.5g to 58g. However, there was no cut in price. In 2010 the makers of the iconic Mars chocolate bar rejigged the recipe to contain 15 per cent less saturated fat following pressure from the Food Standards Agency to cut fat levels. The healthier bars now contain less saturated palm fat than the old recipe after it was replaced by healthier sunflower oil. Mars said the change will remove more than 600 tons of saturated fat a year from the UK diet - equalling seven million bags of sugar. Snickers, Milky Way and Topic bars were also altered, and the company assured consumers that they would not notice any difference in the taste of the product. A spokesman said: 'We believe that all of our products can be enjoyed as part of a healthy lifestyle and balanced diet - our commitment to making all our chocolate products no more than 250 calories per portion reflects this. 'These changes form part of our on-going efforts to encourage responsible consumption, and will come into effect globally by the end of next year.' One of Mars biggest rivals, Cadbury, which is now part of the U.S. confectionary giant Kraft, has cut the size of a number of its products in recent years. However, it has admitted this has been a financial decision, rather than any effort to tackle obesity. Last year, it reduced the size of the 140g bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk to 120g, so losing the equivalent of two chunks. It then cut the size of its traditional circular Roses tins from 975g to 850g – effectively snatching away 11 of the chocolate favourites. At the time, the company blamed increases in the cost of commodities, such as cocoa. Consumer groups have been sceptical about cuts in portion sizes on the pretext of supporting healthy living. Which? and the official customer body Consumer Focus argue that firms should be up-front about any decision to shrink products and to match any reductions with a cut in the price. Consumer Focus said: 'As a tactic, shrinking size but not price won't go down well among savvy customers who may become inclined to be less loyal to their favourite brands.'","New Mars Caramel will be smaller and healthier than existing Mars bar .

"Shocked friends, colleagues and members of the public have managed to raise almost $50,000 in just three days for a prominent Harvard and Cambridge educated criminal law professor who was gunned down in his own home last Friday. So far, police appear to at a loss as to who was responsible for shooting 41-year-old Professor Dan Markel in the head at his affluent Betton Hills home in Florida last week. Tallahassee police say it is likely the Florida State University professor knew his killer because there were no signs of forced entry. Scroll down for video... So far, police appear to at a loss as to . who was responsible for shooting 41-year-old Professor Dan Markel in . the head at his affluent Betton Hills home in Florida last week. The shooting of the popular lawyer has . stunned friends, colleagues and residents of his well-to-do community in . Florida's state capital. A fund was set up at the start of the week to benefit his sons Benjamin Amichai Markel and Lincoln Jonah Markel. Those close to him have spoken of how he loved his students, his colleagues, his friends, his scholarly work, and helping all those in need. 'Most of all, he loved his faith and his family. Ben and Lincoln were his heart. Danny will live every day in our hearts, and we must work together to ensure his most beloved little bears know how much their Abba was loved and what a great, wise, amazing man and father he was...and how much he loved them,' the site states. Touota Prius seen nearby: The 72-year-old man who called 911 after hearing gunshots said that he saw a Toyota Prius driving away . As the investigation gathers pace, police have not ruled out a contract killing and have issued a picture of . a white Toyota Prius that was seen close to the crime scene. 'There’s not enough information to suggest that this is a contract murder. It certainly could be,' said ABC News consultant Brad Garrett, a former FBI agent. 'The most likely theory is that it it’s somebody that he knows.' However, . with no suspects being named, the police are being careful not to . reveal crucial evidence that they are hopeful the murderer will . volunteer and incriminate themselves. 'We must make sure that we are keeping the integrity of this case so we can bring it to prosecution,' Northway said. Markel, 41, who is divorced from the mother of his two children, a day after the attack in his upscale Tallahassee neighborhood, as police revealed there were no signs of burglary or robbery and police have admitted they have no suspects so far. 'This is a puzzle and we need to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together to bring this case to a close,' said Officer David Northway. Officers were first called to Markel's home at 11am last Friday after a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang coming from his home. He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, but died later in hospital from his injuries. 'It was not a robbery,' Northway said. 'It does not appear that it was a burglary. At this time, it does appear that Mr. Markel was unfortunately the intended victim in this case.' Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father . Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013 . Markel was known as a strict disciplinary at Florida State University where he taught law and was known across the country for his writing featured in the New York Times and the Atlantic. Markel, a Toronto native, had just published a theory of retributive justice in the United States that applied elements of mercy, capital punishment, damages and shaming. He was the co-author of the book, 'Privilege or Punish: Criminal Justice and the Challenge of Family Ties' and he founded the popular law website, PrawfsBlawg. Intentional? Police are investigating the . possibility that Dan Markel was the subject of a targeted killing inside . his Tallahassee home on Friday morning . Markel and his wife split two years ago and their divorce became final on July 31 last year. They were currently involved in a legal dispute regarding their finances and custody issues. Judkins said Professor Adelson is co-operating with police and is not considered a suspect. A post on PrawfsBlawg was dedicated to Markel. 'What we have in common, with many others, is Dan,' the post read. 'His network of friends and loved ones — and he had a great deal of love for all his many friends, as we did and do for him — is enormous. 'His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life.' Murdered: The 41-year-old had no enemies according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by their friends death . His friend and colleague, Stepehen Valdeck of the American University said that Markel's 'devotion to scholarly enterprise' was his key. Vladeck said that 'Dan was  brilliant scholar and writer, but there are lots of law professors who fit those labels,' Vladeck wrote in an email to FoxNews.com. 'Whether that meant tirelessly reading and providing feedback on his friends' paper, organizing conferences where folks could present their ideas, or starting a blog where folks looking for an outlet could find a forum to develop and distribute their ideas, Dan cared about legal ideas, as such — even those that weren't his own.' Markel's own attorney said that it is physically beyond him to imagine how this has happened. 'He’s … by all accounts one of the most dedicated fathers anybody has ever known. And for this to happen to him, it’s just beyond repugnant,' said Stephen Webster, Professor Markel’s lawyer to The Globe and Mail. And the respected scholar's friends were equally distraught. 'It doesn’t make sense on any level. But at least the initial theory was that it was some kind of robbery gone wrong, which is awful, but at least makes sense,' said Michael McCann, a friend who teaches law at the University of New Hampshire. 'This has become a story that no longer makes sense. If, in fact, he was somehow targeted, I literally just cannot understand that.'","Investigators believe the Professor Dan Markel knew his killer .

It was akin to a siege at times and it came as little surprise when Chelsea doubled their lead just before the half-hour. Huddersfield failed to clear their lines from a corner and Abraham was left with a simple finish from close range. Three minutes later, Chelsea extended their lead with Abraham turning provider. He got beyond left-back Jack Senior and crossed low for Solanke to convert from just a few yards out.

"Jermain Defoe is a step closer to securing his return to the Barclays Premier League after agreeing a move to Sunderland - and has arrived in the city in order to finalise the deal. As revealed by Sportsmail on Monday, the 32-year-old striker is poised to end his 11-month spell with Toronto FC in Major League Soccer and join Gus Poyet’s side. Sunderland sit just one point and two places above the relegation zone after managing only 18 league goals so far this season, but Defoe is expected to be confirmed as a Black Cats played on Thursday after arriving in the North East in order to rubber stamp the deal. Jermain Defoe is closing in on a return to English football with a move to Sunderland . Defoe (right) has been training with former club Tottenham Hotspur and wants to return from the MLS . Sunderland have arranged a swap deal that involves Black Cats misfit Jozy Altidore heading in the opposite direction. The USA international’s big wages were a concern but it's understood the 25-year-old has agreed terms with Toronto FC as Defoe has sorted his deal with Sunderland. Defoe meanwhile has scored 11 goals in 16 games in the MLS, but has been keen to return home and revive his Premier League career.

"When Tottenham paid £26million for Roberto Soldado they knew they were getting a quality striker with proven experience at the highest level. He'd won La Liga, he'd represented Spain. But things haven't worked out as planned for the former Valencia man. Here, Dan Kilpatrick of Spurs blog TheTottenhamWay.com shares his views on why supporters are still showing faith in the struggling forward. Tottenham forward Roberto Soldado has only managed to score four goals in all competitions this season . Striker Roberto Soldado (right) contrived to miss a chance to score against Burnley with the goal gaping . It looked like he'd reached breaking point, finally. Roberto Soldado dropped to his knees in despair, eyes wide with disbelief. Andros Townsend, sensing this was no time to mourn a lost assist, rushed over to console his teammate. Once they'd recovered from the shock, the Spurs fans, aided by the excellent 1882 movement, began singing: 'Viva Soldado, oooh-oh; he came from sunny Spain; to play with Harry Kane.' Spurs trailed Burnley 2-1 in the FA Cup and Soldado, not for the first time, had missed a sitter. With the goal gaping, the Spaniard blazed Townsend's on a plate cross into the stands from five yards out. It was no exaggeration to say it was easier to score. It was his worst miss to date and there was nothing and no-one else to blame; not the service, not the system, not the Premier League. Fortunately, Spurs went on to win 4-2 but the result hardly spared Soldado's blushes. The miss was the main talking point after the match and Townsend, Mauricio Pochettino and Soldado himself all had their say on it. The Spain international reacts to the miss by dropping to his knees as White Hart Lane . Andros Townsend (left) has revealed that he offered some words of encouragement to Soldado at half-time . For a Premier League player, it was inexcusable and it could have cost Tottenham dear. Yet support for Soldado from the terraces remained unwavering. There cannot be many players at Spurs – Kane and Hugo Lloris maybe – towards whom there is so much support and goodwill. Adoration for Kane and Lloris is understandable. They are both quality players, at the top of their games. Soldado, however, is not. The striker has scored one league goal this season, fewer than Eric Dier, and seven in his Spurs career. That's a league goal every 360 minutes or every 840 minutes excluding penalties. To his credit, Soldado did not crumble. Having already assisted Paulinho, he set-up another for Danny Rose with a pinpoint cross. This is part of the reason Spurs fans sing for Soldado. A lesser player would've hidden, allowed his head to drop, but Soldado continued to work for the team. His overall performance – which some confused with his miss – was impressive. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino reacts after Soldado's miss during their FA Cup match against Burnley . Soldado scored 24 league goals in his final season at Valencia before securing Spurs move . His goalscoring form has been wretched, catastrophic since a £26m move from Valencia but he still continues to stay positive, give his all, revel in his teammates' successes and display a mingled sense of agony and humour about his misses (see his incredulous smile after his shot rebounded off the post allowing Benji Stambouli to score against Partizan). White Hart Lane loves a striker and, after years of yearning for a big-money forward, fans are not about to give up on Soldado. They recognise that he's a good player suffering from a sustained crisis of form and confidence, rather than a Gregorz Rasiak-type, hopelessly out of his depth. On the pitch, he is passionate and apologetic. He seems to genuinely care. He's classy. Off it, he appears humble and family-minded. These are endearing qualities to supporters, while the mocking he receives at the hands of the media and rival fans makes Spurs supporters all the more desperate to see him succeed. It's also worth saying that fans singing for Soldado are singing for the club, too. He was a huge investment and selling Bobby for a significant loss would hurt Tottenham. We are desperate to see him perform, for everyone's sake. Others simply recognise that Soldado, now more than ever, must be close to that breaking point. He needs more support than anyone and he's getting it. He will continue to get it.

"Emma Rice, pictured at her father's and brothers' funeral last year, has told an inquest how love for her family drove her to enter the fume-filled tank . The sister of a rising rugby star killed with his father and brother in a slurry tank accident has said love for her family drove her to twice enter the fume-filled tank in a desperate attempt to rescue them. Ulster Rugby player Nevin Spence, 22, his brother Graham, 30, and their father Noel, 58, died at their family farm near Hillsborough, County Down last September. An inquest in Belfast heard yesterday the incident was first triggered when Graham Spence entered the tank to find a collie dog that had fallen in. Emma Rice, who was also overcome by . the poisonous gases when she climbed down a ladder to try to find her . father and brothers, told Northern Ireland’s Senior Coroner John Leckey . that she knew how dangerous it was to go into the pit. 'When it comes to the love of your family, it doesn’t matter,' she said. After . helping to pull her father from the pit, Mrs Rice passed out and fell . back into the slurry as she tried to bring Graham to safety. She was rescued by neighbours who had rushed to the scene to help. Mr Leckey said Mrs Rice’s actions were 'extremely brave'. The . court heard that the young artist initially fought off the attempts by . neighbours to stop her entering the tank, which was dark. 'I remember thinking they’re not going to live in there, so it was just get them out,' she said. Mrs Rice’s sister Laura and mother Essie were also in court for the first day of the inquest. The incident happened just after 6pm on September 15. The . inquest was told that Nevin and his brother had been working in the . farmyard loading wood into the Ulster star’s car, helped by friend . Andrew Oliver. Mr Oliver and Nevin then went into the farmhouse after the rugby player’s mother called him for his dinner. Shortly afterwards, Noel Spence came into the house and said the dog had fallen into the tank. The . tank was located under a shed that housed calves. Accessible through . eight manholes, it was around 10ft deep and, at the time of the . accident, there was around three-and-a-half feet of slurry at the . bottom. The men went to the . shed and lowered a ladder into one of the manholes. Graham climbed down . with a torch and conducted a quick search for the animal. In . his statement, which was read to the court in his absence, Mr Oliver . said: 'After about 15 to 20 seconds it looked like Graham was giving up . the search.' He said he then started climbing up the ladder again. 'At . the point when his head was just about at ground level - he had looked . fine until then - he passed out and sank back into the tank.' Seeing his brother fall into the slurry, Nevin then climbed down. Mr Oliver rushed off to call for help. Shortly afterwards, the Ireland under-20 international also succumbed to the poisonous fumes and collapsed into the slurry. Noel then went down into the tank. He managed to retrieve Graham and began carrying him back up the ladder. Mr Oliver grabbed hold of Graham’s clothing from above as his father climbed upwards. 'Noel was overcome and fell down the ladder,' he said. Tragic: Former Ulster Rugby player Nevin Spence, 22, pictured on his family farm in County Down . Noel Spence, 58, left, and his son Graham Spence, 30, right, who died after falling into their farm's slurry tank . 'I wasn’t able to hold Graham without Noel’s help.' Mrs Rice and her husband Peter had been visiting with Graham’s wife Andrea at their house nearby when the accident happened. As they were leaving, they noticed a car speeding up the drive and went after it to see if something was wrong. In her statement, Mrs Rice said she ran round to the shed to investigate while her husband parked the car. Missed: Nevin had been widely tipped to represent Ireland at international level . 'I think I remember someone saying ""They’re all in the tank"",' she told investigators. 'Someone tried to move me away, I stopped them and got on to the ladder.' Mr Oliver and neighbour David Wilson both tried to prevent the young woman entering the tank. When she first climbed down, Mrs Rice located her father and, by grabbing the belt on his trousers, managed to lift him up. She was helped by neighbours to haul him up and out of the pit. Having recently taken a first aid course, she attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. 'I then went back to the ladder and again went down a couple of steps,' she said. Rescue effort: Firefighters attend the farm near Hillsborough, Co. Down, where the tragedy happened . On that second attempt, she found her brother Graham and tried to lift him out. But as she emerged out of the pit, she was overcome by the gases. 'I suddenly felt faint and sleepy,' she said. 'The next thing I remember, I was in the recovery position.' Rescuers finally managed to get both Mrs Rice and Graham out of the tank, but the search for Nevin went on. A firefighter wearing specialist breathing equipment later found both Nevin and the dog at the bottom of the tank. Despite frantic efforts to revive the men, Nevin and Noel Spence died at the scene, with Graham declared dead in hospital a short time later. Mrs Rice was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast where she recovered sufficiently to be discharged to deliver a moving tribute to the men at their funerals. During the first day of evidence a number of neighbours described how they had responded to calls for help and tried to rescue the men at the Drumlough Road farm. Shrine: A man places a tribute to rugby player Nevin Spence at Ulster's Ravenhill rugby ground in Belfast . Remembrance: Floral tributes to rugby player Nevin Spence are affixed to a fence at the ground . Mr Leckey said it was 'incredulous' that they had managed to do what they did and pull three adults, their clothes soaked in slurry, from a gas-filled underground pit. 'You are all extremely brave, you all made frantic efforts to effect a rescue,' he told one witness. After hearing how the tragedy had unfolded, the coroner asked Mr Wilson was he aware of the dangers of slurry gases. 'I think we’re all aware of the dangers but on the spur of the moment these things are done without thinking,' he replied. Mr Leckey said the Spences had shown an 'understandable desire' to save the dog. Scene: The family home on the farm where Nevin Spence, his brother Graham and father Noel fell into a slurry tank . 'I think everyone’s instinct would be to try and rescue a family pet,' he said. But he later asked Fire Service Group Commander Dermot Rooney for his opinion of health and safety legislation which stated that an individual should only enter such a confined space in exceptional circumstances, and then only with the aid of breathing equipment. 'I would absolutely be in concurrence with that,' replied Mr Rooney. The officer said a gas sensor was placed in the shed while the rescue was ongoing. It briefly sounded, indicating a level one warning. Emergency: Rescue teams were called to the farm, on the outskirts of Hillsborough, Co. Down, shortly after 6pm on a Saturday night . 'If it had gone to the second level I would have had no choice but to evacuate the area,' he added. Mr Rooney said slurry emitted a number of harmful gases, including hydrogen sulphide, carbon monoxide, methane and ammonia. Mr Leckey said he was concerned at the number of recent cases he had dealt with involving deaths at slurry pits, describing the situation as a 'very serious problem'. Northern Ireland’s state pathologist Professor Jack Crane and investigators from the region’s Health and Safety Executive are scheduled to give evidence when the inquest concludes today.","Emma Rice fought off attempts by neighbours to stop her entering the tank .

"Lazio will intensify their interest in Ravel Morrison this weekend after the West Ham forward was cleared of all charges of assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother. The 21-year-old was accused of hitting Reah Mansoor, 19, and her mother, Parveen Mansoor, 39, after a night out at a club in his home city of Manchester last July 24. He was due to go on trial at Manchester Crown Court later this month but on Thursday the charges were dropped by the prosecution and Morrison, who was not in court, was found not guilty. Italian side Lazio want to sign West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison on a pre-contract for the summer . And the news allows Lazio to accelerate their move for Morrison on a free transfer at the end of the season. Sportsmail understands talks over a move for the former Manchester United man are scheduled to take place this weekend. And if everything goes according to plan for the Serie A club, a pre-contract agreement could be in place by the start of next week. The Italians have been offered the West Ham midfielder, as reported by Sportsmail, but are aware they cannot buy him now owing to UEFA regulations. Morrison has played for West Ham and Cardiff and would not be allowed to sign for a club in another country during this window. Guy Mathieson, prosecuting, told the court the charges had been withdrawn after Morrison's defence team recovered CCTV footage of the first alleged assault outside the One Central nightclub, in Manchester city centre. It showed that Morrison had not hit his ex, as was alleged, and she had 'slumped' to the floor on her own. Morrison (centre right) has not played for West Ham since their 3-1 defeat vs Southampton on August 31 . The ex-girlfriend also withdrew her statement alleging Morrison later assaulted her outside her home when he dropped her off and there was 'reluctance' from her mother to proceed with the alleged assault on her. All three charges of assault were withdrawn. Morrison had also been initially accused of threatening to throw acid in the face of his ex and have her shot during a four-year period of harassment. But at a hearing last November the harassment charge was also withdrawn by the prosecution and he was found not guilty on those charges. Morrison is currently back with West Ham after a loan spell with Cardiff. He was first arrested last August after it was alleged that, during a night out, he assaulted his ex and, after 'bundling' her into his Porsche Panamera car, took her home to her mother's house in Salford. When they got back to the house, he was alleged to have assaulted Miss Mansoor again, as well as her mother. But Mr Mathieson said Morrison's lawyers had got the CCTV footage from an office building which captured the alleged first assault. He said that, in her statement, Miss Mansoor said she remembered her boyfriend standing in front of her and then waking up on the floor with him standing over her. Mr Mathieson continued: 'When reviewing the CCTV footage, it's clear there's a gap she doesn't remember between those two statements. 'She's seen falling, or slumping to the ground, remaining there for a minute or two before, quite clearly, the defendant and her friend come to her assistance, trying to get her to stand up. 'And it is right, thereafter, the Porsche Panamera, the defendant's car, is seen to come, she's put, bundled or half-carried into the car and she's then taken home. 'It's quite clear from that CCTV footage there's no assault at that stage.

"James Rodriguez (42%) Stephanie Roche (33%) Robin van Persie (11%) There was no fairytale ending to Stephanie Roche’s remarkable journey and there was no disguising her disappointment. Roche is the girl from Dublin whose extraordinary volley playing for Peamount United in Ireland – right foot control, 180 degree turn and left foot smash – catapulted her into the glitz and glamour of Zurich on Monday night, alongside James Rodriguez and Robin van Persie. It has been a life-changing couple of months for the 25-year-old, who now plays in France for ASPTT Albi, and one she has thoroughly enjoyed.

Yet when her name was not called out by World Cup winner Christian Karembeu, the competitor inside took of hold of Roche. ‘The whole thing has been fantastic and I just want to thank everyone who has got behind it,’ said Roche. ‘There wasn’t too much of a difference in the percentage of the goals, so that is something.

"A sheriff who was murdered earlier this year was allegedly shot dead by a male gunman that he raped as a teenager. Eugene Crum, 59, was shot dead in his police cruiser as he sat eating lunch in April, three months after taking up his post in Mingo County, West Virginia. Tennis Maynard, 37, is suspected of killing the sheriff. However his family have claimed that the shooting was motivated by the fact that Maynard was raped by Crum when he was a teenager. 'Protect and serve': Sheriff Eugene Crum, who was murdered in April, allegedly raped a woman in the back of a police cruiser . Tragedy: Crum died from his injuries at the scene after leading a drug task force and an initiative called Operation Zero Tolerance as part of a campaign pledge . Court documents also revealed that another rape allegation was brought against the late sheriff. Murky dealings: Mingo County Judge Michael Thornsbury is being investigated for corruption . It is alleged that Crum raped a 19-year-old woman in 2002 in the back of a police cruiser while two officers sat in the front, turning up the radio to cover up the attack. The allegations are part of a wider investigation this week into the murky world of Mingo . County where allegations of murder, public corruption, illegal drugs, moonshine and . illicit affairs have rumbled for decades.[ . This . Wednesday, the county's only judge for the past 15 years is set to . admit that he was part of a scheme to ruin an FBI investigation into . goings-on - again involving Crum's alleged drug habit. Judge Michael Thornsbury' startling admissions is the latest development into the downfall of what was known among local people in Mingo County as the 'courthouse gang'. Steven Ruby, an assistant U.S. Attorney involved in the investigation told TPM: 'Our investigation of public corruption in Mingo County at this point is ongoing. 'At . this point, it would be premature to indicate how many targets or how . many subjects of the investigation might exist, but we can certainly say . that the investigation is very much continuing.' The . allegations regarding Crum and Thornsbury came to light after a local . businessman George White planned to tell the FBI about their corrupt . dealings including drug taking and bending electoral law while Crum ran for sheriff. In 2012, White a local sign-maker who often did work for political campaigns, did some work for Crum. When . the local businessman was left being owed $3,000, prosecutors claim . that the sheriff arranged for White to be set up in a drug deal . involving oxycodone tablets - known on the street as 'hillbilly heroin'. Grief: Crum's widow, Rosie Crum, (center) grieves at his funeral, where she received a folded American flag from a local officer . Members of the honor guard carry Crum's body following his memorial, where he was remembered for his warmth, kisses and dedication to his job . White in turn alleged that Crum had previously bought pills from him illegally, adding that the law enforcement officer had also sold him moonshine. When it became clear to the sheriff and other members of his 'courthouse gang' that White was speaking to the FBI, they came up with a plan to silence him. Crum, Thornsbury and two other officials then allegedly told White, according to Talking Points, that if he cut off contact with the FBI, a deal could be reached about the prescription drugs. White is currently in jail while county prosecutor Michael Sparks has denied being part of the conspiracy - and has taken himself off the investigation into Crum's murder. Judge Thornsbury's cooperation with the FBI means that another case against him - involving using his powers as a judge to make frame a former mistress's husband - will be dropped. Sheriff Crum's funeral was attended by hundreds of mourners earlier this year, including nearly 400 law enforcement officers from several states. Judge Thornsbury spoke at his friend's funeral. 'We ask all the time where have all . the heroes gone?' Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury said . during his eulogy. 'Let me tell you, sometimes we walk in their midst . and we don't know we got them. He was mine.' West Virginia sheriff Eugene Crum was killed in April while sitting in his police cruiser . At the time, county prosecutor Michael Sparks said there was no substantial . evidence that Crum's death was drug-related, Thornsbury claimed Crum had . received threats due to his job. Thornsbury said: 'He was aware he was being persecuted by some, but the saving grace was that he knew he was loved by many.' The last conversation Thornsbury had with Crum included those job risks and occurred just a few minutes before his death. 'He looked at me and he said, ""I'm going to fight the good fight,'"" Thornsbury said. And with that, Crum left for lunch. He was shot as he ate in a downtown Williamson parking lot on April 3. Murky dealings: West Virginia is known for its coal industry and more recently one area, Mingo County has become associated with rife public corruption .","Eugene Crum, 59, was shot dead in his police cruiser as he sat eating lunch in April in Mingo County .

"Imran Khan has finally married ex-BBC weather girl Reham Khan at a low-key wedding ceremony in Pakistan after weeks of speculation - but not a single member of his family was invited. A close friend of the cricketer-turned-politician announced he had tied the knot with the divorced mother-of-three at his home in Islamabad earlier today, in accordance with Islamic law. Mr Khan's sisters did not attend the 'nikkah' - Islamic marriage ceremony - amid reports they do not approve of the match. Aleema Khan said: 'We were neither aware nor informed of the nikkah prior to this.' However the bride's mother, sister and two close friends were all present for the intimate ceremony, according to her nephew Yusuf Khan. He said: 'I am very close to her, she is like my mother. We have decided to hold a small reception tomorrow. There were only a few close friends of Imran Khan present at the occasion. 'The majority of our family lives in UK and USA and that is the reason only my mother, grandmother and I attended it from close family.' Mr Khan's spokesman said the wedding was kept small to honour the 145 victims of the terrorist attack on a school in Peshawar last month, in which 132 children died. Scroll down for video . Finally: Imran Khan married his fiance, Reham, at an intimate wedding ceremony in Islamabad . Intimate: Close friends and family attended the ceremony but it's thought that Imran Khan's sisters did not . Formalities: A close friend of Imran Khan's confirmed that a dowry of 82,000 rupees - around £850 - was agreed for the bride . Honour: Mr Khan's spokesperson says the wedding was kept small in respect for the 132 children who died in the Peshawar school massacre last month . Spokesman Naeemul Haq said:  'We did not want to celebrate it in big way due to the Peshawar school massacre. 'They look very elegant together. It is the biggest news of the new year for the people of Pakistan. Tomorrow both bride and groom will distribute food among the poor and needy.' Imran Khan's sister, Aleema, confirmed that none of his family were present and said they were never asked to attend. The match has caused huge controversy in Pakistan where Mr Khan is chairman of the opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. Mrs Khan said: 'We, all the sisters, were never informed or contacted by Imran so there was no question to attend it. All of us are in Lahore.' Zakir Khan, a close friend of Mr Khan's who witnessed the marriage, confirmed the dowry, a ceremonial fee paid for the bride, was 82,000 rupees - around £850. He said: 'I can confirm that Imran Khan and Reham Khan's Nikah [legal marriage contract in Islam] took place at 3:30pm today at Imran Khan's Bani Gala bungalow. 'I and four other friends were present at the occasion and we signed the marriage papers as witnesses. 'A reception for close friends and family will be held tomorrow.' Mr Khan's wedding may also have doubled as a fundraiser for a new cancer Hospital, which is currently under construction in Peshawar, according to reports today. His party's spokesperson, Shireen Mazari, rubbished reports that only those who agreed to donate money for the hospital would be invited to the reception. A source at Dawn TV, the private news channel where Reham works, revealed the new Mrs Khan invited her make up artist to the event, which was originally thought to be taking place on Friday. The source added: 'She has also shown willingness to start her regular programme for TV from next week.' Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV . Imran Khan arrives at Heathrow Airport last week when, at the time, he said rumours he had married were 'greatly exaggerated' The formal announcement comes after a turbulent week for the couple, who have incited the wrath of Mr Khan's family and the wider public in Pakistan. A friend of Mrs Khan, 41, told how she was suffering emotional turmoil after being trolled over her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician. Some social media users have accused the divorced mother-of-three of being a lesbian and one image even claims to show her in a sex shop. A producer at Dawn TV told MailOnline that the backlash had left the broadcaster 'very disturbed'. The source said: 'She is not in the right state of mind after seeing the reaction of trolls on social media after news of her marriage with Imran Khan was disclosed. 'She has not been conducting her daily programme as well. She is very disturbed by the way she is being portrayed on social media.' Denial: Imran Khan's sister Aleema said the family had a showdown with the politician and he denied the secret marriage . It came as Mr Khan spoke out against the storm surrounding his  wedding, telling his critics that marriage is not a crime. His sister Aleena reacted with anger at the news, saying she doesn't want to meet the new Mrs Khan. Told by MailOnline that her brother had revealed he was actually married, Aleema Khan - who claimed the rumours were started by opposition politicians looking to discredit her brother - said: 'Really? Really? Let's see if he announces it officially. I am taken aback. 'This is a real challenge for him. We haven't met her and I don't know that we want to meet her. 'It is his decision, he is a grown up. It is more important how the children feel. 'I suppose in any situation like this the children will not feel good about it. They do look up to their father.' Speaking amid a political storm surrounding rumours of the marriage, she said she hoped Reham Khan 'will be good for Pakistan and our brother'. She added: 'It all depends on how the public respond to it. The biggest surprise is how everybody in Pakistan feels they have a right to participate in the decision. 'He is a grown man, we are watching the situation unfold.' But speaking from his home in Islamabad yesterday, Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride, declaring: 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants.' He pointed to the fact that he had in no way deceived his wife and insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision. The 62-year-old said: 'I didn't think of my marriage for 10 years after my divorce because my children were small. I do not ever think of hurting my children's feelings.' 'I hope he will be happy': Jemima Goldsmith, the ex-wife of Imran Khan, has offered her congratulations to the former cricketer 'on this new phase in his life' after he announced his marriage to a former BBC weather girl . After the wedding was officially confirmed by Khan yesterday following days of speculation, Ms Goldsmith took to Twitter to express her happiness for the newlyweds . Khan's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith has been among those to offer her congratulations to the former cricketer. She tweeted: 'I hope Imran will be happy in this new phase of his life.' Ms Goldsmith, who divorced Khan in 2004 after nine years of marriage and has two teenage sons with him, also spoke of her fondness for Pakistan. Ms Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname 'Khan' and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: 'My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it's probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.' Khan married Ms Goldsmith in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris in 1995. What Mrs Khan's former in-laws think of the marriage is less clear. Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. Fazlur Rehman, her ex-father-in-law, a retired major in the Pakistan army, refused to speak to reporters when they approached him. Pakistan cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan speaks out against his critics in a press conference at his home in Islamabad (left) after secretly marrying former BBC weather girl Reham Khan (right) 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants:' Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride after reaction to the marriage was negative in Pakistan and on social media . Mr Khan insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision about marriage . Reham Khan is understood to have moved into the house with her youngest daughter, according to her former colleague and friend. The Daily Mail's diarist Sebastian Shakespeare broke the news of Khan's marriage to the broadcaster last week. On New Year's Eve, Mr Khan said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated' and his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it. But speaking to reporters at Heathrow airport on Tuesday, before boarding a flight to Pakistan, Khan is reported to have said: 'I am going to Pakistan to share good news about my marriage with the nation. I have nothing to hide.'
