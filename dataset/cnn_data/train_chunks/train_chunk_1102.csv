Clough heads to face fellow League One side Preston at Deepdale determined to make sure his players don’t drop the standards they produced in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg.

"Eddie Howe admits he is saddened by the demise of the FA Cup at the expense of the Barclays Premier League, but believes the competition will rise again once more. The Bournemouth manager, whose Championship-topping side take on top flight Aston Villa on Sunday in the fourth round, grew up in the 1980s when the FA Cup was considered more prestigious than league competition. But now the giant of the Premier League and the financial rewards of the competition has eclipsed that. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe believes the FA Cup needs to return to its 'proper position' Howe's side face Aston Villa in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday afternoon . ‘That is sad,’ Howe said, ‘when you’ve been brought up around the FA Cup and that’s the big competition. All those days that are talked about, those historic days in the competition. ‘It’s sad that with all the tweaks to the competition and the changes which have been made it’s not the prominent cup that it once was. ‘The Premier League now has definitely taken priority, in my eyes. That’s a shame. But I think it can be temporary. I’d love to think the FA Cup will come back. I think it can.’ Howe added: ‘There’s still a lot of love for the competition in the country. I know a lot of managers feel as I do that it’s still got a really important role to play in English football. I’d love to see it put back in its proper position.’","Eddie Howe believes the Premier League is now priority over FA Cup .

"With two children, a devoted best friend, a loving boyfriend and a comfortable home, life for Steph Cocker, 24, from Sheffield, is good. But all is not quite as it seems for Steph's idyllic lifestyle is funded by benefits of £330 a week, while boyfriend Nathan, recently released from prison, lives next door so Steph can go on claiming an extra allowance for being a single parent. Yet far from being ashamed of her taxpayer-funded lifestyle, the 24-year-old describes her life as 'blessed' and says she won't stop claiming until she finds a job that pays her £5,000 a month. Scroll down for video . Enjoying life: Mother-of-two Steph Cocker, 24, says she is as 'happy as Larry' with her taxpayer-funded life . 'I've had my life cushty,' she boasts. 'I have had . everything provided for me. If I wanted it, I got it. Still now. If I . want it, I'll get it. 'From being young, I've had everything I ever . wanted. If I wanted a Barbie, I'd f***ing get it. I'm not f***ing . getting off of benefits. That is just as simple as that.' And while Steph, who appears on Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole, says she'd do any job, it would have to pay at least £5,000 a month. 'I'd do anything for a job - even if its . making cups of tea,' she insists. 'If I were earning enough, I'd go to that job. 'But to . put my kids in childcare from 9 to 5, it's £400 a week. I'd need to be . on at least £5,000 a month to pay my rent, to pay my council tax, . everything like that.' Happy: Steph, left, with her friend Zara, right, says she lives a 'blessed life' on benefits . Paid for: Steph, seen here getting a new tattoo, is paid £330 a week  and says she has no plans to find a job . Her hometown, Sheffield, is one of the most deprived parts of the UK, with 80,000 people currently out of work and dependent on the dole, which last year cost taxpayers £117bn, to survive. But while Steph is adamant about staying on benefits, her best friend Zara Suki, 20, couldn't be more different. 'I hate being on benefits, I hate going . to the job centre, I hate not working,' she says. 'That's the main thing I hate - . not working. I want to do something, get out there, get a good routine . in my life.' Unfortunately for Zara, a criminal record and a stint in prison aged 17 have made getting work difficult to say the least. 'It's like, I went for an interview for a job at McDonalds. I did . well in my interview and I've got previous experience in similar jobs like . that. 'The only thing that let me down is my criminal record. When I . was younger, I used to take part in a lot of robberies just for a way to . make money. Different world: Steph's friend Zara, right, is desperate to get a job so she can win her son back . 'I haven't lived with my mum and dad since I was young, so I . was independent from a young age. I used to go out fighting a lot, . carrying knives with you... Just stupid things.' For now, she and her Staffordshire bull terrier, Giro, spend their lives helping Steph take care of her two sons, Corbin Jay, three, and Cohen Kenzie, one. She even cares for the two boys while Steph indulges in one of her favourite pastimes - getting new tattoos, which she does whenever she has cash to spare. 'It's my money what I got for my . birthday and I can do what I want with it,' says a mulish Steph as she contemplates the 'flowers and fairies' that she wants to add to her already large sleeve artwork. 'Obviously, if I didn't get . benefits, I'd be spending it on food and stuff like that but . since it's my money, I can do what I want with it. If I want to go and . piss it up the wall, I will.' Tough times: 80,000 people in Steph's hometown Sheffield are currently out of work and on benefits . No job: Unlike Zara, Steph doesn't have to find a job because her children are under five . Zara, who lives on £70 a week, also has a son but he was taken away by social services aged three months - much to her continuing dismay. 'I was 17 when I went to prison,' she explains. 'About . four weeks before, I found out I was pregnant. 'It's not nice having . scans when you're in f***ing handcuffs. I'm not really an emotional . person but when it comes to my son, I am. 'If I had a job, it would make it much . easier to see my son and take steps towards getting him back. It . breaks my heart when I have to leave him.

I'm . just a totally different person.' Steph, however, has no such worries. 'I'm happy as Larry,' she boasts.

"Ronald Koeman can see himself returning to Barcelona as manager one day, but the Dutchman's only focus right now is continuing Southampton's fine form. Life at the Nou Camp is rocky at the moment, with president Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing on Thursday that elections would be held early in a bid to lift the negative 'tension' around the club. The term crisis is being bandied around and the Spanish press are reporting rising tensions between head coach Luis Enrique and some of his players, namely Lionel Messi. Southampton Ronald Koeman has rejected talk he could soon depart St Mary's to take over at Barcelona . Koeman celebrates scoring the winning goal in the European Cup final for Barcelona at Wembley in 1992 . Koeman has masterminded a superb season for Southampton so far, leading the club to fourth in the league . Speculation that both could soon be leaving Barca has been knocked back by Bartomeu, while Enrique had denied he was handed an ultimatum by the club. His position at the helm does, though, look under pressure and Koeman has been installed as the bookmakers' favourite to replace him, thanks to his fine work at Saints and his history with the Catalan giants. Barcelona list the former defender amongst their 'legends' after a highly-successful spell as a player at the Nou Camp - a place he can see himself returning to as manager, albeit not in the immediate future. 'At teams like Barcelona, if they lose games, there's always a lot of critics, rumours, speculation,' Koeman said. 'I know because my whole life I'm linked to Barcelona, but it's not a time to talk about that, because I think it's not respectful to Southampton as a club, it is not respectful to the people of Barcelona.' Koeman (left) took over at Southampton after Mauricio Pochettino (right) left for Tottenham last summer .

"U.S. authorities are investigating claims that an American man fighting for the Islamic State has been killed during clashes in a besieged Syrian town. Abu Muhammad al-Amriki, who reportedly lived in the U.S. before joining the terror group, has been 'martyred' in the border town of Kobani, according to internet posts by militants. In a video posted on YouTube in February, a bearded man believed by officials to be the same individual was seen speaking in English with a heavy foreign accent. Dressed in uniform and clutching a rifle, he said he had lived in America for around 10 years before travelling to Syria to join ISIS. It is unclear whether he was a U.S. citizen. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dead? Abu Muhammad al-Amriki (pictured speaking of his U.S. background in a video posted on YouTube in February) has been 'martyred' in the Syrian town of Kobani, according to internet posts by militants . Photos of the fighter, released around the same time as the video, show him posing with an array of weapons, forming the ISIS one-finger salute with his 'brothers' and trying to convert others to Islam. Now, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are trying to confirm the authenticity of the internet claims about al-Amriki's death, which were posted online by militants last weekend. Flashpoint Partners, a firm which monitors jihadist Web traffic, said al-Amriki was reportedly killed during recent clashes in Kobani, the Kurdish town on the Turkish border. The area has been under attack for days by ISIS, which has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq. Fighter: Photos of the fighter (including this one, with him on the right), show him posing with an array of weapons, forming the ISIS one-finger salute with his 'brothers' and trying to convert others to Islam . In the widely-publicized video, the man believed to be al-Amriki said said he was an al-Qaeda affiliate when he originally arrived in Syria. However, he later defected to Islamic State after the groups clashed, he said. According to U.S. officials, at least a handful of Americans - including a Michigan woman and men from Florida and Minnesota - have died fighting in Syria over the past two years. One of the men, Moner Mohammed Abusalha, reportedly blew himself up in a suicide bombing earlier this year.

U.S. and European authorities are deeply concerned about Western foreign fighters in Syria who might return to their home countries to carry out attacks. It comes as ISIS's sinister black flag  has been torn down from a Kobani hill  in a symbolic blow against the jihadis. Kurdish fighters captured the strategic hill of Tel Shair and pulled down the flag that had been fluttering for more than a week.

It followed a sustained stepping up of the U.S.-led airstrikes, with locals counting more than 30 bombs dropped on jihadi positions in just 24 hours. The fighting in Kobani has forced more than 200,000 people to flee across the border into Turkey, and killed more than 500, mostly fighters from both sides. Yesterday, presidential counter-terrorism advisor Lisa Monaco discussed this threat with New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton, a White House announcement said.","Abu Muhammad al-Amriki has reportedly been killed in Kobani in Syria .

"Socialite Lady Victoria Hervey has sparked fury for tweeting a picture of bruising she suffered on a bobsleigh and claiming she was rocking the 'battered housewife look'. The photo shows her posing in front of a bathroom mirror and revealing bruising on the underside of her arm which she sustained while training for the upcoming series of reality TV show The Jump. In the caption underneath the photo, the 38-year-old wrote: 'Rocking the battered housewife look. New war wounds from bobsleigh, can we please get an arnica sponsor asap!' But her apparent suggestion the bruising was comparable to injuries suffered by victims of domestic violence has been branded 'vile'. Lady Victoria Hervey's photo caused anger after she compared the bruising on her arm to injuries suffered by 'battered' housewives . The socialite posted the image and claimed the bruising was caused while training for TV show The Jump . One Twitter user said Lady Victoria's pictured and accompanying comment disgusted her . Victims counsellor Kel Ashley said: 'It's just the sort of comment I'd expect the privileged elite to come out with,' The Mirror reported. She added: 'No one ""rocks the battered wife look"". They endure being a being a battered wife and hope it never happens to them again.' It also provoked anger online, with one Twitter user writing that it proved how 'utterly trivially' domestic violence was treated. They added: 'It needs to change. It's not a joke. Ever.' Training for the second season of Channel 4's The Jump is currently taking place in Austria, with celebrities including Joey Essex, Ashley Roberts and Mike Tindall competing across a range of winter sports. Lady Victoria has previously tweeted about the rough and tumble required for the series - on January 7, she wrote: 'Feeling really beaten up from the skeleton. Wrist and ankle. Can't wait till that bit is over. #TheJump #Innsbruck.' Nor is it the first time contestants on the show have been injured - Sally Bercow and Ola Jordan were both replaced after sustaining injuries. Bercow, 45, was forced to pull out after breaking two ribs while training in Austria, while Jordan, 32, suffered a serious leg injury. MailOnline has requested comment from Lady Victoria's publicist. Lady Victoria Hervey, pictured left in Austria for The Jump with her pet D'Artagnan, has previously claimed to have suffered knocks and bruises while training for the show. On the right is a selfie she tweeted in which she said she was 'feeling really beaten up from the skeleton' Lady Victoria also hit the headlines last week after she revealed the extraordinary request made to ensure she remains relaxed during The Jump – she insisted that producers pay for her new puppy to be flown out to be with her wherever the show is filmed. Her six-month-old Norfolk terrier, D’Artagnan, will go back and forth from Los Angeles, where she lives, to Britain, Germany and Austria, covering 17,500 miles. She said: ‘That was part of the agreement. I got it in my contract. The training is very difficult, so when we have had a long day he acts as a bit of a stress reliever for everyone.’ Lady Victoria had just bought the puppy in October from a breeder in Stafford when she was approached for the series. She was so anxious about leaving him that she asked for a special contract clause guaranteeing his air travel costs would be covered. Before Christmas, he flew with her from London to LA, at a cost of £1,000, for two weeks. Then he flew back to join Lady Victoria for training at an indoor ski slope in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.","Lady Victoria Hervey posted a bathroom mirror selfie of bruise on Twitter .

"Radamel Falcao is still interesting English clubs including Liverpool even though the player himself is hoping to join Real Madrid. The Colombian striker, who last year joined French club Monaco for £50million from Atletico Madrid last year is understood to be dissatisfied in the French League and keen to move back to Madrid. However, Real Madrid have already paid £90million to sign James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Keylor Navas this summer and now have to rein in their spending to ensure they comply with UEFA’s tough Financial Fair Play rules. VIDEO Scroll down for Radamel Falcao scores brilliant acrobatic scissor kick in training . Transfer: Radamel Falcao signed for Monaco last summer after a brilliant spell at Atletico Madrid . They are keen to take Falcao on a loan with a view to a permanent move next season but Monaco will not let the striker go on those terms, as they believe Real should pay up front. However, Monaco are prepared to loan him out for a season to another club and should Real not make a formal bid for him in the next two weeks before the window closes the player would consider a one-year loan with the expectation of moving to Real Madrid next summer. Brendan Rodgers has made it clear that signing one more striker is his priority before the end of the transfer window and is an admirer of Falcao. La Liga: Real Madrid were interested in signing the Colombian forward, but the deal never materialised . Ligue 1: Monaco's record signing has enjoyed mixed success while in France . Liverpool still think he is more likely to join Madrid but will monitor the situation to see if Falcao can be persuaded to join them if that move does not materialise. It is understood that the financing of the move would not be a problem even though Falcao would need to be paid more than £200,000 a week. Monaco are asking for a £12million loan fee, though that would be negotiated down. Manchester City have also made inquiries about Falcao but not taken it further at present. Liverpool are also monitoring Fiorentina’s goalkeeper Netto, with a move possible before the end of the month.

"If a wild cheer from the crowd is a sportsman’s greatest reward then spare a thought for the youngsters of Yorkshire this weekend. For in an unprecedented move rugby bosses have ordered that all youth games have to be played in complete silence. The bizarre rule has been introduced in an attempt to improve behaviour on the touchlines after a spate of unsavoury incidents. Officials said that referees are increasingly becoming targets for abuse from aggressive parents during games. Parents watching youth rugby games in Yorkshire have been told to observe a rule of silence after referees complained of being verbally abused (file image) The ban will affect spectators, parents and coaches, with only the players on the field permitted to make any noise. But as well as banning shouting and chanting, officials have told spectators that they are not even allowed to applaud impressive play on the pitch. The ‘Silent Sundays’ initiative has been approved by the Rugby Football Union, with former Lions coach Sir Ian McGeechan also backing the plan. It is unclear how Yorkshire RFU will apply the rules, but the letter they sent to clubs complained that a ‘small minority’ were forgetting rugby’s ‘core values’ when attending games at weekends. It went on to say: ‘Some referees are being verbally abused and we are finding it harder to recruit new referees because of this. And junior players who leave the game have highlighted this pitch-side pressure as a reason for giving up.’ Last year the Football Association started offering courses to parents caught swearing during children’s football matches. The three-hour sessions include a quiz designed to show parents ‘that they do not know the rules better than the referee’.","Bizarre rule introduced after bosses said it was harder to recruit referees .

"Margaret Thatcher's hometown is divided over proposals to name a new bypass after the former prime minister. The people of Grantham, Lincolnshire, are eagerly awaiting a new relief road and supporters are clamouring for it to be named in her honour. There is no permanent memorial to of Britain's first female prime minister, who died in 2013, in the town, except for a small plaque commemorating her birthplace. Proposals to name a bypass in Margaret Thatcher's hometown in her honour has divided the town. Pictured, the former prime minister at the Conservative Party conference in 1989 . Britain's first female prime minister Margaret Thatcher visits her alma mater, Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School, in Grantham in 1986 . So Ray Wootten, a Conservative councillor for Lincolnshire county council, was eager to remedy that and registered the names Lady Thatcher Way, Margaret Thatcher Way and Baroness Thatcher Way for the bypass. He said he proposed the idea in a bid to provide a fitting memorial to the town's most famous export - but he admits the town is divided over the issue. Councillor Ray Wootten thinks naming the bypass after Baroness Thatcher would be a fitting tribute . Councillor Wootten added a previous proposal to build a statue in Baroness Thatcher's honour several years ago had sparked the same controversy. He told MailOnline: 'It's certainly caused a stir. The town is divided. 'It was the same thing with the statue four or five years ago. 'I raised the idea of a statue and a tourist trail and the response was ""We shouldn't commemorate her life and there are far more important people than Mrs Thatcher"". 'But we need to really celebrate her life and her career. 'Mrs Thatcher certainly changed the world in which we live in today. 'She really put the great back in Great Britain.' He added: 'I have received people from Canada, Japan, France and Germany who all wanted to visit Grantham and couldn't understand why there isn't anything to commemorate Mrs Thatcher. 'Some months ago, I made enquiries as to whether anybody had registered names for the bypass - which was no. 'So I stuck my head above the parapet and registered Lady Thatcher Way, Baroness Thatcher Way and Margaret Thatcher Way.' But Labour politicians in the town are strongly against the idea, claiming it would be wrong to name the bypass after such a controversial person. Councillor Wootten's idea of a Margaret Thatcher tourist trail also sparked controversy. Pictured, her birthplace - a corner shop in North Parade, Grantham .

"So is Phil Jones Manchester United's new specialist corner taker? Everyone had to double take when he took set pieces in Saturday's win at Queens Park Rangers. But he was at it again, as he remained on corner duties. The new David Beckham, perhaps? Manchester United defender Phil Jones was placed on corner kick duty once again . Jones was also responsible for taking corner kicks against Queens Park Rangers . There are reminders of Cambridge United's rich heritage all over the Abbey Stadium. There's the John Ruddy Suite - which doubled up as the press working area. Inside were shirts from Ruddy and Jack Collison - who spent five years at the Abbey Stadium as a trainee - taking pride of place on the walls. Likewise, mementos from matches against Bayern Munich and Stuttgart were also on show. The John Ruddy suite, which is named after the keeper due to his time at the club, doubled up as a press area . Adnan Januzaj was handed another chance to make an imprint in his manager's thoughts. The Belgian has been a peripheral figure for United this season and, despite the club insisting otherwise, is set for a loan switch away this month.

"Odion Ighalo scored four times as Watford produced a remarkable second-half performance to move within four points of the top of the Championship following a 7-2 victory over Blackpool. The Hornets found themselves two goals down at the break, but they dug themselves out of that hole in sensational style with a devastating seven-goal showing after the break as Troy Deeny, Matej Vydra and Gabriele Angella also joined in the home side's free-scoring run following last week's 5-0 win over Charlton Athletic. Blackpool came into the game still searching for a first away win of the season, but they started the brighter and were rewarded with the opening goal in the eighth minute, although it came about largely due to their opponents' defensive shortcomings. Odion Ighalo struck four times for Watford as they hammered Blackpool 7-2 on Saturday . The Hornets celebrate after a reversing a two-goal deficit at half-time at Vicarage Road .

Juan Carlos Paredes, who was under pressure from Ishmael Miller, got involved in a mix-up with Heurelho Gomes, with the ball ricocheting off the goalkeeper's body and back to Andrea Orlandi, who kept his composure to fire home. The Hornets, who had already gone close through an Angella header, missed a good chance to equalise soon after when Vydra put the ball wide from close range after good link-up play with fellow strikers Ighalo and Deeney. Thereafter, Watford controlled possession and territory for the most part as they probed to get back on terms. Goalkeeper Elliot Parish was extended a couple of times by strikes from Ikechi Anya and Ighalo, but the visitors were defending resolutely, remaining organised and three minutes before the break they went 2-0. The Hornets failed to react as David Ferguson attacked the right side of the penalty area before cutting inside and hitting a low cross-shot which wasn't dealt with, Steve Davies made a real hash of his first effort but he still had the time to recompose himself and fire the ball into the back of the net. Andrea Orlandi (right) celebrates after putting Blackpool ahead in the first half . Steve Davies (right) then doubled the Tangerines lead before the break . Ighalo of Watford halved the defecit for the home side shortly after after half time . He then put the Hornets 3-2 ahead after Troy Deeney had levelled proceedings . It is fair to assume Hornets head coach Slavisa Jokanovic had some harsh words for his side at the interval but it is also reasonable to suggest he did not expect the reaction he got. Within seven second-half minutes, the home side were back on terms as Ighalo tapped home a Miguel Layun centre from close range in the 47th minute before Deeney equalised five minutes later when he glanced home a Daniel Tozser corner. And before the hour was up, Watford were incredibly 4-2 as Ighalo put his side ahead for the first time after a Layun cross was knocked down by Deeney and then Vydra made it 4-2, firing home an Anya cross was knocked down into his path.

Again an assist from the woodwork following a Deeney strike allowed Ighalo to complete his hat-trick in the 77th minute as the ball cannoned into the net off his chest. And four minutes later the Nigerian had his fourth, with Watford's latest close-range finish following more good work by strike partner Deeney.","Blackpool throw away two-goal lead at half time to lose at Watford .

"Republic of Congo ground out a surprise 1-0 win over Gabon at the African Cup of Nations on Wednesday to go top of Group A. Prince Oniangue forced the ball in from a corner in the 48th minute at Bata Stadium to sneak the win after Republic of Congo was under pressure almost throughout and relied on counterattacks. The Congolese were clinging on before and after their goal, but while Gabon surged forward often, they couldn't convert any of their many chances. Republic of Congo ground out a surprise 1-0 win over Gabon at the African Cup of Nations . The Congo players celebrate after taking the lead in their group game . 'We played a very good match tactically,' Republic of Congo coach Claude Le Roy said. Levy Madinda sent a shot just past the post in Gabon's completely dominant first half. He also shot just wide late in the second after weaving his way past defenders to create the opening for himself.

"Arsene Wenger may have raised an inquisitive eyebrow at this Brighton performance; he will know Arsenal are in for a proper game when they arrive here in the FA Cup on Sunday. It was a night not befitting a team who had won only three Championship games before the end of December and are still trying to haul themselves away from the relegation zone. But then again, in Chris Hughton the Seagulls have a manager who is already turning the tide on the south coast. With Liverpool loanee Joao Teixeira they have a diminutive figure who is able to unlock at will, and it was he who scored two stunning goals for which Ipswich had no answer. Joao Teixeira (centre) scores Brighton's second goal in the 3-2 win over Ipswich . Teixeira (centre) is congratulated after scoring his first goal of the night .

Subs not used: Kenny, Parr, Clarke, Ambrose . Goals: Murphy 22, Sears 78 . Referee: Keith Stroud . Attendance: 23,880 . ‘I’m delighted with the performance,’ said Hughton, who sees his side now six points clear of the drop. ‘Joao was excellent. He has quality and somebody who is prepared to work hard. You need to get him on the ball. He’s still young - today would’ve done him the world of good.’ Sam Baldock had given Brighton a lead - unstoppably lashing across Bartosz Bialkowski - before Daryl Murphy’s deft volley levelled for Mick McCarthy’s side three minutes later, his 18th of the campaign. It seemed the visitors, who could’ve gone top with a win, would then turn the screw but Teixeira had other ideas. Firstly he picked up possession from the impressive Rohan Ince 40 yards from goal, driving purposefully at five defenders, before jinking inside and smashing into the top corner via a deflection. And if that wasn’t enough, the Portuguese added a third in first-half stoppage time, arriving late to a clever Joe Bennett cut-back and leathering home. It is his first sustained spell away from Anfield, and Brendan Rodgers will like what he is seeing. McCarthy, meanwhile, did not. ‘I'm not happy about the goals - that isn't like us,’ he said. ‘Our first-half performance wasn’t what I’d expect. Maybe one or two of them are knackered. ‘They're all off until Monday. Go on holiday, have a beer with their mates, whatever.’ Chris Hughton has made an instant impact at Brighton since replacing Sami Hyypia . Brighton keeper David Stockdale rushes out of his area to claim a ball into the box . Chris O’Grady had chances to pile further misery on McCarthy but fluffed his lines on a number of occasions as Brighton quite rightly looked towards the flamboyant Teixeira for inspiration. They would be advised to do similar when Wenger and Arsenal come to town. ‘He’s just too good for you,’ they sang inside the Amex Stadium and that was no exaggeration. Ince had a header cleared off the line while Aaron Hughes saw his looping effort tipped over. And they could have been made to pay for those close calls after Freddie Sears slipped underneath David Stockdale in the 78th minute and Murphy almost squeezed in a late equaliser but the eventual difference was a little playmaker from Melwood.","Joao Teixeira, on loan from Liverpool, inspires Brighton to victory .

"Fulham fans know a bit about managerial changes so perhaps they thought they were on to something when they started warning Stuart Pearce he would be out of work in the morning. It turns out they may have been premature words on a couple of counts, not least because they were delivered after 35 minutes when Fulham were 3-0 up courtesy of a Ross McCormack hat-trick. Fulham forward Ross McCormack celebrates his third goal to complete a first half hat-trick . Fulham (4-3-1-2): Bettinelli 6; Grimmer 6, Hutchinson 6, Bodurov 6, Stafylidis 6.5; Fofana 6, Parker 7 (Ruiz 57, 6), Tunnicliffe 6.5; Kačaniklić 6.5; McCormack 8, Rodallega 6.5 (Woodrow 77) Subs not used: Kiraly, Roberts, Dembélé, G Williams, Burn .

Subs not used: Darlow, Lascelles, Burke, Vaughan, Paterson, Veldwijk . Ref: Andy Haines 5 . Att: 15,512 . MOM: Ross McCormack . What followed was an impressive two-goal comeback which, by consolation, added a lick of gloss to what might have been a dreadful night for Pearce. But a defeat is a defeat and while these numbers were not as bad as they might have been, there was no escaping the truth in the wider figures since these sides last met. It is scarcely believable that following that 5-3 Forest win in September, Pearce’s side were top of the Championship with 17 points from seven games; Fulham were bottom with one and immediately sacked Felix Magath. Moving on four months, Forest have managed 17 points in the next 20 games and Fulham 33 under Kit Symons. Even points overall, but one side is upwardly mobile and the other is sinking quickly. The win over Derby at the weekend was popular and important for Pearce, but how much leeway will that buy him? Forest sources maintained last night that his job is not under immediate threat, but the cracks are obvious, even before you consider how his defence operated in the first half here. Owner Fawaz Al-Hasawi is already understood to have his reservations and it will not have gone unnoticed that when Eric Lichaj was substituted midway through a dreadful first half, he stormed past Pearce without shaking hands. Fulham forward Ross McCormack scores the opening goal against Nottingham Forest . McCormack scores Fulham's second goal against Nottingham Forest at Craven Cottage . By then, Forest were two down to an £11million striker who has found some form in a mixed season. He brought a stunning save from Dorus De Vries inside two minutes and within seven had opened the scoring with a low shot from the edge of the area. He scored his second from a similar range 11 minutes later and a deflected shot off Todd Kane completed his hat-trick and ninth goal of the season. ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning,’ sang the Fulham fans. Then came the fight back. Henri Lansbury pulled one back in stoppage time with what was Forest’s first shot on target and a second shortly after the hour made it interesting. Brit Assombalonga then missed a glorious chance inside the six-yard box and Robert Tesche’s late header was saved by Marcus Betinelli’s face. Not enough for Pearce, but he will know this could have been worse. Fulham fans celebrate third goal in front of Nottingham Forest chairman Fawaz Al-Hasawi .

"Celtic’s return to the summit of the Scottish Premiership will surprise no one. A Mikael Lustig hat-trick might have been a different story. The Swedish defender is not noted for his goalscoring. In a season blighted by injury for the most part he hasn’t been noted for very much at all. Yet, on his return from injury for a first appearance since November, the half-time substitute eased his way back in with two goals in seven minutes – one a diving header – and came to within inches of adding a third. Mikael Lustig scores his second, and Celtic's fourth, goal of the evening with a diving header . Virgil van Dijk scores the opening goal of the game in the clash between Celtic and Motherwell . The woodwork proved Motherwell’s salvation more than once here. With Celtic 2-0 up at half-time it prevented the home team from making a very comfortable victory a rout. Lustig turned a James Forrest centre into the net with a slightly mis-hit left foot shot in 75 minutes. He added his second with a spectacular looping, diving header from 10 yards from a Leigh Griffiths cross. Had he added a third we might all have been calling Tommy Gemmell, the club’s last free-scoring full-back, for a comment. As it turned out, a low Kris Commons centre in the final minutes was turned against the upright from 12 yards. The statisticians could rest easy. More so, at least, than a Motherwell team tormented here from start to finish. Anthony Stokes divides opinion. The Irishman has admirers in Cardiff and Leeds and has been linked with both English Championship clubs this month already. They don’t seem so sure about him in the Celtic support. Yet after three weeks on the sidelines he was the first Celtic returnee to remind doubters what he brings to Ronny Deila’s team. The Dutchman celebrates his goal with left back Emilio Izaguirre on Wednesday evening . Scottish striker Leigh Griffiths then doubles the hosts' lead with another header . In the 4-2-3-1 formation favoured by the Norwegian, Stokes is forging a new role as a creator on the left side. It’s not clear he fancies his new role much. Yet two first half assists in this routine, mundane victory suggest he won’t be back in his favoured berth as an out and out poacher again any time soon. When his corner struck the first defender in 26 minutes they howled their derision. In response Stokes gathered the ball in and thumped a probing ball to the back post where Virgil van Dijk headed the opener into the roof of the net. Like Stokes, Van Dijk is another of the wanted men. The attraction of selling now for a £10million fee is obvious. But it’s not only defending which makes Deila determined to stick. Scoring his seventh of the season the centre-half became Celtic’s third highest goalscorer after John Guidetti and Anthony Stokes. Leigh Griffiths might feature in the upper reaches soon enough. He headed a fine goal two minutes from half-time. A quick free-kick from Nir Bitton sent Stokes scuttling down the left flank. The cross which prompted Griffiths to crane back his neck and guide the ball into the net for 2-0 was quality. Griffiths celebrates doubling his side's lead by leaping through the air . Lustig then added a third goal to seal the win with 15 minutes remaining . At half-time it was a question of how many Celtic wanted. Seeking to overhaul Aberdeen at the top of the table – with a game in hand – the response was empatic. Motherwell entered this match on a run of three straight defeats. After winning their opening two matches under Ian Barraclough the Fir Park side arrived in Glasgow’s east end knowing they could drop into the bottom two if they lost and St Mirren won. In the event the Paisley side fell short. But so did Motherwell here and by some distance. It may have been a lack of ambition, more likely a lack of ability and experience, with captain Keith Lasley absent with a broken toe. Despite the return of Stephen Pearson to a claret shirt, however, the Steelmen barely mustered a venture over the halfway line. Pearson did loft a deft cross towards the back post on the half hour which nearly dropped inside the post. Yet Celtic – with Kris Commons in the starting line-up again – had a spring in their step. Throwing his boots to the crowd in Hamilton at the weekend Commons created a few headlines as he gave impression he was off. Wrongly. They found him a new pair last night, but almost sent out a call for the old pair when he lashed an early effort from a Stokes lay-off high and wide. The two managers watch on from the sidelines during the Scottish Premiership clash . A minute's silence is observed before the game at Celtic Park in remembrance of fan Martin Kane . He blew a later chance for 3-0 after an hour, sidefooting an easy chance from a Griffiths centre too close to keeper Dan Twardzik, then hammered a right foot shot straight at the keeper moments later. If last year’s player of the year finally signs a new contract – and it looks unlikely – this won’t be the night which seals it. He was by no means a solitary offender in the art of wasting great chances. Celtic should probably have finished the night with six. Greig Thomas, Motherwell’s lively teenage substitute at half-time, threatened the briefest of revivals when he thumped a fine chance into the side-netting in 49 minutes from 16 yards. But it was an illusion. A false new dawn. Craig Gordon still toiled to stay warm as Celtic resumed normal service. Stefan Johansen – taken off with Motherwell’s Mark O’Brien after a clash of heads – struck the inside of the post with a stooping header from an Emilio Izaguirre cross to the back post in 58 minutes. Three minutes later the Honduran left-back achieved a staggering miss when he lashed a Leigh Griffiths squared ball against the face of the bar from six yards. Falling to the ground, slapping the turf, his disbelief was shared by many. In Lustig Celtic had one defender, at least, who had his eye in. He took his goals in some style as some key performers returned from injury a mere 10 days before an Old Firm game. Sheer coincidence of course.","Virgil van Dijk opened the scoring for the hosts in the 26th minute .

"Police were called to Manchester City's former training ground a staggering 31 times in five years. Sportsmail can reveal that on one occasion, a call was made when youths were spotted lurking with a javelin on the other side of a fence behind where the Premier League champions train. Other reports, made during the period of June 2009 to June 2014, included a man spotted urinating on a grass verge within the Carrington complex, an egg attack on reception and a group of Manchester United fans following the team bus back from a derby and hurling abuse. Police were called to Manchester City's former Carrington training ground 31 times in 5 years . A 999 call was made when youths were spotted lurking with a JAVELIN close to City's former training base .

And on another occasion a man wanted by police was arrested when he was found up a tree watching City train. According to a report obtained under Freedom of Information laws from Greater Manchester Police, the youths with 'a javelin-type instrument' were spotted 'mooning' CCTV cameras on May 3, 2012, days after City's 1-0 win over United put them on course for the title. It is one of a catalogue of bizarre callouts to the former base of Manuel Pellegrini's men who moved to the ultra-secure £200m City Football Academy last year. On another occasion,  a man wanted by police was found up a tree watching the club train at Carrington . Manchester City moved from Carrington to the ultra-secure £200m City Football Academy last year . In February 2011 police were called when men in a 4 x 4 followed the team bus after the Manchester derby in which Wayne Rooney scored his late overhead kick to give United a 2-1 win. They are reported to have driven into the complex 'causing annoyance and shouting abuse' and made their getaway before police arrived. Later that year a security guard was assaulted while in August 2012 police were called after football boots were stolen. In September 2012, police were called out to arrest the wanted man who presumably wanted to watch his heroes while on the run. He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of burglary. On two occasions police were called when footballs were taken from the former training ground which is a stone's throw away from that of rivals United in the south of the city.

In September 2009 officers turned up when concerns were raised over the welfare of a man at the site while in January of the following year police were called when an anti-Glazer protest took place outside the training ground. In 2012 the club's grounds staff were hit by the theft of tools and five lawnmowers while in 2013 a bag was stolen and police were called when security refused access to a solicitor who was trying to issue a court order to an unnamed player. Last year officers turned out twice to deal with 'parking issues'. Police received 13 calls to the Man United training complex during the period of June 2009 to June 2014 . Over on Merseyside for the same time period officers dealt with just four calls from the Finch Farm and Melwood training grounds of Everton and Liverpool.

The Frenchman said on Thursday: 'If you want to be the best league in the world then you have to accept that you have to produce the best players in the world, so the question is how can you produce the best players? 'If you put a young player with top-level players, he has more chance to develop. If you put him with average players he has more chance to remain average.' VIDEO Scroll down for Sam Allardyce rejects Arsene Wenger's calls scrap work permit rule . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce believes the work permit rule is needed to safeguard homegrown talent . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger missed out on signing Angel di Maria (right) due to the work permit rule . Wenger thinks that exposing English players to the best foreign talent could help aid their development . But Allardyce was quick to reject that view. 'I don't agree with that at all,' he said. 'There's already a massive influx of foreign youth coming to academies and us losing the opportunities for young British players to take up those places. 'That (abolishing the work permit rule) for me, as an Englishman, is a real no-no. I'm sure Arsene, if he was working in France, would have a similar opinion to me. 'Protect your own. We very rarely do it in this country and haven't done it up until now. 'We've got to do it somewhere along the line and get more British players through. 'If we open up the doors, the floodgates would open and there would be very, very few British players who would even get the chance at a football club.' Allardyce feels that more should be done to ensure more clubs' academy players progress to the first-team . West Ham's James Tomkins graduated from the club's academy and has made 201 senior appearances . The rules state a player must have featured in 75 per cent of his country's international matches over the last two years - with his country in the top 70 of FIFA's rankings - to qualify for a 'Governing Body Endorsement'. Should a player fail to meet those criteria, a club can request an appeal hearing to 'consider whether the player is able to contribute significantly to the development of the game at the top level in England'. West Ham's signing of Ecuador World Cup star Enner Valencia required an appeal, as did Leicester's recent acquisition of Croatian Andrej Kramaric. Wenger and Arsenal would also need to succeed in an appeal should they agree a deal for Villarreal's uncapped Brazilian centre-back Gabriel Paulista. 'I think the rules are fine at the moment,' Allardyce added. 'You can get a work permit if there is an exceptional talent and it can be proven.' Some of West Ham's foreign players, like Enner Valencia, required a work permit to play in England .","Sam Allardyce says English football needs the work permit rule .

"Eugenie Bouchard declared herself to be relaxed about the 'Twirlygate' controversy at the Australian Open, after she was asked to do a twirl by the on court interviewer following her second round. Last year's Wimbledon finalist laughed off the subsequent furore after defeating France's Caroline Garcia to make the last sixteen with a 7-6 6-0 victory. On court interviewer Ian Cohen has been accused of being 'truly sexist' by tennis great Billie Jean King and been taken to task by others. But the 20 year-old Canadian, while having a few reservations, chose to take a less serious approach to the issue. VIDEO Scroll down for Eugenie Bouchard: I'm fine to twirl if the guys flex their muscles . Eugenie Bouchard survived a tough first set to ease through the second and book her place in the last 16 . Bouchard celebrates as she ensured she would progress beyond the third round of yet another grand slam . She did, however, say that the men should be asked to do similar little stunts to make it a level playing field and tweeted a cartoon poking fun at the incident. 'I think it was just kind of funny,' she said. 'You know, I'm fine with being asked to twirl if they ask the guys to flex their muscles and stuff. My friends are texting me saying I dance and twirl well. 'Personally I'm not offended. I think it was an in-the-moment thing and it was funny. But it's just funny how it's taken a life of its own. I'm just going to try to focus on my tennis.' An Australian Open rarely goes by without some kind of incident arising from the broadcasters' insistence here that immediately after the match the interviewers try and raise a laugh for the crowd. Caroline Garcia gave Bouchard a run for her money in the first set but wilted somewhat in the second . Bouchard's fans watch as the Canadian made her way into the fourth round of the Australian Open . Bouchard is familiar with the pitfalls of these interviews. Last year she was asked who her dream date would be , and she responded ‘Justin Bieber’, for which the crowd roundly booed her. 'They try to ask funny questions. It's entertaining, I guess,' said Bouchard. ' I don't mind it. People can think what they want about it, but I just answer how I want and do what I want. I'm fine with it.' She did, though, express the wish that people would not overlook serious athletic talent and her achievement of making another Grand Slam fourth round. This is a big year for her after her breakthrough in 2014 and so far she has responded admirably. Garcia has plenty of ability and led in the first set. 'I'm happy that I've played three solid matches here,' said Bouchard. ' and we could definitely be a little bit more focused on that.'","Eugenie Bouchard was embroiled in a sexism row on Thursday .

"The verbal crossfire over the Severn Bridge began on Monday with Wales coach Warren Gatland tipping England to ‘kick the leather’ off the ball in their Six Nations opener at the Millennium Stadium. Gatland has a history of delivering spikey messages through the media and the barrel was half-loaded when he suggested that Stuart Lancaster’s side will go back to basics in Cardiff next month. Wales were able to name a relatively settled 34-man party at their squad announcement in the Vale of Glamorgan, where the Kiwi was keen to point out that England are still scratching heads over their ideal combinations. Wales coach Warren Gatland has tipped England to 'kick the leather off the ball' in their Six Nations opener . Gareth Anscombe (left), pictured in action for Cardiff Blues, has been called up to the Wales squad . Forwards: Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Paul James (Bath), Rob Evans (Scarlets), Aaron Jarvis (Ospreys), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Scott Andrews (Cardiff Blues), Richard Hibbard (Gloucester), Kristian Dacey (Cardiff Blues), Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Jake Ball (Scarlets), Bradley Davies (Wasps), Luke Charteris (Racing Metro), Dan Lydiate (Ospreys), James King (Ospreys), Sam Warburton (Cardiff Blues, capt), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). Backs: Mike Phillips (Racing Metro), Rhys Webb (Ospreys), Gareth Davies (Scarlets), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Gareth Anscombe (Cardiff Blues), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues), Jamie Roberts (Racing Metro), Jonathan Davies (Clermont Auvergne), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Tyler Morgan (Newport Gwent Dragons), Hallam Amos (Newport Gwent Dragons), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), George North (Northampton Saints), Liam Williams (Scarlets), Leigh Halfpenny (Toulon). ‘We are probably lucky in that we know where our selection is at,’ said Gatland. ‘I think England are still debating which way they go, particularly at 10 and the midfield; that’s going to determine the type of game they play coming into the World Cup. ‘They are not 100 per cent sure themselves whether they are going to play a nine or 10 man game, or more expansively. Teams are probably going to come and kick the leather off against us; we expect England to kick everything and we have got to be prepared for that.’ England’s last Six Nations visit to Cardiff was in 2013, when a 30-3 defeat blew their chances of a first Grand Slam since 2003 and allowed Wales to clinch the trophy in heart-breaking style. ‘It was probably a deep wound that’s taken a while to heal,’ said Gatland. ‘I’m interested to see if the roof is open or closed, because the atmosphere was pretty electric that night. They may decide to leave the roof open and try to dampen down the crowd. I hope they don’t close it and accept that challenge, but we’ll wait and see.’ Wales head coach Warren Gatland has named his 34-man squad for the RBS Six Nations . Prop Adam Jones has been left out of the Wales squad despite winning 95 caps for his country . As revealed by Sportsmail, Kiwi No 10 Gareth Anscombe was the most eye-catching inclusion at Gatland’s squad announcement. The 23-year-old, who won the 2011 Junior World Cup with New Zealand, moved to Wales in November and is eligible for selection through his Cardiff-born mother. He arrived with a glowing reference from former All Blacks assistant Wayne Smith, who coached the youngster at the Waikato Chiefs before his switch to Europe. Anscombe will compete with Dan Biggar and Bath-bound Rhys Priestland for the No 10 jersey, while Leicester youngster Owen Williams must wait a little longer for his opportunity. There had been suggestions that Williams would not be considered for selection because of his decision to sign a contract in England, however Gatland revealed the 22-year-old was still in contention before he was dropped for the Champions Cup tie against the Scarlets. ‘For me, the best way for Owen to develop as a 10 was to stay at Leicester and have couple of years there at a quality side,’ said Gatland. ‘I can understand Owen’s decision to stay at Leicester and he’s shown loyalty, which is good. It didn’t help him by not starting last week. It was a pretty important game to play in, but they decided to pick Freddie Burns. For me, if he had started and played well then it would have been much more of a debating point. ‘ . Anscombe, Tyler Morgan (above), Rob Evans and Kristian Dacey are among four rookies to be called up . Warren Gatland has allowed Anscombe the option of returning to New Zealand to hold out for the All Blacks . Williams looks like one for the future, while the omission of tight-head prop Adam Jones suggests that his international career is now consigned to the past. The 33-year-old has not played for Wales since the first summer Test in South Africa, where he was hauled off after 30 minutes because he lacked basic fitness. Gatland claims that the door is still, but the selection of Scott Andrews - who has not started a league match this season and played in the second row at the weekend - suggests that it is close to being slammed shut. Fitness is one of Gatland’s hottest subjects and his squad will be put through their paces when they convene in camp early next week. The 51-year-old has a decent idea of his strongest XV, but there have been suggestions of a shake up in the back-three, where stalwart winger George North could be named on the bench. North missed November’s victory over South Africa and Gatland said it would be ‘pretty hard’ to change that winning formula, which featured Liam Williams and Alex Cuthbert, who recently turned down a dual contract, on the wings. But ultimately it all boils down to the bigger picture of the World Cup. The Six Nations opener in Cardiff is a dress rehearsal for September’s Pool A match at Twickenham and, with detailed analysis carried out on opponents, Gatland is keen to keep a few tricks up his sleeve. ‘You don’t want to show your hand completely,’ he said. ‘We’ve got to keep something in our repertoire that’s a little bit different.’","Wales coach Warren Gatland has named his 34-man squad for the 2015 Six Nations, beginning with a tie against England at the Millenium Stadium .

"Ian Kirke is still in the dark over the reasons for his sudden departure from Leeds but insists he holds no grudges against his old club as he prepares to kick-start his career with Wakefield. The 34-year-old ex-York prop forward was looking forward to starting his 10th season with the Rhinos when he was told in November that his chances of regular football in 2015 were going to be limited. It left him with little time to find a new club but the Wildcats offered him a 12-month deal and he followed a well-trodden path from Headingley to Belle Vue. Leeds Rhinos's Ian Kirke is tackled by Huddersfield Giants' Michael Lawrence and Nathan Mason during a Super League match at The John Smiths Stadium, Huddersfield. 'I had a conversation in the middle of last season when I was definitely staying for this year but at the end of the year that changed,' Kirke said. 'I'm not too sure why. 'I think it's because they're bringing on the younger players. They've got to look to the future. I've got no bitter feelings towards them, other than perhaps it wasn't ideal timing for me because most clubs were settled by the time I got to find out. 'As it happens, Wakefield is good for me. I don't have to uproot myself and I know a few of the guys here.' Back rower Chris Clarkson had been given the same message a few months earlier and front rower Ryan Bailey was similarly told he was not part of Leeds coach Brian McDermott's plans for 2015. They moved on to Widnes (on a season-long loan) and Hull KR respectively and Kirke anticipated an influx of new blood to replenish the Rhinos' pack. However, Leeds' only close-season signing has been Australian prop Adam Cuthbertson, which has surprised Kirke. 'If it had been my choice, I would have stayed there until the bitter end but they said I would have limited opportunities so it was time to move on,' he added. 'Me and Bails (Bailey) got told at the same time. I was a little bit surprised. I assumed they would be signing some other people. That has not happened yet but (chief executive) Gary (Hetherington) has probably got something in his back pocket.' Huddersfield Giants' Larne Patrick is tackled by Leeds Rhinos' Luke Briscoe, Robbie Ward and Ian Kirke   during the First Utility match at The Headingley Stadium, Leeds . Kirke, who played for the Wildcats in the Boxing Day friendly at Leeds, still expects the Rhinos to be challenging for honours this year. 'I imagine they will do really well,' he said. 'I've got some great friends there and they've been doing some good stuff in training. I imagine they will be challenging at the top end of the top eight but I will just concentrate on what we're doing.' Wakefield are the bookmakers favourites to finish bottom but Kirke believes they can once more defy the pundits. 'The squad is looking good for this year,' he said. 'They've got Tim Smith back, who is a great half-back and actually pretty different to what I've played with before. 'He's pretty organised and he will help me because he tells you where you need to be on the pitch. Coming to a new team with new systems it helps me massively.' Kirke and fellow newcomer Matty Ashurst are still recovering from groin strains and will sit out Wakefield's game against Hull for Gareth Ellis's testimonial on Sunday.","Ian Kirke still unsure over reasons for his sudden Leeds departure .

"For a manager who arrived at White Hart Lane with a reputation for shunning knockout competitions, it now appears that Mauricio Pochettino has finally discovered the magic of the FA Cup. When Pochettino took over at Tottenham last summer, he was reportedly told by his employers to take the cups seriously, after using the games to rest several first team members at Southampton. But what perhaps Daniel Levy and Co did not envisage was the Argentine coach plotting a trip to the recording studio should Spurs reach the FA Cup final, following in the footsteps of Tottenham's 1981 cup hero Ossie Ardiles. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has not ruled out making an FA Cup final song if Spurs get there . Ossie Ardiles pictured singing his solo line in Tottenham's FA Cup final song . Ardiles (left) and team-mate Ricky Villa pose outside Wembley before the 1981 FA Cup final . Ardiles (right) holds the cup aloft alongside Tottenham team-mate Steve Perryman . Ardiles and his team-mates recorded the infamous Ossie's Dream with Chas and Dave that year, with the song reaching No 5 in the charts as Spurs lifted the cup after beating Manchester City 3-2 in a replay. 'I know all about Ossie's Dream,' confessed Pochettino to The Sun. 'I have heard the song and even seen a video of it. 'Would I record a song with Chas and Dave if we get to the final this season? Maybe. Yes, why not?' Pochettino stopped short at saying he would be singing too much on any potential collaboration. 'I would let my staff sing because they have good voices and I don't!' Pochettino and his squad could team up with Chas and Dave to record a new version of the song . The Spurs manager wants to recreate the scenes of excitement shown in the FA Cup single . The song made it up to No 5 in the music charts and inspired the club to FA Cup glory . While Tottenham supporters will now undoubtedly be hoping to hear a team single ahead of a cup final, music lovers across the nation will be hoping Pochettino is not about to usher in a new era of football songs. It has become less of tradition in recent years, but still one responsible for tunes such as The Anfield Rap by Liverpool ahead of the 1988 FA Cup final and Move Move Move (The Red Tribe) by Manchester United ahead of their Cup triumph in 1996.

"Tattoos are traditionally used to decorate the skin, but now archaeologists believe skin etchings discovered on a 5,000-year-old mummy could have been intended as therapy. The marks found on Ötzi the iceman reveal that tattoos could have been used as a primitive form of acupuncture. The iceman's tattoos are largely seen on the parts of his body that endured wear-and-tear, causing archaeologists to liken the practice of tattooing to acupuncture, which is itself an ancient treatment for joint distress. While tattoos are traditionally used to decorate the skin, archaeologists believe skin etchings discovered on a 5,00-year-old mummy (pictured) could have been intended as therapy . Ötzi's body art is the only known example of real-life ancient tattoos and reveal how the marks were made in Copper Age Europe. Writing in the publication Archaeology, U.S. experts Jarrett A. Lobell and Eric A. Powell said Ötzi's body, which was almost perfectly preserved in ice, provides unique evidence of early medicine for archaeologists. They said Ötzi got his 50 tattoos - most of which are lines and crosses - by enduring a series of small incisions in his skin, which were then rubbed with charcoal to make the marks. The ice man's tattoos are largely seen on parts of the body that endured wear-and-tear, causing archaeologists to like the practice to acupuncture, which is itself an ancient treatment for joint distress . Radiological images of the tattooed areas of the mummy show degenerative areas under the tattoos that could have caused pain . 'Because they are all found on parts of . the body that show evidence of a lifetime of wear and tear - the ankles, . wrists, knees, Achilles tendon, and lower back, for example - it’s thought . that Ötzi’s tattoos were therapeutic, not decorative or symbolic,' they added. When the mummy was first studied, experts were shocked at Ötzi's tattooed skin as they had never seen real examples of Copper Age tattoos before. They were also surprised as it is popularly thought that acupuncture was invented more than 2,000 years later in Asia and the mummy's markings look like they have been made over joints under stress such as the ankles and wrists. Ötzi's tattoos are the only known examples of real-life ancient tattoos as all other examples are found in artwork at the time and reveal how the marks were made in Copper Age EuropeOtzi Iceman Tattoo . They wrote: 'Of . course we can't be absolutely sure why these tattoos were placed in . those locations. It's possible Ötzi's people believed those regions of . the body were spiritually significant. Still, it's very possible that . this was an early effort at acupuncture.' If this is the case, it would appear that the tattoos were not originally intended to be merely decorative or symbolic, but could have been used as a kind of medicine to treat ailments like rheumatism, and arthritis, which are also treated using acupuncture. A spokesman for the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology, told Mail Online:' It seems common opinion that the Iceman tattoos are not ornamental but therapeutic tattoos for pain relief. Ötzi got his 50 tattoos by enduring a series of small incisions in his skin, which were then rubbed with charcoal to make the marks. Most of Otzi's tattoos are lines (pictured) and crosses found on major joints of his body. The mummy is specially illuminated here to show the tattoos clearly . 'Radiological images of the tattooed areas show degenerative areas under the tattoos that could have caused pain. 'As the tattooing spots lie approximately over the acupuncture medians, it seems common opinion that they could have been use for that.' Professor Frank Rühli, head of the Centre for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich, told Mail Online the tattoos were probably a combination of decorative art and therapy. Archaeologists believe that judging by the clothing, tools and weapons found with the mummy fozen in the Alps on the Austrian, Italian border two decades ago, Ötzi was a herder or a chieftain in Copper Age Europe . He said that while there might be a connection to suggest the tattoos functioned as a form of ancient acupuncture, it is difficult to see which ailments the mummy suffered from, so an indication of the marks being therapeutic is 'likely' but cannot be proven as there are not a number of similar bodies to study, found in the same location that are the same age. The spokesman for the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology said that if indeed the tattoos were created as a form of acupuncture, 'people of the Iceman's times would have known not only about nature around them, but also about the human body and its reactions - I think this is remarkable.' While the reasons for creating the tattoos may not be agreed upon, archaeologists believe that judging by the clothing, tools and weapons found with the mummy frozen in the Alps on the Austrian, Italian border two decades ago, Ötzi was a herder or a chieftain in Copper Age Europe. it would appear that the tattoos were not originally intended to be merely decorative or symbolic, but could have been sued as a kind of medicine to treat ailments like rheumatism, and arthritis, which are also treated using acupuncture . DNA analysis has revealed details of the iceman's life . The 5,300-year-old 'ice mummy' known . as Ötzi suffered from the world's first-known case of Lyme disease, a . bacterial parasite spread by ticks, according to new DNA analysis. Ötzi, . who was 46 at the time of his death and measured 5ft2, also had brown . eyes, had relatives in Sardinia, and was lactose intolerant. Ötzi was also predisposed to heart disease. The . new research focused on the DNA in the nuclei of Ötzi's cells, and . could yield further insights into the famous 'ice mummy's life. He was unearthed in September 1991 by a couple of German tourists trekking through the Oetz Valley, after which he was named. The iceman has been crucial to our understanding of how prehistoric people lived, what they wore and even what they ate.

"The Alabama attorney general is asking a federal judge to stay a ruling that overturned Alabama's ban on gay marriage, as advocates cheer what once seemed an improbable victory in the deeply conservative state. Attorney General Luther Strange's office asked a federal judge on Friday to put the ruling on hold since the U.S. Supreme Court plans to take up the issue of gay marriage this term, 'resolving the issues on a nation-wide basis.' U.S. District Callie V.S. Granade on Friday said Alabama's ban was unconstitutional, ruling in favor of two Mobile women who sued to challenge Alabama's refusal to recognize their 2008 marriage performed in California. The ruling is the latest in a string of wins in the South for advocates of gay marriage rights after judges struck down bans in the Carolinas, Florida, Mississippi and Virginia. The U.S. Supreme Court announced this month that it will take up the issue of whether gay couples have a fundamental right to marry and if states can ban such unions. Cari Searcy, left, and Kim McKeand pose for a portrait with their son Khaya. Alabama became the latest state to see its ban on gay marriage fall to a federal court ruling, as the issue of same-sex marriage heads to the U.S. Supreme Court. The judge ruled in favor of the couple who sued to challenge Alabama's refusal to recognize their 2008 marriage performed in California . Alabama plaintiffs Cari Searcy and Kimberly McKeand have been a couple for more than 15 years and have a son together who was conceived with the help of a sperm donor. They filed a federal lawsuit after courts refused to let Searcy be recognized as the adoptive parent of the boy because they were not spouses under Alabama law. 'We just want our son to have the same protections that every child in Alabama enjoys and now he can!' the couple said in a statement issued Saturday morning. David Kennedy, a lawyer for the couple said, 'Justice and equality are guaranteed to everyone and we are proud to know that is true in Alabama tonight.' The judge's decision Friday reverberated through the Deep South state where 81 percent of state voters in 2006 approved inserting a ban on gay marriage into the Alabama Constitution. 'It is outrageous when a single unelected and unaccountable federal judge can overturn the will of millions of Alabamians who stand in firm support of the Sanctity of Marriage Act,' Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard said. A spokeswoman for Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley said the governor was disappointed in the decision and said the state is reviewing the decision to decide the next steps. 'The people of Alabama voted in a constitutional amendment to define marriage between a man and a woman,' Bentley Communications Director Jennifer Ardis said. Advocates of gay marriage cheered what they called a historic victory in a state traditionally hostile to gay activism. Ben Cooper, chairman of Equality Alabama, said, 'We expect and hope that the attorney general will uphold the decision to recognize same-sex marriage. These laws are irrational and finally have come to the forefront of this debate thanks to brave women like Cari Searcy and Kimberly McKeand.' Alabama asked the judge to stay the order until the U.S. Supreme Court decides the issue on a national basis. Lesbian and gay couples were married in Miami earlier this month by the same judge who said she saw no reason why they couldn't immediately get their licenses ahead of Florida's coming-out party . In seeking a stay, state lawyers argued there would be widespread confusion if 'marriages are recognized on an interim basis.' 'A stay will serve the public interest by avoiding the confusion and inconsistency that will result from an on-again, off-again enforcement of marriage laws,' state lawyers wrote. Granade enjoined Strange from enforcing the state's same-sex marriage bans, raising the question of what happens next. Lawyers for Searcy and McKeand said the couple plan to refile their adoption paperwork next week and believe same-sex couples can begin to wed in the state as early as Monday. David Dinielli, deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center LGBT Rights Project, said in his personal view, couples should be able to seek marriage licenses when the doors of the county clerks' offices open Monday. However, he said it will likely take much more litigation for that to happen. Alabama has two laws banning gay marriage, a state statute and a constitutional amendment called the 'Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment' that was approved by voters in 2006. Granade said both were in violation of the equal-protection and due-process clauses of the U.S. Constitution. Granade rejected arguments from Alabama that the state had an interest in promoting marriage between men and women for the benefit of children. She said the state does not ban marriage for couples who are infertile, elderly, or want to remain childless, and she said children of gay couples are equally deserving of protection under the law.

Eric Menzer, who is part of arena's management team, says that it is unusual for the glass that surrounds the rink to break. However, the man struck the panel with his metal wedding ring which resulted in a 'very concentrated impact'. Rachel Cunningham, who claims to know the hockey dad, described him as a 'very nice husband, father and friend.' She says he feels 'horrible' for his actions but he felt he had to stand up for his daughter who had been knocked down by an opponent on the ice.

"Brooke Tsakirakis with her fiance Nick Emery, who demanded £35,000 from England captain Eoin Morgan to prevent release of sexual messages . The Australian woman at the heart of a blackmail plot against the England cricket captain said she was ‘ropeable angry’ as she broke her silence last night. Brooke Tsakirakis, 36, made the remark, which means angry to the point of having to be restrained, as she revealed she has ditched her fiance following the scandal. Nick Emery, a safety consultant from Tasmania, demanded £35,000 from England captain Eoin Morgan to prevent the release of sexual messages and videos of Morgan with Miss Tsakirakis from five years ago. Emery claimed the pair had been in recent contact, although Morgan is in a three-year relationship with Australian Tara Ridgway – who is said to be fully backing him. Last night Miss Tsakirakis, a mother of two, strenuously denied being in touch with the new one-day captain and insisted both had been single when they had an affair. The England Cricket Board (ECB) called in Scotland Yard detectives last Wednesday after Emery emailed his demands. He was quickly tracked and the ECB decided not to press charges, but details of the scandal emerged the night before England’s match in Hobart, Tasmania. ‘I don’t want to air mine and Nick’s dirty laundry but I’m gutted,’ a tearful Miss Tsakirakis told the Australian press. ‘I’m ropeable angry. I’m furious but I don’t think right now that anger towards him is worth wasting my energy on because I have to protect my children. They are my first priority.’ ‘Ropeable’ is an Australian slang term dating from the 19th century, thought to have originally been used to refer to horses.

She added: ‘Some of it may have been romantic or sexually explicit, but it was nothing more than what any two people who are consenting adults independent of anyone else might say to each other. ‘What upsets me the most are the reports in the media that Nick has said he had evidence of contact between me and Eoin in the last 12 months. I deny that completely. I have never been in contact with Eoin while I’ve been in a relationship with Nick. Well, Nick and I don’t have a relationship any longer.’ Morgan claimed the issue had not affected him but was bowled out first ball – a golden duck – against Australia last Friday. Miss Tsakirakis added: ‘I feel for Eoin and his partner because we are all innocent parties. I don’t even want to be vindictive about Nick but I’m not going to take responsibility for his actions.’","Brooke Tsakirakis, 36, used term 'ropeable angry' as she broke silence .

"Mauricio Pochettino has called on Tottenham fans to stop booing Emmanuel Adebayor. The forward was barracked on being substituted in the Capital One Cup semi-final victory over Sheffield United in midweek. Adebayor had previously incurred the wrath of the White Hart Lane faithful for claiming earlier in the season that the players preferred away games because of a perceived lack of support at home and will be included in the squad for Saturday's FA Cup fourth round tie at home to Leicester City. Emmanuel Adebayor returned to Tottenham last weekend, but was booed by some Spurs fans . Adebayor received a tough reaction from the White Hart Lane crowd when he left the pitch in the FA Cup . Asked whether he feared the poisonous atmosphere could drive Adebayor away from the club, head coach Pochettino admitted that was the case. 'Yes, but we need to change that,' he said. 'We need to give our supporters good performances and good victories to create a better atmosphere. This is our way. 'We have the opportunity to offer our supporters another victory and change their feelings about us.' Tottenham have a reputation for being a successful cup side, and Pochettino is also planning ahead for the resumption of the Europa League next month. And he revealed that fellow Argentinian Osvaldo Ardiles, a FA Cup winner with Tottenham in 1981 and 1982 and now an ambassador for the club, had given him a helpful history lesson. 'He explained to me how important it is for the supporters and the club to get to finals,' he said. 'That is what we are fighting for - to get the victory against Sheffield United on Wednesday and to get past Leicester.' So is Pochettino prepared to emulate Ardiles, who sang in wobbly English in the song for the 1981 final 'Ossie's Dream', which included the lines 'Ossie's going to Wembley, his knees have gone all trembly'? 'I am not a very good singer,' he said. 'But my knees are strong.' He captained Mauricio Pochettino's side against Sheffield United after being away for nine weeks . Pochettio says the fans need to be behind the team in order for them to be successful .","Emmanuel Adebayor captained Tottenham against Sheffield United .

"Celtic defender Mikael Lustig feels they are hitting form and fitness at the perfect time as they prepare for some momentous cup ties and respond to a title challenge. With Celtic and Aberdeen vying for top spot in the Scottish Premiership, Lustig helped his team to a third consecutive win by scoring a double in a 4-0 win over Motherwell on Wednesday night. The Swede came within inches of a second-half hat-trick when he hit the bar in the closing stages as he marked his comeback from a two-month injury lay-off in some style. Mikael Lustig (left) believes his Celtic team are hitting form at the right time of the season . The 28-year-old is looking for more action when Celtic face Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday in their final game before the eagerly-awaited QTS Scottish League Cup semi-final against Rangers. 'Hopefully I can stay fit now but of course we know we have a lot of important games and fun games coming up in February,' he said. 'The Rangers game of course is a massive game but also the cup game against Inter Milan is going to be big as well. 'You always want to play in the big games so all the players will want to be part of that.' James Forrest (right) is, like Lusting, recovering from injury and hopes to be in the first team soon . Aberdeen recently matched Celtic's earlier eight-match winning league run, which has jolted Celtic into action in recent weeks. And with the likes of James Forrest joining Lustig in overcoming injury, and a rejuvenated Leigh Griffiths regaining his place in the team, the Swede feels they have the resources to meet the demands of competing on four fronts. 'We need to be focused on every game now,' Lustig said. 'Aberdeen have done really well and if they keep winning we need to win as well. 'We are going to need all the players now and we need to be ready when we are out there.' Celtic have scored eight goals without reply in their three games in 2015 and Lustig believes they are showing they have adapted to the tactics of manager Ronny Deila following a difficult opening few months for the Norwegian boss. Lustig believes the team took a while to learn the way of playing that new coach Ronny Deila implemented . 'We can still manage to do things better but we always had a feeling we were heading in the right direction,' the Sweden international said. 'We are getting there. 'When you change manager, it's another way to play and the best way to get better is to play games. 'You know you are going to have some games where you don't look good and you maybe feel a bit lost, but most of the players know how to play the game now and how to work as a team. I think we will be there soon.'","Celtic lead the Scottish Premiership, but are only a point above Aberdeen .

"Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan said he had wed former BBC weather presenter  Reham Khan just days after his family said he had denied it - provoking a furious reaction from his sister. The 62-year-old World Cup winner who is now a politician in his home country has married the 41-year-old divorced mother-of-three. On New Year's Eve, Khan said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated' and his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it. Scroll down for video . Pakistan cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan (left), 62, has married broadcaster Reham Khan (right) Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV . Speaking to reporters at Heathrow airport on Monday night before boarding a flight, Khan is reported to have said: ‘I am going to Pakistan to share good news about my marriage with the nation. I have nothing to hide.’ Told by MailOnline that her brother had revealed he was actually married, Aleema Khan said: ‘Really? Really? Let’s see if he announces it officially. I am taken aback. Denial: Imran Khan's sister Aleema said the family had a showdown with the politician and he denied the secret marriage . 'This is a real challenge for him. We haven’t met her and I don’t know that we want to meet her. ‘It is his decision, he is a grown up. It is more important how the children feel. I suppose in any situation like this the children will not feel good about it. They do look up to their father.' Speaking amid a political storm surrounding rumours of the marriage, she said she hoped Reham Khan 'will be good for Pakistan and our brother'. She added: 'It all depends on how the public respond to it. The biggest surprise is how everybody in Pakistan feels they have a right to participate in the decision. 'He is a grown man, we are watching the situation unfold.’ The Daily Mail’s diarist Sebastian Shakespeare broke the news of Khan’s marriage to the broadcaster last week. Khan’s new wife - he divorced  heiress Jemima Goldsmith in 2004 - lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on the BBC regional news programme South Today. Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. It is believed family members and those in his political party tried talking him out of the marriage. Imran Khan arrives at Heathrow Airport last week when, at the time, he said rumours he had married were 'greatly exaggerated' Online abusers also set up Facebook hate pages attacking the TV news anchor. News of the  union sparked outrage in Pakistan and trolls have now accused Ms Khan of being a lesbian for stroking a woman's back, and attempted to shame her for going to parties. Users have criticised her for wearing short skirts, lambasted her for dancing with unknown men in public, and branded her daughter a 'pornstar' while claiming to be in possession of topless pictures. One image even claims to show Ms Khan in a sex shop in the UK wearing a pink nightdress, with a collar around her neck and a whip slung over her shoulder. Mr Khan's sister Aleema earlier branded the reports of marriage lies, saying they had been concocted by Mr Khan's political enemies to damage his reputation. Hate groups have already sprung up on Facebook where users have been sharing photos of her dancing and going out with friends while making abusive comments . Among the images posted by online abusers was this photograph, which they claim shows Ms Khan in a sex shop, wearing a night dress, suspenders, a collar and with a whip over her shoulder . Online trolls have attacked Ms Khan for her appearance, dancing with unknown men, and attending parties . She told MailOnline: ‘This is the only way the opposition know how to attack him. These are the tactics they would stoop to. It’s out of control. I guess that is politics. ‘I spoke to my brother a few days ago and he said it isn’t true. 'We, the family, just asked him outright, have you married her? And he said no. I don’t know if they are in a relationship, here [in Pakistan] you are either getting married or you are not. ‘We’d be extremely happy if he marries a good person and settles down, of course we would. But it is not just his consideration, it’s a consideration for the country, it’s like a national-level decision. 'There are people in Pakistan who love him so much that everyone wants to participate in his private life, they feel he is their leader and should be part of his decision. ‘Everybody [we, the family] are taken aback at how much other people want to participate in this decision.’ Asked if her brother is in a secret relationship with the TV broadcaster, she said: ‘It’s a confusing signal to everyone who follows him [but] we asked him if he was married and he said no. I don’t know if he is in a relationship. We just asked him if he was married.’ Reaction to the rumoured marriage had been very negative in Pakistan and there has been a backlash on social media. Photos of Reham in revealing clothes and a video of her doing a tango while working for the BBC are prompting insulting comments in the conservative Islamic country.

The 41-year-old lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on BBC regional news programme South Today . Khan with the 'Sportsman of the Century' award . Imran's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname ‘Khan’ and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: ‘My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it’s probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.’ Imran married Ms Goldsmith in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris in 1995. She had converted to Islam prior to their wedding and had learned Urdu and started to wear traditional Pakistani clothes. Imran Khan is Pakistan's most successful cricket captain and led his country to World Cup victory in 1992 after being begged to come out of retirement. Khan, then aged 39, top scored in the final win over England with 72 runs. In 2010, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.

"Cruzeiro have agreed to sell defensive midfielder Lucas Silva to Real Madrid, the Brazilian champions confirmed on Thursday. Spanish sports newspaper Marca had earlier claimed that Real have reached an agreement with Cruzeiro to sign the Brazilian starlet for a reported 15million euros (£11.5m). Lucas Silva (left) looks set to choose the Bernabeu after nearing a January move to Real Madrid . The 21-year-old has been linked with a host of Premier League sides - including Arsenal - during the last few months. He is considered to be one of Brazil's most promising young players and has represented his country at junior level. 'We have been in touch with Real Madrid since last year and we're now discussing a fee,' Cruzeiro's director of football Valdir Barbosa told ESPN radio. 'I think a deal should be complete by the start of next week.' The Cruzeiro defensive midfielder has reportedly agreed to join Los Blancos for a fee of £11.5m . Silva was released from training on Thursday to have a medical with the European champions. His arrival could prompt the departure of Asier Illarramendi who is believed to be a target for Real's struggling La Liga rivals Athletic Bilbao.

The 22-year-old Brazilian's current deal runs to 2018 but talks have been ongoing and are drawing to a conclusion. Coutinho signed from Inter Milan for £8.5m in 2013 and manager Brendan Rodgers has been determined to build a side around his mercurial midfielder. Liverpool are keen to tie Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho down to a new long-term contract . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has been pleased with Coutinho's recent performances . Coutinho, pictured playing against Chelsea in midweek, has scored two goals for Liverpool so far this season . Rodgers heaped praise upon the boy from Rio de Janeiro for his performance against Chelsea in Tuesday night's Capital One Cup semi-final draw. 'He was outstanding the other night,' the Liverpool boss said. 'It was a difficult start to the season for him because if you think of Phil Coutinho, he has that bit of magic to make the key pass in the final third and combines with people ahead of him so well. 'Last year he had a [Luis] Suarez and a [Daniel] Sturridge to make those passes to and he could work well with their style. 'At the beginning of this season, he didn't have that. Probably until six or seven weeks ago, his ability to make that threaded pass through wasn't on because he didn't have that [energy and movement upfront].' The change in system for Liverpool has returned Coutinho to his role behind the striker and Rodgers added: 'We had to look at how to bring out the best in all our players, and once he's had mobility, energy and speed around him, it's lifted his game. 'He's a class act, and he's still got so much growth and development to undertake here.' Rodgers believes Coutinho has grown into a 'class act' after struggling during the early stages of the season .","Philippe Coutinho is expected to sign a new four-and-a-half year deal .

"The Iraqi government policemen and soldiers in Mosul abandoned their weapons and uniforms with barely a fight against the army of black-clad killers from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) terror group. The gunmen quickly laid their hands on a mass of abandoned U.S. military equipment to add to their massive arsenal, ranging from Humvee vehicles to night-sights and body armour. Among the first acts of this ruthless force of Islamic militants was to liberate 2,500 prisoners from two jails - many of them terrorists who immediately joined their ranks. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Masked ISIL gunmen gather in the Iraq desert . Meanwhile, ISIL terrorists are also on the verge of taking Iraq’s largest oil refinery in the town of Baiji, 130 miles north of Baghdad and have taken Saddam’s hometown of Tikrit, too. The evening before, ISIL chiefs phoned Baiji’s sheiks, and told them to warn policemen and soldiers to lay down their arms or be killed. They meekly complied. Who are ISIL and why do they inspire such fear? Could they really, as serious commentators and political leaders suggest, threaten not only the entire stability of the Middle East but also bring a new reign of jihadist terror to the West? One thing is certain: this formidable army is a very different beast to the Iraqi branch of Al Qaeda from which it originated and which fought the U.S. and the Iraqi government from the 2003 invasion until American troops left in 2011. ISIL fanatics are hardline followers of the Sunni Muslim creed. They despise Iraq’s leadership - as well as the majority of the country’s population - who follow the Shia version of the faith. This Sunni/Shia divide has been a source of violence across the Middle East since the 7th century. It was kept in check by brutal dictators such as Saddam Hussein, Colonel Gaddafi and President Assad. Extreme: The fighters were once part of al-Qaeda, which has cut ties with the group. They have now taken control of Saddam Hussein's home town . Tensions: The Isis fighters are from the Sunni branch of Islam - as was Saddam Hussein - in contrast to the current Shia government . But their . removal - attempted in the case of Syria’s Assad - by gung-ho Western . leaders such as Tony Blair and George W. Bush has re-ignited the bitter . hatred with terrifying fervour. And ISIL is the living embodiment of . that hatred. The . sectarian civil war in Syria has been the terror group’s biggest asset. In the past they would have been crushed ruthlessly by Assad’s forces, . but during the past two years, the war has enabled them to train and . shelter militants in the increasingly ungoverned areas between Syria and . Iraq. The group originated in Iraq and incorporated the Levant (Syria) into its name two years ago to reflect its spearheading of the fight against Assad. Later, it fell out with the Al Qaeda leadership in Afghanistan - and redefined itself to become a far more lethal and powerful army than ever operated against Western troops in Iraq, eclipsing Al Qaeda. Today, it effectively governs a nation-sized area stretching over north and west Iraq and Syria. ‘This is a force that is ideologically motivated, battle-hardened and incredibly well-equipped,’ explains Douglas Ollivant, of the New America Foundation, who advised the Obama and Bush administrations on Iraq and served two tours of duty there. ‘It also runs the equivalent of a state. It has all the trappings of a state, just not an internationally recognised one.’ Territory: The above map shows the areas of Iraq and Syria currently controlled by Isis forces . Whereas Al Qaeda concentrated on counter-insurgency, ISIL transformed itself into a full-blooded army with thousands of fighting men to call on. ‘Al Qaeda in Iraq didn’t really fight the Americans,’ explains Ollivant. ‘They were great bomb-makers and kidnappers, but if caught in a firefight, they would probably get killed because they weren’t good line-infantry,’ he said. ‘Now that has been fixed.’ The U.S. congratulated itself on beating Al Qaeda in Iraq before it withdrew its troops in 2011 and handed power to the Baghdad government, dispersing $14billion of military aid to the Iraqi army. But since then, Iraqi jihadists under the control of ISIL have won control of key towns, such as Fallujah, Ramadi, Samara - and now Mosul - while carrying out suicide bomb attacks in Baghdad that are causing 1,000 fatalities a month. Within those areas it has conquered, it is imposing a vicious form of hardline Islamic sharia law, which has involved crucifixion of ‘spies’, as well as beheadings  and amputations. Violent and mysterious: This undated photograph is one of only a few in existence showing Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of Isis . The transformation of ISIL came about under the command of a shadowy 42-year-old ex-preacher called Abu Bakr al Baghdadi - who was captured in southern Iraq in 2005 after being identified as  Al Qaeda’s point man in a flyblown town in Iraq’s western desert. According to a Pentagon document, he was ‘connected to the intimidation, torture and murder of civilians,’ as well as publicly executing ‘entire families’. Astonishingly, he was released in 2009, possibly because of some amnesty agreement or through confusion - his name is a nom de guerre used by several people. ‘We either arrested or killed a man of that name about half a dozen times,’ explained Lieutenant-General Sir Graeme Lamb, a former British special forces commander who fought Al Qaeda in Iraq. Today, with a $10million bounty on his head, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi wears masks and avoids being photographed - the only image of him is a U.S. prison mugshot of a thickset man with cropped hair. ISIL became the richest terror group ever yesterday after stealing £256 million from Mosul’s central bank. Funding also comes from shadowy opponents of President Assad’s regime, and it extorts more than £600,000 each month from the prosperous citizens of cities such as Mosul, where it has long been a covert presence. In the meantime, it has been recruiting foreign fighters for the war in Syria. Some 12,000 have flocked to fight in Syria from as far away as Chechnya, China and Pakistan - 3,000 of these foreign volunteers are Westerners, including an estimated 400 Britons. ISIL’s aim is to create a Taliban-style caliphate, where political and religious leadership are fused, in Iraq and Syria, countries which it considers meaningless colonial constructs. In order to achieve its vision, the terror group is not only simultaneously fighting Assad and the Iraqi regime of PM Nouri al-Maliki, but also other Syrian rebel groups that object to its appalling brutality - brutality that has proved even too much for Al Qaeda. In addition, to the deep concern of Western governments, ISIL is encouraging its foreign fighters to commit atrocities in their home countries - particularly if these countries intervene in this conflict. Earlier this month, a Frenchman who spent more than a year fighting in Syria was detained after three people were shot dead and another critically wounded outside a synagogue in Brussels. He was carrying a Kalashnikov automatic rifle, a handgun, a 40-second film in which he appears to claim responsibility for the shootings - as well as an ISIL banner. Carnage: Isis fighters devastated Mosul, to the north of the country, on Monday. Pictured is a member of the Iraqi security forced gunned down by the militants . Strewn: Uniforms though to belong to Iraqi soldiers were seen scattered on the road in Mosul - Iraq's second city - in this smartphone image from the conflict . It can only be a matter of time before a Briton, indoctrinated in Syria by ISIL, tries to launch a terror attack here. Can anything be done to defeat this monstrous army? Certainly, we can’t rely on the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, a dour, joyless figure who failed to win a majority in Iraq’s elections this April, and will not have a ruling coalition for months. His regime is not only at loggerheads with Iraq’s Sunni Muslims - who see him as a puppet of Iran’s Shia regime - but also with  the ethnic Kurds in the north of Iraq, who enjoy all the trappings of independence and are in dispute with al-Maliki over the country’s oil wealth. The Kurds’ own ferocious 250,000-strong peshmerga militia could probably make mincemeat of the jihadis, but they refuse to help unless Maliki meets their demands on oil revenue. The result is that we are rapidly advancing to the point where Iraq disintegrates into three separate states, with the Kurds demanding full independence, ISIL establishing its own territory in the north and west, and Iraq’s Shia population settling for the rest of the country. This would destabilise the whole region, compounding existing refugee problems and inflaming the Sunni/Shia conflict. It is also what the West has desperately tried to stop happening for the past decade - but the cost in the blood of British, American and other countries’ soldiers means no Western leader will countenance sending troops back into Iraq.","Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) rules nation-sized swathe of land .

"The 85 richest people in the world now have as much money as the 3.5billion poorest put together. The combined wealth of people including Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and the Koch Brothers has increased to £1trillion. And the top one per cent of earners are worth £67.3trillion - almost half (46 per cent) of the world's wealth, according to a report by Oxfam. Surge: Warren Buffet (left) and Bill Gates are among the 85 whose wealth equals the 3.5billion poorest . Critics claim the surge in inequality has been driven by 'power grabbing' wealthy elites who harbour close relationships with leading politicians. Winnie Byanyima, chief executive of Oxfam, said: 'It is staggering that in the 21st century, half of the world’s population - that’s three and a half billion people - own no more than a tiny elite whose numbers could all fit comfortably on a double-decker bus. She added: 'In too many countries economic growth already amounts to little more than a ‘winner takes all’ windfall for the richest.' The world now has 1,426 billionaires with a combined wealth of £3.3trillion, and 12million millionaires, the report found. Carlos Slim Helu, head of Telecom, is the richest man in the world. L'Oreal's Lilian Bettencourt is also on the list . The number of US millionaires has increased to 3.7million - up 11.5 per cent on last year - while the UK has an estimated 345,271 net millionaire households - up 12.6 per cent. The findings come as David Cameron and other world leaders fly to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economics Forum, attended by some of the most influential businesses. 1. Carlos Slim Helu (Telecom) £44.6bn . 2. Bill Gates (Microsoft) £41bn . 3. Amancio Ortega (Zara) £34.8bn . 4. Warren Buffet (Berkshire Hathaway) £32.7bn . 5. Larry Ellison (Oracle) £26.3bn . 6. Charles Koch (Diversified) £20.8bn . 7. David Koch (Diversified) £20.8bn . 8. Li Ka-shing (Diversified) £19bn . 9. Lilian Bettencourt (L'Oreal) £18.3bn . 10. Bernard Arnault (LVMH) £17.7bn . Oxfam said the focus of the exclusive gathering – which includes more than 2,500 business leaders, heads of state and other powerful figures – must be the ‘extreme economic inequality’ which is ‘undermining social stability and threatening global security’. Ms Byanyima said: 'We cannot hope to win the fight against poverty without tackling inequality. Widening inequality is creating a vicious circle where wealth and power are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, leaving the rest of us to fight over crumbs from the top table. 'In developed and developing countries alike we are increasingly living in a world where the lowest tax rates, the best health and education and the opportunity to influence are being given not just to the rich but also to their children. 'Without a concerted effort to tackle inequality, the cascade of privilege and of disadvantage will continue down the generations. We will soon live in a world where equality of opportunity is just a dream.' Since the late 1970s, tax rates for the richest have fallen in 29 out of 30 countries for which data are available, said the report. Opinion polls in Spain, Brazil, India, South Africa, the US, UK and Netherlands found that a majority in each country believe that wealthy people exert too much influence. Oxfam's report comes as David Cameron and other world leaders (pictured at the G8 summit) fly to Davos in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum . Concern was strongest in Spain, followed by Brazil and India and least marked in the Netherlands.

"The website set up to defend convicted rapist Ched Evans has been referred to the police over a complaint by his victim's father that the footballer's supporters have identified her. The Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC has also asked North Wales Police to look into whether evidence served during Evans' trial in 2012 has been dealt with 'properly'. In Britain all sex attack victims are granted anonymity and it is a criminal offence to name them. But the woman raped by Evans has been forced to change her name and move for a fifth time after being hunted down by vile internet trolls. New twist: A website set up to support Ched Evans, pictured with his fiancée Natasha Massey, will be investigated by police and prosecutors after a complaint it helps identify his victim . Footballer Evans was released from prison last year after serving two-and-a-half years for the rape of a 19-year-old woman in a hotel, but continues to protest his innocence. Much of his defence is contained on his website, but there are claims that some of its content is in contempt of court. A spokeswoman for the Attorney General said: 'The Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC MP, has asked the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether any criminal offences may have been committed in regards to identifying the victim in the Ched Evans case. 'He has also asked the North Wales police to investigate whether some of the material served during the course of the proceedings has been dealt with properly. 'If not, this may constitute a contempt of court. 'Given that there is now the possibility of proceedings being brought, it is very important that there is no comment in the media which might jeopardise either the investigation or any subsequent proceedings. Since Evans’ conviction, his victim, who has a legal right to anonymity for life, has moved home five times as online trolls repeatedly tracked her down and revealed her new identity. She was first given a new identity in 2012 when her name was circulated on social media at the end of the court case. Nine people were later each ordered by court to pay the victim £624 in one of the first cases of its kind. A number of football clubs were confronted with public outcry after showing interest in the former Wales and Sheffield United player as he attempted to restart his career. The former striker was released from prison last year after being found guilty of raping a drunk woman in a hotel in Wales in 2011 . After a deal with Oldham Athletic collapsed earlier this month following a public petition, he released a statement condemning the online abuse of his victim. The 26-year-old, who is still on licence, said: “Whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned. “Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so.” Evans’s supporters have mounted a vigorous campaign to overturn his conviction, including setting up a website detailing what they say are the flaws in the case against him. The appeal against Evans’s conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012 and the case is currently being considered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.","Attorney General asks police and prosecutors to probe  Evans' website .

"Demarai Gray should only leave Birmingham City for a team challenging the Champions League places, Gary Rowett believes. Birmingham have rejected three bids from Championship rivals Bournemouth – the latest of £3million rising to £3.5m in add-ons – and top-flight clubs are interested. ‘He’s a fantastic talent,’ said Rowett. ‘I think he’s best served being here until an opportunity comes his way that is befitting of his talent. For me at the moment it’s only probably a top four team that can do that. That’s not being disrespectful to anyone else.’ Demarai Gray of Birmingham City in action against West Brom in their FA Cup clash . Gary Rowett (right) greets his player after they were defeated 2-1 by the Baggies in the fourth round . A report on Sky Sports News suggested Gray was inclined to leave the club, but Rowett insisted that desire had never been communicated to him. Gray began Birmingham’s 2-1 FA Cup defeat to West Bromwich Albion on the bench but was sent on with 20 minutes to go to provide a genuine spark. He brought two fine saves from Ben Foster with driven shots – one from long range – and would only have enhanced his reputation. Explaining his decision to omit Gray from the starting line-up, Rowett said: ‘One of the biggest things, this was before the morning’s comment on TV, I just felt it has been a big month for him. Saido Berahino congratulates two-goal hero Victor Anichebe (right) during their win over Birmingham . ‘A lot of speculation, a big game, and I wondered whether it might be a little bit too much for an 18 year old.

He’s our player, I hope he stays. ‘I’m not too worried about any speculation. I prefer to concentrate on his performance when he came on.

"Kenneth Bolton, 44, stole £750 he raised for a hospice that provides care for sick babies avoided jail following a trial at Hartlepool Magistrates' Court . A former professional footballer who stole £750 he raised for a hospice that provides care to babies with life-threatening conditions has avoided jail. Kenneth Bolton, who played for Middlesbrough FC at youth level, was the manager of Golden Flatt's Under 11s football team in Hartlepool when he asked players' parents and supporters to sponsor him for a charity coast to coast bike ride. Bolton, 44, said he was going to carry out the challenge for Zoe's Place, a hospice for sick babies in Hartlepool that relies on public donations to perform its work. Hartlepool Magistrates' Court heard he printed out unauthorised sponsorship forms and collected £752 in sponsorship. But the father-of-two was caught out when football club officials notified police of another matter - that they had given money to Bolton to buy football kits for the children which had not materialised. They uncovered his fraudulent behaviour and Bolton pleaded guilty to theft on August 30 last year. Chairman of the magistrates' bench Barbara Sutherland sentenced Bolton to eight weeks in custody suspended for 12 months, ordered him to carry out 160 hours of unpaid work and to pay £752 compensation to Zoe's Place. The court was told Bolton, a physio, began stealing money when his family fell on hard times which saw their income halved. Blair Martin, for the prosecution, said: 'Zoe's Place had no knowledge of the defendant and had not given him any sponsor forms. 'He said he had recovered the sponsorship money, which he was going to give to charity but fell on hard times financially and spent it.' In mitigation, Bolton's solicitor Stuart Haywood, said he was 'appalled, ashamed, and remorseful' for his actions. He said: 'You have to ask yourself why a man who has no previous convictions other than one when he was in the Army in 1997, would stoop to such depths. 'Mr Bolton was a man who was previously on the books at Middlesbrough Football Club and when he was released by them he immediately joined the Army and was successful at football during his time in the Army and as a semi-professional player locally. 'Unfortunately the semi-professional football club he was a physio for could no longer keep him so he was released, so that was an income of about £150 to £200 per week gone overnight, and in his own physiotherapy business he was given two weeks' notice from his landlord so that ended too. 'His wife was on long term sick also. So as a family they went from having about £3,000 per month to that being halved.' Mr Haywood added: 'He will be outcast and alienated from a community that he was probably well thought of and loved for his achievements.' Bolton said he was collecting money for Zoe's Place baby hospice - but the forms were unauthorised . Bolton was previously on the books at Middlesbrough FC and when he was released he joined the Army . The court was read a statement from Zoe's Place which said: 'We rely solely on donations from the general public, and incidents like this raise doubts with them. 'All the money we raise goes to the babies we support. 'Incidents like this could be to the detriment of the charity.' Zoe's Place, which opened in 2004, provides end-of-life care to babies and infants aged from birth to five years old suffering from life-threatening conditions. A statement from the football club officials said they 'deplored' this act which saw Bolton 'con parents and children out of their money' which was for charity.","Kenneth Bolton, 44, played for Middlesbrough FC at youth level .

"Former Rangers skipper Barry Ferguson believes the Ibrox support will put their differences with the club's board to one side for a day as they pay tribute to Fernando Ricksen. A host of retired Gers favourites will turn out for a charity game on Sunday in honour of the Dutchman, who is battling Motor Neurone Disease. But so far only half the available tickets for the Ibrox match have been sold. Former Rangers midfielder Fernando Ricksen (centre) is battling Motor Neurone Disease . Dutch midfielder Ricksen played for Rangers between 2000 and 2006 . The Light Blues faithful have been engaged in a long-running dispute with the ruling regime at the club and attendances at Ibrox have sunk to record low levels. However, Ferguson believes all that will be forgotten about come Sunday as he predicted a sell-out crowd. The 36-year-old - who won five Scottish titles over two spells with the Glasgow giants - said: 'I'm looking forward to the match. It's for a great cause. I'm really looking forward to meeting a lot of the lads I played with. 'Everything that has happened to Fernando just makes you appreciate life a lot more. 'It's a difficult time but I'm just doing a small part by showing up to pay my respects. You just need to see the turnout from former players who are coming to support him. 'I just hope the crowd is a big one. I've heard it's at 23,000 or 24,000 and I just hope it's a full house for the guy because he was a tremendous servant for the club. He captained it to trophies, so I hope there's a good turnout for him. 'I have no doubt the fans will forget about the off-field stuff and their issues with the way the club is being run. It's Fernando's day. Let's not forget that. 'He's going through a hard time. I'm sure the fans will realise (the profits) are going to Fernando, his kid, Motor Neurone Disease and various other charities. I'm more than sure there will be a great turnout for him.' Barry Ferguson has called on Rangers to show up in numbers to support Ricksen . Gennaro Gattuso is among a host of former Rangers players who have agreed to take part in friendly . Among the big names who will be pulling on a blue jersey once more are Michael Mols, Jorg Albertz, Ronald de Boer, Gennaro Gattuso and Marco Negri - who has become the latest former Ibrox player to sign up to fan-ownership group Rangers First. It will allow the club's faithful to put their current difficulties to one side and remember the days when it was silverware and not boardroom battles that dominated their thoughts. But Ferguson admits watching former team-mate Ricksen struggle with his debilitating - and ultimately fatal - illness will leave Sunday's occasion tinged with sadness. 'Fernando is some character,' he said. 'Everything I know about him, you couldn't repeat it outside of closed doors. Ally McCoist will be barred from making an appearance at the friendly match, according to reports . 'He's faced this with a lot of bravery and I take my hat off to him. He was like that as a player - a tough cookie. He's handling it really well. 'Even today when I met him he is still bright and he is excited about the game. 'But it's hard when you see a guy of his age going through what he is. He's only a year older than myself. You need to enjoy life.' Reports this week have suggested axed boss Ally McCoist will be barred for making an appearance alongside the other former players under the terms of his garden leave. But Ferguson hit back: 'If Ally wants to come and support Fernando I don't see why he shouldn't be allowed to. 'It's a great cause. Fernando has a terrible illness and if someone wants to come and show their support for Fernando, I don't see why it should be a problem.' Meanwhile, the Rangers Supporters Trust has announced it has now passed the one-million share threshold after buying up another chunk of shares in the club.","Former Rangers stars will take part in charity match for Fernando Ricksen .

"Massimo Cellino has announced he has resigned as president of Leeds but says he will return in April.

That conviction becomes spent in April which will allow the Italian businessman to return. Massimo Cellino has announced he has resigned as president of Leeds but says he will return to the club . Cellino said in a statement: 'It is with great sadness and frustration that I have to take this step, however I abide by the Football League's decision to temporarily disqualify me from this great football club and will return in April in good health and good spirits. 'I have done my best for a club and fans that I hold close to my heart and it is now financially much stronger than it has been for a long time. It will continue to thrive and I am sincerely looking forward to returning very soon.' Leeds United Head Coach Dave Hockaday (left) chats with Cellino (right) before the match against Millwall . Board member Andrew Umbers will take over as Leeds chairman in the absence of Cellino, the club confirmed. Cellino added: 'Following my resignation and in my temporary absence, the board has appointed Andrew Umbers to become chairman of Leeds United. 'Andrew has personally worked tirelessly with me in restructuring the football club from May 2014 and shares the same goals, strategy and insights that I do in bringing Leeds United back from its financial abyss to make it the strong entity that its fans, players and city need it to be and to which these foundations are now in place. 'Andrew is also a Yorkshireman and lifelong Leeds United fan.' Cellino's disqualification was confirmed on Monday following his appeal being dismissed by a Professional Conduct Committee hearing (PCC). Umbers had told the PCC in a witness statement there was 'a real likelihood of insolvency' if Cellino was disqualified. This was disputed by the Football League's lawyer Jonathan Taylor, who said Umbers' claims were 'exaggerated, speculative and unsupported by any external evidence or, tellingly, by any evidence from Mr Cellino himself', according to the written judgement. Umbers previously advised Leeds on the sale of the club from Ken Bates' ownership to the Dubai-based investment firm GFH, before Cellino took over last year.

"Celtic manager Ronny Deila praised the 'world-class' ability of Leigh Griffiths as he revealed that another striker, John Guidetti, had delayed talks over his long-term future. Griffiths has started the last two games - his first starts in the Scottish Premiership since August - and rewarded Deila with a goal in Wednesday's 4-0 victory over Motherwell, which sent the Hoops top of the league. Guidetti has not got off the bench in either of those games as he continues to wait for his first goal since November, a barren run that contrasts sharply with his prolific start to his Parkhead career, which saw him net 11 times in 10 matches. John Guidetti has been in good form this season for Celtic but has been linked with Southampton . Celtic are believed to have agreed a fee with Manchester City to sign the striker on a permanent deal at the end of the season but the Swede is keeping his options open amid reported interest from Southampton. Deila, who is '100 per cent sure' that Guidetti will complete his season-long loan, said: 'We've been speaking with John for a long time but he's decided now he wants to wait to see what his options are until March or April, maybe longer, so there won't be any final decision this month. But we know we have him until the end of the season.' The 22-year-old recently boasted he would hit a hat-trick in the QTS Scottish League Cup semi-final against Rangers on February 1 but he might not get in the team if Griffiths continues to impress Deila against Ross County in Dingwall on Saturday. The former Hibernian player had been linked with a return to Easter Road but looks to have won over his sceptical manager. Deila said: 'There is big competition up front and it's also about the opponents we meet but Leigh has made improvement in a lot of things. He looks sharper now and needs even more confidence. Ronny Deila is '100 per cent sure' that Guidetti will see out his loan deal with Celtic . 'I believe in him. I think he's a very exciting player and his left foot is world-class, I've not seen any player have a better left foot in my life. 'He has skills but again you have to perform over time when you play at Celtic. 'I wouldn't play him if I wanted him to leave. 'We made some demands of him and he has really, really worked hard to tune into that. He still needs to improve, everybody does, but he is getting to a new level. 'You saw yesterday how much he works for the team, how sharp he is, and he scored a very nice goal as well. So he is going in the right direction. 'He has played the last two games and we have won the games and he has played well, so he has in a better position than three or four weeks ago.' With the likes of Charlie Mulgrew and James Forrest returning to fitness, Deila is pleased with his options, a situation highlighted by the fact that right-back Mikael Lustig struck two goals against Motherwell on his comeback from a hamstring injury after coming on for Adam Matthews, who netted against Hamilton in their previous game. Leigh Griffiths (right) heads in Cletic's second goal during the Scottish Premiership 4-0 win against Motherwell . So he does not appear desperate to sign players in January. 'In January it's hard but to keep the players is most important now that we have consistency through the season,' he said. 'We're getting a better level in the team so it's important to keep it. That's more important than getting players in but if we can add some in as well then it will be perfect.' One player Deila has missed out on is 16-year-old Martin Odegaard, who has moved from the Norwegian manager's former club, Stromgodset, to Real Madrid. Deila said: 'I met him, but he had some options. It was tough choice for him, there were so many clubs. 'I gave him his debut at 15 years old. He is a special, special boy.'","John Guidetti scored 11 goals in his first 10 games for Celtic .

"Two days after contemplating calling time on his Australian Open campaign, a rejuvenated Rafael Nadal surged into the fourth round in Melbourne on Friday. Nadal came close to retiring from his second round match with Tim Smyczek due to nausea and dizziness, the nine-time French Open champion eventually recovering from two sets to one down to avoid a first ever defeat to a qualifier in a grand slam. The 28-year-old was back on Rod Laver Arena 48 hours later and enjoyed a far more pleasant experience, beating Israel's Dudi Sela 6-1 6-0 7-5 to set up a last-16 clash with big-serving South African Kevin Anderson.

Nadal received medical attention after suffering from fatigue in his second round match with Tim Smyczek . 'I started playing well with not many mistakes and Dudi was making more than usual in the first two sets, but I was playing much better than the other day,' said Nadal, who saw his great rival Roger Federer suffer a shock exit at the hands of Italy's Andreas Seppi earlier in the day. 'I was feeling the ball better with the forehand, changing direction down the line. In the third set he had some chances and I was lucky at the end of the third. 'The other night was one of the toughest moments I have spent on court. My body was not in good condition, I felt I was very lucky to be through. I thought at 2-1 down I was going to have to take the plane and go back to Majorca.' Nadal told on-court interviewer Jim Courier that a lot of sleep had been the key to his recovery, but added: 'I don't like to sleep a lot. I feel when I am sleeping I am losing time. '(But) I have to this time, to be relaxed and try to rest a little bit. It's a big thing for me to be in the fourth round of the Australian Open after not having much chance to be on the tour.

Federer's defeat means Seppi will take on Australian Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round, with the winner to face either Andy Murray or Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals. Kyrgios battled a bad back and a nosebleed to beat Tunisia's Malek Jaziri in straight sets and was less taken aback than everyone else by the identity of his next opponent. 'I wasn't like really surprised,' the world number 53 said. 'I knew Seppi is capable of playing that sort of tennis, to beat some of the top guys. I don't think Roger played too bad at all. It was a tough match. 'Obviously I'd rather play Seppi than Federer, of course. But I know it's going to be a really tough match in a couple days. I played him (Seppi) once at the US Open. That was a really, really tough match. I probably played the best tennis I played in my life (winning in straight sets). I need to be ready again.'

Dimitrov, who ended Murray's Wimbledon title defence in the quarter-finals last year, said: 'Obviously it was a tough game for me. I didn't really feel comfortable on the court. I thought Marcos was playing dominating tennis early on in the match. I wasn't really able to turn things around as fast as I wanted to. 'I felt quite good physically, which was I think the best sign for me today. I'm not going to hide my excitement of winning the match because it meant a lot to me. To be able to play three and a half hours and win 6-3 in the fifth and feeling really good after the match physically, that says a lot for me.'

"Roger Federer rolled back time last season, but looked like he was feeling all of his 33 years as he was dramatically ousted from the Australian Open. Facing Andreas Seppi, the world No 46 who he had beaten 10 out of 10 times previously, Federer slumped to a 6-4 7-6 4-6 7-6 defeat in a shade under three hours on the Rod Laver Arena. The final point, a stunning forehand down the line on the run, was handed down from the Gods to the largely uncelebrated Italian, a nearly man who has only briefly infiltrated the top 20 in his career. VIDEO Scroll down for Australian Open: Seppi shock win vs Federer 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 . Roger Federer (left) congratulates Andreas Seppi on his four-set victory at the Australian Open . Federer appears frustrated during his first ever defeat by Seppi in his 11th match against the Italian . Seppi raises his arms in victory after sealing an impressive 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) win . He took advantage of an unusually sluggish and tetchy Federer, who had been scheduled to meet Andy Murray in the quarter-final stage in what has looked the toughest part of the draw. You were left wondering if the great Swiss was paying the price for what was a fairly truncated off season. He did not finish off playing the Davis Cup final until late November and then paid a brief visit to the International Premier Tennis League in India. Federer plays a forehand during his third round clash with Seppi at Melbourne Park on Friday . Italian star Seppi connects with a backhand on his way to victory against No 2 seed Federer . Federer stretches to make a forehand shot during a difficult afternoon in the Melbourne heat . He stated that the foundation for his excellent 2014 was the preparation work he did in the off season before last. He did win the Brisbane Open at the start of this month, but there was a lack of vigour when presented with his first serious test over five sets. In a tight first set, Seppi was first to break for 5-4 as Federer struggled for consistency, netting with the forehand before Seppi served it out. Federer had also dropped the first set to Seppi's compatriot Simone Bolelli before coming back for a four-set win, however this time the Swiss continued to make errors and Seppi took the second set in a tiebreak when Federer missed a forehand volley.

Federer smiles as he gives Seppi a hug following an almost three-hour battle on the Rod Laver Arena . Federer threatened to fight back by breaking for 2-1 in the third set and that was enough for him to go on to claim the third set as he comfortably served it out. But Federer repeatedly showed his frustrations with his game in the fourth set which went to a tiebreak and Seppi hit a stunning inside-out forehand to set up match point at 6-5. Seppi then sealed victory in stunning fashion as he hit a forehand slice on the backfoot which flew past Federer down the line for a famous victory.","Andres Seppi beat Roger Federer 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6 on Friday in Melbourne .

"If England are going to exceed expectations and challenge for the World Cup they will need Jimmy Anderson to stay fit and firing as he did in the demolition of India. Steven Finn grabbed the plaudits in the nine-wicket victory at the Gabba, but Anderson set the tone for what came close to the perfect team bowling performance. He was not fit enough to return against Australia in Sydney after missing the one-day tour to Sri Lanka with a knee problem but was at his best in Brisbane, taking four for 18 as India were skittled for 153. ‘I felt good and the wickets were a bonus,’ said Anderson. James Anderson celebrates after taking the wicket of Bhuvneshwar Kumar during the tri-series win . Anderson is congratulated by Joe Root after dismissing India's Shikhar Dhawan in Tuesday's match . ‘I’ve been bowling well since I went to South Africa before Christmas — it’s just been trying to get my fitness right.’ Finn also shone, taking five wickets a year on from being sent home from Australia, and Anderson can relate to what he has gone through. ‘I’ve spoken to him here and I was texting him when he was in Sri Lanka,’ he said. ‘There’s lots of similarities between his path and mine so I try to help him. He deserved to put in a performance after all the work he’s put in and his return is huge because he bowls wicket-taking balls.’ England have now gone south to Tasmania to take on Australia at the Bellerive Oval on Thursday. Mitchell Johnson, David Warner, George Bailey and Michael Clarke are missing and England know a win will take them into the tri-series final. Anderson ended the match with four wickets for just 18 runs as England cruised to victory . Steven Finn took all the plaudits, however, as he took five wickets . The suspicion remains that their attack lacks the variety to go all the way in the World Cup, but Anderson insisted: ‘We’re all very different bowlers. We may not be blessed with a left-armer but we’ve got a good enough attack to bowl teams out.’ Warner’s absence is, Australia insist, down to a sore hamstring rather than any disciplinary measure, though players’ behaviour has been in focus after his clash with India’s Rohit Sharma. Yet Anderson is adamant that the sport does not have an attitude problem. ‘I don’t think there are more verbals than at any time in the history of cricket,’ he said. ‘There is just more of a spotlight on it with stump mics and more cameras. It has happened for more than a hundred years so it isn’t just going to disappear.’","James Anderson took four wickets in the tri-series win against India .

"Jimmy Anderson declared himself satisfied with the perfect comeback after playing an integral part in the demolition of India that England hope will kick-start their World Cup challenge. 'It couldn't have gone much better really,' said Anderson after taking four wickets in the thumping Tri-series win at the Gabba. 'I was just happy to get out there, get a competitive game under my belt and come through it unscathed. James Anderson celebrates taking the wicket of India's Bhuvneshwar Kumar in Tuesday's Tri-Series match . Anderson (right) posted this picture with Stuart Broad (left) and Steven Finn as England arrived in Hobart . 'I was delighted to be back in the team and with the wickets, that was a bonus. It's just one game, my first game back and it went really well but I've still got a lot of work to do. 'Not just myself, but as a team too. We want to build on what was such a good performance and hopefully we can do that on Friday.' Anderson missed the one-day tour of Sri Lanka before Christmas with a knee injury and found his body protesting when he made his comeback in England's first warm-up game of this World Cup tour. It forced him to miss the opening defeat by Australia in Sydney. 'The knee has been fine,' he insisted. 'I've not had any issues with that for a while now. It's just everything else that seems to stiffen up and niggles crop up. 'I feel strong at the minute and just to get through yesterday was really good for me. To spend 40-odd overs in the field was progress and hopefully I can get through a full 50 on Friday.' Anderson took four wickets as England comfortable beat India by nine wickets in Brisbane . Anderson celebrates after Jos Buttler takes the catch to dismiss India's Shikhar Dhawan at the Gabba . The biggest plus of England's nine-wicket win against the defending World Cup champions was the man-of-the-match display from Steven Finn, who took five wickets in a city he was sent home from this time last year when he was deemed 'unselectable' for the Ashes tour. Anderson, who took a while on the periphery before he became England's attack leader, can empathise after his early travails in an England shirt. 'There definitely are similarities,' said Anderson. 'I've chatted to him about it quite a bit. We've worked together a reasonable amount on this tour so far. 'He's worked so hard off the field, trying to get himself back to the form we know he can produce. Everyone was delighted for him yesterday, it was a fantastic performance from him. 'Saying that he's a very humble, honest guy and he knows it's just one performance and he's got a lot of hard work to do to keep improving on that.' Steven Finn was England's star performer on Tuesday, taking five wickets as India were comfortably beaten . Finn celebrates with his England team-mates after taking the wicket of Axar Patel . But England were delighted with a victory they badly needed at this early stage of a tour where they have been dismissed as World Cup no-hopers. Now they are preparing to meet Australia on Friday here at the Bellerive Oval. 'It's huge for us,' said Anderson. 'We're still developing as a team. There's a lot of belief in the dressing room. We know we've got a huge amount of talent and the ability to upset teams like we did yesterday, beating the best in the world. 'Yesterday was a great performance but it's one game and we know we've got a lot of hard work and improving to do. That starts tomorrow and hopefully we can continue the good work on Friday.' Australia will be without David Warner in Hobart but they insist he is being rested with a sore hamstring rather than being disciplined for the latest of the many spats that have punctuated his career. Warner's clash with Rohit Sharma of India in Melbourne sparked a huge debate about player behaviour in cricket. Anderson, as England's chief sledger, is well qualified to speak on the subject. Australia's David Warner made the headlines for his spat with India's Rohit Sharma (right) last weekend . 'Of course there's a line and I think all players are aware of that,' said England's leading international wicket-taker. 'I don't think at the moment there is any more sledging than there's been in the history of cricket, it's something that's gone on for years and years. There's a spotlight on it a little bit more - stump mics and lots of cameras on the ground. 'I think guys have got to use their heads a little bit and be a bit smart about what is said on the field, if anything is said at all. 'You don't want to take away the aggression from teams, I think we showed yesterday we were really aggressive with the ball all the way through and there was very little said at all. 'I don't think it should disappear from the game, I think it's quite entertaining when it's done in the right manner.'","Anderson took four wickets as England easily beat India in Brisbane .

"Paula Radcliffe has revealed her heartache at people challenging the legitimacy of her world marathon record. Her time of 2hrs 15mins and 25secs has stood since 2003, but the spectre of doping means even clean athletes are suspected of drug taking, according to Radcliffe. ‘It’s horrible,’ said the 41-year-old. ‘I get it all the time. People saying “she couldn’t have run 2.15 clean” but I know I can be totally proud. Paula Radcliffe breaks the world marathon record with a time of 2hrs 15mins and 25secs in London in 2003 . Radcliffe celebrates following her seismic achievement after the 2003 London Marathon . ‘I can’t understand how other people who have cheated can stand there and look their competitors and family in the eye. On the one hand you can say “people can say what they want because I know inside” but still, it’s not nice to have people saying that.’ Russian Liliya Shobukhova, the second fastest female marathon runner, was banned for two years for doping while Kenyan Rita Jeptoo, the fifth fastest, is awaiting the outcome of a hearing into her positive doping test. In addition, revelations in a German TV documentary last month claimed 99 per cent of Russian athletes were drugs cheats and revealed that one famous British athlete was among more than hundreds of track and field stars who had suspicious blood values that were covered up. Radcliffe admitted she was angry that these claims mean her legacy, which includes the three fastest times in the history of the women’s marathon, is doubted. Radcliffe strides out from the start line before her record-breaking feat in London that day . ‘It makes you think we have to put a system in place that protects clean athletes,’ said Radcliffe. ‘There will be some Russians athletes who are not cheating, there are a lot of Kenyan athletes out there who are not cheating and they are all being lumped together. It spoils it so we have to do something to protect them and the sport.’ Radcliffe called for the entire Russian team to be banned from international competition following the German documentary. ‘You knew that there was some kind of problem going on there but the scale and level of it was a shock,’ she said. ‘You have to be careful because it hasn’t been proven yet but that level of corruption was shocking. Radcliffe is supporting Lord Sebastian Coe (above) in his bid to become president of the IAAF . ‘The world anti-doping agency says it is going to look into it by the end of the year. I appreciate that it takes time to conduct an investigation but I think it has to be done fast.’ Radcliffe is supporting Lord Coe in his bid to become president of the IAAF and said she would like to be more involved in the fight against doping. Radcliffe was speaking to launch a scheme to encourage ordinary women to take part in the Great Manchester Run on May 10. She will soon leave for three weeks’ training in Kenya to prepare for this year’s London Marathon, which is likely to bring down the curtain on her career. Meanwhile, five Russian race walkers, including three Olympic champions, have been handed doping bans. Great Run has appointed Paula Radcliffe as its ambassador for women’s running.

"Dai Young believes James Haskell is the 'form back-rower' who can 'meet fire with fire' when England open their RBS 6 Nations campaign against Wales in Cardiff. Wasps rugby director Young admitted he would 'feel for' Haskell if he does not win a starting berth in England's Six Nations back-row. England face Wales in the Millennium Stadium on Friday, February 6 in their first return since a record 30-3 defeat that handed Warren Gatland's men the 2013 Six Nations title. James Haskell is in contention to start for England against Wales in the Six Nations . Wasps director Dai Young will sympathise with Haskell if he is not selected by Stuart Lancaster . Billy Vunipola should replace injured number eight Ben Morgan, leaving Haskell potentially competing with Tom Wood for the blindside jersey with captain Chris Robshaw inked in at seven. 'I don't think he'll be shoved into eight, but I'd feel for him if he's not starting to be quite honest,' said Young. 'I think he's by far the form back-rower in England. 'I know I'm biased and I'm not pretending I'm not. 'I know I'm biased and maybe one-eyed, I'm certainly not going to knock any of the other players because I think they're all real quality players. 'But for me I think he's probably the form back-rower at this moment in time.' Harlequins number eight Nick Easter was named in England's 34-man Six Nations training squad on Wednesday, recalled for the first time since the 2011 World Cup. The 36-year-old adds specialist number eight cover in Stuart Lancaster's squad, but may be hard-pressed to win match selection. Haskell featured in England's chastening 2013 Six Nations loss in Cardiff, amid a ferocious atmosphere under the closed Millennium Stadium roof. Nick Easter has been brought back into the England fold for the first time since the 2011 World Cup . The 29-year-old forced a recall to England's summer tour of New Zealand before featuring in the autumn Test series. The 51-cap loose forward will have his final chance to state his Test case in club action when Wasps host Leinster in Coventry on Saturday with Champions Cup quarter-final qualification on the line. Former Wales prop Young is adamant the bullish Wasps flanker is the ideal candidate to cope with the intimidating reception awaiting England in Cardiff. 'I do believe Wales' strength has always been their physicality, their power and their size, well Haskell is more than a match for that,' said Young. 'If you really want to meet fire with fire, he's certainly the guy that can stand up to that. 'I'm not saying the other guys won't be able to, but he'd be in my team, put it that way. 'He can generally play right across the back-row, but what he has developed over the last 12 months mind is a really big strong carrying game. Young believes that Lancaster would be making the best decision to select Haskell . 'His defensive ability from the day he came here has always been exceptional; his contact area work has always been exceptional. 'But the big areas I see he has improved out of sight are his carrying ability, he's one of our best carriers now, and his line-out ability. 'He can play six and eight and be a line-out option as well. 'He's not a Paul O'Connell of course but he's an effective target now.'","Wasps director believes James Haskell is the form choice for England .

"Off-colour Kevin Pietersen was bowled for a golden duck in Melbourne Stars' three-wicket win at home to Perth Scorchers in the Big Bash. Pietersen has been in prolific form for much of the competition, hitting three half-centuries, and has continued to make it clear he still harbours ambitions of an England return. Those hopes are not shared by his former employers, however, and the South Africa-born batsman - controversially sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board 11 months ago - missed his latest chance to demonstrate his renewed form before the World Cup.

It therefore fell to others - chiefly Peter Handscomb (103 not out) with a brilliant 64-ball century, and some late hitting too from John Hastings - to complete the run-chase with three balls to spare.

"Aston Villa have been fined £60,000 and warned about their future conduct after failing to control their players at Leicester. The club admitted the players did not conduct themselves in an orderly fashion and/or refrained from proactive behaviour.

"Everton's 0-0 draw against West Brom in the Premier League has been shrouded by one talking point - the missed penalty by Kevin Mirallas. Mirallas' decision to take the spot-kick instead of regular taker Leighton Baines has been largely condemned with the likes of Gary Neville slamming the incident as a 'despicable breach of team orders.' Despite the incident Everton fan and 90min.com blogger Gary Stevens insists the Belgian international mustn't be blasted for his miss as he is an integral part of the team. Let's not beat around the bush - it's been a grim season so far. We spent nearly £30m on a striker who keeps forgetting how to score and most of the team have gone from giving 110 per cent to 25 per cent overnight. But there are still a couple of players who, when you turn up at Goodison, you know you're going to see them give everything they've got - and then a little more. You can rely on Leighton Baines, you can rely on Steven Naismith and you can always, always rely on Kevin Mirallas. There's been a lot made of his Monday night penalty cock-up and while it's true that he made a mistake, there's no doubt that he did what he thought was best for the team. He was wrong, it turned out, but surely you'd rather have somebody who's willing to stand up and be counted when he thinks his team needs it than someone who'd hide away at the first sign of a challenge? Kevin Mirallas missed a penalty as Everton drew 0-0 against West Brom at Goodison Park on Monday . Mirallas (second left) demanded to take a penalty, despite Leighton Baines (left) being the regular specialist . The Belgian dragged his penalty wide of Ben Foster's goal as the game remained goalless just before half-time . Mirallas watches his penalty clip the outside of the post beyond the outstretched arm of Foster . He's not been at the club for a long time in the grand scheme of things - only two and a half years - but his gutsy performances on the pitch and his attitude off it show just how much he's taken the club, the fans and his team-mates into his heart and the least we can do is pay that back in kind. Of course, it isn't just his love of the club that makes us want to keep Big Kev around. If it were that simple, Leon Osman would be the most popular man in the blue half of Merseyside. No, we also need to keep him around because he's one of the best wide men in the league. He's not necessarily the most skilful - although his assist against West Ham showed that he's hardly lacking in that area - but there's no ball too far away to chase down and the words 'lost cause' don't appear in his French-to-English dictionary. There's very little that he can't do, and he's always up for the fight. Mirallas scored a sublime free-kick for the Toffees in their FA Cup third round replay at West Ham . Hammers goalkeeper was a mere spectator as the ball flew past him at Upton Park after Mirallas' effort . It's make or break time now though, as he's admitted that it's 'difficult' not to have won a trophy at the club and has hinted that improvements will have to be made for him to stick around. If he is sold with 12 months left on his contract in the summer, it will be just about the biggest loss possible. Few other players in the league, let alone the club, have his ability to create a moment of magic from nothing, or to recover a lost cause with his now signature tenacity and determination. We need Kevin Mirallas. We have to hope that he needs us too. Mirallas will be in his final 12 months of his current Everton contract at the end of this season .

"Jermain Defoe insists it was the lure of the Premier League rather than a dislike of MLS which was the motivation behind his decision to quit Toronto FC for Sunderland. The 32-year-old spent just one season in Canada before his move to the North-East earlier this month. But he has rejected claims that he was unsettled during the entirety of his time in MLS. Jermain Defoe says he joined Sunderland because a return to the Premier League proved too tempting . Defoe joined the Black Cats on a three-and-a-half year deal MLS side Toronto FC earlier this month . The 32-year-old has rejected claims that he left Toronto because he was unhappy at the club . ‘It was pretty simple, really. My time in Toronto, I enjoyed it. The MLS was a good experience and something that I thought at some point in my career that I'd like to do,’ he said. ‘But if I am being honest, I missed the Premier League, just that intensity, the fans and the football, basically. I just missed the Premier League.’ Defoe was linked with a move to QPR before Sunderland and Gus Poyet came in with an £80,000-per-week offer. And the former Spurs frontman says his respect for the Black Cats boss played a big part in his decision to head for the Stadium of Light. ‘Yes, there was a lot of speculation about me going to other clubs, but after the first conversation I had with Gus I knew,’ he said. ‘I played with him at Tottenham, and he was back there as a coach with Juande Ramos, so I have always had a good relationship with Gus. Defoe (left) was quick to praise his new Sunderland boss Gus Poyet during Tuesday's press conference . ‘He's someone I have always liked as a man, a good person and a good coach, so when I had the conversation with Gus and he explained how he wanted us to play, I pretty much made my mind up there and then, to be honest.’ Defoe made his Sunderland debut during last weekend’s 2-1 defeat at Spurs. There is pressure on the Londoner to score the goals which will keep his new club in the top flight, and he added: ‘There's always been pressure on me from when I was young. ‘When I was at West Ham, I came through young, then I signed for Tottenham at a young age, and you are brought in to score goals, it's as simple as that. ‘I think it's a good pressure. You have got to enjoy it at the end of the day, you have got to embrace it because I love playing football, I love scoring goals, and I always believe if I get the chances, I'll score. ‘It's not a case of thinking about the pressure too much, you have got to go out there and just enjoy it, just enjoy playing football and hopefully the goals will come.’ Defoe added that he believes he will score the goals to help the club avoid relegation this season . However, while that reverse left the club just a point clear of the drop zone, Defoe is confident he can handle the responsibility of dragging them to safety. He said: 'There's always been pressure, to be honest, on me from when I was young. When I was at West Ham, I came through young, then I signed for Tottenham at a young age, and you are brought in to score goals, it's as simple as that. 'I think it's a good pressure.

'When he has trained with us he has been great, and I'll be delighted to have him available. 'His experience and game understanding is a quality sometimes people underplay.

"Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill believes the FA Cup fourth-round tie at home to West Ham on Sunday will be a great learning experience for his side. The Robins go into the clash on the back of a four-game winning streak and with just once loss in 12 in all competitions. Two goals from Jay Emmanuel-Thomas helped City overcome Doncaster in a replay while the Hammers required penalties to edge past Premier League rivals Everton at Upton Park. Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill is preparing for the visit of West Ham United in the FA Cup on Sunday . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is targeting a cup run this season and will play a strong squad . This is only the third meeting between the sides in 22 years with both games ending in draws during the 2011/12 season when they were plying their trade in the Championship. City have not beaten West Ham at home since 1977 but, with a little bit of FA Cup magic, Cotterill feels that could change in front of the live BBC cameras. He told the club's official website, bcfc.co.uk: 'Outside of our dressing room the pressure is off. We have to have a certain amount of belief in ourselves because otherwise we may as well not turn up. Cotterill celebrating leading Cheltenham to victory in the Division Three playoff final  in 2002 . 'We know we have to play to our maximum and potentially they have to have an off-day. We may need a little bit of luck, we know that, but these things can happen in the FA Cup. 'We won't be shouting from the rooftops to anyone this week. We're very grounded and if we can maintain that between now and the end of the season, given the relative success we've had so far, that will be great. 'Every time there's been an FA Cup tie we've tried our best and thankfully we've made it through a couple of tough games against Doncaster Rovers to get a shot at a Premier League side. 'I wanted that opportunity for the players to test themselves against Premier League players. They will learn something in this game.' A younger Cotterill on the touchline as Stoke City manager in September 2002 . 'I'll enjoy it when we have the ball... probably less so when they have it! All in all it's going to be a really good occasion and hopefully we can play well. 'When you're playing against Premier League teams I think they will let you play because they play.

"This defeat, inflicted with a moment of Bojan brilliance, hurts Leicester considerably. On an unbeaten run of four matches and with a following wind in their fight against relegation, Stoke’s victory leaves their sails flapping with weaker gusto. With upcoming fixtures against Tottenham, Manchester United, Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Everton, Chelsea, and Manchester City, a home match to Stoke would have been seen as a vital chance to clinch three points. But in a game of modest quality, Bojan sprinkled some stardust with his winning goal in the 63rd minute. The pass from Jon Walters was slightly behind him, but the boy from Barcelona showed skills honed at La Masia to adjust his body, swivel quickly and direct a laser-sharp shot from 18 yards into the far corner.

Subs not used: Butland, Huth, Ireland, Adam, Sidwell . Manager: Mark Hughes, 7 . Referee: Andre Marriner . Attendance: 31,772 . Bojan scores the only goal of the game- CLICK HERE FOR MATCH ZONE . His cost of £500,000 last summer continues to look a steal of Great Train Robbery proportions. Mark Hughes did not shun the chance to fan the flames of self-praise. ‘The figure we paid takes people aback given some of the figures bandied about,’ he said. ‘You look at what we’ve got for the money we’ve paid — we’ve done well.’ Bojan survived Leicester’s rougher edges too. ‘He’s a game little chap, he doesn’t mind that,’ Hughes added, of the occasional robust challenge. ‘Teams will try to stop him but he has a low centre of gravity and great ability.’ Marc Wilson gets across to challenge Knockaert in a goalless first half . Bojan is sandwiched between Leicester's Danny Simpson (left) and Knockaert (right), but manages to get his shot away .

Jonathan Walters   90            11.1       6.9 . In truth this was one of Bojan’s quieter games, even as he recorded his fourth goal in 10 matches. Andrej Kramaric made his Leicester debut in the second half following his £9.3million transfer from HNK Rijeka and Nigel Pearson will be pleased if his striker produces a similar goal ratio to the Spaniard. Having not played for a month though, the Croatian had little impact. Nor did Leo Ulloa, thrown on with 19 minutes left as Leicester chased a point. Stoke could have gone ahead shortly before Bojan’s strike when Steven Nzonzi hit a sweet volley that saw Ben Hamer react swiftly to fist away. Leicester’s best chances came in the first half, through the pace and purpose of Jeff Schlupp down the left wing. In the 28th minute he picked out Anthony Knockaert who arrived on to the ball without breaking stride but drove his shot straight at Asmir Begovic, who held gratefully. It was a similar story when Jamie Vardy applied a smart backheel to another Schlupp cross later in the half. Schlupp was a surprise name in Pearson’s line-up given Ghana left him out of their Africa Cup of Nations squad on January 7 because of a knee injury they estimated would take three weeks to heal. But Pearson clarified the situation with a swipe at the Ghanaians, managed by Avram Grant. ‘He recovered in the time we said from the outset: 10 days to two weeks,’ said Pearson. ‘He went down to London to have independent medical scans organised by the Ghanaian FA. If they have any problems they need to look at their own administrators, not anything to do with me. ‘He’s our footballer and we abide within the rules. If their manager wants to say anything, quite frankly I couldn’t care less.’ Leicester midfielder Danny Drinkwater brings the ball forward and fends off Stoke's Glen Whelan .

"For Celtic, February brings the mouth-watering prospect of cup ties against historic foes Rangers and Inter Milan. Sandwiched in between the hotly-anticipated League Cup semi-final and Europa League last 32 tie is the small matter of a Scottish Cup visit of Dundee. As the club’s make-or-break month approaches, manager Ronny Deila admits he can sense fear in the air. But the terror he detects is not emanating from his Parkhead players, but from their domestic rivals, anxious at facing a Celtic side peaking at the right time. Deila cited the way Motherwell set out for a goalless draw at Parkhead on Wednesday night, only to lose 4-0 as Celtic returned to the summit of the Premiership, as proof that teams are becoming worried at the damage they could sustain at the hands of the champions. Celtic manager Ronny Deila believes his team are peaking at the perfect time ahead of frenetic February . Deila takes his position as he prepares to lead Celtic into battle on four fronts next month . Celtic eased back to the Scottish Premiership summit with Wednesday night's 4-0 demolition of Motherwell . 1 Rangers (Hampden Park) League Cup semi-final . 7 Dundee (A) Scottish Cup Fifth Round . 14 St Johnstone (A) 19 Inter Milan (H) Europa League Round of 32, first leg . 22 Hamilton (H) 26 Inter Milan (A) Europa League Round of 32, second leg . The Norwegian expects more of the same blend of fear and respect at Ross County on Saturday lunchtime, after the Dingwall side parked the bus and stole a point in Glasgow on December 27. But as Deila continues to targets a domestic treble, he wants to ensure January ends with a perfect 12 points from 12 ahead of a month he hopes does not end up defining his first season in charge in Scotland. ‘February is going to be a very big month for us,’ smiled the Celtic manager. ‘I am excited. They are going to be very interesting games (against Rangers, Inter Milan and Dundee). The month could define the season but hopefully it won’t because trophies don’t come in February. Hopefully we can extend our run in the competitions beyond next month. ‘I think I am more confident now about my team than I was two or three months ago. I think we are growing more and more together. 'We understand what we expect from each other, the players and me. That gives me more confidence and I see more confidence in the players. They are also much fitter and sharper than they were before. Mikael Lustig celebrates with James Forrest after scoring one of his two goals in the 4-0 Motherwell win . Leigh Griffiths jumps for joy after making it 2-0 to Celtic shortly before half-time . Celtic's Stefan Johansen sees a shot creep just wide of the post during the match at Parkhead . ‘I think (the Motherwell game) in particular shows that people fear us more than they did before! And, to me, that is good to see. We will have to deal with breaking teams down, like Motherwell. Ross County did the same to us at home and I think it will be a quite similar match on Saturday. ‘Confidence is a very important thing in football. When you win games you get more and more confidence. So to win up in the north is so important because it will give us confidence going into the Rangers match. ‘I’m home a lot, so I don’t get people talking to me much about the Rangers game. But I get it when I come into training. I know what it is about. But I’m taking it a match at a time just now. For me, the league is the most important thing and the first target is beating Ross County.’ After Celtic dropped points at home to the Highlanders last month, Aberdeen took advantage of the champions postponed game at Partick Thistle to go clear at the top of the table. But Deila’s side have responded by winning each game since their return from Gran Canaria and reclaimed their place at the summit on Wednesday night. Ronny Deila applauds the Celtic fans at the end of their 4-0 win over Motherwell on Wednesday . Mikael Lustig scores two goals in the comfortable win, guiding Celtic back to the top of the table . That came days after Aberdeen’s eight game run of wins without conceding came to a halt in a 3-3 home draw with Dundee. Now Deila suggests it is Aberdeen’s turn to see how they deal with questions being asked of their own title bid. ‘I think Aberdeen have a very good team. They should be up there,’ he said. ‘They have had consistency in their team over the period and they have improved. They can win a lot of games. ‘But it is always the same when you are up there fighting for titles that you have to bounce back quick. You can’t have long periods with bad results. You need to maintain a high level over a whole season. 'Now we will see if we can do it and if Aberdeen can do it, or Dundee United, Inverness or whoever. We will see in April if it is two teams or three teams or just one (in the title race).’ It’s not long since striker John Guidetti was boasting of his plans to become the first Celtic player to score a hat-trick against Rangers since Harry Hood at the same stage of the League Cup in 1973. Despite his iniital 11 goals in 18 appearances on loan from Manchester City, however, the Swede is without a goal in his last six matches and was unused in the rout of Motherwell. John Guidetti scored 11 goals in 18 appearances during his loan spell, but didn't feature against Motherwell . Griffiths is expected to get the nod again when Celtic travel to Ross County on Saturday . In his absence, Leigh Griffiths scored a goal and is expected to be given the nod against Ross County tomorrow with the chance to stake a claim for an Old Firm starting berth. Whatever happens in Dingwall, Griffiths – who once looked on his way out of Parkhead – has already impressed Deila with his attitude, fitness and a left foot the Celtic boss yesterday labelled ‘world class’. ‘I think Leigh’s a very exciting player,’ Deila said. ‘His left foot is world class. I’ve not seen any player have a better left foot in my life. He has skills but you have to perform over time when you play at Celtic. ‘Leigh looks sharp but he needs more confidence. The goal against Motherwell was very important. I believe in him. I wouldn’t play him if I wanted him to leave. We made some demands of him and he has really worked hard to tune into that. He still needs to improve, everybody does, but he is getting to a new level. ‘His fitness is 100 per cent better than it was and you can see that in matches. He works really hard to close people down. ‘It started with him giving 100 per cent in training. That’s why he got his chance in the team. ‘Leigh is also a fantastic guy. He is always in a good mood and you get a laugh in the dressing room – but he is also hungry to learn. ‘Now he has played the last two games for us and we have won and he has played well. So he is in a better position than three or four weeks ago. It’s clear to see we have big competition for places up front.’","Celtic manager Ronny Deila delighted with form ahead of busy February .

"Ronald Koeman needs to know sooner rather than later whether Toby Alderweireld, Ryan Bertrand and Nathaniel Clyne will commit their future to Southampton. Saints know all too well what can happen when a club their size flourish, having experienced an unparalleled talent drain last summer. Champions League qualification would surely avoid such a scenario this time around, although Koeman has highlighted the importance of tying down their key assets before the end of the campaign. Ronald Koeman wants to know what his key players are intending to do for next season . Toby Alderweireld (centre) is on loan at Southampton from Atletico Madrid and has been impressive . Right-back Nathaniel Clyne has been a revelation and has reportedly been interesting Manchester United . Bertrand and Alderweireld have been tremendous since joining on season-long loan deals from Chelsea and Atletico Madrid, respectively, and Saints have the option to make both moves permanent. 'We would like to know fast what the player likes, if there is any possibility to buy that player, and that's in the case of Ryan and Toby,' manager Koeman said. 'Of course, we don't put exactly a deadline on it but we would like to know it soon what the plans are of the players. 'If it is yes and we can do the deal, then fantastic. 'If not, okay, then we need other players or we have to think about, that we have players in the Under-21s who can play in those positions. 'I think that it is important that the club is growing, the team is doing very well and the players are very happy. 'They have got the possibility to play in the case of Ryan and Toby. I think we have good possibilities to sign them players.' It is not just those on loan that Koeman needs to persuade to stay, with several key players approaching the end of their contracts. Left-back Ryan Bertrand is on loan at the club from Chelsea and Koeman would like to keep him at St Mary's . The Dutchman has given Jack Cork a week to extend his deal past the end of the season, while he is aware that Jay Rodriguez and Clyne are amongst those out of contract next year. The former's recovery from a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament lessens the need for that deal to be struck, although getting England right-back Clyne to promptly sign a new contract is key. 'Yeah, [we are still waiting to hear],' he said of the extension offered to Clyne. 'It is a little bit the same as we would like to know what the player is doing because it all influences the plans with what we would like to do. 'They are important players in the club, like in the case of Jack Cork, as well as Toby, Ryan and Clyney. Jack Cork (right) has been offered a new deal at Southampton, which he is yet to sign . 'We try to do our maximum to keep these players because they are good players and still at a good age to develop. 'This month? No [we don't expect an answer from them].

"Mike Ashley is poised to tighten his grip on Rangers with fresh emergency funding amid claims Ibrox will not be used as security. Sports Direct, Ashley's sportswear firm, are preparing to lend the stricken club more cash, with a reported £10million on the table. The Three Bear shareholding group, consisting of bus tycoon Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor, have made an alternative offer of £5million. Mike Ashley (left), with Derek Llambias, offered Rangers a £10m loan in bid to take control of the club . The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems . The lodging by Sports Direct of advanced notices of security against Ibrox and Murray Park last week has raised expectations, however, that the Rangers board will opt for a new loan from one of Ashley's companies. Rangers refused to offer any comment on the Ibrox claims last night. But sceptical fans groups have called on the club's board to provide proof the iconic stadium is safe after the news leaked out on Sky, rather than a legally binding stock market announcement. Chris Graham of the Union of Fans told Sportsmail: 'They previously confirmed they are looking at Ibrox as a security. If you want to put that to bed you either put out another stock exchange announcement offering a categoric assurance. Ashley wanted to use the Ibrox Stadium and club's training ground as security against his loan . 'Or you get Mike Ashley to remove the advance notices from the Land Register. 'They have done neither of those things. 'I'm sure this information is coming from somebody close to the board – but that doesn't mean they are telling the truth.' The news Sports Direct had taken an advance notice over Ibrox triggered a furious backlash. Rangers Fans Fighting Fund backed a legal bid to halt the move while former director Dave King has called a General Meeting aimed at ousting the current board.

Caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has added to the turmoil by resigning for 'personal reasons' Rangers First supporters group protest in the hope of saving the future of their club . If the Rangers board now honour promises made last May not to use Ibrox as security they are likely to offer the club's Auchenhowie training ground as the safeguard to a lender instead. 'The original terms of Ashley's offer to lend more money clearly included Ibrox and Murray Park in the advance notices,' added Graham. 'You don't do that unless you are about to grant security – because it stops you granting security to anyone else for 35 days. 'If the board have backed off from that then either Ashley is receiving a different type of security or more Rangers retail.

He is just 19 but has been involved with the Selecao set-up for more than five years, first alerting European clubs to his talent when he netted 10 goals in seven matches at the U15 South American Championship. A move to Atletico Paranaense from Vasco da Gama followed and he has already found the back of the net for the South American side. Expect a move across the Atlantic soon... Mosquito (left) celebrates scoring for Brazil during the FIFA U17 World Cup in 2013 . The Atletico Paranaense striker is just 19 and has been involved in the Brazil set-up and more than five years . Fabrice Olinga (18, Apollon Liamssol on loan from Malaga) Fabrice Olinga - La Liga's youngest goalscorer at 16 years and 98 days and Cameroon's youngster goalscorer (after breaking Samuel Eto'o's record no less). Quite an introduction really. Inevitably comparisons have been made with Eto'o, Cameroon's greatest striker, and Olinga was even first spotted at his idol's footballing academy. Malaga bought the 18-year-old in 2009 and, after spending last season at Zulte Waregem, the striker is now on loan at Apollon Limassol in Cyprus where he is honing his skills. Interestingly, his nickname is 'Happy Feet' due to his magnificent dribbling skills and his love of dancing... Fabrice Olinga of Cameroon kicks the ball during a training season at the World Cup in Brazil . The 18-year-old Malaga winger, pictured on loan at Zulte Waregem, is Cameroon's youngest-ever scorer . Diego Fagundez (19, New England Revolution) Uruguay aren't short of an exciting player or two at the moment and Diego Fagundez is expected to be the country's next great export. The 19-year-old plies his trade for New England Revolution in Major League Soccer and the attacking midfielder has established a pretty impressive strike ratio - he has netted 22 times in 96 matches for his club. Fagundez's super-quick acceleration, superb control and instinctive finishing have made him one of the most-sought after attacking midfielders in world football. Watch this space. Diego Fagundez (left) playing for the Uruguay U20 side during the South American tournament . The New England Revolution midfielder has netted an impressive 22 times in 96 appearances for the club . Kelechi Iheanacho (18, Manchester City) Manchester City have been pumping money into their academy in recent years and forward Kelechi Iheanacho is expected to be one of the success stories to emerge from this big cash injection. The forward excelled for Man City during their pre-season tour of the United States - scoring against Sporting Kansas City -  and contributed seven assists and six goals for the Nigeria U17 side during their victorious 2013 World Cup campaign. Yaya Toure has even commented on Iheanacho's talent, explaining: 'Kelechi is an exciting player. I love the way he plays and I feel that he will have a good career at the club and go on to become one of the players of the future.' Praise indeed! Kelechi Iheanacho (left) crosses the ball for Manchester City against Sporting Kanas City last July . The Man City academy striker is regarded as a huge prospect by first-teamer Yaya Toure . Adnan Januzaj (19, Manchester United) The Belgian winger needs no introduction to Premier League fans and, despite a difficult start to Louis van Gaal's reign at Manchester United, Adnan Januzaj remains one of the hottest prospects in England. At 19, Januzaj has already scored four times for the Man United first-team and burst on to the scene when he netted twice in his first start for the club against Sunderland in October 2013. With six Belgium caps to his name too, Januzaj may well look for pastures new if Van Gaal will not give him game time at Old Trafford - and he will certainly not be short of potential suitors, that's for sure.

The Belgium international has struggled for game time under Louis van Gaal but is highly regarded . Januzaj broke on to the Premier League scene when he scored against Sunderland in October 2013 . Rolando Aarons (19, Newcastle United) Newcastle United may be enduring a turbulent spell off the field right now but the Magpies have arguably their best crop of youngsters in a generation - most notably the exciting talent that is Rolando Aarons. The 19-year-old Jamaican-born winger has only made five first-team appearances since his debut earlier this season - largely due to recurring hamstring problems - but he is already courted by a number of top Premier League sides after scoring twice. His pace, trickery and directness have already drawn comparisons with Raheem Sterling and his brilliant goal against Manchester City in the Capital One Cup proved his potential. Geordies love watching players of Aarons' talent - but Newcastle need to make sure they can keep hold of him.

The Jamaican-born winger beats Eliaquim Mangala (right) before slotting past Willy Caballero . Aarons (left) celebrates scoring for Newcastle against Crystal Palace in August of last year . Ryan Gauld (19, Sporting Lisbon) One of the surprise transfers of last summer was Ryan Gauld's £3m move from Dundee United to Sporting Lisbon. The attacking midfielder had scored nine times in 50 appearances for Dundee United before Sporting came calling for the Scotland U21 starlet. He has since found himself largely playing for Sporting's B side but, after impressing, he made his Primeira Liga debut for the first team earlier this month. Scotland believe they have a real talent of the future on their hands - can Gauld fulfil his true potential? Ryan Gauld completed a £3m move from Dundee United to Sporting Lisbon last summer . The attacking midfielder (centre) made his Primeira Liga debut against Boavista earlier this month . Zakaria Bakkali (18, PSV Eindhoven) The one-cap Belgian international was subject to interest from La Liga champions Atletico Madrid last summer, such is Zakaria Bakkali's talent. A quick, tricky and in many ways unorthodox winger, Bakkali made the short move to PSV Eindhoven in Holland from Standard Liege in his homeland in 2006. The 18-year-old netted four times for PSV last season but, after failing to secure a move to Atletico, he was banished to the Dutch side's reserves for refusing to sign a new contract. Atletico and their fellow European giants will almost certainly return for the Moroccan-born youngster. Zakaria Bakkali, pictured playing for PSV Eindhoven against SC Stormvogels, is just 18 years of age . The Belgium international has been banished to the PSV reserves for refusing to sign a new deal . Leon Goretzka (19, Schalke) You know how I said Werner was Germany's next big talent? Yeah well, about that - Leon Goretzka may run him close you know... At just 19, the Schalke midfielder was named in Joachim Low's provisional squad for Germany's victorious World Cup campaign last year before being cut for the final 23 - but he is regarded by both his national and club coaches as a future heartbeat of their sides. Having moved to Schalke from Bochum in 2013 - where he was described by coach Peter Neururer as 'the talent of the century' - Goretzka has developed his game to become a classy midfielder who is tactically astute, positionally aware and who can rocket in a shot from the edge of the area. Not bad for a guy who hasn't turned 20 yet, is it? Leon Goretzka (left) of Schalke beats the challenge of two FC Freiburg players in May 2014 .

"Mesut Ozil has beefed-up in an attempt to reinvigorate his Arsenal career. The £42.5million man made his return to action after four months on the sidelines with a knee injury against Stoke on Sunday. And the Germany star was noticeably more muscular than he was during his previous appearance in October against Chelsea. Mesut Ozil appeared bulkier against Stoke (left) than he did in his previous game against Chelsea in October . Arsenal playmaker Ozil worked on his strength during his lengthy spell on the sidelines . Ozil's arms are certainly smaller in March last year compared with how he looked against the Potters . And Sportsmail can reveal, increased upper body and core strength work was incorporated into Ozil's rehabilitation programme to prepare him for the rigours of Barclays Premier League football. While Ozil's quality on the ball has not been questioned since his arrival from Real Madrid 18 months ago, his slender frame has led to suggestions that he can be bullied by top-flight defenders. But his new muscular frame should help ensure the attacking midfielder can stand up to the physical nature of the English top-flight. The 26-year-old came on as a late substitute in the win over Stoke and is now in contention to start against Manchester City at the weekend. 'It feels great to be back on the pitch after such a long time on the sidelines. I worked hard for this moment,' said Ozil. 'As I watched the matches on TV I started to get nervous, because I really wanted to play again. 'Of course I am not at 100 per cent, I only trained with the team once on Saturday, but I hope that I will be back at 100 per cent by the end of January.' Ozil came off the substitutes' bench in the 73rd minute to make his comeback appearance against Stoke .","Mesut Ozil has increased his  core strength during his time on the sidelines .

"Eidur Gudjohnsen scored his first goal for Bolton since May 2000 as struggling Leeds were denied victory in their quest to avoid relegation from the Sky Bet Championship. The 36-year-old forward, who re-signed for the Trotters last month, scored with a fine penalty in the 48th minute to cancel out a third-minute spot-kick from United midfielder Rudy Austin as the match finished 1-1. The visitors led when Sam Byram was brought down by Bolton goalkeeper Andy Lonergan and Austin fired home confidently before Bolton levelled when Luke Murphy felled Darren Pratley and Gudjohnsen blasted home from 12 yards. Eidur Gudjohnsen fires Bolton level from the penalty spot to net his first goal since returning to the club . The result took Bolton's unbeaten home run to eight games but left Neil Redfearn's visitors without a win in their last six Championship outings. With Gudjohnsen and Emile Heskey starting together for the first time, Bolton's veteran strikeforce had a combined age of 72. Teenager Zach Clough, who struck the winner on his debut against Wigan in last weekend's FA Cup win, was missing due to injury while Steve Morison was the surprise inclusion in Leeds' starting line-up. It was only the former Millwall man's third league start of the season as Redfearn made four changes to the side which lost 1-0 at Sunderland in the FA Cup. Byram, Giuseppe Bellusci and Lewis Cook also returned with Dario Del Fabro, Adryan, Brian Montenegro and Mirco Antenucci all making way. Leeds were handed a great early chance to take the lead when Bryam latched onto Cook's clever through ball and was brought down by Lonergan as he rounded the goalkeeper. Rodolph Austin gave the visitors the lead from 12 yards in just the second minute . Referee Andy Woolmer pointed straight to the spot and Austin struck a powerful right-foot penalty into the net. Lonergan escaped without as much as a yellow card and Leeds should have doubled their advantage in the 10th minute. A cross from the right flank found Morison unmarked on the edge of the six-yard box and his firm header drew an outstanding save from Lonergan. Morison should really have scored and Bolton midfielder Liam Trotter was soon booked for a late challenge on left-back Charlie Taylor. In the 15th minute, Taylor did well to deflect Trotter's shot out for a corner, from which Matt Mills narrowly headed wide from close range. Gudjohnsen saw a 25-yard free-kick sail inches wide of Marco Silvestri's left-hand post before Murphy had a long-range strike deflected out for a corner at the other end. Bolton's other new striker Emile Heskey jumps with Leeds defender Liam Cooper . A brief deluge of rain and hail midway through the first half made the conditions increasingly difficult but it soon subsided. In the 28th minute, Trotter went close with a header from close range following a corner which Silvestri repelled before producing another smart stop to deny Pratley's follow-up shot. In the 37th minute, Mills made a vital interception to deny Morison after Byram headed a cross into his path on the edge of the six-yard box. Bellusci was booked for catching Heskey with a stray arm in added time at the end of a first half which saw Leeds establish a 1-0 advantage. That was cancelled out when Liam Feeney's deep cross from the right was palmed away by Silvestri to Pratley, who was caught by Murphy's outstretched leg. Gudjohnsen did the rest to fire high into the net, but chances remained scarce as the second half wore on. Gudjohnsen had a powerful strike well blocked by Leeds captain Liam Cooper before Silvestri parried a fierce cross-shot from substitute Craig Davies. Byram went close with a close-range shot for Leeds late on but both sides held on for a deserved share of the spoils.","Rodolph Austin gave Leeds the lead from the spot inside two minutes .

"Joining Real Madrid is a dream that has come true for Brazilian Lucas Silva, his former coach Marcelo Oliveira has said, while describing the midfielder as a 'diamond'. The talented Silva, who played for Cruzeiro, has agreed a contract until June 2020 for a reported fee of £11.5million and will be presented at the Bernabeu on Monday. Real won the chase to bring in the creative 21-year-old, who is able to dictate play from the middle of the pitch and will be a useful under-study to Toni Kroos this season as he gains first team experience. Real Madrid new boy Lucas Silva (left) takes on Fluminense's Wagner for former club Cruzeiro . 'I have been talking with Lucas and he is very happy as one of his dreams has come true.

'He is a technical player with good vision, he can make precise 30-40 metre passes and has a strong shot. 'I have been behind him when he has shot from outside the area and believe me he has a lot of potential that can be further exploited. He will push those who are already in his position. Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti snapped Silva up for a fee believed to be £11.5million . 'He will need to adapt now to a new formation but I am sure he will develop a lot alongside the quality at Real Madrid.'

"An unknown possessing an iconic football name lit up world football’s most iconic knockout competition, as 2013 winners Wigan were ousted from this year’s FA Cup at the first hurdle. This was the one piece of major silverware that eluded managerial great Brian Clough but his namesake Zach etched a chapter of his own with a virtuoso performance and delightful debut goal at the Macron Stadium. Clough, 19, was plucked from obscurity by Bolton manager Neil Lennon and thrust into the third-round Lancashire derby to devastating effect. By the time he was withdrawn to a standing ovation seven minutes from time everyone was talking about him. Zach Clough (centre) clips the ball over Ali Al Habsi to score the winner for Bolton in the FA Cup third round . Clough watches his shot sail over the Wigan keeper to give Bolton the lead on 76minutes . The Bolton striker wheels away to celebrate as Al Habsi (right) looks on dejected . Bolton players rush to congratulate Clough after his winner earns the Trotters local bragging rights . BOLTON (4-3-1-2): Bogdan 7; Vela 7, Wheater 6, Dervite 6, Ream 7; Pratley 6, Danns 7, Trotter 7; Clough 9 (Gudjohnsen 83); Feeney 6, Heskey 6 (C Davies 62, 6). Subs (not used): Lonergan, Spearing, Wilkinson, Threlkeld, Medo. Booked: Vela. WIGAN (3-5-2): Al Habsi 8; Perch 7, Ramis 7, Kiernan 6; Tavernier 6 (Boyce 64, 6), Forshaw 6, Watson 6 (Cowie 53, 6), McCann 7, Taylor 6; McClean 7, Fortune 5 (Maloney 46, 5). Subs (not used): Nicholls, Waghorn, Chow, Cosgrove. Referee: Phil Dowd (Staffordshire) 6. Yet, it is fair to say some of those supporters would not previously have heard of him. The official club website did not have him numbered in the first-team squad until kick-off. But with Chung-yong Lee away on Asia Cup duty, Clough was selected as Wanderers’ wandering waif behind the front men. Everything went through the 5ft 4in playmaker, and when he was given a fourth sight of goal with just under a quarter of an hour remaining he showed there is a composed finish in the armoury too. Accepting Liam Trotter’s pass in his stride, he glided into the Wigan area, drew the otherwise excellent former Bolton goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi, delayed, and then dinked over his opponents’s sprawled frame to settle the game. ‘It augurs well,’ said Lennon. ‘We know with young players there may be a dip here or there but he is a talent. He is very diminutive but he’s very strong, has a great low centre of gravity. He can drop the shoulder and go by people, and run with the ball at pace, and nine times out of 10 he takes the right option. He was a real threat.’ Wigan manager Malky Mackay greets his Bolton counterpart Neil Lennon (right) ahead of the game . Veteran striker Emile Heskey (right) made his return to the FA Cup after a spell in Australia . Former Chelsea striker Eidur Gudjohnsen watches the game from the Bolton bench . Wigan keeper Ali Al Habsi (2nd left) denies Bolton's Liam Trotter with one of many saves . Indeed, Clough’s solo slaloms were a feature of Bolton’s most dominant period — the opening quarter of the second period — when he witnessed one effort destined for the top corner deflect wide, another force Al-Habsi into a full-length save and a third fizz the wrong side of an upright. After such an introduction it was only fair to question where Bolton had been hiding this prodigious talent. Lennon suggested his physicality — or lack of it — has held him back. ‘When you are that small, you have to be special and I think he is. We just have to be mindful we don’t get carried away.’ Wigan — unbeaten in 13 FA Cup matches discounting shoot-outs, and semi-finalists last season — did not field a single starter from the win over Manchester City two years ago, although their goalscoring hero from the bench that day, Ben Watson, wore the armband. Wigan midfielder James Perch (ground) slides in to deny Liam Feeney of Bolton a golden opportunity . Bolton keeper Adam Bogdan (right) makes a save from Adam Forshaw during a rare Wigan attack . Clough finally managed to break through the Wigan keeper's resistance deep into the second half . Clough's clipped effort gave the home side a deserved victory after recording a total of 15 shots . Yet it was not until the half-time introduction of Shaun Maloney, one of those XI, that they threatened. Maloney, who is expected to leave for a fee this month with four suitors pursuing him, was one of a trio of Wigan players foiled by Adam Bogdan, whose best save came during Bolton’s purple patch, when he spectacularly tipped Adam Forshaw’s close-range header over the top. So Malky Mackay failed to keep up the rich recent record of progress in the cup managed by Roberto Martinez and Uwe Rosler, although he insisted it was not for the want of trying. ‘We came here to win it, I have got great respect for the FA Cup and that showed,’ Mackay said. ‘It was a strong team and we could have won it.’","Bolton defeated Wigan 1-0 in the FA Cup third round at the Macron Stadium .

"Arsenal could be set to miss out on signing Tolgay Arslan, who is close to agreeing terms with Besiktas. The Hamburg defensive midfielder and his representatives are waiting on a decision from Arsene Wenger before finalising terms with the Turkish club. Wenger has been monitoring the player, who is available for free in the summer but can discuss pre-contract terms with clubs outside of the Bundesliga now. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tolgay Arslan scores a sensational goal in Hamburg training . Arsenal could be set to miss out on signing Tolgay Arslan, who is close to agreeing terms with Besiktas . He is out of contract in the summer and can agree pre-contract terms with non-German clubs this window . The 24-year-old is seeking wages of £40,000-per-week and is tempted by the offer on the table from Besiktas. Wenger is short in central midfield with Mikel Arteta and Jack Wilshere out injured. The Frenchman has suggested he is pursuing defensive options in this transfer window and has admitted his interest in Ipswich's Tyrone Mings. Arslan, whose contract ends on June 30 this year, is keen for a new challenge and would welcome a move away from Germany. Arslan vies for the ball with Dortmund's Henrikh Mkhitaryan during a Bundesliga game in February 2014 . Arsene Wenger is hoping Arslan can provide midfielder cover for Mike Arteta and Jack Wilshere (pictured) His parents are from Turkey, although he was was born and grew up in Paderborn. Arslan has represented Turkey's Under 19 and 21 sides but has more recently played for Germany's Under 20s and 21s. Arsenal have been keeping tabs on Arslan's situation since November. He is a hard worker in front of the back four and plays a short passing game, meaning he would fit in to Wenger's style of play.

"Manchester City have apologised after they invited volunteers to a publicity event – and told them not to wear United colours. The Premier League champions held a media call to promote their 'Walking Football' programme at their £200million City Football Academy (CFA) on Friday and raise awareness of the game designed for over 50s. Stars including Pablo Zabaleta and David Silva took on club legends Mike Summerbee and Peter Barnes along with a number of volunteers in a pre-arranged kickabout in front of the press and without a red shirt in sight. Cheeky David Silva (left) flashes his skills against participants taking part in walking football initiative . Former Manchester City star Mike Summerbee (left) takes on Pablo Zabaleta at a game of walking football . And we can reveal the absence of any United colours was by design and not by accident. A memo sent to participants ahead of the event by the club's community arm, seen by Sportsmail, lays down the sky blue law. 'Please note' it reads, 'only participants registered for our sessions will be allowed access to CFA (no spectators), the surface is the same as the tennis centre and please do not wear any MUFC kit as you won't be allowed in'. It is understood the message was meant to be lighthearted but the tone was lost in translation. However, the club have been moved to say sorry. A spokesperson for City in the Community (CITC) said: 'Manchester City would like to apologise for any offence caused as a result of the letter sent to participants of our ‘Walking Football’ project. Silva takes on the volunteers who were light-heartedly told not to wear Manchester United colours . 'CITC delivers 34 different programmes to 45,000 people in Manchester every year, and our participants wear many different colours. CITC is committed to providing footballing opportunities for all regardless of which team they support. 'The letter was addressed to the regular participants of the project and was related to the one-off event involving both current and past MCFC players. It is not a policy for CITC, nor will it be repeated.'

"WAITING FOR WILFRIED . City will understandably be anticipating new signing Wilfried Bony’s return from the African Cup of Nations next month. However it will be interesting to see how manager Manuel Pellegrini accommodates him in to the team. The Chilean seems happier to build his team around one central striker and – as fearsome as it will be – the Bony/Sergio Aguero partnership will perhaps require some tweaking elsewhere in the line-up to make it work. Wilfried Bony is currently away in Equatorial Guinea with the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations . A CITY MAN GOES MISSING . Happily City are a club that still welcome supporters’ flags and banners but they may wish to consider where they put them. Two homemade efforts draped over the top tier on Sunday were so unfortunately placed that one of City’s own slogans read ‘...chester thanks you Sheikh Mansour’ and another was reduced to ‘The ONLY football team to come from ….chester’. TIME TO STRIP THINGS BACK . Whatever happened to the days when teams played in their most recognisable colours? Arsenal, we should remind ourselves, are a team that play in red and white. On Sunday they played a team wearing all blue. So what justification for wearing a ‘change’ strip that actually constituted more a colour clash than their usual one? None at all, clearly. Manchester City's all blue kit wouldn't have clashed with Arsenal's red... so why do they have to wear yellow? SUPPORT AT ALL LEVELS . City’s new Football Academy has had more openings than an envelope but on Sunday afternoon was one of which they really should be proud. The £200m facility was opened to spectators for the first time as Patrick Vieira’s EDS squad took on Schalke from Germany. It was freezing cold, foggy and then it started snowing. But City got more than 5,000 through the gate. A fine effort. HEADER BY FERNAN...WHO? Sky commentator Martin Tyler suffered a case of mistaken identity yesterday, crediting Fernando with a header instead of Manchester City team-mate Vincent Kompany. Last week Sky pundit Charlie Nicholas was forced into making an on-air apology after mixing up Fernando witwh his colleague Fernandinho. Thankfully Sky didn’t feel the need this time. Patrick Vieira was in the stands at the Etihad, but earlier had steered the City Development team to victory . HELLO TO OLD FRIENDS . The tunnel at the Etihad Stadium is always a cosmopolitan place when these two clubs meet but yesterday there were so many hugs, handshakes and high fives going on in the moments before kick-off that it didn’t do much for the occasion’ s competitive edge.

"It was certainly a result that raised a few eyebrows. Arsenal, often so timid on the road against the big teams, producing a masterclass to whack a great big dent in Manchester City's title hopes. In the cold post-mortem of Sunday's game, after the thrill of Santi Cazorla's penalty and Olivier Giroud's header, it was found that the Gunners had just 35.33 per cent of possession. It means they saw less of the ball on Sunday than in any of their Premier League matches since 2003 and yet still came away with a very impressive victory. Santi Cazorla is mobbed by his team-mates after putting Arsenal in front from the penalty spot at Man City . Olivier Giroud doubled Arsenal's advantage with a header midway through the second-half . Arsene Wenger's men were able to absorb City's pressure and hit them when their chances arose . But while Arsene Wenger's team are renowned for adopting a passing game, craving the ball at all times and working it around to try and force an opportunity, they can also win without it - especially on the road. Indeed, a study of their possession stats from every away match since 2003 shows that they won seven of the eight matches in which they had a smaller share of the ball. Sunday's match at the Etihad Stadium tops the list but there are plenty of other examples. In November 2008, Arsenal saw just 40.22 per cent of the ball at Stamford Bridge, and yet still beat Chelsea 2-1 thanks to a double from Robin van Persie.

Back in December, they earned a 2-2 draw at Liverpool despite only having 36.48 per cent of the ball. Matches against their fellow top-four candidates aside, Arsenal have also shown a capability to grind out results when starved of possession at Swansea, Blackburn and West Ham in the last few years. It shows that possession of the ball is not the be-all and end-all in any match. Curiously though, while Arsenal can grind out results with just 35 or 40 per cent possession on their travels, it's a different story at the Emirates.

"Vincent Kompany insists Manchester City's title hopes are still alive, despite their disappointing defeat to Arsenal. City will fall eight points behind Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea next week if they follow up their loss to Arsenal with another reverse at Stamford Bridge. Manuel Pellegrini's men rarely looked like a team capable of winning the title on Sunday, but Kompany thinks it would be foolish to write his team's chances off just yet. Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany  appeals to referee Mike Dean after he concedes a penalty . In fact, the skipper thinks the result could actually help City's chances of winning the league as he thinks the players will be even more determined to beat Chelsea in what is already being billed as a 'title decider'. 'In theory it should be better for us now because we will definitely be more fired up for that (match),' the City captain said. 'We have always been great in games like this so I'm actually looking forward to it.' City moved level with Chelsea over the Christmas period but draws against Everton and Burnley have proved costly for Pellegrini's side. Monreal was caught by Kompany with the contact sending the left back crashing to the ground inside the box . When asked how damaging the Arsenal defeat could be for City, Kompany said: 'You are disappointed with any result that's not a win, but we've been in situations like this before and it won't affect the way we look at the Premier League, it won't affect the way we look at the Champions League or the FA Cup. 'We will just make sure we are better the next game. We are always liable to kick off a massive run and that's the kind of club that we are. 'Maybe this run has stopped, but the next one should be coming soon hopefully.' Santi Cazorla leads the celebrations after the Spaniard kept his cool to fire home from the penalty spot . Kompany did not put in the kind of display expected of him on his return from a month-long hamstring injury lay-off. The Belgian earned a booking for taking down Olivier Giroud and was lucky to stay on the pitch after a second foul on Alexis Sanchez which went unnoticed. The former Hamburg defender also gave away the penalty that handed Arsenal the lead, although replays showed there was minimal contact between the centre-back and Nacho Monreal. There was no doubting his hunger to impress, though, and that bodes well for City as they look to retain the title in the coming four months. Kompany earned a booking for taking down Olivier Giroud during a difficult evening for the home side . 'People who know me see I work like an animal when I am out,' the 28-year-old said. 'I want to be back stronger and I've come back at the right time as well.' Kompany refused to criticise Mike Dean's decision to give a penalty against him for the slightest of touches on Monreal. 'I've said my bit on the pitch and I don't want to go further,' the Belgian said. 'It's football. We pick ourselves up now. That spirit is there, more than ever, in this team.' Kompany hopes new signing Wilfried Bony will have a big impact when he joins the squad after the African Nations Cup. Kompany hopes new signing Wilfried Bony (above) will have a big impact when he joins the squad . 'I rate him,' said Kompany, who flew to Abu Dhabi with his team-mates for a five-day warm-weather training camp after the match. 'If we are serious about the league and the FA Cup then you need good players like him. You can't get enough of them. 'If you look at all the big teams around us, they have the same kind of strike force. You do need it. The teams we are competing with have the same tools and it's as simple as that. 'I quite enjoyed facing him (Bony) in matches, but I will face him in training more now.'","Manchester City went down 2-0 to Arsenal at the Etihad on Sunday .

"Wilfried Bony believes he has made the right decision in joining Manchester City after revealing other clubs were keen to sign him. The 26-year-old completed his £25million plus add-ons move to the Etihad on January 14, penning a four-and-a-half-year deal. In an exclusive interview with Sky Sports News, the striker said: 'I think so,' when asked if City was the only offer he considered. 'I don't know if I should have chosen the other one. I think this is the best club for me.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wilfried Bony: I joined Manchester City to become a champion .

Yaya Toure (Manchester City) - 17 . Wayne Rooney (Manchester United) - 16 . Edin Dzeko (Manchester City) - 14 . Daniel Sturridge (Liverpool) - 13 . The Ivory Coast international, who ended 2014 as the Premier League's deadliest marksman in the calender year - with 20 goals, was also subject of interest from Liverpool and Tottenham as well as Spanish giants Real Madrid - as Sportsmail revealed earlier this month. However, speaking to City boss Manuel Pellegrini and the lure of playing Champions League football for the first time in his career made the move a no-brainer for Bony who is keen to be part of City's 'project' moving forward. 'Yeah, he [Manuel Pellegrini] talked to me [and said] ""I really need you here, you will be part of our project. I hope you will enjoy it here and I think it's the right way for you to get one step more in your career and your life. I think you will enjoy here."" 'It's [the Champions League] a competition that I didn't play yet. I really want to feel it, I really want to enjoy it. I want to be in the action, not just to see every time on the TV. It's good motivation for me.' Bony was the top scorer in the Premier League during 2014 - netting 20 goals for the Swans . Bony, who is away with the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations, also revealed that international team-mate and City midfield powerhouse Yaya Toure played a pivotal role in his move to the blue half of Manchester. 'He [Yaya Toure] helped me in my move to City,' Bony added. 'When I spoke to the coach [Pellegrini] he told me: ""I'll be asking Yaya Toure how you are and how you work."" It's a part of my move to Manchester City. He's a player who every time I've spoken to him he has given me a lot of advice. I'm OK with him, he's helped me a lot.'

"Former US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro admitted he had to think of his long-term future after pulling out of the Australian Open with a recurrence of a wrist injury. Del Potro returned from 10 months out of the game at the Sydney International earlier this week, but since bowing out in the quarter-finals to Mikhail Kukushkin has felt pain in his wrist. And the 26-year-old Argentinian, who won his sole grand slam title to date at Flushing Meadows in 2009, said he did not feel ready to play five-set matches in the first grand slam of the year in Melbourne. Juan Martin del Potro practiced in Melbourne ahead of the tournament but felt pain in his wrist . 'It's been hurting the last couple of days and weeks,' he said. 'Nothing new, nothing dangerous. But I think my wrist is not ready for play in this important tournament. 'I have to be smart. I'm looking forward to my future and my career. I'm still positive. I want to play tennis but I don't want to put my body and wrist at risk. 'I think it was a tough decision, but it could be a smart decision if I want to stay healthy and play for the whole year. I have to be smart and see more than my present now. I have to do what the doctor says. Del Potro announces his retirement from the Australian Open at a press conference . 'I really enjoyed playing tennis again in Sydney, winning a couple of matches. I didn't expect that for sure. But that's given me a little bit of motivation for getting through this pain again.' Del Potro said he would consult with his doctor before deciding when he might be able to compete again, adding: 'I want to stay calm a few days, then see the doctor, see what's going on with my plan.'","Juan Martin del Potro has suffered a recurrence of his wrist injury .

"Sportsmail examined 10  playmakers from the Premier League and ranked them against each other using their statistics. We've looked at pass completion, pass completion in final third, goals scored, chances created and dribble success rate. And here's how the scoring works: If the player ranks first, he gets 10 points. If he ranks second, he gets nine points. Third? Eight points. And so on, until the person in last gets a single point for coming 10th. Eden Hazard, Santi Cazorla, David Silva? What about Raheem Sterling, Christian Eriksen and Juan Mata? The Barclays Premier League is packed full of brilliant playmakers. How can you compare such diverse talents? Sportsmail has attempted to rank a subjective list of 10 advanced playmakers, the men who bob and weave close to the front lines and pick locks. It excludes a deep-lying genius like Cesc Fabregas, while rewarding the players who thrive in the most congested part of the pitch. By using five key indicators – pass completion rate, pass completion rate in the final third of the pitch, goals scored, chances created and dribble success rate – we think we have found the best of the maestros. The leader in each category will get 10, the backmarker will score 1 and the man with the most points out of 50 wins. It’s not a flawless science – some playmakers have had more game time than others - but it offers an interesting barometer of how these men compare when set against each other. Midfield maestros: David Silva (left) and Santi Cazorla make the list - but who finishes higher? Chances created: 50 (5th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 47% (8th) Pass completion: 81% (10th) Pass completion in final third: 75% (10th) Goals: 4 (=7th) 10th - Raheem Sterling . A wonderfully exciting talent who has not yet hit his fastest stride this season. He has impressed in front of goal with four strikes and has five direct assists included in the 50 chances he has created. Sterling brings thrills to a game and his dribble success rating is unfair, because even though he has only completed 47 per cent of his attempts, the fact remains he has tried 135 dribbles and succeeded many times. Only Hazard looks to beat his man more often. Where Sterling is let down is his passing. His pass completion of 81 per cent is four down on the next lowest and his success rate in the final third is also the worst of this sample. Dusan Tadic (left) scored the winner against Manchester United and helped Southampton beat Newcastle too . Chances created: 26 (9th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 52% (5th) Pass completion: 85% (=7th) Pass completion in final third: 78% (=6th) Goals: 4 (=7th) 9th - Bojan Krkic . When he was breaking youth-team records at Barcelona, not many expected him to truly flourish in Stoke. But he is looking to be a quite brilliant player in Mark Hughes’s side. He has thrived behind Stoke’s frontline, scoring four goals, including the winner against Leicester at the weekend. His pass completion is respectable, though Stoke’s style means he has actually attempted fewer passes than any other player in the sample. His dribbling is exciting and effective, but he has only created 26 chances this season. Bojan Krkic has made 88 dribbles - ranked third best in the 10 - and he has created 26 chances for Stoke City . Chances created: 17 (10th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 48% (=6th) Pass completion: 89% (=2nd) Pass completion in final third: 86% (2nd) Goals: 1 (10th) 8th - Ross Barkley . Had his season badly delayed by a knee injury and was recently told to ‘relax’ by Roberto Martinez. Plenty is expected of this excellent young talent, who is lagging some way behind his rivals in goals and created chances. But his passing statistics are excellent – his passing in the final third is second only to Hazard, while he maintains a very high passing ratio all over the pitch. More than half his dribbles don’t come off, but he tries more than most having attempted 96 this season, which is the third highest despite playing fewer minutes than anyone else on this list. He brings an excitement factor to a game. Ross Barkley has made 96 dribbles for Everton - the second best out of the 10 - but has just one goal . Chances created: 54 (3rd out of the 10th) Dribble completion: 48% (=6th) Pass completion: 86% (=5th) Pass completion in final third: 77% (8th) Goals: 4 (=7th) 7th - Gylfi Sigurdsson . One of the signings of the summer. He’s scored four goals, directly assisted eight (the most of players in this list) and has created 54 chances, which ranks fourth against these particular rivals. A solid all-rounder who, like most here, takes an excellent free-kick. Surprisingly for a player in a passing-orientated side, his passing in the final third is a full 10 per cent less than Hazard. Gylfi Sigurdsson has made 44 dribbles and has a pass completion rate of 77 per cent in the Premier League . Chances created: 60 (1st out of the 10) Dribble completion: 40% (9th) Pass completion: 85% (=7th) Pass completion in final third: 78% (=6th) Goals: 5 (=4th) =4th - Stewart Downing . West Ham have been a major surprise in the league this season and much of that is because of Downing. He can play out wide but has often been part of narrower systems this season. He has proven himself a major threat and has reached five goals for only the fifth time in 14 Premier League seasons. The 60 chances he has created is the most of any player on this list and he also has the best crossing figures. Stewart Downing is arguably the most surprising top player of the season with 60 chances created . Chances created: 52 (4th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 59% (4th) Pass completion: 84% (9th) Pass completion in final third: 76% (9th) Goals: 8 (=1st) =4th - Christian Eriksen . His passing statistics are good but look poor on a talented list such as this, but where the 22-year-old Dane really thrives is in front of goal, where he excels at creating chances and getting shots off. His haul of eight goals is matched only by Hazard. For all that, he is also part of Mauricio Pochettino’s pressing machine – his 34 tackles is best in the list. Christian Eriksen runs away in celebration after scoring Tottenham's winner against Sunderland . Chances created: 28 (8th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 36% (10th) Pass completion: 90% (1st) Pass completion in final third: 82% (4th) Goals: 5 (=4th) =4th - Juan Mata . His numbers paint a fairly accurate picture of a man who can score his share of goals and also passes better than anyone else on this list. But the numbers also show that no one attempted fewer dribbles and no one succeeded with less of those attempts. Surprisingly he has only created 28 chances this season, though he has played almost 500 minutes less than Hazard. Juan Mata has an 82 per cent pass completion rate and has scored five goals for Manchester United . Chances created: 40 (7th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 76% (1st) Pass completion: 86% (=5th) Pass completion in final third: 79% (5th) Goals: 6 (3rd) 3rd David Silva . He didn’t have his best game against Arsenal and has managed fewer minutes on the pitch than all but Ross Barkley and Bojan on this list. Yet he is a devastating talent. His goals tally of six ranks third here, while outside of our key indicators he actually has the best goals to shots ratio (32 per cent) of the field. Flattered a little by his very high dribbling success rate of 76 per cent, considering his total tally of 33 completed dribbles is better than only Juan Mata’s 25. David Silva has scored six goals, made 33 dribbles and created 40 chances for the champions City . Chances created: 49 (6th out of the 10) Dribble completion: 67% (2nd) Pass completion: 89% (=2nd) Pass completion in final third: 83% (3rd) Goals: 5 (=4th) 2nd Santi Cazorla . The most two-footed player in the Premier League? It certainly seems that way, a delightful blur that is capable of gliding to his left or right to get through a crowd. A fairly distant second to Hazard in this reckoning, though he has played roughly 250 minutes less than the Belgian, which might explain why he has created 10 fewer chances. Numerically, the most complete playmaker behind Hazard. Santi Cazorla put in a heroic performance for Arsenal as they beat Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday . Chances created: 59 (2nd out of the 10) Dribble completion: 61% (3rd) Pass completion: 89% (=2nd) Pass completion final third: 87% (1st) Goals: 8 (=1st) 1st Eden Hazard . Unlike most in this list, he doesn’t take a central role as he is often coming in from the left, but what a magnificent player. A creative genius with a balanced game. He has scored jointly the most goals (eight) of any of the playmakers in this group, but also has the highest pass completion rate for the final third of the pitch, where the gaps are minimal. He is also by far the most prolific dribbler – his tally of 175 dribbles is 79 more than the next nearest and he has a dribble completion rate that stacks up well against his peers. He does not fall outside the top three in any of our key indicators. Fearless and effective – the best in this list.

"A stoppage-time winner from Moussa Sow saw Senegal complete an impressive comeback against Ghana, the striker netting with the last kick of the game to secure a 2-1 win. Sow, preferred off the bench to Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse, was in the right place at the right time to grab a back-post winner with seconds left on the clock. Before the dramatic ending it had been Premier League stars who had taken centre stage as two of Africa’s most star-studded sides played out an entertaining game in Mongomo. Senegal's players and substitutes celebrate after Moussa Sow's last-gasp winner in their match on Monday .

Mame Biram Diouf of Stoke City bagged the equaliser for Senegal after Ghana had taken a first half lead through a penalty won by Everton’s Christian Atsu. Diouf, lively throughout, was the quickest to react when his own header came back off the post in the 57th minute, nodding the rebound home from close range. In truth, the pacey striker could have had more than just one goal. In the first half Diouf saw a spectacular bicycle kick saved by Ghana keeper Razak Brimah, denying him what would have been an early contender for goal of the season. Then, just minutes after his equaliser, he spurned a simple chance, swinging wildly at a cross with his left foot, but sending high over the bar from close range. In the tournament’s ‘Group of Death’ neither side could afford a defeat in the first game, and both seemed set up to avoid conceding, rather than chase the win, in the opening stages. Senegal in particular were keen to sit back and use the pace of Stoke’s Diouf on the break. Earlier in the game, Stoke striker Mame Biram Diouf (second left) had levelled the scores at 1-1 . Ghana players celebrate after Andre Ayew netted an early penalty to put them 1-0 up against Senegal . Ayew (second left) slots home his penalty in the opening stages to put Ghana ahead in the Group C opener . But Andre Ayew’s 12th minute penalty changed all that. It was won by Atsu, the winger on loan from Chelsea, showing pace to get to Emmanuel Badu-Agyemang’s through ball ahead of Senegal keeper Bouna Coundoul, who brought him down. Ayew, captaining Ghana in the absence of Asamoah Gyan – missing with Malaria - chipped home down the middle and ran straight to the dugout to celebrate with his team-mates. The goal meant Senegal had to come out of their shell, leaving space for Atsu and both Ayews to attack. It was Jordan Ayew who had the most joy, at one point feeding Atsu after a driving run, only for the winger to curl his shot just wide.

Avram Grant, former Chelsea manager, is currently in charge of Ghana at the Africa Cup of Nations 2015 . The 2015 Africa Cup of Nations got off to a good start for Ayew and Ghana with an early goal against Senegal . But Alain Giresse’s Senegal side, though not particularly pretty, did look a threat - particularly at set pieces. Centre-back Serigne Mbodji powered a header against the crossbar before Diouf forced a save from Brimah with a spectacular bicycle kick. Neither side were helped by a shocking pitch, the second the competition has seen in two days. A bobble denied Senegal’s Stephane Badji an early opportunity, before late on in the first half Coundoul was lucky to make contact with a horribly bobbling back-pass, which he managed to slice away for a corner.

In the second half they witnessed a Senegal onslaught, as Avram Grant’s side sat back on their lead. But Ghana never looked comfortable in defence, and Diouf’s goal, when it came, was no surprise. Both sides had chances in the closing stages, Pape Kouly Diop charging through a non-existent Ghana defence before dragging his shot wide from just inside the box, before Jordan Ayew put a header wide from seven yards out. But, it looked as though both would have to settle for a point until dramatic Sow’s last-gasp winner.

"Thibaut Courtois denied Adam Lallana Liverpool's winner in the first leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final on Tuesday with a tremendous one-handed save - and the playmaker still can't comprehend how the Chelsea goalkeeper managed to do it. Lallana connected perfectly with a knock-down from Raheem Sterling and his strike from 25 yards seemed destined to find the left corner of the net and put Liverpool ahead, until Courtois' outstretched arm somehow managed to tip it around the post. 'I can't believe the 'keeper saved it, I was halfway on my celebration,' Lallana told Liverpool's official website.

"Jose Mourinho has repeated his plea for a noisy Stamford Bridge when Chelsea play Liverpool next week for a place in the Capital One Cup final. The Blues drew 1-1 at Anfield on Tuesday night and play the Reds in the semi-final second-leg bidding for a place in the March 1 final at Wembley. Mourinho, who won the League Cup twice in his first spell at the club, was critical of Chelsea fans following November's win over QPR, saying he felt his side were playing in an 'empty stadium'. Jose Mourinho (right) has asked Chelsea fans to give it their all in his side's League Cup replay next week . The Blus boss said in November that playing at Stamford Bridge was 'like playing in an empty stadium' The Portuguese believes a partisan crowd can make a big difference next week against Brendan Rodgers' visitors. 'It was a two-leg semi-final, now it's a one-leg semi-final. That says a lot,' Mourinho told Chelsea TV. 'Two legs is difficult, Anfield is difficult and with this result we transform a two-leg semi-final into a one-leg semi-final at Stamford Bridge. 'If Stamford Bridge can give us 25 per cent of the emotion Anfield gives Liverpool, I think we can do it. 'Liverpool, instead of 40,000 fans, they will have five or 10 (thousand). 'Chelsea, instead of 1,000, will have 40,000. I hope that can make a difference in the atmosphere.' Chelsea have been looking at ways to improve the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge (pictured) The Blues have only once failed to win at home this season - when drawing with Schalke in the Champions League - and won all 10 of their home Premier League games. Like Mourinho, Eden Hazard, who converted a penalty at Anfield, called for the home support to create an intimidating atmosphere. The Belgium playmaker told Chelsea TV: 'We are very strong at home. We need to win, because a draw is not enough. We need the support, the fans, everybody to go to Wembley.' Hazard missed his most recent prior spot kick at Maribor and was relieved to net this time round. 'I was a little bit scared because sometimes in training in Belgium with (Liverpool goalkeeper Simon) Mignolet), he saves my penalties,' Hazard added.

After a 5-0 win at Swansea which had Mourinho purring, he was frustrated by the lack of accuracy of his side's passing. 'We were ready to hurt them much more but the quality of our passing was not good,' Mourinho added. 'We didn't have chances to score, but we had lots of opportunities to go for a killing action. The opposite to what happened at Swansea.' Thibaut Courtois returned in goal for Chelsea following a minor hand injury. Thibaut Courtois was the star man for Chelsea after keeping out Liverpool's continuous onslaught . Courtois said: 'The second leg will be like a final. It's just we win or they win. We have to win in front of our fans and go on to Wembley. 'For them it's a big opportunity to win a trophy this season, to go to the final. Obviously we want to play too. It will be a hell of a second game, I think.' Courtois' return saw Petr Cech drop out of the starting XI. Mourinho is happy to have two high-class goalkeepers fighting for one place in the team and Courtois knows he must be at his best to stay as number one. Courtois told the London Evening Standard: 'I was not 100 per cent fit last week. I still had pain in my thumb and it's not good to play if you know you can't help the team at the fullest. I have no pain in the thumb now. 'We have another top keeper who was there to play so the thinking was about the team. 'He is behind me and pushing me. I know in training that we are working hard and at a really high level. Petr is a top goalkeeper and I have to play well to continue to play. 'We are not busy being against each other, though, we just want to help the team. That's the important thing.'","Jose Mourinho wants a noisy home support to get the Blues to the final .

"Justin Thomas tied the course record to take a share of the lead at the Sony Open in Hawaii. The 21-year-old American carded a 61 on day two at the Waialae Country Club in Honolulu and now sits top of the leaderboard alongside Matt Kuchar and Webb Simpson on 12 under overall. Thomas made an inauspicious start on Friday, but kicked his round into over drive with a hat-trick of birdies on the 16th, 17th and 18th holes. Justin Thomas equalled the course record at the Waialae County Club in Honolulu to take a share of the lead . Matt Kuchar studies a putt on the 17th green as he shared the lead after two rounds of the Sony Open . Webb Simpson also earned a share of the lead at the half-way point of the Sony Open in Hawaii .

Kuchar put in a steady display, with a blemish-free round of 63 that was boosted by consecutive putts from more than 25 feet for birdies on the 12th and 13th holes. Simpson, who was an overnight leader alongside Englishman Paul Casey, bogeyed his fifth hole of the day but recovered by picking up five shots to retain his standing at the top. Casey, meanwhile, endured a more difficult second day and hit four bogeys as he made a par 70 to slip four shots behind the leaders. Ahead of him, South African Tim Clark was a model of consistency as he hit his second successive 65 to take a share of second place on 10 under.

He was joined by American Troy Merritt, who made light of a change in putter and swing, and after the morning wave the pair shared the lead before being pipped to the halfway post. Merritt explained afterwards that the changes were down to a desire to boost his short game and that decision came off as he found six birdies and no bogeys. 'When you don't have any confidence in the short game you start playing a little bit more conservative into greens,' he told the PGA Tour website. 'And for me that usually brings out more mistakes, so it brings out the worst in the short game, too.' He added: 'When I played really well at Boise State, I was releasing the club and hitting a draw. 'So I'm trying to kind of get back to that a little bit more, which is kind of a tough thing to do, to go from aiming 15 yards left to now looking 15 yards right and hoping it goes the other way.'

When he pointed it out to an official he was disqualified having played a shot with the club. 'He asked for a second opinion on the bend,' rules official John Mutch told the PGA Tour website. 'The bend in this club was about 10 inches up from the neck. It was substantial.' Elsewhere, Scot Russell Knox is three shots behind on nine under alongside Rory Sabbatini, while defending Sony Open champion Jimmy Walker is in a six-strong cluster on eight under.

"Scott Brown plans to speak with Gary Mackay-Steven before he joins Celtic – to ensure the Dundee United man knows exactly what he’s getting himself into. The Tannadice winger will move to Parkhead on a Bosman in the summer, with the outside chance of the move being advanced to this month if Celtic pay out around £200,000. After coming up against the 24-year-old on club business and seeing him step up to become a full Scotland international, Brown believes the player has the mental strength to go with the skill required to cut it at a bigger club. Scott Brown (right) says he plans to speak to Dundee United's Gary Mackay-Steven when he joins Celtic . Mackay-Steven (right) pictured playing against Celtic in 2013, is making the step up to Celtic . And, depending upon when the move is imminent, Brown intends to sit his future team-mate down to lay bare the realities of being a Celtic player. ‘I’ll speak to him before he turns up,’ Brown revealed. ‘I’ve met him a few times in Edinburgh because he stays there as well. He stays about five minutes up the road from me, so hopefully he can be my driver. ‘Coming to a club as big as Celtic, it takes everyone six months to understand the fan-base. ‘Even when it comes to going out to a restaurant in Glasgow, you find half the people love you and the other half hate you. It’s a big thing for newcomers to come in and accept this Rangers and Celtic divide - but I’m sure he’ll flourish.’ Brown was non-committal when asked if he’d prefer to see Mackay-Steven in Glasgow sooner rather than later. Brown says it takes new signings a while to get used to the Rangers-Celtic divide, and he will help the new man . Mackay-Steven has been at Dundee United since 2011, making more than 100 appearances for the SPL side . ‘That’s between the clubs, really. It would be great if he came but, if not, it’ll be great to see him at the end of the season.’ While Mackay-Steven’s arrival is now only a matter of time, Kris Commons’ immediate future is no clearer. The 31-year-old threw his boots to the visiting fans at Hamilton on Saturday, giving rise to the conclusion he was bidding farewell after four years in Glasgow. Ronny Deila has reiterated his belief that a long-term deal could yet be agreed - and Brown also hopes a compromise can be struck. Kris Commons' Celtic future is in doubt, and he increased speculation when he threw his boots into the crowd . Celtic boss Ronny Deila has reiterated that a long-term deal for Commons could still be agreed . ‘Anything can happen,’ he said. ‘Of course, we’d love him to stay but it’s between the gaffer, Peter (Lawwell) and Kris. If it doesn’t work, everyone at the club will be gutted to see him go. He’s a good character and a good guy around the changing room. He scores goals from nothing, so we’d be gutted to see him go but it’s up to him. There’s nothing anyone else can do. ‘He scored 30 goals last season and it is hard for anyone to score 30 goals in this league. He’s going to be a miss if he does go, but fingers’ crossed.’ Celtic can reclaim top place in the Premiership on Tuesday with a win against Motherwell. Brown is expecting to have to deal with the challenge of Aberdeen at the top of the table for some time yet . However, Brown, feels the challenge of Aberdeen is something Celtic should expect to live with over the course of the next four months. ‘You’ve got to think that. But they are four points behind us if we win both games in hand, halfway through January. It’s a great challenge from them. Hamilton and Dundee United have been doing really well as well, but we haven’t heard too much about them, it’s all been about Aberdeen.’ Meanwhile, Leeds manager Neil Redfearn is interested in signing Anthony Stokes – despite the Elland Road club currently being subject to a transfer embargo. Redfearn could yet take the Irishman to Yorkshire in the summer once the penalty the FA imposed for breaches of Financial Fair Play is lifted.","Gary Mackay-Steven is currently moving to Celtic on a free in the summer .

"Bolton are putting the finishing touches to their bid to lure Kris Commons from Celtic this month – despite Ronny Deila saying they are wasting their time. Sportsmail understands Bolton chairman Phil Gartside is about to test the resolve of the Parkhead club on the say-so of manager Neil Lennon. Lennon signed the player to Celtic from Derby in 2011 and has gone public with his desire to be re-united with him in Lancashire this month. Celtic winger Kris Commons applauds the travelling supports following the Bhoys 2-0 win at Hibernian . The Scotland winger hammers a shot off the bar during Celtic 2-0 win at Kilmarnock earlier this month . The 31-year-old midfielder is in the final six months of his contract but so far negotiations over a new two-year deal have been fruitless with the sticking point believed to be the appearance-related aspect of the second year. But not only does Deila feel any approach to take the player from his clutches now will be swiftly rejected, he firmly believes a middle ground in the talks will yet be found. ‘He’s not leaving in January,’ Deila stated. ‘We have to win the league. ‘He’s a good player and we want to keep the best ones. ‘The situation is still the same. We are talking together and will see if something can be agreed. ‘I still think it’s a possibility because we want to keep him and he wants to stay. That’s the most important thing. ‘If I didn’t want him and he didn’t want to stay it would be finished now.’ Commons appeared to be bidding farewell to the Celtic support when he threw his boots to the visiting fans at the end of Saturday’s 2-0 win at Hamilton. Commons threw his boots into the crowd after Celtic's win against Hamilton at the weekend . Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon, now with Bolton, is keen on bringing Commons to England . Deila is adamant he doesn’t need to address that matter – simply because the player is going nowhere. ‘I haven’t talked to him about that,’ he added. ‘I’ve only talked to him about his situation which is very clear and we’ll see what’s happening in the next few days. ‘I still think a deal can be done. I haven’t given that up. He still has to perform like we all have to do. It works both ways. ‘He’s a very good players and we’ll see if we can do this for a longer period. 'The situation is very clear. We want him and he wants to stay. It’s about the contract. ‘It’s hard to say how apart we are but we’re not agreeing. And when you do not agree, you do not agree. So we’ll see but we’re in negotiations so we’ll see what’s happening.’","Championship side Bolton want to sign Celtic winger Kris Commons .

"Hamilton Accies will charge fans just 10p per person to get into this weekend’s Scottish Premiership match against Inverness as a tribute to departed duo Alex Neil and Frankie McAvoy. Accies will be the second top-flight club to try an innovative scheme to boost attendances this winter, with Inverness trialling a pay-what-you-want scheme for Tuesday’s home clash with St Johnstone. Neil has taken over at English Championship side Norwich City and Accies assistant McAvoy will join him after Saturday’s visit of Caley Thistle to New Douglas Park. Hamilton Academical fans will have to pay 10p to watch Saturday's clash with Inverness Caledonian Thistle . Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie Macdonald came up with the idea of ‘The Perfect 10s’ tribute this weekend, as Neil graced Hamilton’s No 10 jersey with distinction as a player, while both he and McAvoy were at the Lanarkshire club for 10 years. Macdonald told Sportsmail: ‘Our fans put up banners saying goodbye and good luck to Alex during our recent match against Dundee United - and the club wanted to honour them, too. ‘I think too often in football, people leave football clubs under a cloud - even after doing very well. ‘But we could not be happier that Alex and Frankie’s great success and great football with Hamilton has resulted in them getting this opportunity at Norwich. ‘This club is all about wanting the very best for its employers and when they move on to better things we are delighted. Hamilton's interim player coach Martin Canning in action against Celtic on Saturday . ‘And with it being Frankie’s last game on Saturday, we thought there was no better time to do this tribute, by letting fans, home and away, in for just 10p. ‘It’s not about how many fans come through the gates, though. If anyone looks they will see that our crowds have been going up and we do a lot of work behind the scenes to connect with the local community. ‘This is about paying tribute to two men who gave this club so much and to show the esteem in which they are held at New Douglas Park. ‘We look forward to welcoming all our loyal supporters, and perhaps even some new ones as well, to send Frankie - and Alex - off in style with the acclaim they deserve,’ added Macdonald, who hopes that Neil’s successor will be in place within seven days. Canning stands in the dugout as he spoke to the press before last week's match .","Hamilton fans will be charged just 10p to attend the match at weekend .

"Celtic boss Ronny Deila has offered his apologies to Dundee United counterpart Jackie McNamara who has criticised his conduct in the Gary Mackay-Steven deal. The 24-year-old Tannadice winger last week signed a pre-contract agreement which will see him join the Hoops in the summer. To McNamara's ire, Deila spoke publicly of taking him during the transfer window, although the reported fee of £250,000 is a stumbling block. Celtic have signed Dundee United winger Gary Mackay-Steven on a pre-contract agreement . Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara has hit out at Celtic's attempt to acquire Mackay-Steven . The former Parkhead defender said: 'I like to speak about players behind the scenes and I don't think it's right to speak publicly about it. He (Deila) has his own way of doing things but I wouldn't want to speak about one of his players under contract.' Ahead of the visit of Motherwell on Wednesday, where Celtic will leapfrog Aberdeen to the top of the Scottish Premiership table with a win, the Norwegian appeared somewhat surprised by McNamara's complaint but was suitably contrite. 'I just have to say sorry if that offended him in any way,' he said. 'This is a rule that I haven't heard before so I have to learn from this. 'I was at a smaller cub in Norway and everybody wanted my players all the time. But I am happy that they want my players because (that means) I did something well. 'But if he didn't like it I have to apologise for that and think about it the next time.' Celtic manager Ronny Deila has apologised if he 'offended' McNamara 'in any way' during the deal . Before the McNamara question was posed, Deila responded to a question about possibly bringing the Scotland cap in before the transfer window closed. He said: 'We will see what is happening. We know we have him in the summer. 'It is not in our hands. Dundee United are doing well so I understand they want to keep their squad together.' While looking forward to the addition of Mackay-Steven to his squad, Deila is no further forward in persuading Kris Commons to sign a new deal. The 31-year-old Hoops midfielder, out of contract at the end of the season, threw his boots into the Celtic fans following the 2-0 win over Hamilton at New Douglas Park on Saturday, suggesting that he could be on his way, with Bolton - managed by former Celtic boss Neil Lennon - a possible destination. The 24-year-old Mackay-Steven scores against Hamilton during a Scottish Premiership match . Deila played the boots symbolism down, saying: 'I haven't seen the footage but I haven't thought about it. This is something big for you, not so big for me. 'I know what is going on and will see what is happening. We are speaking together, we want him to stay here and he wants to stay.' Deila was in the directors' box at Ibrox on Friday night to see League Cup semi-final opponents Rangers play Championship rivals Hearts. However, he left without learning too much after the game was abandoned after 24 minutes due to the unplayable pitch. The Parkhead side confirmed that the 24-year-old Scotland cap will join the Scottish champions this summer . Deila arrived at the ground while there was a demonstration by Gers fans outside the main door against the board, which allowed the former Stromsgodset boss to slip in unnoticed. He said: 'It went well. I seems there are bigger problems there than me.' On the subject of their traditional rivals, Deila was asked about predecessor Martin O'Neill's comments in which he claimed the top-flight in Scotland has suffered from the absence of Rangers. The Hoops boss said: 'I have answered many times. The best clubs are in the top division. 'At the minute, the teams who are in the Premiership are the best clubs.'","Celtic have agreed pre-contract for Gary Mackay-Steven in £250,000 deal .

"Ronald Koeman believes Alan Pardew has turned Crystal Palace into a much tougher side than the one Southampton so easily overcame a month ago. Saints' 3-1 triumph at Selhurst Park on Boxing Day proved the catalyst for change in south London. Neil Warnock was promptly sacked by the struggling Eagles, who head into Saturday's FA Cup fourth-round tie at St Mary's riding the crest of a wave. Alan Pardew left his post at Newcastle United earlier this month to replace Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace . Jason Puncheon scores for Crystal Palace during a 3-2 comeback win for Pardew's side away at Burnely . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has heaped praise on Pardew for the turnaround he has overseen . The appointment of Pardew has brought with it an impressive change in fortunes at Palace, with their former player overseeing three successive wins in all competitions. 'They have a spirit in the team, the confidence and they have had a great start (under Pardew),' Koeman said of Palace. 'The first win (against Dover) was normally an easy FA Cup round for them, but the first victory in the Premier League against Tottenham Hotspur gave everybody confidence. 'At the moment they are more difficult to beat than over Christmas on Boxing Day. 'They have new players and a new manager and that always means some changes in tactics or organisation in the team and I think the manager is more happy than he was before, and that's important.' Crystal Palace forward Dwight Gayle has been in superb form for The Eagles since Pardew took over . Pardew, who spent four years as a player at Selhurst Park, has proved very popular with Eagles fans . Palace sit 13th in the standings ahead of Pardew's trip to the club he led to the Johnstone's Paint Trophy in 2010. Jose Fonte started that 4-1 defeat of Carlisle and will captain Saints this weekend as they continue their campaign to reach Wembley for the first time since then. 'I am lucky,' Koeman said. 'I don't have a lot of numbers of players to think about to make changes. 'The players who wasn't available in the last week are still not available for this weekend. 'That means we have 17 or 18 players and of that 17 or 18 players we have already five or six Under-21 players. 'There is no time and no reason to think about making changes and we will put out the strongest team we can.' Southampton's 2-1 win against Newcastle last weekend extended their unbeaten run to eight games . Toby Alderweireld, Victor Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin are among those unavailable, joining long-term absentees Sam Gallagher and Jay Rodriguez in the treatment room. International commitments mean Sadio Mane, Emmanuel Mayuka and Maya Yoshida further reduce numbers, but Saints do have the momentum of a eight-match unbeaten run on their side and a sell-out St Mary's crowd. 'We had some days off this week, we didn't play during the week,' Koeman said. 'The players are back in a good freshness and in a mental way I think the players are very strong because we are winning. 'We had a great week last week with very good results in difficult games and we like to go on.'

"Manchester City emerged 2-0 victors in a rather awkward-feeling fixture against Hamburg in the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. Starting with a relatively strong line up including Frank Lampard, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic, boss Manuel Pellegrini used this an opportunity to give many of his starlets some much-needed first team experience. Despite Jovetic and Dzeko both gladly putting their names on the score sheet, there was some sad news for the Blues as Thierry Ambrose came off injured just eight minutes after coming on at half time. Host commentator . Ultimately Manchester City will be the happier of the two teams. A good second half display from Manuel Pellegrini's men as they return to England with a 2-0 victory against Hamburg. Next up - Middlesbrough! Thanks for tuning in everyone! There is a feeling this game is winding down to a close now. City will be happy with the result, Hamburg not so much after their spritely start to the match. Jovetic shows his composure to beat the on-rushing Hamburg goalkeeper Rene Adler . Pablo Zabaleta on for Aleksandar Kolarov Martin Demichelis replaces Bacary SagnaGael Clichy on for James Milner . Tenacious work from James Milner leads to him crossing the ball for Edin Dzeko, who similarly to Jovetic, controls with his chest and directs the ball into the back of the net. Sergio Aguero is put through but still has some work to do as the Hamburg defence triple up on him. The limited crowd are going wild every time the Argentine touches the ball. Zoltan Stieber makes way for Gojko KacarSlobodan Rajkovic is brought off for Heiko Westermann . Jovetic comes off as Aguero comes on to a rapturous applause. One quirky Manchester City fan skipped a day in the library to be here today. Let's hope his dad isn't watching! After a good phase of play from Hamburg, Boyata is there to read the game well and cut out a through ball to Gouaida. Nicolai Muller on for Rafael Van der Vaart . Maximilian Beister comes on for Innocent Emeghara . Jesus Navas on for Ambrose . There's a slight coming together between Hamburg goalkeeper Adler and and Thierry Ambrose, who is 8 minutes into his first team debut. As the City forward goes for an overhead kick, Adler clatters into him and they both land in a pile. The stretcher is brought on and the 17-year-old is withdrawn as quickly as he was brought on. A great long ball from Evans finds Jovetic in the box, who chests and blast home. Adler just fails to do enough to stop it but it rolls in. Ambrose on for Fernando . Evans on for Lampard . Rene Adler on for Jaroslav DrobnyMarcell Jansen replaces Ronny MarcosCleber on for Johan Djourou . Who can break the deadlock? Let's find out shall we? Relatively dull opening 40 minutes or so. The action only really began with City's double chance and the disallowed Hamburg goal when Stieber's strike was ricocheted in off one of his own players in an offside position. Kolarov takes an out-swinging corner from the left and Sagna strikes, but it is deflected narrowly wide. A corner is then taken from the other side and it ends up with Jovetic, who tries to curl one into the top corner but it goes just over. Rafael van der Vaart has a free kick from 30 yards blocked by the wall. The ball rebounds back to the feet of the former Tottenham man, but his half-volley takes a deflection into the thankful hands of Caballero. Manchester City's James Milner once again drives down the right towards the Hamburg goal, but just before he is able to pull the trigger he is intercepted. City try to work a short corner in the follow up, but it comes to nothing. Possession mainly being held in the midfield area as we head past the half hour mark. Hamburg still probing away but they are yet to make any real clear cut chances . Patient build up for City this time, who are looking to find a way through the Hamburg midfield. Mangala is cautioned for a silly tackle on the edge of his own box, but the resulting free kick fails to test the goalkeeper. Dzeko is slipped through by Barker and he shoots from just inside the box, but it is blocked out for a corner. James Milner is looking most likely down that right flank as he drills another low ball across the penalty box box Stevan Jovetic fails to meet it at the back stick. The ball falls to Fernando on the edge of the box but his shot is blazed over. Hamburg are happy to build up play with some patient possession, which ends with Van der Vaart letting rip from 25 yards. Caballero deals with it well. First real chance of the game goes to City as James Milner squares a ball across the box. But it is cleared for a corner. The Manchester City players get limbered up ahead of the mid-week friendly clash. 7 min: Rafael van der Vaart finds an opportunity to squeeze in a shot but it merely dribbles towards goal. The Blues clearly want to show off their domestic prowess as the teams pass the illustrious Premier League trophy. The City squad turned up in style to the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium. The 36-year-old will no doubt want to take this opportunity to prove to Pellegrini that he is fit for a regular starting berth in his title chasing side. Hamburg captain Van der Vaart knows Premier League defences well, having played two seasons at Tottenham Hotspur. The Dutchman has three goals for his club this season and will be looking to keep the City midfield quiet. Manchester City face Hamburg in a specially-arranged midweek friendly at the Hazza Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi. The match will be used as preparation for Hamburg as they gear up for the resumption of their season, while City will use the match to get their players in-tune ahead of their FA Cup match against Middlesbrough. City boss Manuel Pellegrini has fielded a strong side with the likes of James Milner and Edin Dzeko starting. Will he rue this decision in a meaningless game? Hamburg starting XI: Drobny, Gotz, Djourou, Rajkovic, Marcos, Jiracek, Emeghara, van der Vaart, Stieber, Gouaida, Rudnevs .

"West Ham boss Sam Allardyce insists the club will have the financial clout to tie up a permanent deal for Alex Song in the summer. The 27-year-old is enjoying a fine start to his time at Upton Park having moved to the club on loan from Barcelona at the start of the season. The former Arsenal midfielder is attracting interest from some of the Premier League's biggest clubs, with the Gunners and Liverpool believed to be looking into the possibility of bringing the ex-Cameroon international back to England on a permanent basis. West Ham United's Alex Song challenges Alex Oxlaide-Chaimberlain for the ball against former club Arsenal . Sam Allardyce is confident that West Ham have enough summer spending money to sign Song in the summer . But Allardyce feels that the Hammers will be able to compete with those clubs for Song's signature and still remain within the constraints of Financial Fair-Play. ""I think that next year is next year's budget and there's a considerable amount of fund available next season,"" he replied when asked if West Ham could be priced out of a move. ""They can't be spent this season because we're at the extreme of that budget but next year is a completely new budget. ""So, affordable? It depends on what Barcelona are looking for and what Alex is looking for, that negotiation will happen at some stage in or around that period."" Song shows his appreciation for the West Ham faithful during the 2-1 home win against Manchester City . Having brought in a number of new faces in the summer, Allardyce is likely to have to remain in the loan market if he is to bolster his squad in the January window and the 60-year-old does not envisage many deals in or out of Upton Park. ""We're Financial Fair Played with no money available at the moment,"" he added. ""I think what money we do have available is only wages so if a player pops up within that wage structure with what we've got left with financial fair play - and we feel it's somebody who could have an immediate impact on the team - then we will pursue it but we think that's highly unlikely in this window. Song is still a Barcelona player but looks set for a permanent switch away from the Nou Camp this summer . ""But you never know what turns up in the next two or three weeks. We will never say never but probably highly unlikely."" Allardyce also said there has been no change in Winston Reid's situation despite a reported interest from Arsenal in the New Zealand defender. Reid, 26, is out of contract in the summer but Allardyce has insisted in recent weeks he will not allow the player to leave on the cheap this month. Arsenal have been struggling for numbers in defensive positions for much of the season and have again been hit by a long-term injury to Mathieu Debuchy. Winston Reid looks set for the West Ham exit doors with the New Zealand international yet to agree a new deal . They have Carl Jenkinson on loan at West Ham but Allardyce does not believe there is a chance he could be recalled to the Emirates Stadium before his deal runs out at the end of the campaign. ""I'm 99 per cent sure he's ours for the season to be fair,"" he said. ""I don't think there is a call back clause in this month."" The Hammers welcome Hull to Upton Park on Sunday looking for their first Premier League win since December 20, having failed to pick up a victory in their last four league outings. Hull have won twice in that time but Steve Bruce's Tigers are embroiled in the relegation battle and could travel to east London bottom of the table if results on Saturday go against them.

"Luke Walsh is in danger of missing the start of the new Super League season but St Helens coach Kieron Cunningham is determined not to rush the influential playmaker back into action. Walsh was a Man of Steel contender after making an impressive start to his career in England but he missed the last two months of the 2014 season with a broken leg and was among a host of key players watching the club's Grand Final triumph from the sidelines. The goalkicking Australian scrum-half will miss Sunday's rematch with Wigan but Cunningham is confident he will be back playing well before the Super League champions take on South Sydney in the World Club Challenge on February 22. St Helens' Luke Walsh is in danger of missing the start of the new Super League season due to injury . 'We're looking at round one or round two, that was always the target,' Cunningham said. 'If he can play at least one game before the World Club Challenge, I'll be a very happy person.' Walsh, who still finished the season as Saints' leading scorer, has recovered from his broken leg but his comeback has been delayed by ankle surgery. 'The leg is completely healed, he just had an issue with his ankle which was grumbling and grumbling,' Cunningham said. 'We couldn't do the ankle surgery at the same time as the leg surgery so we've had to wait for that to get right first and then we did the ankle. Every day is a new challenge and he's making strides. 'When Luke Walsh takes to the field, it will be like a breath of fresh air for everyone.'

"James Haskell has urged Danny Cipriani to chase a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' in France next season if excluded from England's Six Nations squad. Haskell believes former Wasps team-mate Cipriani must not fall into the trap of 'hanging on' too long in the hope of rekindling his England career. Sale fly-half Cipriani is expected to be named in England's second-string Saxons squad on Wednesday, in a senior snub that could lead him to join Toulon in the summer. The decision to omit Sale playmaker Danny Cipriani may prompt him to move across the Channel next season . 27-year-old Cipriani posted this on his Instagram, proving he is working hard on his fitness at Sale Sharks . Talisman centre Manu Tuilagi could miss the entire Six Nations with continued groin trouble, while George Ford, Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler are primed to be selected at fly-half ahead of Cipriani. 'I think the problem is you can be hanging on your entire life,' former Stade Francais flanker Haskell told Press Association Sport of Cipriani's position. 'Sometimes your face doesn't fit, or there's too much competition around, and you need to make the right decision to suit yourself and suit your game. England head coach Stuart Lancaster will announce his Six Nations squad on Wednesday . The England head coach has twice assured Cipriani that he remains in his plans in the past two weeks . 'I don't regret one minute going to France, it was one of the best experiences of my life. 'If I thought it would have affected my England chances, because the rules were different then, then I probably wouldn't go. 'If I was on the fringe of the squad looking to play rugby and I had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to go and play in France, you've got to go and play in France, haven't you? 'I think that's what you've got to do. But everyone is different. Only he knows what the England coaches are saying to him, only he knows his own situation. 'But I respect anyone who broadens their horizons, Toby Flood chose to go to Toulouse. Wasps flanker James Haskell claims playing rugby in France is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . 'The worst thing you can do is get to 33 having hung on and still not really been involved, then gone over and miss the entire boat.' Haskell believes nine-cap Cipriani will face a difficult decision on whether to move across the channel in the summer if deemed England's fourth-choice fly-half. England stick rigidly to the policy of not selecting overseas-based players unless in 'exceptional circumstances'. 'George (Ford) has been eased in and turned out to be outstanding,' said Haskell. The 29-year-old, in action for club side Wasps, is set to be named in Lancaster's England Six Nations squad . 'Danny's unlucky because there are some very good 10s about, I think he has been unlucky not to be involved as much and it must be frustrating for him - because he would get into most teams or most squads, but England are blessed with some good backs. 'I've no doubt that if he keeps sticking with it he will keep knocking at that door because a couple of injuries and he's right in the mix. 'But I think certainly he has the skill-set, the attitude now and the ability to perform.' Exeter's Thomas Waldrom could step up to fill the void from Ben Morgan's leg break at number eight, while 36-year-old Nick Easter has been pressing for a recall with his form at Harlequins. Haskell has settled at openside flanker at Wasps, but said he is ready to fill the number-eight breach as back-up to Billy Vunipola if required. Nick Easter is another in-form player who needs a last-minute change of heart from England’s coaches . 'I'd do it without thinking about it,' he said. 'I've played what I think are some of my best games for England at eight. But you never know what's going to happen. 'I think there is enough cover in the squad to cope with the injuries.

"Warren Gatland has revealed that a glowing recommendation from one of world rugby's outstanding coaches played its part in New Zealand-born Gareth Anscombe making an unlikely journey from Super Rugby to potential Wales Test star. Anscombe, 23, is among four uncapped players in Wales head coach Gatland's 34-man squad for this season's RBS 6 Nations Championship. Despite making just nine appearances as a Cardiff Blues player, the former Auckland and Chiefs fly-half will report for Wales duty next week, joining forces with fellow number 10s Dan Biggar and Rhys Priestland. The Chief's Gareth Anscombe has received a surprise call-up to the Wales Six Nations squad . Anscombe, who had a spell with Cardiff Blues, was given a glowing recommendation by Wayne Smith . Friday, 6 February: England (Cardiff) Sunday, 15 February: Scotland (Murrayfield) Saturday, 28 February: France (Paris) Saturday, 14 March: Ireland (Cardiff) Saturday, 21 March: Italy (Rome) Anscombe, whose mother was born in Wales, offers Gatland options at fly-half and full-back. And the Wales boss says a conversation he had with Wayne Smith, who worked with Anscombe at the Chiefs and will rejoin New Zealand's coaching staff this year after helping to mastermind their 2011 World Cup triumph, provided an invaluable guide. 'I had a good chat to Wayne Smith about him, and Wayne couldn't speak more highly,' Gatland said. 'He thought he was very coachable, he wanted to learn. 'They were very impressed by him at the Chiefs, both as a player and as a person. 'When that recommendation comes from someone like Wayne Smith, you've got to take notice of that. 'I met with Gareth here (in Wales) with his dad a bit longer than 12 months ago. We sat down and had a chat. Warren Gatland has allowed Anscombe the option of returning to New Zealand to hold out for the All Blacks . 'With his mother being born in Cardiff, we knew that he was an option for Wales, and the discussion was a very general one. 'There was no pressure from us in terms of his declaration, and if he wanted to go back to New Zealand, play Super Rugby and continue the dreams and aspirations to be in the All Blacks, I didn't have a problem with that. 'He went back and had another season with the Chiefs, and I think Gareth then thought that for him to fulfil his dream of playing international rugby, the best opportunity for him was to come to the Blues and make himself for Wales in the short term, and hopefully the long term. 'He has the ability to play at 10 and 15, and goalkick as well. We really want to have a good look at him in this window and see how he goes.' Forwards: Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues), Paul James (Bath), Rob Evans (Scarlets), Aaron Jarvis (Ospreys), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Scott Andrews (Cardiff Blues), Richard Hibbard (Gloucester), Kristian Dacey (Cardiff Blues), Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Jake Ball (Scarlets), Bradley Davies (Wasps), Luke Charteris (Racing Metro), Dan Lydiate (Ospreys), James King (Ospreys), Sam Warburton (Cardiff Blues, capt), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). Backs: Mike Phillips (Racing Metro), Rhys Webb (Ospreys), Gareth Davies (Scarlets), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Gareth Anscombe (Cardiff Blues), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues), Jamie Roberts (Racing Metro), Jonathan Davies (Clermont Auvergne), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Tyler Morgan (Newport Gwent Dragons), Hallam Amos (Newport Gwent Dragons), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), George North (Northampton Saints), Liam Williams (Scarlets), Leigh Halfpenny (Toulon). Anscombe, who helped New Zealand win the Junior World Championship earlier in his career, is joined in the squad by fellow Test rookies in Newport Gwent Dragons centre Tyler Morgan, Scarlets prop Rob Evans and Blues hooker Kristian Dacey. There are no places, though, for 95 times-capped Blues prop Adam Jones or Gloucester fly-half James Hook. Hook's omission is not a surprise - he was left out of Gatland's autumn Test squad earlier this season - yet 33-year-old Jones had been tipped for a recall after Scarlets forward Rhodri Jones suffered a shoulder injury. Anscombe, Tyler Morgan (above), Rob Evans and Kristian Dacey are among four rookies to be called up . But Gatland has chosen Samson Lee, Aaron Jarvis and Scott Andrews as his three tighthead props, raising fresh question marks over Jones' international future. 'It was a long debate about leaving Adam out because we know he has been working hard,' Gatland added. 'We know his experience, and if we do get injuries we can call him in. It is about us developing some strength in depth in that position that we don't have a huge amount of. 'With Adam at the moment we don't see him as a player who comes off the bench, we see him as a starter in that position if he does come into the squad.' Lee is currently sidelined with a neck problem, although every indication is that he will be fit for Wales' high-octane Six Nations opener against England in Cardiff on February 6. Gloucester star James Hook (right) did not make it into Gatland's squad . Elsewhere in the squad, there is a recall for fit-again Scarlets scrum-half Gareth Davies, who joins fellow number nines Rhys Webb and Mike Phillips, with Morgan featuring among the centres. Morgan, who is among seven players to have so far signed a national dual contract in Wales, has also been named in the Wales Under-20 squad for their Six Nations campaign, and he will be released from the senior camp to link up with the age group side. Wales will also face England in their World Cup pool later this year, while the Six Nations campaign also features away games against Scotland, France and Italy, plus a Millennium Stadium appointment with Ireland.","Gareth Anscombe was surprise selection in Wales 2015 Six Nations squad .

"Wigan have announced that rising star Joe Burgess will leave the club at the end of the 2015 Super League season and join Sydney Roosters. The 20-year-old winger, who burst onto the scene in spectacular fashion in 2014, is out of contract with the Warriors this year and the club have failed to persuade him to sign a new deal. 'We did everything we could but he wants to experience the Sydney lifestyle,' Wigan's football general manager and director Kris Radlinski told a fans forum at the DW Stadium on Thursday night. Wigan have announced that rising star Joe Burgess will leave the club at the end of the Super League season . Widely regarded as one of the hottest properties in the game, Burgess played and scored against the Roosters in the World Club Challenge clash at the start of last season in Sydney. Wigan-born Burgess, who came through the club's junior system, scored 23 tries in his first full season of Super League, including the Warriors' only touchdown in their Grand-Final defeat by St Helens in October. The 20-year-old, who burst onto the scene in 2014, is out of contract with the Warriors this year . He went on to earn a place in the England squad for the 2014 Four Nations Series, celebrating his 20th birthday on the flight to Brisbane, but was a non-playing member of the squad. Burgess, who has been handed Wigan's number five jersey for the new season, will be the latest high-profile player to switch from Super League to the NRL. Seven members of the 24-strong England squad plied their trade in the NRL in 2014, including former Wigan full-back Sam Tomkins, and they have since been joined by former Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson.

"Sam Allardyce does not regret cupping his ear in an act of defiance to the boo-boys who jeered his West Ham side off after last season's home win over Hull. An unconvincing 2-1 victory over the Tigers, who were reduced to 10 men, saw the Hammers players greeted with howls of derision at full-time, with Allardyce responding by turning and cupping his ear to the crowd. A number of West Ham fans had turned on the Hammers manager after a season which did not live up to expectations, although the win over Hull took them up to 11th in the Premier League table at the time. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce reacts to the boos after the 2-1 win over Hull last season . Steve Bruce takes his Hull side back to Upton Park on Sunday and it will be the visitors who are under more pressure for a result this time out as they go into the game inside the relegation zone. West Ham have enjoyed a better start to the season and sit eighth, just one point shy of the 34 they had amassed after the win over Hull last March 31 games into the campaign. And Allardyce revealed ahead of the clash that he resorted to the gesture to detract from fans directly criticising the players - and was happy to take the heat instead. 'I've never had a problem with the fans cheering or booing,' he said. 'It is part of the game, part of what you have to accept - part of a life today that has become ever-more demanding. West Ham were buoyed by midweek penalty shootout victory over Everton in the FA Cup . 'People that pay money are allowed to express their opinion whether you think it is right or wrong. My fear was how much it affected the players, not how much it affected me. 'I would take the stick, I would take the pressure off them by creating the cupping of the ear. I thought it was unfair at that particular time. 'They could vent their anger at me, no problem. But keep away from the players because if you affect them then they don't play here, then they are frightened to play here. 'When they get to that stage they can't perform to their best and it is a vicious circle then. At that particular time it was about winning, it didn't matter how we won as long as we won - and we did win.' West Ham are currently eighth in the Premier League after collecting 33 points from 21 games . Allardyce felt the frustration came from the terraces after a season which could have ended with relegation, but this campaign things are different and the 60-year-old believes his players are shining because of that. 'It was a hugely important victory but I wasn't surprised,' he said. 'I knew we weren't playing as well as we should have done and because 10 men sit back and say 'break us down' fans get really frustrated. 'Frustration can over-spill into an emotion and that happens in football. But it moves on and it is chip paper. It is not water under the bridge, it is in the Atlantic it is that far gone. It was a difficult period last year because we were where we were. 'We were all worried about getting relegated and the fans were going: 'here we go again, how are we going to get out of this?' But we did and this year there is a whole different vibe around the place because of how the players have thrilled the fans, especially at home. Andy Carroll and Enner Valencia are likely to start against Hull on Sunday . 'The fans will always stay with the team, even if the team is behind, if we are playing well.' Despite their improved points tally, the Hammers have not won in their last four league outings and will be hopeful of putting that right at the expense of Hull. Allardyce has a near-fit squad to select from with only Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate missing, the latter having linked up with Senegal ahead of the African Nations Cup. Sakho was also initially called into the same squad but pulled out after suffering a back injury, with Allardyce criticising the Senegal medical staff for mistreating a previous ailment. Allardyce admits he is unsure when he would be free to select Sakho again once he has overcome the back issue so Andy Carroll and Enner Valencia are likely to start against Hull, with Carlton Cole once again on the bench despite scoring as a substitute in the FA Cup third-round penalty shoot-out win over Everton on Tuesday.","Sam Allardyce cupped his ear in an act of defiance to boo-boys last season .

"Brendan Rodgers hailed Raheem Sterling’s brilliance and insisted he is the man to fire Liverpool to Wembley. The revitalised Liverpool forward showed the benefits of a mid-season break in the Caribbean by scoring a magnificent goal to ensure the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final with Chelsea ended 1-1. After Eden Hazard had put Chelsea ahead with a penalty, Liverpool roared back and Sterling scored a magnificent goal, waltzing past Nemanja Matic and Gary Cahill before finishing confidently with his left foot. Raheem Sterling's superb second-half strike means Liverpool's semi-final is firmly poised . Sterling watches on as his shot evades Thibaut Courtois and nestles into the far corner . Sterling celebrates his goal with Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho . Only a string of superb saves from Thibaut Courtois kept Jose Mourinho’s team in the game – Liverpool had 20 shots compared to the six of Chelsea – and Rodgers has no doubt Liverpool are ready to go to Stamford Bridge and win. Rodgers, who hopes Daniel Sturridge will be fit for the second leg, said: ‘The rest has done him the world of good. He was outstanding. He has that ability to move in behind but he can also exploit the space in front. ‘His speed was frightening to come in and finish, wonderful goal. He certainly deserved that. We are getting better as each game goes on. This is a team that has done very well. We have to keep our focus and concentration and we will try to continue to perform in that way. Eden Hazard  put the Blues ahead from the penalty spot before the break . ‘You see defensively how we were: aggressive, compact. Chelsea have got top-class players. I thought the performance was a benchmark. There is absolutely no doubt we can go to the second leg and get the performance we need to go through.’ Sterling added: ‘It’s always good to get on the scoresheet and help the team out. I’ve felt the benefit of the break because there are times you need a bit of rest and the manager gave me some time off and it’s helped. We’re still in the tie and Chelsea will be difficult but helpfully we can get a result.’ Rodgers felt referee Martin Atkinson missed two big decisions, one when Diego Costa appeared to handle in the area and another when Courtois, returning after a three-match absence, carried the ball out of his area. That was the only blemish on Courtois’ outstanding display. Brendan Rodgers and Jose Mourinho shake hands at the final whistle after the 1-1 draw at Anfield . Mourinho said: ‘The Premier League is full of top goalkeepers but we have the two best so for me it is so easy and to have both playing so well and giving so much confidence to the team the players don’t care who plays.’ Chelsea’s manager later appeared to take a dig at Liverpool for letting Steven Gerrard leave when his contract expires. When asked if he would make a cheeky bid to sign him, Mourinho told 5 Live: 'Or perhaps to take him on loan? I would love the Premier League to keep the best players and I believe he has the quality to play for more years.’","Raheem Sterling earned Liverpool 1-1 draw against Chelsea at Anfield .

"Crystal Palace have shown an interest in Sevilla midfielder Stephane Mbia. The 28-year-old is available on a free transfer and is keen on a return to the Premier League. The  holding midfielder, who is currently on Africa Cup of Nations duty with Cameroon, is on a short-term contract with Spanish side Sevilla but has an agreement with the club that he can leave in this window. Palace, as well as Everton, have already held tentative talks with his representatives and the 28-year-old is ready to make the move back to England where he has retained a flat in Chelsea. Stephane Mbia is currently on international duty with Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations . Between 2009 and 2012, Mbia played for Marseille in France before moving to the Premier League with QPR . Mbia had a spell at Queens Park Rangers in 2012 after joining in a swap deal that saw Joey Barton go on loan to Marseille. Rangers suffered as their large influx of new players failed to gel and they were relegated. However, Mbia went on loan to Sevilla where he showed his ability and helped guide Sevilla to Europa League victory over Benfica, scoring his penalty in the shootout. He was named in the Europa League team of the year and was nominated for best African player in the Spanish league. He is now on a short-term deal at La Liga side Sevilla, and has played 11 times for them . Mbia poses for Sportsmail during his time in the Premier League with Queens Park Rangers . His agent Jean-Paul Ndoumin said: 'Stephane signed a short-term contract with Sevilla as he wanted the opportunity in this window to discuss a return to the Premier League. It is a league that excites him and one he believes is the most challenging and he likes a challenge. 'He feels the Premier League didn't see the best of him at QPR and he wants to put that right. He doesn't want to wait until the last minute; he is ready to move now.' Several Premier League sides are searching for a holding midfielder and Mbia has the attributes. He can also sign a pre-contract for the summer.","Stephane Mbia is currently on a short-term deal at La Liga side Sevilla .

"England cricketers are used to getting a hard time Down Under – mainly at the crease. But Eoin Morgan, the new captain of the nation’s one-day team, wasn’t prepared for the bouncer hurled at him yesterday from outside the ground. Hours before he was due to lead out his side against Australia, the 28-year-old batsman found himself at the centre of a bizarre blackmail plot involving lurid sex messages and videos. Scroll down for video . England cricket captain Eoin Morgan, pictured with his current girlfriend Tara Ridgway, was the focus of a £35,000 blackmail plot over a fling with an Australian woman five years ago, it was revealed today . The emails were traced to a man named by Australian media as safety consultant Nick Emery (above). He is pictured with a woman named as Brooke Tsakirakis - who is said to be at the centre of the claims . The jealous fiancé of a woman Morgan had dated five years ago threatened to reveal graphic details of the affair unless he was paid £35,000 to keep quiet. Nick Emery said he would release ‘sexually-based’ messages and videos featuring Morgan unless he was paid the money before the start of England’s match today. The safety consultant from Tasmania said he had come across ‘some interesting Skype calls’ between his fiancée – understood to be Brooke Tsakirakis – and Morgan. Emery told reporters: ‘I have got a fair bit of interesting content regarding Eoin Morgan with a woman who isn’t his girlfriend ... there’s sexual content. It’s my partner.’ The England Cricket Board said it had received an email, demanding money be paid or details of Morgan's previous relationship, including videos, would be given to both the UK and Australian press. The cricketer is seen left after he was caught out against Australia last week, and right taking on India last year . In one interview with the Australian press yesterday, Emery claimed he had found compromising messages between the pair from just last year. Morgan, who has been dating Australian model and law student Tara Ridgway for the last three years, is understood to have had a relationship with Miss Tsakirakis five years ago while he was playing cricket in Australia. Yesterday the England and Wales Cricket Board took the extraordinary step of releasing details of the plot amid fears that speculation surrounding the dalliance could disrupt the match. The board also disputed Emery’s claim that there was some kind of relationship between the pair last year, insisting that the dalliance took place five years ago when both parties were single. A college of happy photographs of Emery and Miss Tsakirakis, which he posted on social media . Dublin-born Morgan, who was made captain of the one-day side last month, was due to lead the team out in Hobart at 3am, UK time, today. The ECB immediately told Scotland Yard of the blackmail plot after receiving two emails from Emery. UK detectives then tracked him down within 24 hours with the help of colleagues in Australia. After meeting ECB officials and Australian police officers, Emery said he had made a mistake because he was in a ‘bad head space’. Speaking to the Melbourne-based Herald Sun newspaper, he said: ‘It’s done. It’s dealt with. I did the wrong thing in the wrong state of mind. Emery's girlfriend has been named by Australian media as Brooke Tsakirakis (pictured) ‘I wanted to catch her out in a big way. I was in a very angry and bad head space. Everything is sorted now. They were very understanding. We came to an agreement.’ He said he had stumbled upon the messages when his partner backed up her phone on his computer. Emery added: ‘It was a stupid mistake on her behalf. I knew something went on between them a long time ago.’ He said he had called Morgan’s number to confirm it was the cricketer, but had not confronted either of them. The blackmailer gave no indication to his friends or family about what he was planning to do. Instead, he posted a picture of himself and Miss Tsakirakis smiling on his Facebook page last week. The cricketer, 28, is currently in a relationship with Ms Ridgway (left), who is studying law and public relations at Bond University in Australia . The couple are thought to have met during the 2010/11 Ashes series in Australia, which England went on to with 3-1 . Morgan and Ms Ridgway pictured together in Australia earlier this month . In October he wrote: ‘This time one year ago I met this hottie for a coffee. 12 months on we still meet for coffee, every morning in the kitchen. She keeps me real, she believes in me and I love her loads.’ A month later he announced their engagement over Facebook. His fiancée is not thought to have known about the plot until police became involved. Yesterday Paul Downton, managing director of the ECB, said: ‘There were references to a relationship that Eoin Morgan had five years ago with a single Australian lady. It was a brief relationship and what appears to be a fairly deliberate attempt to extort a sum of money from the ECB. ‘The individual, who comes from Hobart, demanded that the money be paid before the first ball was played on Friday. ‘The suspect has been identified as an Australian resident of Hobart who is the new boyfriend of the woman Morgan dated five years ago. The individual is understood to have found a phone with details of Morgan’s relationship. ‘He has now apologised saying it was not intended to go this far.’ Mr Downton said the ECB would not be pressing charges against Emery. Police declined to comment. Morgan (centre) today with his teammates James Taylor and Tim Bresnan.

"Pleaded guilty: High school teacher and baseball coach pleaded guilty to sexual assault against a 15-year-old nearly 20 years ago . A Vancouver high school teacher and baseball coach pleaded guilty on Thursday to abusing a 15-year-old boy nearly 20 years ago  when he was a pitcher on a minor league baseball team. Eric Estes, 42, was living with the alleged victim's family in Maryland in 1997 while playing for Baltimore Orioles affiliates the Frederick Keys and the Bowie Baysox. The alleged abuse took place between April and September of 1997. Estes would have been around 24 at the time. Oregon Live reports that Estes was put on paid administrative leave in May 2014 and that the school has begun the process of firing him following an investigation. Estes was a teacher in the Vancouver school district for 14 years and taught social studies. He was a teacher at Skyview High School for ten of those years and began coaching baseball there in 2006. Estes entered his guilty plea in the Frederick Maryland Circuit Court and in exchange the prosecution dropped a third-degree sex offense to a second-degree offense. Prosecutors are recommending that Estes serve three years of supervised probation and that he register as a sex offender. The conviction normally carries a maximum 15-year sentence. The Frederick News-Post spoke Dave Ziedelis, general manager of the Frederick Keys, this June. He said he had no other details about Estes' time in Frederick. 'Until very recently, I was not aware of the name Eric Estes,' Ziedelis said. Minor league pitcher: Despite his pleading guilty to sexual assault the students of Eric Estes say they are shocked by the allegations and that they saw him as a father figure . There have been no other reports of alleged sexual misconduct and students of Estes were deeply troubled by the allegations. Brooks Hanson, a former Skyview High School baseball player, told The Columbian that Estes was a great coach and it has been hard for him and others to pair the coach’s great personality and character with the criminal charges against him . 'He has done more for me baseball-wise than, arguably, anyone,' Hanson said. 'I think it is a shame he is not going to be able to help kids like me anymore. It’s a sad situation on both sides.' Former Skyview player Brian Valentine, who has known Estes for five years, said he was completely in shock about the sexual assault allegation and that he looked up to Estes like a father figure. 'He was a really good guy to everyone who passed through Skyview,' said Valentine. 'I’ve looked up to him and still do as a father figure, so when I heard about it, it was a really tough time for me.' Behind bars: Eric Estes is escorted back to jail after appearing in Clark County District Court in June .

"Bournemouth defender Adam Smith insists their promotion push will not distract them from their FA Cup fourth-round clash against Aston Villa on Sunday. Eddie Howe's men are a point ahead of Middlesbrough at the top of the Championship table, despite losing 1-0 to Leeds on Tuesday. The Cherries thrashed Rotherham 5-1 in the last round of the cup and have been prolific in front of goal all season, with 57 goals so far in the league. Bouremouth defender Adam Smith has warned Aston Villa that his side are out to cause an upset . Eddie Howe's side are currently top of the Championship table with a one-point lead over Middlesbrough . Smith believes Bournemouth can 'beat anyone on their day' and vowed they would head into the match without fear of the opposition. 'Things are going well at the minute,' he told the Football Association website. 'The team spirit is very good and we're playing some good football. 'The lads won't be scared going into this game. We are just looking forward to testing ourselves against another top side. 'Hopefully we can beat Villa and then go on a bit of a run, like we did in the League Cup. We are looking to go on another good run and we'll see where that takes us.' Bournemouth knocked out Premier League side West Brom during their impressive Capital One Cup run, which was eventually halted by Liverpool in the quarter-finals. The experience of taking a major scalp is something which Smith believes can give them the extra self-confidence needed to progress this weekend. Smith was part of the Bournemouth side which reached the Capital One Cup quarter-finals . Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert will be hoping his side can progress to the fifth round of the FA Cup . 'Villa probably aren't doing as well as they would like, but they have got plenty of quality and we know it will be tough,' he added. 'But if we can keep their big players quiet I'm sure we can get a good result and if we play our football I'm sure we'll have a good chance.' Manager Howe could make a couple of changes for their second match this week. No 1 goalkeeper Artur Boruc made his first start at Elland Road since recovering from a neck injury and will carry on between the sticks. Midfielder Dan Gosling, who came on for the last half-an-hour in midweek, may come into contention if Howe decides to flood the midfield. That means Brett Pittman could make way, with top scorer Callum Wilson set to lead the line.","Bournemouth face Aston Villa at Villa Park in fourth round of the FA Cup .

"Veteran full-back Paul Wellens, who led St Helens to Grand-Final glory three months ago, has been replaced as captain of the club by his former England team-mate Jon Wilkin. The 35-year-old Wellens, who is set to start his 18th season with his home-town team, will remain part of Saints' leadership group but is expected to adopt a reduced playing role in 2015. St Helens coach and former captain Kieron Cunningham, who succeeded Australian Nathan Brown after October's Old Trafford success, made the announcement at a press conference at Langtree Park on Wednesday morning. Paul Wellen hoists the Super League Grand Final trophy aloft but has now been replaced as captain . Jon Wilkin has been given the role of leader in place of the 35-year-old Wellens . 'I had a discussion with Paul when I got the job,' Cunningham said. 'I was in a similar position myself, when I was captain of the team and coming off the bench or not even playing. 'Going forward, we thought it would be appropriate to appoint a new captain and Jon Wilkin is a great ambassador for the club who epitomises what we are. 'Paul is going to be around for a long time. He will play a supporting role to Wilko and will remain part of the leadership group.' Wellens is expected to follow Cunningham on to the coaching staff when he brings his playing career to a halt. Wilkin, who turned 32 earlier this month, missed the second half of last season with a shoulder injury but made his comeback in last Sunday's pre-season friendly against Widnes and will lead the side for Sunday's Grand Final re-match with Wigan. Hooker James Roby will take up the role of vice-captain at St Helens . 'It's been an honour to play for such a fantastic club for the last 12 years and to go on and become captain is something I will be very proud to do,' said Wilkin, who joined Saints from Hull KR in 2003.

"Having this year reached its pensionable age of 65,  one of Britain’s best-loved vehicles - and a favourite with the Queen - is to cease production. For now. The last of the current Land Rover Defenders will roll-off the production lines of Jaguar Land Rover’s (JLR) Solihull factory in the West Midlands in December 2015. But already a bold new successor for the 21st century is on the drawing board ready to replace it. A small ‘family’ of Defenders is even being prepared, including a sporty beach-buggy style. The Land Rover Defender - built for farmers, now a favourite with the Queen, James Bond, and Tomb Raider's Lara Croft - is to cease production . New Land Rover Defender 100 Sport - the bold new successor for the 21st century is on the drawing board ready to replace it . A small 'family' of Defenders is being prepared, including a sporty beach-buggy style . The Defender is the name given in more recent years to the original Land Rover which was born in 1948. The . popular 4x4 vehicle, which is exported all around the world, represents . the continuation of the very first Land Rover which came on to the . scene in April 1948 and was modelled on the war-time jeeps. Featuring . in the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and in the latest . James Bond movie, Skyfall, the Defender name itself can be traced back . to 1990. It was created to avoid confusion with a new Land Rover . launched the previous year  called Discovery. Jaguar . land Rover confirmed that Defender production will cease but stressed a . new replacement vehicle would join the Land Rover model range, which . includes the Freelander, the Discovery and the Range Rover. The last of the models - pictured here being driven by the Queen at the Windsor show - will be produced by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) at Solihull in the West Midlands in December 2015 . At . the Frankfurt Motor Show two years ago parent company Jaguar Land Rover . unveiled a macho, testosterone-fuelled open-topped off-roader - . codenamed DS100 Sport - designed to be as useful off-road as the trusty . original. it is likely to be one of a small family of Defenders. It . could even be built at their new factory in Puna – whether  in . knock-down form from kits supplied in Britain, or more radically, in . India alone. John . Edwards, who has just been announced as the head of JLR's new individual . products division, said the  Defender was ‘loved the world over for its . simple, honest and distinctive design’ adding:’We are determined that . the new Defender will be true to its heritage, while meeting the . requirements of a changing global market.’ He . added: ’Like no other vehicle, the  Defender inspires affection and . loyalty the world over. It inspires people to go beyond, whether they . are explorers, ecologists, UN aid workers or Red cross medics.’ Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie) at the wheel of her Defender in 'Tomb Raider' movie. While Defender production will cease, a new replacement vehicle will join the Land Rover model range . He . said the Defender is ‘known and loved the world over and that its . replacement would be ‘instantly recognised’  by anyone who knows the . current vehicle and the ""core values of dependability and functionality’ would be retained. Mr Edwards added that the new vehicle ‘won't necessarily be cheap’. Land . Rover design director Gerry McGovern  said: ‘Replacing the iconic . Defender is one of the biggest challenges in the automotive design . world; it is a car that inspires people worldwide.’ A JLR spokesman said: ‘Production of Defender in its current format will stop at the end of 2015. 'A . new replacement vehicle will join the Land Rover model range, but we . have not yet announced the name nor any details of the new product. ""The . Defender in its current format is coming to an end and we are looking . at what the options are.’ But  Land Rover is already hard at work creating a new replacement  Defender fit for the 21st century. The much loved vehicle was also featured in the latest James Bond film, Skyfall . The . proposed new prototype Defender  takes its cue  from the early . canvas-roofed Defenders with their fold-down windscreens that still . typify the Land Rover spirit of  adventure and exploration – but with a . wrap-around aero screen and cut-down side windows for exhilarating . open-air motoring. Land Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household. The royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover. The . Queen, who has been pictured at the wheel of Land Rovers, took delivery . of her first one shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has . used Land Rovers ever since. 'Even its colour – metallic amber – was designed to . echo the ‘vibrant ochre hues found in Africa.’ However, . in  keeping with the demands of 21st century motoring, the proposed new . Defender  also  included a bevy of new hi-tech special features. These . include ‘Wade Aid’ which  uses sonar to assess water depth when crossing . a shallow river or ford; next generation Terrain Response which . optimises car’s setting for any type of environment; a ‘Terrain-i ‘ . feature which maps the  contours of what’s ahead to create  3D visual . map on the dashboard screen and is similar to technology used by fighter . pilots, and retractable ‘on demand’ tyre spikes for driving on snow and . ice. There’s even a park-assist system to help you parallel park . The . original and iconic Defender workhorse off-roader began life in 1948 as . a £450  agricultural aid for farmers. Astonishingly, some . three-quarters of the 2 million Defenders ever built since then are . still in regular use. Land . Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household.

The . original  Land Rover started life as a squiggle in the sand when, . shortly after the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks . sketched out on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey  the . rufty-tufty vehicle he needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep . he used while there and on the family’s main home and farm in .

"Nigel Clough is still working his magic in England’s most famous cup competition - thanks to an Italian teenager. Diego De Girolamo, 19, dug the Sheffield United boss out of a hole after his much-changed team were on the brink of being dumped out by Preston. Preston were better for much of the first half and took a deserved lead through Paul Gallagher’s vicious free-kick. Diego De Girolamo of Sheffield United celebrates scoring the equaliser against Preston with team mates . De Girolamo earns Sheffield United a well deserved FA Cup fourth round replay . But Clough’s team responded well after the break and got themselves back into the tie when De Girolamo scored from close range after good work from substitute Jamie Murphy. United have earned themselves a reputation as knockout specialists in the past two seasons and arrived at Deepdale having lost just two of 18 FA and League Cup matches under Clough. Clough puts his team’s success in the cups down to the face that he fields his strongest side and every opportunity but he broke his own rule here by making eight changes to his starting line-up. That was perhaps forgivable, given the fact that this tie fell between the two legs of the League Cup semi-final against Tottenham, added to the fact the Blades are pushing for promotion from League One. Paul Gallagher scores the first goal for Preston in the FA Cup Fourth Round tie against Sheffield United . Preston North End's Chris Humphrey (left)  in action with Sheffield Unitedís Harrison McGahey . Preston North End (4-2-3-1): Stuckmann 6; Woods 7, Huntington 6, Clarke 6, Buchanan 6; Welsh 6 (Davies, 63, 6), Kilkenny 6 (King, 63, 6); Humphrey 6, Gallagher 7, Reid 8 (Browne, 85, 6); Ebanks-Blake 6.

Substitutes not used: Long, Doyle, Scougall, Campbell-Ryce. Bookings: Reed, Baxter, Kennedy. Referee: Keith Stroud 8/10 . Attendance: 10,770 . Match rating: 6/10 . During his time as Leicester City manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson claimed Gallagher’s free-kicks were as good as David Beckham’s and it looked like the former England manger had a point as Preston took the lead. Chris Basham’s clumsy challenge 35 yards from goal gave the hosts a shooting chance and Gallagher delivered, sending his vicious shot dipping over the wall and giving Mark Howard no chance. As well as making eight changes, Sheffield United also adopted an unfamiliar 3-5-2 shape and the players were clearly struggling to cope with the disruption. Ben Davies’ free-kick, dragged horribly wide, was as close as the visitors came to troubling Thorsten Stuckmann, Preston’s German goalkeeper. The visitors were fortunate not to fall further behind in the opening stages of the second half when Kyel Reid, the Preston winger, seized upon some sloppy defending and shot at Howard, with the visiting goalkeeper gathering the ball at the second attempt.

United finally found some rhythm and De Girolamo fashioned their first genuine chance. The he got to the ball ahead of Stuckmann and poked his effort towards the empty net, only to see defender Calum Woods recover and hook the ball away from the goal. The introduction of Jamie Murphy helped the visitors keep the pressure on and he played a key role for the equaliser, making progress down the left before cutting the ball back for De Girolamo to score from inside the six-yard box.","Paul Gallagher opened the scoring with his fifth goal in eight games .

"Stunned: Nurse Peter McDougall found this blade inside a pack of Halloween sweets . A nurse who purchased a bag of children's Halloween sweets from Poundland was horrified when he discovered a rusty three-inch blade hidden inside. Peter McDougall bought the packet of Witches Broomsticks from a Poundland store in Aberdeen in preparation for children trick-or-treating on Halloween. But the 28-year-old nurse, who works at Royal Cornhill Hospital in Aberdeen, couldn't believe his eyes when he saw the knife wrapped up with one of the marshmallows inside. Mr McDougall, from Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, said: 'I had bought the sweets as part of the collection I have for when the kids come round chapping on the door at Halloween. 'But I hadn't had any breakfast one day so I was hungry. I ate one of the marshmallows and I was about to have another one when I saw the blade. 'It's like a hacksaw blade, something similar to a stanley knife, that was inside the wrapping with the marshmallow. 'I was shocked and mortified when I saw it - who knows what could have happened if a child had opened it.' The sweets, made up of twisted strips of marshmallow, are an in-house Poundland brand. Ironically, the bag of sugary snacks were sold with the tag-line 'Eat if you dare'. Mr McDougall, who bought the packet from Poundland's Berryden branch in Aberdeen, said the knife could cause serious harm to children. He said: 'It's longer than my finger. You can see all the rust in there. It looks like it's come off some machinery or something. Halloween treat: The bag of Witches Broomsticks were purchased from a Poundland store in Aberdeen . Investigation: Poundland has since removed the product from its shelves following the discovery of the blade next to a wrapped marshmallow twister . 'If a young kid had seen it they might not have known what it was and they might have started playing with it, which could have caused some serious damage. 'Because it's Halloween, they might have thought it was a free toy with the bag of sweets. 'Luckily it was me who found it and not a child, otherwise who knows what could have happened. 'I want parents to be aware that they need to double check what's in these bags of sweets when their children go trick-or-treating. 'When I told the lady in Poundland what I found she was absolutely mortified and I'm chuffed that they've have taken the sweets off their shelves.' A spokeswoman for Poundland said: 'Poundland is committed to providing its customers with quality products. 'An investigation is currently taking place into its Witches Broomstick sweets following a complaint from a customer that they had found a machinery blade inside. 'In the meantime, Poundland has removed the product from all of its stores until the findings of the investigation are known.'","Blade found in a pack of Witches Broomsticks purchased from a Poundland store in Aberdeen .

"It all ended in smiles, but when Sydney Sixers opener Riki Wessels was cracked in the head by a 144.7 km/h delivery in his side’s Big Bash match there was a sharp intake of breath all around the Adelaide Oval. The tragic death of Australian batsman Philip Hughes last November when he was struck in the head by a similar ball from fast bowler Sean Abbott is still fresh in the memory, and since then there has been a lot of debate and controversy over the kind of helmets being used today.

"When shopping for clothes, customers usually check to see if they need a small medium or large.

"It's no secret that portion sizes in America are some of the largest, and it appears this is also true when it comes to fast food chains. According to a video on BuzzFeed, even McDonald's cup sizes are larger in the U.S. than elsewhere - except for in Singapore and Canada, which also go by the same definitions of 'small', 'medium' and 'large'. In fact, a medium-sized drink in the U.S., which is 21oz of liquid, is an ounce more than Japan's large-sized drink. Scroll down for video . Portion control: McDonald's cup sizes are larger in the U.S. than elsewhere - except for in Singapore and Canada, which also go by the same definitions of 'small', 'medium' and 'large' And America's large size (30oz) is 1.5 times bigger than the one in Japan (20oz). The video begins by showing the sizes of cups in America, marking the 16oz small, 21oz medium and 30oz large with white lines on a red background. Sizes in other countries are then placed against the lines to see how they measure up. In Australia, a small beverage from McDonald's is just about the same size as a small from the U.S., but a medium-sized one is significantly shorter - just minimally bigger than Australia's small. Super size it: America's large size (30oz) is 1.5 times bigger than the one in Japan (20oz) Comparison: A medium-sized drink in the U.S., which is 21oz of liquid, is big enough to overflow Japan's 20oz large cup . And a large is nearly as big as the one in America, although not quite. In Hong Kong, the sizes are nearly exactly the same as they are in Australia. But in the UK, the small-sized cup appears several ounces smaller than the one in the U.S., and slightly smaller than the smalls in Australia and Hong Kong. America may win the prize for largest sodas, but it's a triumph that doesn't come without controversy.

The proposed law would ban restaurants, theaters and food courts from selling sugary drinks and sodas larger than 16oz.

The hearings for defendants Sydney Claire Johnson, Allistair Curtis Berg and Brian Phillip Norlander - all 18 - will take place later this year, according to The Pioneer Press. Fitzgerald died after she was discovered unresponsive on January 11, 2014, the newspaper reported. Though police were informed by the 17-year-old's friends she thought she took LSD, the drug was actually the synthetic 25i-NBOMe, The Pioneer Press reported. Citing a criminal complaint, the newspaper reported Claussen first had the drug before it was given to Matenaer - then the drug was sold to the other three defendants before Fitzgerald purchased it. Last May, The Star Tribune reported that Fitzgerald was an avid reader and honor student, as well as an Anglophile and Harry Potter fan - and  asked her parents' permission to let a friend sleep over after doing well on the ACT exam. Her parents told the newspaper they checked her digital communications, warned against drugs and made sure she didn't go on dates with boys.

According to the newspaper, the pal heard Fitzgerald making noises and in the morning contacted her mother, who dialed both 911 and the Fitzgeralds - but Tara's parents did not return home in time to her. Father Thomas Fitzgerald said in court his daughter was downstairs with the friend as he and he wife were  sleeping,The Woodbury Bulletin reported. He reportedly said that the friend witnessed Tara's overdose and contacted a pal, and fearing repercussions, did not inform him of what was happening. 'How would you like to live with this knowledge if this had happened to your child at your house while you slept?' Thomas Fitzgerald said, per The Woodbury Bulletin. 'Hold drug dealers accountable for my Tara’s and other people’s sons’ and daughters’ murders,'; he also reportedly told the judge. 'These criminals should be held responsible and punished appropriately if they sell a drug that kills someone.' According to the newspaper, Matenar cried as Fitzgerald spoke, though Claussen 'sat, eyes fixed straight ahead from his seat at the defense table.' Claussen said on Friday 'I just want to say how sorry I am to everyone involved in this situation,' and 'If I could take away the pain, I would,' per The Woodbury Bulletin.

"The FBI is still trying to track down the Twitter user that made bomb threats targeting two jets bound for Atlanta, prompting F-16 fighter jets to escort the planes. Special Agent Stephen Emmett said the agency is continuing to pursue leads in an effort to locate the individual responsible for the threats. No bombs were found in searches of both planes after they landed safely in Atlanta on Saturday. Scroll down for video . Was this the threat? It is believed this is one of the tweets that prompted the FBI raid of two airplanes . Warning: The Twitter user sent a slew of warnings to Delta and Southwest on Saturday . Threats: A Delta flight and a Southwest flight reported credible bomb threats as they landed at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, on Saturday afternoon . Emergency: Passengers were escorted off the flights that landed around 3pm before bomb squads boarded . It is believed the threats came from a Twitter user with no followers who goes by the name KingZortic. The user sent a slew of warnings to Delta Airlines and Southwest Airlines on Saturday, claiming to have planted explosives on flights which were due to land at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. Bomb squads was rushed in as a result, but nothing suspicious was found on either flight. One tweet read: '@DeltaAssist I have a bomb on one of your planes, but I forgot which one when I left the airport. Can you help me find it?' Another said: '@SouthwestAir As part of a nationwide State agreement. A bomb was placed on SWA2492. It will be detonated at a random time of my choosing...' It is believed these tweets prompted NORAD fighter jets to escort Delta flight 1156 and Southwest flight 2492 to the Atlanta, Georgia, airport. Bomb squads then rushed about the Delta flight, which came from Portland, and the Southwest flight, which flew in from Milwaukee, with canines. However after an investigation of both planes found there were no explosive devices on board. Both flights had landed by 3pm and all passengers were being ushered off as bomb squads prepared to sweep the cabins, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. FBI officials told WSBTV the passengers on both flights would be interviewed and searched before they are allowed to leave the area. After the flights were airborne, the Twitter user King Zortic, who claims to be a member of a group they title The State, bombarded Delta and Southwest with warnings. The user, who claims to be based in Chicago, wrote to Delta: 'I have a bomb on one of your planes, but I forgot which one when I left the airport. Can you help me find it? 'It was from Portland to Atlanta, I forgot the flight number, though. It was something like DL156 or DL 1556 I forgot the order. 'Oh yes, that's it. 1156, thanks.

Two male employees of Ruby Tuesday, Andrew Herrera and Joshua Bell, claim they responded to an internal advert for temporary roles in Park City, Utah, but were denied 'because they are men' The case comes just over a year after a court found Ruby Tuesday guilty of age discrimination at restaurants in six states, ordering the group to pay a $575,000 fine. According to Andrew Herrera and Joshua Bell, they responded to an internal advert for temporary roles in Park City, Utah, but were denied, The Oregonian reported. The positions would have come with a higher wage and free housing for two months. Their suit claims the company, based in Tennessee, clearly favored female applicants and no men were hired due to gender discrimination. Demands: The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands compensation for the two employees . 'It's an unusual lawsuit,' John Stanley, a supervisory trial attorney for the EEOC in Seattle who has served 27 years with the commission, told the Oregonian. 'It's rare to see an explicit example of sex discrimination like Ruby Tuesday's internal job announcement,' noted EEOC San Francisco Regional Attorney William R Tamayo, according to a statement on the EEOC website. 'This suit is a cautionary tale to employers that sex-based employment decisions are rarely justified, and are not consistent with good business judgment.'","Two men claim they were refused Utah transfer because they are men .

"A New Hampshire woman got a surprise at a Burger King drive-thru: a bag full of cash instead of food. Janelle Jones says she discovered on the way home that the bag did not contain the sweet tea and junior spicy chicken sandwich that she had ordered Friday afternoon at the Rochester fast-food restaurant.

They said the money was split between two deposit bags, with a loose $100 bill as well. The couple returned the money to the restaurant about an hour later and were met with extremely thankful employees. The newspaper reports that the restaurant confirmed the couple's account but had no comment on it.

"A  911 recording played in court this week sheds light on the final moments of a 32-year-old man who was fatally shot in the head in his girlfriend's bedroom by her father who claims to have confused him for an intruder. Charles Jordan, 41, appeared in court on Wednesday  to face charges of voluntary manslaughter and a weapons offense in the shooting of 20-year-old daughter Brenda's boyfriend Marc Carrion. Carrion was shot dead in September after Jordan heard a noise coming from his daughter's room, and he grabbed his gun to investigate. The 911 recording played in court this week was so tragic, it shocked the judge. Tragic moment: Charles Jordan, 41 (left), shot dead 32-year-old Marc Carrion (right) in September because he thought he was an intruder. Carrion was dating Jordan's 20-year-old daughter Brenda, who let him into the apartment . In a relationship: Investigators say Brenda and Carrion had been seeing each other for a week, and that Carrion had been supplying drug-addict Brenda with heroin. Ten to 15 bags of the substance was found in her bed . Shared apartment: This is the apartment where Brenda and her father lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Carrion and his mother lived right around the block . 'Don't you move! I will shoot you!' Jordan can be heard screaming as he called police just before midnight on September 15. Carrion, who was kneeling next to girlfriend Brenda's bed, is heard replying that 'I have to stand up'. That's when gunshots ring out and Jordan's daughter stars shrieking. 'He moved, he moved!' Jordan tells the dispatcher. 'Dad, he's dead!' his daughter screams, who refers to carrion as 'my boyfriend'. 'I've never seen him before,' Jordan explains to the dispatcher. At the end of the five minute call, Municipal County Judge James DeLeon expressed his shock. 'That's crazy,' he said. 'It sounds like something from West Side Story.' DeLeon added that he was surprised that Jordan was allowed to remain free on bail. Gone: Jordan faces charges of voluntary manslaughter and a weapons violation. Carrion (left) died after being transported to the hospital for a gunshot wound to the head. His girlfriend Brenda's (right) whereabouts are now not known . 'Shot him because he moved. People move,' he noted from his chair. Jordan remained quiet in court on Wednesday, wearing a blue-collared shirt, tie and gray slacks. He exited with his defense attorney Todd Henry and a few supporters. Investigators say Brenda and Carrion had been seeing each other for about a week. It's also believed that Brenda is a drug addict, and Carrion her supplier. About 10 to 15 bags of heroin were found in her bed, and PCP found in Carrions body after an autopsy. Brenda's current whereabouts are unknown. Carrions mother Gloria Moyett admits that her son had a drug dealing past, but says he was trying to turn his life around. The mother and son lived just around the block from the Jordan home in Holme Circle Apartments. ‘He's with your daughter, she's not screaming, and you shoot him just because you don't know him?’Moyett remarked to the Philadelphia Daily News. Carrion is survived by three young children from a previous relationship.","Charles Jordan, 41, faces charges of voluntary manslaughter for shooting dead daughter's boyfriend Marc Carrion, 32, in September .

"Loss: Russ Knight lost his job as assistant frequency coordinator for the NFL during Super Bowl week after posting a photo of his security credential . An Arizona man was sidelined from his dream job working at the Super Bowl after a Facebook post broke a rule he was too excited to read. Russ Knight, a former DJ, was taking a time out on his job as a cab driver for the opportunity to work as assistant frequency coordinator for the NFL during Super Bowl week. When the credential for the job came in the mail, Knight was so thrilled he snapped a photo of himself wearing it and posted it to Facebook without thinking. Just hours later, he told KPHO, an NFL security official phoned with crushing news. 'He said, ""Russ, we’ve got a problem,""' said Knight. 'Apparently, on my picture, even though it’s far away, they could zoom in and they could read my credential on the bottom.' That meant that Knight was given the boot, having broken one of the rules listed on the credential telling the wearer not to post images of it on the internet. The rule is in place to prevent duplication and as a security measure. 'I can’t blame anybody else,' Knight said. 'I was the guy. I was the fool who didn’t read the fine print. I was that guy.' 'It hurts real bad,' he added. Knight wrote the league a letter of apology, and though he'll watch the game from home he says 'it wont be the same as being on the field.' Blame game: Knight put the responsibility for his error on himself, and said he'd be watching at home, though it wouldn't be the same .

"U.S. President Barack Obama will call on Congress to expand protection of Alaska's Arctic refuge where oil and gas drilling is prohibited to 12 million acres (5 million hectares), an area that includes 1.4 million oil-rich acres along the coast. The proposal, unveiled by the Interior Department on Sunday, ran into instant criticism from Republicans and is likely to face an uphill battle in Congress, where Republicans now control both chambers. The wilderness designation, the highest level of federal protection under which oil and gas drilling is banned, would be extended to a total of 19.8 million acres (8 million hectares) under the proposal, the Interior Department said. Announcement: U.S. President Barack Obama will propose expanding the protected area of Alaska's Arctic refuge by 12.28 million acres, the Interior Department said . HabitatL The area in question, a 1.4 million-acre strip wedged between the peaks of the Brooks Range and the Arctic Ocean, is a vital site for polar bears and the migratory Porcupine caribou herd, which raises young there . The move was the latest salvo in the energy wars between Obama, a Democrat, and Republican lawmakers. Republicans kicked off the new Congress earlier this month with a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline to help move Canadian oil to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Obama immediately said he would veto the measure. U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Republican chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called the Obama administration's proposal a politically motivated attack on Alaska. On Friday, she had introduced a bill that would have permitted oil production in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 'It's clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory. The promises made to us at statehood, and since then, mean absolutely nothing to them. I cannot understand why this administration is willing to negotiate with Iran, but not Alaska,' Murkowski said in a statement on Sunday. 'We will fight back with every resource at our disposal,' she said. The area in question, a 1.4 million-acre (566,000-hectare) strip wedged between the peaks of the Brooks Range and the Arctic Ocean, is a vital site for polar bears and the migratory Porcupine caribou herd, which raises young there. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain, holds 10.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil . President Obama's announcement is one of a series that the Interior Department will make this week that will affect Alaska's oil and gas production, according to The Washington Post . 'Other oilfields are available. The Arctic Refuge is too special a place to drill,' said David Hayes, senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the coastal plain holds 10.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Alaska Governor Bill Walker said on Sunday he would consider 'accelerating the options available' to increase oil exploration and production on state-owned lands in response to the move by the administration. The Washington Post, which first reported the story, said the Interior Department would also place part of the Arctic Ocean off limits to drilling and is considering additional limits on oil and gas production in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The announcement is one of a series that the Interior Department will make this week that will affect Alaska's oil and gas production, the Post said. The energy wars are taking place against a backdrop of domestic oil and gas production that has surged in recent years. Across the United States, oil production has surged by more than 3 million barrels per day in the last four years and by more than 2 million in the last two years alone.","U.S. President Barack Obama will propose expanding the protected area of Alaska's Arctic refuge by 12.28 million acres, the Interior Department said .

"Hernandez Garcia has been living in the U.S. illegally since 1999, when he traveled from Chihuahua with his wife and infant daughter on tourist visas . A father-of-two has been living in a Denver church basement for the past six months as he battles to avoid deportation to his native Mexico. Arturo Hernandez Garcia, 42, left his wife and two children and moved into the basement of the First Unitarian Society of Denver in October after officials decided to deport him. The church was able to provide sanctuary because U.S. immigration enforcement officials have a policy of not pursuing 'enforcement actions' in churches and schools. Hernandez Garcia has been living in the U.S. illegally since 1999, when he traveled from Chihuahua with his wife and infant daughter on tourist visas, and they stayed. He settled in Denver where he and his brother co-own a tile-laying business with six employees. In that time his wife also give birth to another daughter and his girls are now 9 and 15. But a disagreement on a construction site in 2010 lead to assault changes being brought against him, reports Newsweek. Hernandez Garcia was eventually acquitted of the charges, but they resulted in him showing up on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement's radar and since then he has been fighting deportation proceedings. After yet another unsuccessful appeal to immigration authorities in August, ICE decided to deport him on October 21, 2014, the same day he took sanctuary in the First Unitarian Society of Denver's church. Arturo Hernandez Garcia, 42, left his wife and two children and moved into the sanctuary of the First Unitarian Society of Denver in October 2014 after officials decided to deport him . Before his fight with ICE, he and his wife had applied for legal permanent resident visas in 2005 through his father-in-law, who is a U.S. citizen, but because of a backlog it could be 2025 before they receive a decision. Though confined to the church, Hernandez Garcia says he keeps busy. He has painted the walls in the church offices. His family, friends and supporters frequently visit, he says. And when alone, he has a television and radio to keep him company. With help from the American Friends Service Committee and legal counsel, Garcia is also trying to get his case re-opened. 'I don't have a criminal record, I have more than ten years [in the United States], I have kids,' said Garcia. 'I think I have a good case. But the courts say no.' As of May, Garcia could ; under DAP, all parents of legal citizen children born on or before November 20, 2014 are eligible. Since October Hernandez Garcia has been living in the First Unitarian Church where he has painted the walls and watched TV to keep him company . Hernandez Garcia hopes his ordeal will help spotlight the legal challenges immigrants continue to face across the country . But getting approved will take months, and Garcia is worried that he could be removed from his family and deported in the meantime. On December 2, Garcia's wife, Ana, as well as their two daughters, traveled to Washington, D.C. to try to halt his deportation. While there, they met with two officials from the Department of Homeland Security and members of the Colorado Congressional delegation. Representatives Diana DeGette, Jared Polis and Ed Perlmutter all signed on to a request for 'stay of removal' for Garcia, and the day after the family returned to Denver, Garcia's attorney sent in the paperwork to re-open his case. He has yet to hear back. Hernandez Garcia says he will claim sanctuary until he knows he will not be deported, he says. He hopes his ordeal will help spotlight the legal challenges immigrants continue to face across the country.

"A worrying trend is affecting millions of little American girls who are so concerned about being overweight that they're resorting to dieting before the age of seven, according to a study. The research was carried out by Common Sense Media - a nonprofit organization that reviews media content targeted at kids. It showed that one out of four children had dieted prior to turning seven-years-old. And a staggering 80 per cent of American girls aged 10 had been on a diet over fears about their looks. Worry: A staggering 80 per cent of American girls aged 10 have been on a diet over fears about their looks and one-third of boys wish their bodies were much thinner . But the diet-fad was not just confined to girls - one-third of boys and the majority of girls ages six to eight-years-old also want their bodies to be thinner. Researchers found that boys' own body concerns and risky behavior can go unnoticed because dieting was not traditionally seen as one of their concerns. The organization is encouraging parents  to listen to children if they engage in negative talk about their bodies, or, signs of dramatic weight loss or weight gain. Along with these vital warning signs, parents can check what they're kids coaches, peers and social media peers are saying. The study placed blame on the media's unrealistic depictions of body images - particularly among pop stars, models and entertainers. Some pop stars, like Lorde, have chosen to address the issue head on after she recently realized that a photograph of her had been photoshopped to rid her face of imperfections. She tweeted to fans: 'I find this curious - two photos from today, one edited so my skin is perfect and one real.' Remember flaws are OK :) Pop stars: Lorde chose to address the issue head on after she recently realized that a photograph of her had been photoshopped to rid her face of imperfections . Media: Children are increasingly being affected by the media's often unrealistic depictions of body images - their family's attitudes, their peers, where they live and even their teachers . Social media: Girls tend to post more photos online, but it can be stressful, with 57 per cent of girls verses 28 per cent of boys feeling left out when they see pictures of others together posted online . Boys: Boys' own body concerns and risky behavior can go unnoticed and their role in supporting healthy attitudes among girls is vital . According to Common Sense Media, when kindergarten-age children are asked to indicate their ideal body size, nearly a third of them choose a size that's smaller than their own. Then, by the age of six, most kids are aware of what 'dieting' means and many admit that they have tried it. With the rise of social media sites, like Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat, children are also increasingly being affected by other people's ideas about how they look in photos posted online. Girls tend to post more photos online, but it can be stressful with 28 per cent of girls admitting to editing images of themselves online. At least 57 per cent of girls verses 28 per cent of boys said they felt left out when they see pictures of others together posted online. And more teenage girls than teen boys text every day. Twitter has more members that are girls than boys and sites, like tumblr, encourage young girls to seek to be perfect  egged on by posts that aim for 'Fitspiration,' and 'how to be skinny.' One site called 'Get Thinspo' showcases skinny girls and has the motto: 'You spend the first 10 years of your life playing with barbies and the next 10 trying to be one.' However, there are other factors, including parents and peers attitude to weight which can also shape small children's attitudes towards themselves. Fitspiration: Social media sites, like tumblr, can encourage young girls to seek to be perfect and attain the desired figure by posts that aim for Fitspiration . The Common Sense Media researchers revealed: 'They take their cues from peers, adults, and media around them. 'Young children in particular pick up models for how to think and behave from those around them. Body-related talk and behavior is no exception.' The U.S. dieting industry is currently worth just over $60 billion annually and eating disorders affect at least 30 million Americans. Claire Mysko, a representative from the National Eating Disorders Association told The Huffington Post that society's obsession with weight loss has made the data unsurprising. She said: 'We live in a culture where the emphasis on weight loss and thinness is everywhere, so it's not surprising that young people are getting caught up in these obsessions.' And when children are dissatisfied with their bodies, they're more likely to struggle with low self-esteem, depression, and eating disorders.","The findings come from a study carried out by Common Sense Media .

"Pioneering radio and TV host Joe Franklin, who gave breaks to the likes of Al Pacino and Bill Cosby on his variety show long before they became famous and who boasted he never missed a broadcast in decades, has died at age 88. He died Saturday of cancer, which he had had for a few years, longtime producer and friend Steven Garrin said. Franklin often is credited with developing the standard TV talk show format, sitting behind a desk while interviewing wanna-be celebrities, minor celebrities and the occasional bona fide celebrity. Remembered: Radio and TV host Joe Franklin died Saturday of cancer, which he had had for a few years, longtime producer and friend Steven Garrin said. He was 88 . Legend: By the early 1990s, Joe Franklin often said, he had chatted with more than 300,000 guests, including Marilyn Monroe, Liza Minnelli and Madonna. Franklin is seen here being interviewed by Conan O'Brien in 1993 . The host of 'The Joe Franklin Show' started in TV in 1950. By the early 1990s, he often said, he had chatted with more than 300,000 guests, including Marilyn Monroe, Liza Minnelli and Madonna. But the notables often had to share air time on his low-budget show with a tap-dancing dentist or a man who whistled through his nose. Garrin recalled how Franklin, who was parodied by Billy Crystal on 'Saturday Night Live,' hired a young Bette Midler as his studio singer and gave a chance on his show to every up-and-comer trying to make it big: Bruce Springsteen, Woody Allen and Dustin Hoffman among them. 'He was a wonderful guy,' Garrin said Sunday. 'He gave everybody an opportunity.' Garrin said he remembered how Pacino, after he became a Hollywood movie star, told Franklin in a private meeting: 'Joe, why don't you interview me now that I'm somebody? You interviewed me when I was nobody.' After Franklin's TV show ended in 1993, he worked on his late-night radio show. He continued to work even after he developed cancer, doing celebrity interviews on the Bloomberg Radio Network. Tuesday was the first scheduled broadcast Franklin had missed in more than 60 years, said Garrin, who worked with him for 20 of those years, booking all his interviews and recording the shows in his studios in Times Square between 1991 and 2010. Multiple celebrities offered their condolences on Twitter after Franklin's death. Billy Crystal tweeted 'Joe Franklin was a New York original, I grew up watching Memory Lane and loved imitating him on SNL. A sad day for all who knew him.' Meanwhile, actress Martha Plimpton wrote ' All the best things about New York are going away. RIP Joe Franklin. A true NYC icon.' 'Joe Franklin gone!!!! Damn!' actor Harvey Fierstein tweeted. 'He gave me my first TV exposure and I certainly wasn't alone in that. Ran into him on 8th Avenue last year.' Chef Andrew Zimmern wrote 'I watched him since I was a kid. A true original.'

The 83-year-old was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital on Friday night where he was pronounced dead, according to the family attorney Mark Bogen, who spoke alongside Banks' widow, Liz. Bogen declined to elaborate. Banks' widow also declined to comment about her husband's death. Ronnie Wickers (WooWoo) lays a doll outside Wrigley Field in remembrance of baseball legend Ernie Banks . Banks spent his entire 19-year career with the Cubs. He hit 512 home runs and was twice named the National League's Most Valuable Player. His death has prompted tributes across the country. In Chicago, the Cubs and the city announced Sunday that a statue of Banks will be temporarily moved from outside Wrigley Field to downtown. It will be on display in Daley Plaza from Wednesday through Saturday. 'Mr. Cub' was fond of saying, 'It's a great day for baseball. Let's play two!', which remains a catchphrase at Wrigley Field to this day. 'Approachable, ever optimistic and kind hearted, Ernie Banks is and always will be Mr. Cub. My family and I grieve the loss of such a great and good-hearted man, but we look forward to celebrating Ernie's life in the days ahead.' Though he was an 11-time All-Star from 1953-71, Banks never reached the postseason, and the Cubs finished below .500 in all but six of his seasons. Stalwart: Ernie Banks, 83, pictured above in March last year, died late Friday, the Chicago Cubs confirmed . Hall of famer: Banks, pictured above on the pitch in 1955, hit 512 home runs in his long careers . Still, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1977, the first year he was eligible, and selected to baseball's All-Century team in 1999. Banks' infectious smile and non-stop good humor despite his team's dismal record endeared him to Chicago fans, who voted him the best player in franchise history. One famous admirer, Saturday Night Live star Bill Murray, named his son Homer Banks Murray. Banks' No. 14 was the first number retired by the Cubs, and hangs from the left-field foul pole at Wrigley Field. 'I'd like to get to the last game of the World Series at Wrigley Field and hit three homers,' he once said. 'That was what I always wanted to do.' Banks was playing for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues when the Cubs discovered him in 1953, and purchased his contract for $10,000. He made his major league debut at shortstop on Sept. 17 that year, and three days later hit his first home run. Tall and thin, Banks didn't look like a typical power hitter. He looked even less so as he stood at the plate, holding his bat high and wiggling it as he waited for pitches. But he had strong wrists and a smooth, quick stroke, and he made hitting balls out of the park look effortless. Caught: Shown above in 1967, Banks poses in uniform having just caught a baseball . Optimism: Despite often being on the losing side, the loyal Cubs player never lost his enthusiasm. He is pictured above in 1970 . When he switched to a lighter bat before the 1955 season, his power quickly became apparent. He hit 44 homers that season, including three against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Aug. 4. His five grand slams that year established a major league record that stood for more than 30 years before Don Mattingly hit six in 1987. Banks' best season came in 1958, when he hit .313 with 47 homers and 129 RBIs. Though the Cubs went 72-82 and finished sixth in the National League, Banks edged Willie Mays and Hank Aaron for his first MVP award. He was the first player from a losing team to win the NL MVP. Banks won the MVP again in 1959, becoming the first NL player to win it in consecutive years, even though the Cubs had another dismal year. Banks hit .304 with 45 homers and a league-leading 143 RBIs. He led the NL in homers again in 1960 with 41, his fourth straight season with 40 or more. His 248 homers from 1955-60 were the most in the majors, topping even Aaron and Mays. At home: Banks is pictured above looking to the outfield fences at Wrigley Field, the Cubs' home ground . Batter up: Banks wore number 14 on his shirt, which was retired after he stopped playing . Though Banks didn't break the 40-homer barrier again after 1960, he topped the 100-RBI mark three more times, including 1969, his last full season. Then 38, he hit .253 with 23 home runs and 106 RBIs, and was chosen an All-Star for an 11th time. On May 12, 1970, he hit his 500th home run, becoming only the eighth player at the time to reach the plateau. Banks retired after the 1971 season. He owned most of the Cubs' career slugging records, some of which still stand today. Known mostly for his power at the plate, Banks was a solid fielder, too. He is best known as a shortstop, where he won a Gold Glove in 1960, but he switched to first base in 1962. He played 1,259 games at first and 1,125 games at shortstop. Born and raised in Dallas, Banks would be bribed to play catch by his father, who always wanted him to be a baseball player. Banks grew to love the game and was a standout in high school, along with participating in football, basketball and track and field. He joined a barnstorming Negro Leagues team at 17 and was spotted by Cool Papa Bell, who signed him to the Monarchs in 1950. Banks played one season before going into the Army. He returned to Kansas City after he was discharged, playing one more season before joining the Cubs.","Banks's death was announced by the Chicago Cubs Friday night .

"A 32-foot gray whale that turned up dead under the Washington state ferry terminal in downtown Seattle died earlier this week because it was struck by the propeller of a large vessel, according to the initial results of a necropsy completed Saturday. The necropsy found large, deep gashes on the whale's right side and back, indicating the cause of death. The gashes extended into the whale's body cavity and the propeller's force had sheared off one of its ribs. Biologists estimated the time of death as no earlier than Monday and likely on Tuesday. They said the animal likely died quickly, probably within an hour. Investigation: A team measures a gray whale that was found dead beneath a dock on the Seattle waterfront earlier in the week. The whale died  because it was struck by the propeller of a large vessel, a necropsy found . Mystery: The whale's body was discovered under the Colman Dock ferry terminal late Wednesday. Ferry service wasn't affected, but people reported a foul odor . The whale's body was discovered under the Colman Dock ferry terminal late Wednesday. Ferry service wasn't affected, but people reported a foul odor. The examination also found that the whale was a juvenile female, about two to three years old. She was just over 30 feet long and had been in very good health before death because its blubber was thick, with healthy amounts of oil. Biologists are not sure why the whale entered Puget Sound, since most gray whales have already migrated south along the outer Washington Coast. Gray whales spend their summers feeding in Alaska. Each fall, they travel along the Pacific coast from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico, said Michael Milstein, a spokesman with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service. Collision: The necropsy found deep gashes on the whale's right side and back, indicating the cause of death.

Biologists estimated the whale's time of death as no earlier than Monday and likely on Tuesday. They said the animal likely died quickly, probably within an hour . Gray whales were removed from Endangered Species Act protection in 1994 and the population along the West Coast is considered recovered. But the whales are still protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In the next few, days the whale's remains will be towed away from shore and sunk to decompose naturally. The results of the necropsy will be assessed by NOAA Fisheries scientists and will be relayed to NOAA Fisheries' Office of Law Enforcement for possible investigation.","A 32-foot gray whale turned up dead under the Washington state ferry terminal in downtown Seattle .

"The journalist credited with being the first to to report the shooting dead of Argentinian prosecutor Alberto Nisman has vanished. Damian Pachter, of the English-language Buenos Aires Herald, reported on Friday he was followed by unknown people and feared for his safety but did not elaborate, his employer said. Mr Nisman was found dead last Sunday, the day before he was to testify before congress about his explosive allegations that President Cristina Kirchner shielded Iranian officials wanted in the South American country's biggest terrorist attack. The official in charge of investigating his death said last night that he appeared to have been shot at point blank range but added that there was no firm evidence that anyone else was involved. Scroll down for video . Missing: Damian Pachter told his employer on Friday he was followed by unknown people and feared for his safety . Argentine President Cristina Kirchner (left) has claimed that prosecutor Alberto Nisman (right), who died a day before he was due to accuse her of covering up a Jewish bombing in 1994, was murdered to 'implicate' her . The local journalism group he worked for, Foro de Periodismo Argentino said he left the country yesterday. Calls and emails to Mr Pachter on Saturday were not immediately returned. In a statement, Pachter's employer said the journalist had not expressed his concerns to the newspaper and the organisation was ready to help him in any way possible. Earlier this week, President  Kirchner claimed Mr Nisman was murdered to implicate her. Kirchner argued that Alberto Nisman did not commit suicide, but was instead killed in an 'operation' against her government. Mr Nisman, the lead prosecutor in the case, was found dead under suspicious circumstance with a gunshot to his head at his home. Prosecutor Viviana Fein, who is leading the investigation into his death, said yesterday that the shot had been fired 'from a distance no greater than a centimetre'. She added that ballistics analysis will be needed to determine whether or not the bullet taken from Mr Nisman's body matches the gun found at the scene. Police carry the body of prosecutor Alberto Nisman outside his house in Buenos Aires, Argentina, early on Monday. He was found dead with a gunshot to the head at his home . Sara Garfunkel, mother of late prosecutor Alberto Nisman, leaves the office of prosecutor Viviana Fein, who is investigating Nisman's death, on Thursday . The day after his death, he was to go before a congressional hearing to accuse President Kirchner of shielding Iranian officials implicated in the 1994 attack on a Jewish community centre which left dozens dead. Investigators have said Mr Nisman appeared to have committed suicide, but have not ruled out homicide or an 'induced suicide'. In a stunning post on her Facebook page, President Kirchner contended that Mr Nisman was killed to immerse her government in scandal after he had been 'used' to publicly accuse her of involvement in the cover-up. 'I'm convinced that it was not suicide,' she said. 'Prosecutor Nisman's charges were never in themselves the true operation against the government. 'They collapsed early on. Nisman did not know it and probably never knew it. 'The true operation against the government was the prosecutor's death after accusing the president, her foreign minister, and the secretary-general of (her political faction) of covering up for the Iranians accused in the AMIA attack,' she added. President Kirchner offered no evidence to support her theory and did not say who she thought was behind Nisman's death. Firefighters and rescue workers search through the rubble of the Buenos Aires Jewish Community centre in this July 18, 1994 picture after a car bomb rocked the building, killing 84 people and injuring 300 others . Before his death, Mr Nisman had filed a 280-page complaint charging that President Kirchner had issued an 'express directive' to shield a group of Iranian suspects in the bombing. Mr Nisman contended that the government had agreed to swap grain for oil with Tehran in exchange for withdrawing 'red notices' to Interpol seeking the arrests of the former and current Iranian officials accused in the case. The attack on the Buenos Aires headquarters of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association, or AMIA, was the deadliest terror strike in Argentina's history. Eighty-four people were killed and more than 300 injured when a van loaded with explosives was detonated in front of the building. Since 2006, Argentine courts have demanded the extradition of eight Iranians, including former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former defense minister Ahmad Vahidi and Iran's former cultural attache in Buenos Aires, Mohsen Rabbani, over the bombing. But in 2013, President Kirchner signed a memorandum of understanding with Tehran agreeing to set up a 'truth commission' to investigate the bombing and allowing Argentine prosecutors to question the suspects in Iran. The rapprochement was vehemently opposed at the time by Jewish community leaders, who charged it was 'unconstitutional'. In general, Argentina has a free press, with many organisations reporting on government officials and corruption in ways unimaginable in many Latin American countries.","Damian Pachter is believed to be first to report Alberto Nisman's death .

"Late last month, it was announced the foundation searching for a site to establish Barack Obama's presidential library had 'major concerns' about going with the University of Chicago. Then just this week, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel proposed an ordinance that would allow the university to build the library on the city park land if the school was selected. The timing of the proposal, which comes right before a selection deadline for the Obamas, has opponents of the plan upset that the Chicago machine is once again interfering in  city affairs. Timing: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel proposed an ordinance this week that would allow the university to build Obama's presidential library on park land, with timing that has some opponents suspicious . 'The big guys — the mayor, the university and the president — they're all together,' said resident Robin Kaufman at a public hearing concerning the possible transfer. The city has not been keen to give up the spaces like the ones proposed for the library,  20 acres each in Washington Park and Jackson Park on Chicago's South Side, in the past. George Lucas, creator of Star Wars, proposed a $300million museum on the lakefront, but ran into the non-profit Friends of the Parks, which is currently suing in federal court over the plans. Cassandra Francis, president of Friends of the Parks, is less optimistic of her chances against Emanuel, who was the president's chief of staff until leaving in 2010 to run for mayor. With talk that Emanuel and the foundation may have used a crisis to limit public opposition to the plans, Francis said it was likely both were in talks about the space 'for a long time.' Emanuel has made the city's bid for the presidential library a central focus as he heads into the February 24 election trying to avoid a close race with upstart candidate Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia. Designs: The University of Chicago submitted a proposal for the library that included two parcels the school does not own that are part of city parks in the South Side . Machine politics: The ties between Emanuel and President Obama have opponents of the plan worried that the city will steamroll any opposition to putting in the library on parks land . Support in Chicago's South Side, where the parks are located, has been weak for Emanuel amidst worries over education and crime, but could rebound with a presidential library in the neighborhood. 'It is essential that the president's library is here in the city of Chicago and not in New York, and I will do what is necessary ... to move heaven and earth to make this happen,' Emanuel said this week. The park district board, which oversees the land in question, is headed by Bryan Traubert, who recused himself from the decision because his wife, Penny Pritzker, is US commerce secretary. 'Does anyone really think the park district won't do exactly what the mayor wants?' Delmarie Cobb, a Democratic political consultant and critic of Emanuel, said of the decision . 'This is a slippery slope that none of us can go down because this is Chicago,' she added. 'And we all know how Chicago works.'","Mayor Rahm Emanuel submitted a proposal this week to give University of Chicago the right to use park land if it wins a bid for the library .
Opponents of the plan say City Hall and the presidential library foundation were in talks over how to push through a plan to use the park space .

"A Manhattan judge approved a millionaire investor's request for a restraining order against his 'volatile and unpredictable' younger girlfriend in Family Court on Friday. The motion to grant former hedge fund manager Brad Zipper, 50, a two-year protective order against 29-year-old former flame Nicole Raef was the finale to a legal ordeal with several dark twists. Though saying both parties had a problem with 'credibility,' Justice Mary Bednar eventually sided with Zipper, who claimed in court his girlfriend was prone to violent fits and once threatened him with a kitchen knife. 'Sad day': A Manhattan judge approved private investor Brad Zipper's investor's request for a two-year extension of a restraining order against girlfriend Nicole Raef . The New York Post reports that Zipper's fashion consultant girlfriend allegedly picked up a 5-inch blade in the $6million townhouse where they lived during an argument last September 4. She reportedly changed her mind and grabbed a 10-inch knife after judging the first to be too small, according to Zipper's testimony. 'She was screeching at the top of her lungs. She had a blade of significant size, and I was scared,' he said. 'She was coming at me, then I was scared she was going to kill herself.' The investor even brought the two knives to court last week, and was allowed to enter them into evidence after Raef admitted she waved the knives as a joke. The couple's tumultuous relationship became public back in November, when Raef told the Post she'd found herself homeless after being served with a protection order at Zipper's Hamptons estate. 'I was 100 percent shocked,' she told the paper, saying she'd had to pawn a pair of diamond earrings to afford legal counsel. 'We’d been arguing, but we’d worked things out.' Farewell: The Post reports that 29-year-old Raef left the courtroom upset after the judge ruled she'd committed harassment, menacing and criminal mischief, focusing on an issue where she brandished knifes at Zipper . Evidence: Zipper brought the knives in question to court, which were entered into evidence after Raef admitted she'd waved them jokingly . Zipper  told the court then that the restraining order was the only way he could end an abusive relationship that he'd 'attempted to break up several times and somehow was convinced not to.' 'I laid in the same bed with her' on September 5, Zipper said after being asked by Raef's attorney, Brett Kimmel, and though he could not recall if they had sex then, Raef claims they did. In documents filed for the original restraining order, Zipper described coming home to find his oven on fire and Raef passed out in the guest room one night in 2012. 'When she woke up, she was delirious and didn’t even remember driving and getting into an accident with my car that night,' the documents stated. He also claimed Raef threw wine bottles at his head during a party over the summer, and tossed thousands of dollars worth of his possessions into the pool at his summer home. The relationship with the former head of Zinc Capital Management came with luxurious perks, such as ski trips to Aspen and beach getaways in St Barts, along with access to a $1.7million home in Southampton. But Raef also alleged he'd been pushing prescription pills on her, saying she felt pressured to take the anxiety and depression medication Ativan by Zipper. 'There’s times when he’s made me feel worthless or completely desperate, and I did take it, as he encouraged me to and stood there with his hand out,' she said in court. The trial also brought an admission from Zipper that he had taken illegal drugs at least 20 times over 4 years with Raef, according to the Post. In court on Friday, Zipper's lawyer, Marcy Katz, made mention of prescription pills, when talking about an email exchange where Raef apologized for breaking a door and said she took a Xanax afterwards. Granting the two-year extension for the protective order, Judge Bednar said she found issues regarding the 'credibility' of both parties, but took the threat at knifepoint seriously. 'Certainly a nine-inch chef’s knife being waved at someone . . . with a threat to commit suicide . . . gives someone cause for concern for their own physical safety,' Bednar said. She found that Raef committed harassment, menacing and criminal mischief and urged her to seek mental health counseling and substance abuse treatment. 'She believes she is the victim here and I believe that this is what the evidence established,' said Kimmel after the decision was handed down. 'All Nicole could do was try to defend herself,' Kimmel said about the claims of abuse and harassment. 'The bar in these types of cases is set very, very low.' Leaving the courtroom, Zipper's only comment was to say 'It’s just a sad day.'","Former hedge fund executive Brad Zipper, 50, filed a protective order against his girlfriend in November .

"Two tearaway brothers aged just 12 and 14 are believed to be the youngest siblings in Britain to be slapped with criminal ASBOs after terrorising their neighbourhood for three years. Thomas Wood, 12, and his older brother Paul, 14, kicked footballs at cars, placed objects in the way of traffic and used verbally abusive language in a number of racially-aggravated incidents. The brothers caused havoc in Worcester and they have now been barred from playing 'chicken' in the street, making rude hand gestures and spitting in public. Paul Wood, 14, and his younger brother Thomas, 12, are believed to be the youngest siblings in Britain to be slapped with criminal ASBOs after terrorising their neighbourhood for three years . They have been told to stay away from two sets of shops in the West Midlands city and must not play ball games on two roads in the area for the next two years. Under the terms of their CRASBOs they have also been prohibited from being verbally abusive and shouting or swearing in a manner that is likely to cause alarm, harassment or distress. The order was granted at Worcester Magistrates Court following an application from West Mercia Police who said their actions 'impacted significantly' on their local community. A CRASBO is a criminally sought Anti-Social Behaviour Order and if it is breached, the maximum penalty is five years in jail for an adult or a two year Detention and Training Order for juveniles - 12 months of which is custodial. PC Paul Slaymaker, of Arboretum and Claines safer neighbourhood team, said: 'These CRASBOs indicate West Mercia Police's priority of protecting people from harm and bringing those who cause distress in local communities to justice, regardless of their age.

'The order means that for the next two years they have to comply with a number of conditions aimed at tackling the issues they have caused. 'If they are found breaching any of the conditions of the order they commit a criminal offence which, if successfully convicted, could result in a prison sentence of up to five years.' The force said they had taken the unusual step of naming and shaming the boys and releasing their images in order to inform the community of their crimes. Superintendent Kevin Purcell, policing commander for South Worcestershire, added: 'When releasing photographs of young people I am always mindful of the impact this can have on them. 'There has been the need to balance the volume and scope of their anti-social behaviour with their needs and the need to notify the community of these orders so we can properly enforce them.'

At the next station we poured warm water on it and after a few minutes the feeling came back into the fingers. But I lost the glove. 'If the station had been further away, it could have been more serious. Thankfully we found a replacement glove and I was able to continue. 'Any part of your skin exposed was in danger. I was lucky in that the worst injury I got during the race was very bad windburn on my face.' He finished the race on Union Glacier four hours ahead of his closest competitor, Kevin McGeeney, despite only signing up at the last minute. Speaking after his win, Mr Whyte said: 'It was an amazing once in a lifetime experience. The scenery is out of this world.' The marathon runner had only been back from injury for one week before taking on the mammoth challenge. He suffered a stress fracture in his hip after the 100km World Championships in Doha in November last year. This was brought on by his osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. The competitors and crew slept in tents (pictured) on Union Glacier and some runners prepared by training on treadmills in industrial freezers . The father-of-two, who suffers from bone condition osteoporosis, said he was close to losing his fingers to frostbite during the gruelling race . In 2012 Keith won the British and Irish Championships, along with ultra-marathons in Dingle and Longford, Ireland. As a result of his victories, he was  ranked number one for fifty miles in Europe and number two in the world. Despite his experience, he admitted before the race: 'I don't know how you can prepare for something like this because it will be minus 30, minus 34 degrees,' he admitted before the race. 'It will be running on snow and then wearing so many layers, when I'd be just used to wearing shorts and a singlet.' Runners have been known to prepare for the freezing temperatures by running on treadmills in giant industrial freezers. Advice on the website for the race said: 'Having some prior experience of running on ice / snow terrain in temperatures of -25C with your polar clothing would obviously be advantageous, but probably not practical for people who live in more temperate climates. 'As a result, some competitors have come up with innovative means of preparing for the race. These methodologies have ranged from running on beach sand to running on treadmills in freezers.' He finished the race on Union Glacier four hours ahead of his closest competitor, Kevin McGeeney, despite only signing up at the last minute .","Father-of-two Keith Whyte, 33, won the 100km Ice Marathon in Antarctica .

"Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan produced a fabulous display at Anfield and his timing could barely have been better. Liverpool are one of the clubs monitoring Bogdan’s situation aware that he is out of contract at the end of the season and resisting Bolton’s efforts to re-sign. The 27-year-old Hungarian was making only his second appearance since August – Andy Lonergan has been preferred – and he responded with an array of brilliant saves to frustrate Liverpool and secure a lucrative replay for the Championship club. Adam Bogdan (right) could be a target for Liverpool after a brilliant FA Cup performance against the Reds . The Bolton goalkeeper pulls off a brilliant save to keep out a shot from Fabio Borini . He has now kept clean sheets in two FA Cup ties, which will alert more clubs to his availability on a free transfer in the summer. Several Bundesliga teams have been on his trail, with scouts in the crowd at Anfield. Bolton rejected a bid of £1.2million last summer from Mainz, who are still keen to sign Bogdan. Stuttgart and Hannover are also watching him, and there is interest from clubs in the Barclays Premier League although, after this season on the fringes at Bolton, he will not be keen on more time on the bench as a back-up goalkeeper.

"It was a perfect 17th Century procession - just with a few more cameras and a bit less blood. This troupe of Civil War re-enactors turned heads outside Buckingham Palace today  in honour of Charles I, who had his cut off 366 years ago. His execution, seven years into a war between royalists and parliamentarians who claimed Charles had committed 'wicked' abuses of power, crushed the idea of an all-powerful king - though the monarchy was restored just 11 years. Riding horses and wearing armour and uniforms typical of the time, the Society of King Charles the Martyr played the part of the royalist King's Army in a ceremony which has been carried out annually since 1951. They retraced the king's short final journey from St James' Palace in central London to the Banqueting House in Whitehall, where crowds groaned with discomfort as his head was chopped off in one clean stroke on a raised scaffold. Thankfully for the witnesses today, there was no beheading. Instead the volunteers laid a simple wreath at the spot where the king was 'martyred' more than three centuries ago. History: Tourists and Londoners at Buckingham Palace did a double-take today as Civil War re-enactors marched on horseback in The Mall. The ceremony was to retrace the final journey of Charles I on January 30 1649, the day he was executed after a bitter and bloody civil war . Passionate: The ceremony was carried out by the Society of King Charles the Martyr, which believes the king was dealt a great injustice . Uniforms: The Civil War enthusiasts have been commemorating Charles' journey to the scaffold at London's banqueting house for 64 years . Calm: Thankfully for the onlookers, there was a lot less blood than 366 years ago, when Charles' head was chopped off on a public block . Proud history: The group is part of the English Civil War Society, which claims to be one of the oldest re-enactment groups in the world . Remembrance: The volunteers laid a simple wreath at the spot where the king was killed, and will hold another ceremony on January 30 . Procession: Holding antique muskets, the volunteers filed out onto Horse Guards Parade next to St James' Palace in central London . Horseback: The riders bore standards wore thick leather uniforms - handy for guarding themselves against the grim January weather .","King executed in London's Whitehall on January 30 1649 after bloody war between royalists and parliamentarians .

"Nicole Pisani quit her job as a chef at a top London restaurant to make exotic school dinners . A top chef at one of London's most exclusive restaurants has quit her job to make exotic school dinners for just 92p a head. Nicole Pisani made a name for herself as chef de cuisine at Nopi - a fashionable, Asian-inspired restaurant in Soho owned by Yotam Ottolenghi - but resigned after tiring of 80-hour weeks in a demanding kitchen. Tomorrow she starts what is arguably an even more challenging job - preparing lunch for 500 hungry schoolchildren on a tiny budget. Ms Pisani - who is used to creating exquisite dishes such as tea-smoked lamb cutlet with jalapeño salsa, and seared tuna with tender-stem broccoli - will take on a school dinners menu which includes the likes of pizza and spaghetti bolognese. But the chef is looking to tear up the menu at Gayhurst Community School in Hackney, north-east London, with the primary school children to be served dishes including sweet potato and spinach dhal muffins, and fresh salmon goujons. After quitting from her job at Nopi, Ms Pisani set about looking for a new challenge. A friend spotted a tweet from restaurateur Henry Dimbleby, which said the chef at his son's school had left and asked if anyone was interested in applying for the job. Ms Pisani handed in her CV and was called in to cook a trial meal, which went down well with staff and children, the Guardian reported. She said: 'I had an amazing time at Nopi. It was a massive learning experience for me. But after two-and-a-half years I was tired. I wanted a break. It's hard being on your feet for 16 hours a day.' Ms Pisani quit her job as chef de cuisine at Yotam Ottolenghi's Nopi (pictured) after tiring of 80-hour weeks . The chef will introduce fresh salmon goujons and sweet potato and spinach dhal muffins to the menu at Gayhurst Community School in Hackney, north-east London . Ms Pisani left her job at Nopi, which was set up by esteemed chef and writer Yotam Ottolenghi . Ms Pisani, who is keen for the children to eat from plates as opposed to plastic trays, said she was looking forward to her new, 'rewarding' job. 'I want to try and stick to the same menu they have, but cook it better,' she said. 'In school kitchens the mentality is they are cooks, not chefs. But it would be really nice to have people who love cooking in schools. I've always loved feeding people. It's a profession, but the idea that you feed someone is so rewarding.' The current menu at the inner-city school includes wholegrain pasta with bolognese, pizza with salad and cauliflower cheese. From tomorrow, however, this will change. Pupils will be served sweet potato and spinach dhal muffin cake, with celeriac and parsnip, smashed beetroot and labneh - a type of Greek yoghurt. On Friday, children will have a choice of salmon goujons or cheese and butternut squash quiche, with peashoots, sour cream and corn salsa. Ms Pisani is even planning to introduce clams and seaweed to the menu, but says she will hold off more exotic ingredients for the time being, instead focusing on persuading the 150 children who bring in lunchboxes to switch to school dinners.","Nicole Pisani used to cook exquisite dishes at Nopi restaurant in Soho .

"Juan Cuadrado failed to justify his £27million price tag as Fiorentina threw away a first half lead to draw 1-1 with Roma at the Stadio Artemio Franchi. Mario Gomez opened the scoring but the hosts couldn't hold on and former Viola forward Adem Ljajic equalised shortly after the break. While Colombian midfielder Cuadrado showed moments of talent, some of his decision making at key moments could leave Chelsea scouts wondering if he's really worth his considerable release clause. Mario Gomez deflects David Pizarro's shot past Morgan de Sanctis to open the scoring on Sunday night . Roma defender Kostas Manolas calls for offside as Gomez's shot hits the back of the net . Adem Ljajic equalises for Roma after good work from Argentine team-mate Juan Iturbe . Roma's Serbian forward refuses to celebrate after scoring against his former club .

Gomez scored just three goals for Fiorentina last season, that's a tally he's now matched in his last two games alone. In the 19th minute, David Pizarro drilled a shot into the area and the German forward instinctively stuck his foot in its path, deflecting the ball past the helpless Morgan de Sanctis from six yards out. As the Roma players called for offside, Gomez soaked up applause from the home fans with a bravado that belied his woeful early-season form. Going behind was no less then the visitors deserved, but they came close to an equaliser shortly after. Radja Nainggolan rose to beat his marker at a corner but his header couldn't find a way past Viola goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who tipped it over the bar acrobatically. Rudi Garcia's night got worse in the 34th minute when Kevin Strootman, who spent nine months out injured last season, was taken off with knee problem. And Roma's French manager evidently had stern words with his side at half time because they were level three minutes after the break. Juan Iturbe crossed for former Fiorentina man Ljajic who took one touch before guiding it home from close-range. As the game wore on only the home side looked like scoring a winner but a lack of cutting edge meant both sides were left frustrated with a draw that only benefited their rivals. Second-placed Roma are now seven points behind league leaders Juventus while Fiorentina, whose main aim this season is Champions league qualification, remain two points adrift of the European places.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers thinks his team will be ready to challenge for the title again next season. Having run Manchester City a close second in May their chances of repeating the feat dipped after the sale of Luis Suarez, the introduction of half-a-dozen new players and injury to Daniel Sturridge. However, Rodgers' side have started to find their form - including a number of the summer arrivals - in recent weeks and Rodgers believes it is a sign of what they are capable of. He believes if they can win some silverware before then - they have an FA Cup fourth round tie against Bolton at the weekend followed by the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Tuesday - it will enhance their chances further. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: Win the cup and then target league next season . Brendan Rodgers watched his side in training at Melwood on a cold Thursday afternoon . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was in good spirits as he joined his team-mates for a training session . Mario Balotelli fights off the cold and also a challenge from Jordan Rossiter . 'The reality for us this season was, could we finish in the top four? With so many changes we weren't going to challenge for the league,' he said. 'We were looking to win a trophy and then come next summer we will be ready to challenge for the title again. 'This year was about getting into the top four, trying to minimise the impact of so many new signings, giving them time to develop and target a trophy in the cup competitions. 'Emre Can, Mamadou Sakho, Philippe Coutinho, Raheem Sterling, Alberto Moreno, Javier Manquillo, Adam Lallana - all players who still have a lot to develop. 'The squad is looking exciting but needs that time to evolve. Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho and young forward Raheem Sterling in training . Liverpool captain Gerrard shares a joke with Sterling and Jordan Henderson . 'If we can get success in a cup competition this year it will provide greater motivation and stimulation for them to stay together and perform. 'Along the way you have to bring in ready-made quality to help their growth. 'Come the summer time that period of integration should be complete and we can challenge for the title like we did last season.' Leading that challenge is likely to be midfielder Jordan Henderson, currently vice-captain but favourite to take over the armband when Steven Gerrard moves to the Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the season. Rodgers would not confirm Henderson was definitely in line for the job but he did praise the 24-year-old's development in a leadership role. Italian striker Balotelli challenges his team-mate Glen Johnson for the ball in a training drill . Liverpool boss Rodgers gives £25m signing Adam Lallana some advice at Melwood . That was more than evident when he stood up to Chelsea striker Diego Costa both on the pitch and in the tunnel during Tuesday's League Cup first leg. 'When I first came in he was searching for his status at the club but the team who brought him in before knew he was a good persona and a strong character and that has continued,' added the Reds boss. 'Now you see his leadership qualities on and off the field; he will protect the team and his colleagues and he is a wonderful ambassador for the club. 'I felt by giving him the vice-captain he could carry that if Steven wasn't playing and he does it with great pride and honour. 'As a footballer he is still improving and developing and he will continue to do that. 'He was given the vice-captaincy role, that doesn't always mean that player goes on to become the captain. It is not automatic. Rodgers has seen his team's form improve of late and they are unbeaten in over a month . Lazar Markovic has started to make his make at Anfield after a slow start to his Liverpool career . Rodgers' side face Bolton on Saturday before visiting Chelsea for the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi . 'But certainly at this moment in time when Steven doesn't play he does it in great fashion. 'When you see him in the tunnel leading out the team he has great presence and good status and the supporters respond to him, . 'He is in a really good moment.' Looking to the future, Rodgers is hopeful of tying up the details on Sterling's long-awaited contract extension soon. 'It is something the club are speaking with his representatives on and I would think that would be concluded very imminently,' he said. 'The player is very happy. It (the delay) is nothing to do with Raheem, he wants to be here so hopefully we get the solution on that very soon.' Rodgers is still waiting for the even longer-awaited return from injury of Sturridge, who has not played for the Reds since August 31. 'We are still waiting and still working. He won't be available for the weekend,' Rodgers said.","Brendan Rodgers wants Liverpool to win at least one cup this season .

"Arsenal's new midfield star Francis Coquelin will make Arsene Wenger sweat on his offer of a new contract by waiting to see if he is still in the first team when Jack Wilshere returns from injury next month. Coquelin is out of contract in the summer and his outstanding performance in the 2-0 win at Manchester City last weekend means that he is now being courted by Premier League rivals and by clubs in his native France. Arsenal have offered the holding midfielder a new deal but with the club lining up a summer bid for Borussia Dortmund’s Ilkay Gundogan, with Wilshere back from injury in mid February and with Mikel Arteta expected to sign a one-year extension, Coquelin’s first- team opportunities look limited. Francis Coquelin was widely praise for his performance against Manchester City last Sunday . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is hoping the 23-year-old midfielder will sign a new contract . But Coquelin is waiting to see if he'll still be in the side following the return from injury of Jack Wilshere . Coquelin, 23, has been at Arsenal since he was 17 and wants to stay at the club - but only if he is in Wenger’s plans for the first team. He was already resigned to leaving this summer until Wilshere’s injury brought an unexpected recall from his loan spell at Charlton last month. Coquelin has since started in five games, four of which Arsenal have won, conceding just three goals. Coquelin in training on Saturday alongside defenders Per Mertesacker (centre) and Laurent Koscielny (right) Coquelin challenges for the ball with striker Olivier Giroud (left) at London Colney training ground . The Frenchman was widely praised for bringing defensive discipline to Arsenal’s often cavalier approach to games after the unexpected 2-0 win at City. But with just five months left on his deal, Arsenal may have left it too late to convince him to stay and risk losing him on a free transfer as they did with Bacary Sagna and Mathieu Flamini. Wilshere is slightly ahead of schedule in his rehabilitation and is expected back in mid February. If Coquelin were to find himself dropped, he would almost certainly have to leave in the summer to ensure more playing time.","Arsene Wenger sweating on new contract for Francis Coquelin .

A message for supporters to stay in their seats at half time appeared on the big screens during the match next to a picture of Stallone holding aloft an Everton scarf. A message for Everton fans to remain in their seats at half time appeared on the big screens . Supporters were captured on camera as a film crew came on tot eh pitch at half time . The film crew wheeled a camera out on to the Goodison Park pitch at half time to shoot for the movie . On Monday afternoon, ahead of their clash against the Baggies, Everton confirmed there will be a film crew present at half-time by tweeting: 'Remember to stay in your seats at HT to star alongside @TheSlyStallone and @TonyBellew in the new 'Rocky' film. #EFC.' Bellew plays Pretty Boy Porter, the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet and the man standing in the way of Adonis Creed - the son of late former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.

"Thirteen months on and Steve Clarke admits he did not see it coming. He was talking about his sacking in December 2013, the bottom line of a late-night training-ground conversation after West Brom had been beaten in Cardiff. But the Reading manager’s words would have been equally applicable to Cardiff, a low-to-mid-table team in the Premier League then, but now in a dreadful, cost-cutting freefall. Kenwyne Jones opened the scoring for the hosts but they now have only a mediocre Championship campaign to consider after Oliver Norwood and Hal Robson-Kanu hit back with goals for Reading. Steve Clarke watches on as his Reading side came from behind to beat Cardiff City in the FA Cup . Oliver Norwood (right) equalised for Clarke's Reading team with a brilliant free kick . Striker Hal Robson-Kanu (left) scored the winning goal for Reading to get to round five of the FA Cup . Cardiff were so poor that their manager Russell Slade admitted that if he was a fan he would have walked out. Clarke, though, has no such desire. He was a year out of management after leaving West Brom but three wins in seven games since taking over a struggling club have them moving in the right direction. ‘I don’t think when I get back to the training ground that the chairman will be waiting for me,’ he said after this win. ‘But then I didn’t think I’d get sacked last time.’ With Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham all out, Clarke, a Cup-winner as a player and coach with Chelsea, added: ‘I think everyone will be thinking it has opened a little.’ Slade’s concerns are deeper. On Saturday, John Brayford was sold to Sheffield United and Kim Bo-kyung released. ‘One or two more’ will follow this week, according to Slade, who must cut the wage bill. Russell Slade admitted after the game that his team's performance was short of what is expected . Kenwyne Jones (second left) put Cardiff ahead but Slade is concerned he could leave the club . He said he has been given no indication that he will lose Jones, the club’s top earner and goalscorer with 12 in all competitions. ‘If an enormous offer came in then that would be left with the owner and chief executive, said Slade. ‘I’d like him here. At this stage there is no kind of mandate to lose Kenwyne.’","Steve Clarke was sacked as West Brom boss after losing to Cardiff City .

"Caroline Wozniacki came through a tough test in her first-round match at the Australian Open - but turned her attention to her beloved Liverpool afterwards as she revealed her sadness at Steven Gerrard's departure. Wozniacki was pushed hard in the first set by 18-year-old Taylor Townsend but eventually went on to secure a 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 victory to progress to the last 64 on Tuesday. But the post-match discussion was not all about tennis as Gerrard's impending summer switch to LA Galaxy was brought up in Wozniacki's press conference.

The Dane is a huge Liverpool fan and once warmed up in a Reds shirt signed by Gerrard before a match at the 2011 Qatar Open. But now that Gerrard is due to leave the Anfield club, Wozniacki is considering a trip to Los Angeles to watch him in action in MLS. Wozniacki said: 'I'm obviously sad. I think Stevie has done so much for the team over the years. 'He's a legend. I think if that's what he thinks is the right time, I have to support that. 'But at the same time he had a talk with the manager and said that maybe he wasn't going to be playing as much. 'Yeah, I'm a little sad. I'm going to have my Stevie G jerseys hanging somewhere. 'Unfortunately he won't be playing there anymore. I'll have to make a trip probably to LA to have a look again.' Wozniacki beat Taylor 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 to progress to the second round of the Australian Open . Wozniacki, 24, rallies back and forth with Townsend, 18, during their match at Melbourne Park . After losing the final of the US Open to good friend Serena Wiliams last September, former world No 1 Wozniacki is still bidding to win her maiden Grand Slam. The 24-year-old's first match in Melbourne was hard work against American rising star Townsend, who three years ago was controversially asked by the USTA to sit out of the US Open junior event due to her weight. But Townsend has put that behind her to climb into the top 100 and she further showed her future promise by providing a stiff challenge for Wozniacki on the Margaret Court Arena. The pair exchanged breaks in the first set before Townsend got tight in the tie-break and Wozniacki took advantage to move a set ahead. Wozniacki then made just four unforced errors in the second set as she went on to wrap up the win in one hour and 32 minutes. Wozniacki is currently ranked as the World No 8 and is bidding to win her first Grand Slam title . Wozniacki shakes hands with Townsend after their match which lasts one hour and 32 minutes . She said: 'It was a tough match. You just want to get through that first round really. You saw yesterday how many seeds went out. You always know that first one, maybe it's not going to be that comfortable. 'I just needed to grind it out and just stay with her. I'm happy to be through and on to the next one.' Wozniacki's victory sets up a blockbuster second-round match on Thursday against Victoria Azarenka, who has won the title here twice in the last three years but is unseeded due to her long lay-off last year with a foot injury. Wozniacki said: 'It's going to be tough. She's won here before. It's not the easiest on paper. 'But at the same time I'm just going to focus on myself, my own game. Honestly, whether you have to beat her in the second round or fourth round, whatever, doesn't matter if you want to win the tournament.'

League One Chesterfield were given the respect they deserved with McClaren selecting a strong side, including Bent and Spanish defender Raul Albentosa. Derby also trialled a new formation, going for the suddenly back-in-fashion three central defenders against Chesterfield’s four-four-two. Yet it was the lower League side who started the brighter as striker Armand Gnanduillet twice found himself in what could be described as shooting positions. Unfortunately for the forward both efforts were blocked and, as a consequence, Derby woke up. The breakthrough came from Omar Mascarell’s corner, which was headed into the turf by Jake Buxton, bounced up and there was master predator Bent from close range.

Jeff Hendrick (left) controls the ball for Derby ahead of pressure from Chesterfield's Dan Gardner (right) A year ago Bent netted in the FA Cup for Fulham against Norwich. Two seasons ago he was wearing a Villa shirt as he scored against Ipswich and Millwall in the same competition. Whether the wanderer has found his spiritual home at the iPro is too soon to say but he is guaranteed lots of chances from Derby’s open style of play. A few were created against Chesterfield, who were playing their sixth Cup tie thanks to a replay with MK Dons after fielding an ineligible player and a bona fide replay for drawing with Scunthorpe. Throw Braintree into the mix and Paul Cook’s team had earned the right for a day in the limelight. Six thousand fans made the short trip for a Derbyshire derby and a rare FA Cup meeting between the two sides. This was the third time they have met in this competition. Historical . note: In 1948 Derby won by this scoreline and in 1907 the first match was 1-1 with Derby winning the replay 4-0. More usual these days is a fixture for the Derbyshire Centenary Cup. Chesterfield wanted to make the most of their first fourth round tie since the famous run of 1997 when they went all the way to the semi-finals. In the end, though, they could not make the most of their rare chances. James O’Shea and Jimmy Ryan might look back with a tinge of regret after snatching at shots.

Chesterfield goalkeeper Tommy Lee, on the other hand, played commendably well making saves from Bent and Johnny Russell.

"Strong minded and individual as they are, neither Eugenie Bouchard nor Maria Sharapova particularly enjoy the comparisons that are inevitably made between them. That does not stop them being paired up in the covering term 'Geniepova', and their careers will converge further after they set up a meeting in the quarter final of the Australian Open. Their latest encounter comes around after the 20 year-old Canadian defeated Romania's Irina-Camelia Begu 6-1 5-7 6-2 while the Russian made impressively short work of Shuai Peng, winning 6-3 6-0.

Sharapova celebrates after setting up a last-right clash with Eugenie Bouchard at the Australian Open . It will be a repeat of their French Open quarter final of last year, when Sharapova prevailed 6-2 in a deciding set. But so far there are no signs of Bouchard's breakthrough season being an aberration, and she will be even more of a threat this time. Having made two Grand Slam semis and the Wimbledon final last year there is the potential for 2015 to be difficult for the Canadian, although she is handling the pressure admirably so far. Leave alone the obvious physical comparisons between them, and the fact that they are both charismatic with a fondness for the limelight, the most interesting thing is that, temperamentally, they are both as tough as tungsten. Eugenie Bouchard takes a rest on a line  judge's chair after losing a point against Irina-Camelia Begu . Bouchard struggled in the second set but regrouped and fought back well in the decider .

Neither makes any pretence, for example, of wanting to make friends in the women's locker room, which is said to be going through one of the more welcoming phases in its history. 'I personally don't know Genie very well,' acknowledged Sharapova, when asked if she saw anything of herself in her next opponent. 'As a tennis player she's a big competitor. She's an aggressive player that likes to take the ball early and dictate points. From that perspective, definitely.' Sharapova recalls the time when she was emerging, and people inevitably searched for equivalents. 'When I was coming up I was compared to (Anna) Kournikova, and still that names comes up occasionally in articles. 'That's just part of the game, part of the business, it's understandable. When I was a teenager I didn't want to be the next anyone, I want to be the next Maria Sharapova, and that's how I've been through my whole career.' The two of them will agree about that, even if there will not be any Serena Williams-Caroline Wozniacki tyope solidarity between them. But Sharapova will need to get used to Bouchard, as she is already signalling that she will be around for the long haul.","Maria Sharapova and Eugenie Bouchard will meet at the Australian Open .

"Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has renewed calls for Australia to become a republic as campaigners continue to demand the country should have a new flag, minus the Union Jack. 'Let us have the courage to ask ourselves if we measure up to more than just a grab-bag of clichés,' Mr Shorten said. The Labor leader used a speech on the eve of Australia Day to urge Australians to breathe new life into the dream of an Australian head of state. Speaking at a book launch in Melbourne, Mr Shorten urged: 'Let us declare that our head of state should be one of us. On the eve of Australia Day, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has renewed calls for Australia to become a republic . 'Let us rally behind an Australian republic - a model that truly speaks for who we are, our modern identity, our place in our region and our world.' 'Let us be brave enough to demand constitutional recognition for the first Australians, and let us breathe new life into the dream of an Australian head of state,' he added. His comments have been echoed by Australian Republican Movement chairman Geoff Gallop who admits pushing the cause is hard work. On current figures, a third of Australians want an Australian head of state, a third favour the current system, and the rest remain to be convinced either way. Mr Gallop welcomed the latest intervention by Mr Shorten. But there just isn't the kind of support for a republic that there was at the time of the 1999 referendum, he said. Campaigners are calling for Australia to be given a new flag, minus the Union Jack . Australia's Head of State is the Queen of Australia, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II (left), but Mr Shorten wants to see an Australian in charge. Derryn Hinch (right) has called for a new Australian flag . Mr Gallop said it was tough work - although he believed more Australians wanted a republic than didn't. 'It's hard work for us republicans - there's no doubt about that,' he told ABC radio. 'There is no doubt that the failure of the referendum in 1999 set the campaign back.' Mr Gallop said the Australian constitution wasn't truly independent, with the head of state determined by hereditary processes that have emerged from the history of another country. 'The great unifying thing to do would be say let's have a proper process, have a democratic engagement and determine a model for the future. Those of us who believe have just go to keep their advocacy up,' he said. 'At each step we go forward in this way, our confidence lifts up and we are better as a nation.' Australian Republican Movement chairman Geoff Gallop admits pushing the cause is hard work . The fight for a republic coincides with further calls for the Australian flag to be changed. Many believe the Union Jack should be ditched from the flag, including journalist and commentator Derryn Hinch. 'It should have been changed in 1988. I was living in Canada when its flag was changed to the Maple leaf; it was a great thing for Canada. We should remove the Union Jack,' Hinch told Daily Mail Australia. 'What should be on it is should be for others to decide. The current flag was won in a competition set up by a tobacco company,' he said, adding that he doesn't want to see 'a boxing kangaroo' on a new flag. TV presenter Ray Martin also wants the Aussie flag redesigned. Writing for News.com.au he asked: 'How many of our soldiers died fighting under those state flags? None. 'So why are those state flags all still so untouchable, too? And what does it say about us and our need to cling to the apron strings of England 114 years after Federation?'","Mr Shorten spoke at a book launch in Melbourne on the eve of Australia Day .

The 35-year-old came back from a possible career-ending injury to play 20 matches and helped Sydney reach the grand final last season. While keeping himself busy offside, the footballer supported three causes: Racism It Stops With Me, White Ribbon and Recognise. Scroll down for video . AFL star Adam Goodes is considering a career switch to politics when he hangs up his boots . 'To get things done and the causes that I support, you need to have good relationships with government to get that reach to provide services and to provide education,' Goodes said before his speech. 'There is no doubt in the future that I will be working with government in some form to make sure I continue this strong messaging and to get the outcomes we require - so it is definitely not a no and not a yes.' Since he was awarded the title, the number of organisations backing Racism It Stops With Me has increased by more than 30 per cent and supporters of Recognise grew from 178,000 to over 250,000. And while Goodes is surrounded by sporting greats and notable Australians, it's the words of a 12-year-old girl that inspires him to keep fighting. The Sydney Swans star campaigned against racism and violence against women, and pushing for indigenous constitutional recognition . AFL star Adam Goodes embraces Rosie Batty as 2015 Australian of the Year award outside Parliament House . In his valedictory speech in Canberra, Goodes read out a letter from Brooklyn, a Wagga Wagga student, who wrote to him after he was racially abused by a teenager during the indigenous AFL round in 2013. 'I would like to tell you that I definitely admire the way you stood up for, not only yourself, but for everyone who is put down for who they are,' the letter read. 'I believe that no one should be put down for what they look like, how they act, what colour their skin is. If you really think about it, it's just a colour.' Goodes was humbled by the number of letters like Brooklyn's he received throughout the year and thanked teachers and parents for starting conversations about racism with children. 'They are the future and they are the ones who really give me a lot of hope what this nation is going to be in many years to come.' In 2013, Goodes was gutted after a 13-year-old ranted racial slurs, calling him an 'ape' which prompted the player to point her out from the crowd .

The AFL star pledged to continue to stand up against racism and female violence and push for a referendum for constitutional recognition . The AFL star pledged to continue to stand up against racism and female violence and push for a referendum for constitutional recognition. 'To me, the heartbreak of this constitutional exclusion is that it denies the true span of our country's history to every Australian today and to all those into the future,' he said. 'It will do so until we fix it.' Both major political parties have thrown their support behind constitutional recognition, however its form and timeline remain uncertain. 'For putting this right, (it) would be a defining and uplifting achievement for every one of us who now calls this nation home,' Goodes said. When taking the Australian of the Year crown, Goodes' dream was for Australians to break down barriers between races and treat each other as equals.

Ms Batty said her son Luke, who was tragically murdered by his father, would be proud of her for winning the prestigious award . Son, Luke, was 11 years old when he was brutally murdered at cricket practice by his father, Greg Anderson . Her 11-year-old son Luke was brutally murdered at cricket practice by his father, Greg Anderson, last February at Tyabb cricket ground, south-east of Melbourne. Anderson was shot dead by police soon after he killed his son. Ms Batty described the experience as 'very humbling', saying 'the other people that were also nominated as Australians of the year ... have done incredible work for decades in their own fields. 'So to be chosen among such amazing people is incredulous and I'm really, really thankful', she continued. Ms Batty speaks at the funeral service for her 11-year-old son Luke at the Flinders Christian Community College in Tyabb last February . She also revealed to host Lisa Wilkinson she wished her son was by her side during such an important time . In November Ms Batty (centre) lead hundreds of people in Melbourne on a White Ribbon Day Walk about family domestic violence . On Sunday, Prime Minister Tony Abbott took the stage on the lawns outside of Parliament House in Canberra to announce the Australian of the Year for 2015. 'I am truly honoured. I would like to dedicate this award to my beautiful son Luke. He's the reason I have found my voice and I'm able to be heard,' Ms Batty said after the announcement. 'Whilst we celebrate the wonderful country that we live in today - there remains a serious epidemic across our nation. 'No matter where you live, family violence exists in every pocket of every neighbourhood. Family violence may happen behind closed doors but it needs to be brought out from these shadows and into broad daylight.' 'One in six women have experienced physical or sexual abuse by a current or a former partner, including some of those celebrating with us today.'

Ms Batty added that Indigenous women 'experience even greater family violence'. With these statistics revealed, Ms Batty said they are 'unacceptable' and 'indisputable'. Ms Batty calls on the government for 'strong leadership' to end family violence and deliver intensive support to those who 'desperately need it'. 'And to the Australian people, look around. Do not ignore what you see and what you know is wrong,' she said. 'Raise the conversation and don't shy away from this uncomfortable topic. We cannot do this without you.

'To the women and children - who are unsafe - in hiding or living in fear - who have changed their names - left their extended families and moved from their communities to find safety - you do not deserve to live a life that is dictated by violence. You are not to blame. 'As the Australian of the year, I am committed to building greater campaigns, to educate and challenge community attitudes. 'I am on a path to expose family violence and to ensure that victims receive the respect, support and safety they deserve. 'And to Luke, my little man, you did not die in vain and will not be forgotten. You are beside me on this journey and with me every step of the way,' Ms Batty said as she concluded her speech.

Ms Batty's award comes after the death of her son that shocked the country, but the way Ms Batty stoically fronted the media in the wake of the horrendous killing stopped the nation. Rosie’s story jolted Australia into recognising that family violence can happen to anyone and she became the voice for many thousands of victims of domestic violence who had until then remained unheard. Since her family tragedy Rosie has championed efforts to fight domestic violence, making many media and public speaking appearances to shine a spotlight on the issue and call for systemic changes. Through her tireless efforts the 52-year-old won the respect and hearts of Australians for her strength of character, and the way in which she has taken her own tragic experience and turned it into a call for change to help save others.

This year’s awards proved to be a historic occasion as women were awarded the top honour in all four award categories - 2015 Australian of the Year, 2015 Young Australian of the Year, 2015 Senior Australian of the Year and 2015 Australia's Local Hero. Author Jackie French, 61, from the Araluen Valley, NSW, was chosen as Senior Australian of the Year; 21-year-old Drisana Levitzke-Gray, from Balga, Western Australia is deaf but who dedicates herself to helping other deaf people and advocating their human rights claimed Young Australian of the Year; while Juliette Wright, 41, the Founder and CEO of GIVIT, from Camp Mountain, Queensland, was recipient of Australia's Local Hero award. Ms Batty was nominated for her work as an anti-domestic violence campaigner. Her mission is to highlight the issue in Australia and for systemic changes to be made. The 52-year has been a vocal advocate against domestic violence since her young son Luke was beaten to death by his father last February. Her composed and courageous response after the horrific killing touched many people. Ms Batty believed the unimaginable tragedy set in motion a chain of events that gave her the drive to help the many families struggling daily with domestic violence. Through her tireless efforts she won the respect and hearts of Australians for her strength of character . 'I guess what I tapped into was a strength I’ve always had - to be articulate, to stand up for myself and what I believe,' she explained. Ms Batty faced competition for the award from movie star Hugh Jackman’s wife Deborra-Lee Furness, who had been nominated for her work as an adoption advocate. She intends to keep fighting for victims of family violence. ‘From an extraordinary group of finalists, all of whom are inspirational Australians and great ambassadors for their home states and territories, we have four Award recipients who stand as role models to us all,’ Chairman of the National Australia Day Council, Ben Roberts-Smith VC, MG, said. ‘It is a great moment in the 55 year history of these Awards to honour four women. ‘Rosie, Jackie, Drisana and Juliette remind us of the many ways in which women contribute to our nation - that women are a force for change, a voice for rights, influencers, educators and the heart of our communities. ‘Most of all, they are admired and respected by their fellow Australians - they are people we can be proud of and look to as examples of the good in us all.’","The popular domestic violence campaigner was announced as the 2015 Australian of the Year on Sunday night .

"Rafael Nadal negotiated a tricky test against Kevin Anderson to reach his 28th Grand Slam quarter-final at the Australian Open on Sunday. World No 3 Nadal came through a tight first set before easing to a 7-5, 6-1, 6-4 victory against South African Anderson which seals a last-eight clash with Tomas Berdych. Nadal said: 'I am very happy with the way I played today. Probably the best match of the year so that is very important for me. Rafael Nadal wasted little time in dispatching Kevin Anderson and reaching the quarter-finals . Nadal battled through the first set and never looked back to book his spot in the last eight . 'For me [the] quarter-finals is a great result. Arriving here after losing in the first round of Qatar, not playing matches for the last seven months, to be in the quarter-finals again here is a very positive thing for me.' Anderson will rue several missed chances in the first set when he failed to convert any of five break points at 5-5 and then missed a volley in the next game to go one set down. Nadal then took charge, dropping just one game in the second set and one break was enough in the third for the Spaniard to claim victory in two hours and six minutes. The 28-year-old now goes on to face seventh seed Berdych after the Czech continued his serene progress through the draw with a 6-2, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 win against Aussie Bernard Tomic. Nadal may be favourite given that he has beaten Berdych in all of their last 17 meetings, but the latter looks to be in fine form with Andy Murray's ex-coach Dani Vallverdu now by his side. Nadal said: 'It doesn't matter what happened in the past. It is a different story this time. Different moment for me, different moment for him. 'I have success against him, but I have the chances to lose against him. I remember in 2012 I had a very, very tough match against him here. I was close to being two sets to love down.' Nadal celebrates his victory over Anderson in typical fashion as he makes through in Melbourne . Nadal is spoilt for choice as two ball boys offer him a towel during a break in play .

"One fisherman got more than he bargained for while on the hunt for Kingfish when he hoisted up a four metre bull shark from the water. Damon Smith-Horak was out fishing off Sydney harbour last week when he snared the monster shark, which weighed in at 200kg. It took him over two hours to reel the ten foot shark in, about 500m off Watson’s Bay. Scroll down for video . One fisherman got more than he bargained for while on the hunt for Kingfish when he hoisted up a four metre bull shark from the water . Speaking to Nine news. Mr Smith-Horak said it was one of the biggest sharks he had ever seen. ‘It’s the biggest bull shark I've ever seen it was about 10 ½ foot long,' he said. While Sydney harbour is a haven for sun worshippers, it wasn't the first shark to come across Mr Smith-Horak's path. Damon Smith-Horak was out fishing off Sydney harbour last week when he snared the monster shark, which weighed in at 200kg . It took him over two hours to reel the ten foot shark in, about 500m off Watson’s Bay . The four metre bull shark was the third shark to take the bait from his line, but it was the only one he managed to keep on the end of the hook. Mr Smith-Horak caught the whole fishing battle on film and viewers can clearly see the veteran fisherman reeling the massive shark in on a simple fishing rod. In the video, the man behind the camera seems to be wary of the shark as Mr Smith-Horak reels it in, declaring 'it's going to eat the boat'. Speaking to Nine news.

The video comes after NSW Premier Mike Baird has promised $100,000 to trial shark-detecting sonar technology, which will undergo rigorous testing at an aquarium before general use. The trial comes after shocking underwater footage revealed many of the nets which partially cover NSW beaches reportedly 'have huge holes easily big enough for a shark to pass through'. 'The expectation is, as the sonar comes out there is an understating they will pick up the sharks in the beaches and that will be texted back to lifesavers on the ground to take early action, early warning,' Premier Mike Baird said on Sunday.

"A Queensland teenager who allegedly racially abused a train guard, then breached his bail after being discovered intoxicated at Schoolies, is now behind bars due to his alleged role in a brutal bashing  last week. In his latest run-in with the law Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar was refused bail in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday, after a violent bashing at a skate park in Brisbane suburb The Gap on Wednesday. The 17-year-old first came into the spotlight when he allegedly spat at Josphat Timothy Mkhwananzi, of African decent, after the security guard told him to remove his feet from the seat of a train on the Ipswich line back in October. Russell-Boumzar was released on bail on the October 13th, pending strict conditions, including staying at his parents' Paddington home when not at work. Scroll down for video . Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar has been refused bail after an alleged brutal beating at skate park in Brisbane suburb The Gap . Russell-Boumzar first came into the spotlight when a video of him allegeldy spitting on and racially abusing train guard Josphat Mkhwananzi went viral . Russell-Boumzar was initally charged for his alleged racial outburst but released on bail by a Brisbane court . However Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia just weeks later that the teen was arrested for being drunk in Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise. On Friday Russell-Boumzar was charged with two counts of assault occasioning bodily harm in company,and also for breaching his strict bail conditions, The Courier Mail reported. He was apparently on the way to the police station as per his conditions when he and two co-offenders confronted two other young men at a skate park in The Gap, where he is said to have grabbed one of the alleged victims by the throat. Since the teenager's apparent abusive rant went viral late in 2014, he has also been fined $350 for being intoxicated in a public place at Schoolies. On December 4 Russell-Boumzar allegedly pulled down his pants in front of a 12-year-old and was subsequently charged with indecently dealing with a child, and was also given community service following an altercation with a French backpacker, according to The Courier Mail. The 17-year-old has re-appeared in court a number of times since last October, seen here walking out of  a Brisbane court barefoot . Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia in November that the teen was arrested for being drunk in Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise . In November was fined $350 by the court and was released ahead of his next court date on December 8 . The teenager was described by police prosecutor Sgt Matt Kahler as high risk of reoffending, . He will appear in court again on March 16, and Magistrate Tina Previtera told the court the charges against Russell-Boumzar were very serious especially as they were allegedly committed while he was under strict bail conditions. It was the video of the alleged racial attack which first put the 17-year-old in the spotlight, and within 24 hours of being posted online it had over three million views. The incident was filmed by Russell-Bouzmar's friend Bailey Clout, 18, who then uploaded the alleged attack, which was described by the magistrate as 'disgusting'. Clout pleaded guilty and was fined $400. On the other hand, Russell-Bouzmar - a second-year apprentice mechanic - was granted conditional bail following the October 2 incident, despite protests from prosecutors. Conditions of his release included abiding by a curfew, reporting to police three times a week and he was forbidden from going near any Queensland Rail infrastructure. Russell-Boumzar's (left) rant was filmed by friend Bailey Clout, 18, (right) who pleaded guilty and was fined $400 . Shocking footage of an intoxicated young man hurling a tirade of racist abuse on a Brisbane train at a security guard went viral. The guard 'Joe' has been commended for his calm actions during the incident . In the viral video, Russell-Boumzar allegedly refers to the train guard as 'n*****' and a 'black c***' repeatedly before he continues to explode into a racist rant during the five-minute video. 'Do you want to come to Australia to learn some proper English?' the teenager said in the video. 'That is the issue c*** - learn some f*****g English 'cause this is Australia c*** because I can't understand you.' 'No, look, my n****r brother - I got my feet off the f*****g seat.' 'Don't touch me - I don't want to speak to you - I don't understand you,' the 17-year-old said. 'Bro, if you want to be a security guard, learn some English first.' An attendant is heard telling the young man to 'get off' at the next stop. Another security guard, wearing a blue top, is seen walking towards the teenager as he continues to drunkenly slur his words to another train worker. Train passengers are seen looking outraged as the teenager utters racial insults before his friend grabs his top and tries to drag him off the train. 'Joe' the security guard remained poised and professional . Magistrate Brownyn Springer said Bailey Clout (pictured) may have done police a huge favour when he decided to film the attack on Queensland Rail security guard Josphat Mkhwananzi . 'I'm trying to get to the next station - l'll sit on this f*****g train for hours if I have to,' the teenager said. 'I'll hold all you f*****s up. I really don't care. Especially this black c***. 'Do you even have an Australian citizenship, you f*****g n****r?' Russell-Boumzar was charged in October with one count of assault, two of assault occasioning bodily harm, one of making threats, two of creating a disturbance, and using a carriage service to menace. Wearing no shoes, Russell-Boumzar was mobbed by media outside a Brisbane court house while he lit up a cigarette. Bailey Clout was charged with one count of creating a nuisance on a railway. 'Joe' was commended for his calm and peaceful way of dealing with the teen who was hurling abuse at him . The teenager will now remain in custody until mid-March . The pair surrendered to police after the footage went viral and sparked a furious online reaction that reportedly included death threats against the teens. Clout, who laughed hysterically may have also given police vital evidence against his friend, said the court magistrate. Magistrate Brownyn Springer said he may have done police a huge favour when he decided to film the attack on the Queensland Rail security guard. There was no doubt the footage would help police in their case against Russell-Boumzar, the magistrate said. The 17-year-old faced the Southport Magistrates Court again on the 24th of November, where he pleaded guilty to breaching his bail and being intoxicated in a public place. He was fined $350 by the court along with an offender levy of $107.10.","Abdel-Kader Russell-Boumzar, 17, has been refused bail after an alleged assault .

"The expectations. The stress. The disappointments. The heat. The boisterous crowd shouting like maniacs as you try to concentrate at match point. It’s all enough to send anyone to breaking point. Temper tantrums are nothing new for the sport, with many tennis professionals channeling their inner-child in the middle of crowded arenas. Serena Williams threatened the line judge in 2009 and Xavier Malisse’s had a hissy fit in 2005, lying on the ground and refusing to get up and resume the match. Of course, it would be remiss not to mention the most famous on-court dummy spit: John McEnroe’s ‘You can not be serious’ tirade at Wimbledon in 1981. Each were memorable for all the wrong reasons and the 2015 Australian Open Grand Slam has been no different. Scroll down for video .

During his temper tantrum, Kyrgios struck his racquet repeatedly whilst swearing in frustration . The 19-year-old received a new racquet - as well as a $4500 fine for racquet abuse and audible obscenity . Several competitors this year have revealed a less-than-flattering side of their personalities whilst Down Under, succumbing to meltdowns on the hot Melbourne courts. On Saturday night, 19th seed John Isner took his rage to centre stage following his shock straight-set loss to unseeded Gilles Muller. An irate Isner threw his tennis racquet across the court twice, running after it to give it another serve to ensure his equipment was sufficiently destroyed. With all the force he could muster the US tennis star slammed the tennis racquet across the floor, where it bounced several times before laying crumpled and useless. It’s not the first time the fiery American has caused some serious damage on court. He showed similarly undesirable traits in 2012 –whacking a tennis ball forcefully into the stands and maiming yet another tennis racquet following a disagreement with the chair umpire.

In Round One, the up-comer lost his cool, smashing his tennis racquet in frustration at the sidelines. During his temper tantrum, the youth struck his racquet repeatedly against the floor whilst swearing in frustration.

However the new racquet was used to win the match and overcome his back pain, which possibly could have triggered his ugly spat.

World female No.1 Serena Williams screams in anger after losing a point to Elinz Svitolina on day six . US tennis champ Serena Williams shouts during her match against Russia's Vera Zvonareva . Young Ukrainian Svitolina quickly put herself ahead 4-1 in the first set. Despite her opponent furiously fighting back to 4-5, Svitolina secured the first set. Clearly Williams felt her form slipping and was not afraid to show her anger with each error in the opening minutes of the match. The passionate tennis player yelled in her heated frustration. However, the 33-year-old was able to maintain the rage and quickly got back on top, taking out the next two sets 6-2 and 6-0 to proceed through to the fourth round. There was heat from both sides of the net when Aussie Lleyton Hewitt and German Benjamin Becker faced off for their round two clash on Thursday night. Hewitt was knocked out of his 19th and possibly last Australian Open despite a strong start, winning the first two sets essentially uncontested. In the most frustrating of circumstances, the 33-year-old went on to lose the next three sets to Becker. Hewitt also threw his racquet and was not amused at he watched it bounce back over his head. Despite his triumph, the gruelling match became too much for Becker, who also threw his racquet after losing a point to Hewitt – obviously unaware that his luck was about to change. With the Tennis Australia ready and waiting to hand out hefty fines to discipline poor conduct, the cost of a tantrum often adds up to fare more than just the price of a replacement racquet.

Not only that, I want her to know he is watching over her.' Now she is also focused on getting guns off the streets, particularly illegal guns, by supporting  Senate Bill 279, which makes carrying a gun an adult offense for anyone over 14 years of age, and imposes harsher penalties amnd jail sentences for threats with a gun or use of a gun. 'I want to start by getting this bill passed, then work from there to start making sure our laws are enforced - because what good is another law if it is not enforced, wrote Jennifer on her website, A Love So Strong. 'Our police force is doing the best they can and they have suffered this past year too. But there has to be a way out there to get these criminals off of the streets.' She then added; 'For those who carry guns legally, this will not affect you in any way so long as you use it within the state of the law.' Simeon Adams, a 16-year-old nicknamed 'Red' with a long criminal history was charged with Nathan's murder. Soon after the crime police released security footage of two males following the 24-year-old, before one of them shepherded him into a parking lot between two buildings and killed him. Adams is alleged to have shot another man just two nights before after they 'bumped' in a steak house car park. Then he was shot in the neck himself on the evening after Nathan’s murder. Adams wanted to rob Nathan, police allege. But to Nathan's family, what makes his killing even more senseless, is that he never carried anythingof value on his walks. 'I have to remind myself every day why he is not next to me,' said Jennifer . Jennifer is working on passing a Senate Bill that would impose stricter gun laws . Simeon Adams (above), a 16-year-old nicknamed 'Red' with a long criminal history was charged with Nathan's murder . Jennifer also revealed Nathan always used to take his daily exercise in the evenings, but fatefully changed his routine that week so he could spend more time with her. That Tuesday was only the second time he had gone for a walk in the morning. ‘When he asked me to marry him he said, ""I want us both to be saints and for us to go to heaven together, side by side"". In his mind our marriage had three people, him, me and God,' Jennifer told DailyMail.com in an interview last year. ‘Nathan actually said I was a better Christian than he could ever be, he said I had a child-like faith, I’m not sure if that’s true, but I never doubted God and this hasn’t changed that. Now I just want to become closer to him so I can see Nate again.’ 'Although he has been described as incredibly humble and gracious, Jennifer says Nathan always believed he was destined for something special and was determined to leave his mark on life.' ‘He had told me he thought he was made for great things, not in an arrogant or presumptuous way', Jennifer explained. ‘I’m not sure he really knew what, but he just felt something. He wanted to be a teacher, so he could have an impact on people. ‘In the last few days people have told me they are going back to church because of Nate’s story. He never dreamed that this is how it would end, but knowing people are going back to church and that they have been touched by his story means a lot to me and would mean so much to him. ‘He used to invite so many of my friends to come to Latin mass and when I saw pictures of how full the church was for his funeral, I thought, he finally did it, he finally got them there.’","Nathan Trapuzzano of Indianapolis, Indiana, was shot dead on April 1 while his wife Jennifer was eight-months pregnant with their first child .

"DNA testing by the FBI has cleared Jesse Matthew of any connection to the abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, the 17-year-old Virginia girl who went missing in 2013 and has never been found. Matthew, 32, has separately been charged with the murder of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, 18, who went missing from a bar in Charlottesvile last September and whose body was found a month later following an extensive search. Matthew has pleaded not guilty to killing Graham. Following Mathew's arrest in October, the attorney for Randy Allen Taylor - the man convicted of Murphy's murder - requested that Matthew be properly examined as a possible suspect in the teen's death. Cleared: DNA testing by the FBI has cleared Jesse Matthew (left) of any connection to the abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, 17 (right), the Virginia girl who went missing in 2013 and has never been found . According to News Advance, swabs of DNA taken from the driver’s side head rest and the steering wheel of Murphy’s Nissan Maxima did not match Matthew, Nelson Commonwealth’s Attorney Anthony Martin said in a news release Friday. In July last year, Randy Allen Taylor was convicted of abducting and killing Murphy and sentenced to two life terms. 'At no time did the name Jesse Matthew ever come up by Randy Taylor or Mr. Hallahan until Matthew’s arrest in the Hannah Graham case in October 2014,' Martin said in the release. Despite Murphy's body never being found, there was overwhelming physical evidence that tied Taylor to her murder. Investigators found a t-shirt under a sofa in Taylor's camper that was splattered with Murphy's blood, as well as the girls shattered cellphone in brush outside the camper. A finger fragment, long black hair and a diamond stud - all with Murphy's DNA - were also found in the camper. In court: Matthew, from Virginia, was arrested and charged in October, 2014, with abducting Hannah Graham . Case: Graham (left), went missing in Charlottesville after leaving a bar at around 2am on September 13. Prosecutors claim the sophomore was unaware that Matthew (right, in his mugshot) was following her . Despite being cleared in the Murphy case, Matthew is also charged in the sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Va., in 2005, according to The New York Daily News. The victim has not been named. Mathew has pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and sexual assault in that case. Additional DNA information has also linked Matthew to the disappearance of Morgan Harrington, a 19-year-old Virginia Tech student, who vanished after attending a concert in Charlottesville in October 2009. Her body was found a few months later. Entering the courtroom: Donning a green jailhouse outfit and with his dreadlocks tied back, Matthew stood up as he entered a not guilty plea a separate 2005 case. The judge set a trial date for March 9, 2015 . As news Graham's disappearance hit the headlines earlier this year, reports emerged that the suspect had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. He first came to police attention when the first sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus. The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped. His last day at the school was the day the accusation was made, the Washington Post reported. Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University, where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003. Tragic losses: Authorities claim Matthew is linked to both the abduction of Miss Graham (left) as well as the disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington (right) in October 2009 . Discovery: Graham's remains were found in a shallow grave in this abandoned property in mid-October . Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not yet clear how this second incident was resolved. In November, Matthew made his first court appearance in the 2005 case via videolink in Charlottesville. Earlier this week, he was transferred to Fairfax Jail ahead of his in-person appearance. He will now be returned to Charlottesville for a preliminary hearing on December 5 in relation to the alleged abduction of Miss Graham with the intent to defile. He is not yet facing murder charges. At the time, Albemarle County Sheriff Chip Harding said Miss Graham's death could have been avoided if Virginia would collect DNA for misdemeanor convictions as well as felonies. Search: These railroad tracks in downtown Charlottesville were part of the search area for Miss Graham . Mr Harding said that had authorities collected DNA from Matthew following a 2010 misdemeanor trespassing conviction, it would have generated a hit that would have linked him to the Fairfax case and the Harrington case years before Graham was killed. On Friday, Mr Morrogh said he agreed about the benefits of expanding DNA collection, describing DNA as 'no different than a fingerprint' and saying: 'We're talking about saving lives here. Lat month, Matthew's attorney, James Camblos, said he had reason to question his client's sanity and requested a psychiatric evaluation. A judge is yet to reject or permit his request. The sexual assault and abduction cases are ongoing.","Jesse Matthew, 32, charged with the abduction and murder of Hannah Graham, 19, in October 2014 .

"Wrestling coach Gary Scott Goins, 46, has been found guilty of raping and molesting  team members . A former high school wrestling coach faces 40 years in prison after being found guilty of raping and molesting his players. Gary Scott Goins, 46, was found guilty on 17 counts of the 20 brought before him, relating to sex crimes against three members of his East Gaston High School team between 1998 and 2004. This included oral and anal sex, which Goins would describe as training. Superior Court Judge Jesse Caldwell sentenced him to a minimum of 34 years and ten months in prison, and a maximum of 43 years and four months. Goins denies any sexual contact with the victims, and has lodged an appeal. Members of the victims' families burst into tears when the former coach was declared guilty. One of the victims told the court he wanted to apologise for not coming forward sooner, the Charlotte Observer reported. 'I could have stopped this from happening,' he said. 'I will not let it happen again. That's one good thing to come out of something so evil.' Turning to a fellow victim, he added: 'Stand true and proud. We can overcome. You can overcome.' The three chief witnesses told of how their coach had abused them on many occasions, in hotel rooms, at school, in his apartment and even in their own homes. One witness described sessions which took place in the his locked bedroom involving different scenarios thought up by Goins, including one for a car race, while the witness had to keep his eyes shut. The outside of East Gaston High School, where Goins had been a trusted wrestling coach . The witness said Goins told him to 'grab the throttle' - his finger, but the next time he did it 'it was his penis in my hand.' The Judge said that Goins had broken trust 'in homes, public schools, taxpayers support and in public property.' He added: 'The coach kept bringing home the gold.' He went on to mention how during the trial 'we’ve heard various officials [at the school] were alerted about problems and nothing was done,' though did not want to pass judgement on the North Carolina school itself. Goins' lawyer, Brent Ratchford, said he had grown close to the defendant during the trial, and believed he should have been given a sentence of maximum 20 years. He told the judge how he had 'tried to serve his community', and how he had turned to God in 2008 - a decision which had changed him. The emotional lawyer told how Goins had said to him: 'God never promised it would be easy'.","East Gaston High's Gary Scott Goins, 46, found guilty of 17 of 20 counts .

"A student who took ‘thinspiration selfies’ to track her dramatic weight loss has spoken out to warn others of the dangers. Holly Temple, 17, took pictures of her shrinking frame as motivation to continue to lose more weight. The teenager from Woking, Surrey, uploaded the pictures onto a password protected blog, which acted as a diary for her to monitor her progress. Scroll down for video . Holly Temple, 17, took regular selfies (pictured left) of her shrinking frame as motivation to continue to lose  weight and at her lightest, weighed just 6 stone 5lbs. After battling anorexia she is now healthy (pictured right) The teenager from Woking, Surrey, uploaded the pictures onto a password protected blog, which acted as a diary for her to monitor her progress. She is pictured here with her parents, having regained some of the weight she lost from skipping meals . When she . reached six stone, Miss Temple was on the verge of being hospitalised . for the second time, but something finally ‘clicked’ and she began to . regain weight. She is now a healthy 8st 5lbs. ‘It's scary to think that by taking all those pictures I was putting my life on the line,’ she said. ‘It was just very important to me to document my weight loss - and ensure I wasn't putting on any weight. ‘I took photos all the time at lots of different angles, and then I'd post them on a private blog to keep track of everything. ‘I'm just so glad I'm in a much better place in my life now and don't have to do that any more, I feel really positive.’ Miss Temple first began taking photos of herself in the summer of 2011. ‘I decided that I needed a way to track my weight, and I wanted to be able to notice a difference,’ she explained. Miss Temple's mother, Yvonne, said: ‘Holly had always been very slim so it was a while before I realised something was wrong. It was so difficult to watch her go through it - we just couldn't get her to eat' ‘If I saw in the picture that I was . thinner, it made me feel really good, but I was very critical and I'd . always think that I needed to lose more weight. ‘I even had the pictures on my phone so that I could look at them when I was away from home. It became quite important to me.’ Miss Temple . first began suffering from an eating disorder at the age of 14, after . she fell out with a group of friends at her school. ‘Rumours had been started about me and it took over my life very quickly,’ she said. ‘After that . it got to the point where if I couldn't control how people felt about . me or what they said, the one thing I could control was my eating.’ At . her lightest, she weighed just six stone. As well as having issues with food, Miss Temple exercised compulsively. She has now gained more than 2st and is a healthy 8st 5lb (right) Anorexia nervosa is often cited as the most lethal mental illness - with a larger ratio sufferers dying than those who have depression or psychosis. Sufferers tend to focus on food but the illness itself stems from low self-esteem and an inability to cope safely with worries, problems and a lack of control. Many who have anorexia lower their food intake by skipping meals and cutting down the types and amounts of food they eat; some over-exercise. Aside from catastrophically severe weight loss, physical symptoms include difficulty sleeping, dizziness, stomach pains, constipation, feeling cold and hair loss. Periods can stop for women and sufferers grow soft, fine hair all over their bodies in a condition called Lanugo. Although researchers are given figures by hospitals around Britain, it is thought the real toll of sufferers could be much higher because many are reluctant to seek help. One symptom is that sufferers shut themselves off from the world and convince themselves that what they are doing is right, even if they are dangerously underweight. Nine out of ten people with an eating disorder are women - but NHS figures suggest there is a growing number of male sufferers. Specialists tend to use psychological treatments such as counselling, though the most severe cases have to be treated in hospital to ensure patients regain weight safely. Sources: BEAT / NHS . ‘I . began to compulsively exercise - if I didn't I'd have trouble sleeping. ‘At . my worst I began to . self-harm too, it was all just so out of control.’ She reached out for help before the disorder took hold by writing a letter to her mother explaining how she was feeling. Yvonne . Temple, 54, booked her daughter a doctor’s appointment, but the doctor . suggested that Holly should come back in a month, during which time her . condition worsened and a school nurse noticed Miss Temple’s dramatic . weight loss. She was referred to her local CAMHS - Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services - and was diagnosed with anorexia in December 2011. After being hospitalised in May 2012, she was discharged but continued to lose weight. ‘By February last year I wasn't allowed to go to school and I realised I just didn't want to go to hospital again,' says Miss Temple. 'Something clicked and I realised that was no point in losing all this weight. ‘I've found it difficult to stay at a healthy weight - and sometimes I do have my bad days - but I've come a really long way,’ she added. Her mother said: ‘Holly had always been very slim so it was a while before I realised something was wrong. ‘It was so difficult to watch her go through it - we went on holiday and it was so stressful as we couldn't get her to eat. 'Sometimes I couldn't believe how sneaky she was, as she would lie to avoid eating. It changed her personality and for a short time she wasn't my Holly anymore, but I would say that we're even closer now than we were before. ‘I still worry about her but we've agreed that if she's ever feeling unsure or anxious, that she must tell me before things get out of control. ‘I've never looked at the pictures she's taken, and I don't think I really want too. I'm just very proud of her for coming through this.

While Santos concluded in the petition that Supanova has been an annual event for most of his childhood, dating back to his first appearance in 2003. 'I have always felt welcomed and loved by both the community, the variety of guests invited, and the family-friendly atmosphere that is harboured [sic],' Santos said in the petition.

'I think quite a few things he has said have been grossly taken out of context...' 'Dont spoil it for those of us who desperately want to see him.' 'Who cares we all have beliefs and what are we turning into an extended US state where the opinions of right or left wing sensationalism is taken for gods right!

"A struggling single mother thought she'd been blessed by God when a new friend offered her baby clothes, but authorities say that it was this chance encounter that left Natalia Robert's child an orphan. Not long before she'd be found dead from a gunshot to the back of the head, Roberts, 30, had called her mother ecstatic over her new friend.

Twisted plot: Catherine Goins, 37 (left), is facing murder charges after police say she shot dead mother-of-two Natalia Roberts (right), 30, so she could claim her two children as her own . Roberts' uncle Benny Robert said his niece believed she had just been given a blessing when the woman who later killed her said she wanted to offer her baby clothes . Lured to her death: Officials say Goins brought Roberts to her ex-boyfriend's house in La Fayette, Georgia, under the pretense of wanting to give her some baby clothes . Roberts' uncle, Benny Roberts, relayed the sad details of that conversation to The Atlanta Journal Constitution Saturday. 'She called her mother and told her that something real good had just happened,' Benny Roberts told reporters shortly after his niece's funeral. 'She was excited about the baby clothes that had been offered to her and how good God was,' he said. Law . enforcement officials in Catoosa County held a press conference . Wednesday morning unveiling the charges against Goins, 37. 'It was like a made-for-TV movie,' Benny Roberts said. Goins, . of Hixson, Tennessee, had pretended she was pregnant and called police . last Friday claiming she had shot an intruder inside her ex-boyfriend’s . home. But an investigation has revealed that Goins’ home invasion story was nothing but a lie concocted to cover up a disturbing abduction plan, Catoosa County Sherif Gary Sisk told reporters, according to the station WRCB . Investigators say Goins met Natalia Roberts, a mother of two, last Friday morning and lured her to the La Fayette home of her former paramour, Tony Richards, claiming she had some baby clothes for her. When Roberts showed up at 227 Smoketree Circle sometime between 11am and 1pm, Goins allegedly shot her in the back of the head from a .380 caliber handgun as they were walking down a flight of stairs. Before fleeing the crime scene with the victim's two young children in tow, Goins allegedly tried to cover up her tracks and called her ex-boyfriend, Tony Richards, telling him she had shot someone inside his residence. 'We're calling it murder because that's what it is,' Sheriff Sisks told reporters. 'She flat-out murdered her.' Young mom: Roberts (far right) was a mother to a three-week-old baby and a three-year-old toddler . In cold blood: Sheriff's officials say Goins shot the woman (pictured) in the back of the head and then took off in her car with the victim's two children . The sheriff added that Catherine Goins’ most recent boyfriend broke up with her after discovering that she had been lying to him about being pregnant, so she decided to present Roberts’ three-week-old baby as her own. When Tony Richards returned home, he discovered a woman’s lifeless body on his property and called 911. He then contacted Goins, who was fleeing with Roberts’ two children, and convinced to return. By the time police officers responded to the crime scene, the 37-year-old suspect made her way back to the La Fayette home. Gruesome sight: When the owner of the house returned home, he found Roberts' lifeless body . When interviewed by police, Goins reportedly said she was at Richards’ house when she heard a noise. She ran to the bedroom, grabbed a gun and shot at a ‘darkened shadow’ in the hallway, according to Northwest Georgia News. Catherine Goins was arrested Tuesday in Tennessee on charges of malice murder; felony murder; tampering with evidence, and possessions of a firearm during the commission of a crime.

"Accused: Cara Labus, 30, stayed in contact with two students at Jerling Junior High School in Orland Park after they graduated and  allegedly engaged in sexual acts with them when they were between 14 and 16 . A junior high teacher and basketball coach in suburban Illinois was arrested Wednesday on charges of sexual abuse against two girls who were former students. Cara Labus, 30, met the two alleged victims, who were between 14 and 16 at the time of the reported abuse, when working at Jerling Junior High School in Orland Park, prosecutors said. The Chicago Sun-Times reports that Labus stayed in contact with the two students after they graduated, and that between December 2008 and February 2011 she allegedly engaged in  sexual acts with the two. According WLS, one of the students spoke to a friend about the reported abuse last summer, leading to the two alleged victims meeting in person and a police report being filed in December. District administrators in Orland Park reported that Labus left the school in 2010 before taking her current position at Hufford Junior High School in Joliet. She was charged with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse on Friday and held on $150,000 bond, authorities said. Labus was also placed on electronic monitoring at her home and told she may not have contact with either the victims or anyone under 18 unless supervised. Administrators at Hufford say that due to those restrictions, Labus will not be allowed to return to her position at the school indefinitely.","Cara Labus, 30, met the two alleged victims at Jerling Junior High School .

"'Disappointed': Dee Dee Knudson, pictured,  used the n-word in a video of her own shortly after being bullied with it . A father who emotionally documented racial abuse and slurs targeted at his adopted daughter was shocked to find the teenage girl using the same words herself. Bradley Knudson, of Lake Prior, Minnesota, recorded messages sent to his African American daughter which called her a 'n*****' and a 'sl**' and posted them to Youtube. Knudson, whose white family adopted Dee Dee, 14, when she was three years old, also shared a message from the bullies' family referring to him as a 'n*****-lover', after attempting to speak to them failed. But despite winning an apology off the back of the video, which has now been seen more than 2.5million times, Knudson found that his daughter had taken to using the offensive term herself. In a video recorded on her cellphone - and in front of a news crew from local station WCCO - Dee Dee excitedly said 'Let's go n*****. Let's go!' to her audience. According WCCO, on finding out Knudson said: 'I am very, very disappointed that my daughter at first did not learn from this experience.' In an online comment on the issue, he added: 'Regardless of your skin color I and my wife do not tolerate this word our daughter is going to be reprimanded in an appropriate manner. 'I am extremely saddened and disappointed because of this video she has discredited the message that we wanted to convey.' Dee Dee later apologized, saying: 'I was excited and not paying attention to what I was saying but I did use it in a different meaning.' 'Disappointed': Knudson said he will punish his daughter for using the term in a SnapChat video of her own, which she is seen composing above . Family: Dee Dee was adopted by the Knudson family when she was three years old. Until the latest incident, the family had never encountered any hostile reactions beyond the occasional stare . Deron Puro, whose children sent the first wave of offensive messages from their cellphones, has since been fired from his job, and issued a full apology. He had originally told Knudson that he saw no problem with his children using racial slurs as it was commonplace in their home and he did it himself. According to Knudson, Dee Dee receiving a barrage of offensive messages via SnapChat, an app which sends brief messages and pictures which automatically delete themselves. After three similar messages which repeatedly used the n-word, Knudson was able to record a fourth, and used it to confront the Puro family, who were recalcitrant at first. But after their about-face, the Puro family issued a statement acknowledging it was wrong - and saying that recovering addict Deron was intoxicated at the time. In shock: He showed the video of the twin boys calling his daughter a 'sl**' and a 'n*****' on Snapchat . Fired: Deron Puro, pictured with his sons, said he stood by his racist comments and did not care if Mr Knudson shared his messages online. Since Mr Knudson shared his name in the video, he has been fired from his job . It said: 'The Puro family is not racist, nor do we use the n-word lightly in our household. What happened was very unfortunate for both families, and we hope each family can heal and move on from this. '...Deron has recently become aware of his actions and is sincerely sorry for how he acted. He understands that what he did was uncalled for and is unforgivable.' The school district is also investigating the incident, and may punish the Puro children itself.","Bradley Knudson, of Prior Lake, Minnesota, documented bullying .

"A white supremacist cop killer with a tattooed-covered face has lost his right to an attorney because he has repeatedly threatened them and called them 'clowns', according to court documents. Curtis Allgier also told his legal representatives preparing his appeal that they did not have the honor of being in his 'Aryan GOD presence' and claimed that he 'knows to find people outside of prison'. The 35-year-old was an inmate at Utah State Prison when he murdered prison guard Stephen Anderson after escaping from shackles during a doctors appointment in 2007. The 60-year-old corrections officer was escorting the prisoner into an MRI at a a University of Utah medical clinic when Allgier got hold of his gun and shot him. He then fled on foot and stole a vehicle before leading police on a highway chase at speeds exceeding 100 mph, but he was caught in a fast food store 45 minutes later. Cop killer: Curtis Allgier (pictured in court in 2012) has been denied the right to an attorney during an appeal against a deal he signed with prosecutors because he continually threatened them and called them 'clowns' Allgier is now appealing a plea deal he accepted which spared him the death penalty, but his behavior means he will be on his own for the duration of the case. In complaints obtained by Fox 13, Allgier referred to his lawyers as the 'dumbest a** clowns I've ever had the EXTREME dishonorable displeasure of being forced to know' and threatened them by saying he 'knew people' on the outside. The killer added he was 'incompetently and ineffectively misrepresented' and that they would never have 'the honor of being in my Aryan GOD presence or having any kind of contact with me period'. The Utah Supreme Court admitted that forfeiting a  right to an attorney is 'an extreme measure.' However they justified the decision by saying: 'We conclude that making threats to the welfare of appointed counsel may constitute extreme conduct justifying a forfeiture of counsel.' Deadly: He was an inmate at a Utah prison (left)  when he murdered prison guard Stephen Anderson (right) after escaping from shackles during a doctors appointment in 2007 . Allgier will have to represent himself for the remainder of his appeal. He pleaded no contest in October 2012 to aggravated murder, pleading guilty to additional charges of disarming a peace officer, aggravated escape, aggravated robbery and possession of a firearm by a restricted person. Adding to the layers of Allgier's personal profile, the supposed racist was due to marry Erica Herrera, a half-Hispanic woman, in August though it is unclear whether or not that happened. 'He's a very sweet, loving... He's a really kind-hearted, good person,' she said. Third District Judge Paul Maughan opened the sentencing hearing to family members of Anderson, a 22-year employee of the Utah Department of Corrections. The 60-year-old victim was survived by a wife, five adult children and 18 grandchildren.

One woman was airlifted to hospital and 28 others taken by ambulance after a crash on the M4 near Cardiff . The first accident happened after the coach collided with a 4x4 and other cars on the eastbound carriageway . Emergency services arrived at the scene at around midday and the road remained shut for around four hours . The accident happened after the coach collided with a 4x4, which subsequently hit other cars on the eastbound carriageway. A South Wales police spokesman said the coach is understood to have contained passengers from the Bridgend area travelling to Cardiff to see a show. A spokesman for Cresta Coaches confirmed the coach was carrying pensioners, but declined to comment further. Minutes later, on the westbound side, another vehicle, which was towing another car, overturned. First on the scene was fireman Lee Morley, who happened to be driving westbound when he saw the crash happen. The 27-year-old, from Swansea, immediately pulled into the hard shoulder and found a woman in a car who was breathing, but unconscious.

One person caught up in the disruption said a 45-minute journey ended up taking twice as long due to delays . The scene after a pile up which is said to have involved 10 vehicles on the M4 motorway in South Wales . 'I got her to come round by talking to her and doing what I'm trained to do,' he told the BBC. 'The minibus went into the back of a car, the car then went into the back of a Range Rover and that then went into another car, which spun out and scrunched.' He added that he spotted children standing on the side of the road who had been in the cars caught up in the accident. 'The minibus was full of pensioners and I think they were on their way to see the musical Top Hat in Cardiff,' he said. Those caught in the disruption said traffic was gridlocked for several miles on both sides of the accident. Cory Richards told MailOnline: 'There were countless ambulances at the crash scene with an air ambulance present, one or two fire engines. 'A bus had crashed into a Land Rover which had then itself crashed into the car in front. 'There were several people sitting on the outer reservations while the services did their work. 'Traffic was three to four miles of gridlock either side of the accident and a journey that would take 45 minutes to an hour took us an hour and a half.' A South Wales Fire and Rescue spokesman said: 'We took the call at 11.55am. It was road traffic collision involving a minibus, a 4x4 and three cars.

"A campaign to buy prosthetic limbs for a super-fit mother-of-two who lost both legs after getting pneumonia at Christmas has topped £85,000 in just five days. The tragic story of Tracy Ralph has inspired more than 2,000 donations from members of the public, while also capturing the hearts of celebrities including Alan Carr, Robbie Savage and Deborah Meaden. Mrs Ralph, who turned 35 on Wednesday, fell desperately ill on Christmas Eve and had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after being hit by pneumonia. Tracey Ralph had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after suffering multiple organ failure and developing septicaemia after coming down with pneumonia shortly before Christmas . The mother, of Hawkwell, Essex, is a keen runner who was training for a half marathon when she reported feeling short of breath of December 24. She was found to be suffering from pneumonia and her condition rapidly deteriorated over the following days. After being put into a medically-induced coma on Christmas Day, she has since battled multiple organ failure, meningitis, septicaemia, blood clots and bleeding on the brain. Tragically Mrs Ralph, who has two sons aged four and 19-months, had to have her fingers and legs amputated below the knee. She came out of her coma on New Year's Eve, but is still in intensive care in St Thomas's hospital, London. Desperate to give her the best chance of leading a normal life again, her sister-in-law Amanda Ralph set up a fundraising campaign to help with her rehabilitation and buy the best prosthetic limbs possible. The mother-of-two's family, including husband Brad and sons Miller and Hudson, didn't realise just how ill she was before she was suddenly rushed to hospital on Christmas Eve . And in just five days, Amanda's £100,000 goal is in reach, after donations topped £85,000 today. Speaking to The Mirror, she said: 'Tracy's husband Brad is overwhelmed by all the acts of kindness and generosity. He is still trying to come to terms with Tracy's situation.' Pneumonia is a swelling of the lung tissue, usually caused by an infection. Early symptoms include a phlegmy cough, fever or difficulty breathing. Mild cases can be treated with antibiotics but more serious cases, which can be exacerbated by underlying health problems, can lead to more serious complications. If left untreated, oxygen levels in the heart and brain can fall, leading to confusion, coma and organ failure, which can  be fatal. Pneumonia can also lead to septicaemia, which can in turn mean amputations are needed. 'We decided to start fundraising because we want to give Tracy what she needs. 'The house will need to be renovated, she'll need prosthetics, an adapted car, a wheelchair, support from carers - we have no idea how much that's going to cost.' Speaking earlier in the week, Amanda said: 'The first we knew anything was seriously wrong was when she couldn't breathe and she had to be rushed to Southend Hospital in an ambulance on Christmas Eve. 'We have been living through it, it has almost been an out of body experience, there has been no good news at all. 'We were close to losing her before she got transferred to London, the doctors said she might not make it at one point.' Tracy's husband Brad, 37, has been at her side throughout the ordeal, but he has kept their children, four-year-old Miller and 19-month-old Hudson, away until their mother is up to seeing them. Her family have now set up a fundraising campaign to pay for her rehabilitation when she is out of hospital . Speaking about the fundraising campaign, her sister-in-law added: 'It's really humbling, we were up to nearly £18,000 in less than 24 hours. 'It just proves that Tracy is such a beautiful, lovely and caring person that so many people want to help her out. 'We have had people who didn't even know Tracy contributing and those saying they can't afford much but giving what they can. 'We know that when she comes out of hospital she is going to need a lot of help. Touched by her story: Ex-footballer Robbie Savage and TV presenter Alan Carr (R) have both donated money to help Tracy Ralph afford the best prosthetic limbs possible . 'Every penny will help Tracy and we are so grateful to everyone who has donated, we are raising the money for her rehab and ultimately the best prosthetic feet we can buy.' Mrs Ralph, who works for Clarins at Debenhams in Southend, had been training to run the Southend Half Marathon later this year and had been training with the Essex Ladies Running Club before becoming ill. A fellow member has now taken her spot and will donate everything she raises to Tracy's cause. To donate to visit youcaring.com .","Keen runner, of Essex, became short of breath on Christmas Eve .

"Hall of Fame slugger Ernie Banks, the two-time MVP who never lost his boundless enthusiasm for baseball despite years of playing on losing Chicago Cubs teams, died Friday night. He was 83. The Cubs announced Banks' death, but did not provide a cause. 'Mr. Cub' hit 512 home runs during his 19-year career, including five seasons with 40 or more. He was fond of saying, 'It's a great day for baseball. Let's play two!' That remains a catchphrase at Wrigley Field to this day. Stalwart: Ernie Banks, 83, pictured above in March last year, died late Friday, the Chicago Cubs confirmed . Hall of famer: Banks, pictured above on the pitch in 1955, hit 512 home runs in his long careers . Caught: Shown above in 1967, Banks poses in uniform having just caught a baseball . 'Approachable, ever optimistic and kind hearted, Ernie Banks is and always will be Mr. Cub. My family and I grieve the loss of such a great and good-hearted man, but we look forward to celebrating Ernie's life in the days ahead.' Though he was an 11-time All-Star from 1953-71, Banks never reached the postseason, and the Cubs finished below .500 in all but six of his seasons. Still, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1977, the first year he was eligible, and selected to baseball's All-Century team in 1999. Banks' infectious smile and non-stop good humor despite his team's dismal record endeared him to Chicago fans, who voted him the best player in franchise history. One famous admirer, Saturday Night Live star Bill Murray, named his son Homer Banks Murray. Optimism: Despite often being on the losing side, the loyal Cubs player never lost his enthusiasm. He is pictured above in 1970 . At home: Banks is pictured above looking to the outfield fences at Wrigley Field, the Cubs' home ground . Banks' No. 14 was the first number retired by the Cubs, and hangs from the left-field foul pole at Wrigley Field. 'I'd like to get to the last game of the World Series at Wrigley Field and hit three homers,' he once said. 'That was what I always wanted to do.' Banks was playing for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues when the Cubs discovered him in 1953, and purchased his contract for $10,000. He made his major league debut at shortstop on Sept. 17 that year, and three days later hit his first home run. Tall and thin, Banks didn't look like a typical power hitter. He looked even less so as he stood at the plate, holding his bat high and wiggling it as he waited for pitches. But he had strong wrists and a smooth, quick stroke, and he made hitting balls out of the park look effortless. Batter up: Banks wore number 14 on his shirt, which was retired after he stopped playing . Tribute: Wrigley Field displayed this message in honor of Cubs on Friday night . When he switched to a lighter bat before the 1955 season, his power quickly became apparent. He hit 44 homers that season, including three against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Aug. 4. His five grand slams that year established a major league record that stood for more than 30 years before Don Mattingly hit six in 1987. Banks' best season came in 1958, when he hit .313 with 47 homers and 129 RBIs. Though the Cubs went 72-82 and finished sixth in the National League, Banks edged Willie Mays and Hank Aaron for his first MVP award. He was the first player from a losing team to win the NL MVP. Banks won the MVP again in 1959, becoming the first NL player to win it in consecutive years, even though the Cubs had another dismal year. Banks hit .304 with 45 homers and a league-leading 143 RBIs. He led the NL in homers again in 1960 with 41, his fourth straight season with 40 or more. His 248 homers from 1955-60 were the most in the majors, topping even Aaron and Mays. Though Banks didn't break the 40-homer barrier again after 1960, he topped the 100-RBI mark three more times, including 1969, his last full season. Then 38, he hit .253 with 23 home runs and 106 RBIs, and was chosen an All-Star for an 11th time. Winner: Above, banks poses in November 1959 with an MVP award from the National League . Still watching: Banks, right, is pictured above with fellow Hall of Famer Billy Williams at a game in January 2014 . On May 12, 1970, he hit his 500th home run, becoming only the eighth player at the time to reach the plateau. Banks retired after the 1971 season. He owned most of the Cubs' career slugging records, some of which still stand today. Known mostly for his power at the plate, Banks was a solid fielder, too. He is best known as a shortstop, where he won a Gold Glove in 1960, but he switched to first base in 1962. He played 1,259 games at first and 1,125 games at shortstop. Born and raised in Dallas, Banks would be bribed to play catch by his father, who always wanted him to be a baseball player. Banks grew to love the game and was a standout in high school, along with participating in football, basketball and track and field. He joined a barnstorming Negro Leagues team at 17 and was spotted by Cool Papa Bell, who signed him to the Monarchs in 1950. Banks played one season before going into the Army. He returned to Kansas City after he was discharged, playing one more season before joining the Cubs.","Banks's death was announced by the Chicago Cubs Friday night .

"These incredible pictures, taken by pioneering documentary photographer Robert Frank, show a forgotten world of what London was like in the 1950s. From bankers in top hats and long coats juxtaposed with men delivering coal to children playing in the streets, the Swiss-born photographer's collection of black and white images give a unique glimpse of everyday life in the city for the rich and poor.

With the rise of adventure films being released, such as Wild and Tracks, travellers' adventurous sides have come out and walking and hiking tour bookings have increased by 35 per cent in the past year. With this is mind, Experience Oz has released their ultimate list of hiking spotlights for 2015 for veteran walkers and beginners alike, with Tasmania, WA, SA, NSW and Victoria all making the cut. 1: Widely considered one of the world's best bushwalks, Tasmania's Overland Track comes in at number one on the list. The stunning location features an environment reminiscent of Switzerland and New Zealand and is roughly 65km long . The list, which is based purely on bookings received over the past 12 months, wasn't a big surprise for the  team, as Australia's most popular spots continue to claim their top positions. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Experience Oz Digital Marketing Manager Matt Hobbs said a growing number of Australians are taking up hiking or walking to experience the 'diversity' of the country. 'One of the things we always hear about - especially from people who've been on multiple of hikes - is that they just appreciate the diversity,' Mr Hobbs said. 'I guess it's one of the benefits of Australia being such a massive country that if you go on a track from one region to the other you come across a completely different landscape.' Mr Hobbs said the vast landscape of Australia means that enthusiasts can go on a desert walk one week and be trekking through snow a couple of months later. 2:Recommended by Matt Hobbs, NSW phenomenon the Blue Mountains take its place at number two on the list. Its close proximity to Sydney makes it a convenient pit stop for hikers looking for a bit of nature near the big cityThe Blue Mountains feature massive waterfalls, rugged peaks and endless opportunities for exploration both on peak and in canyon . Tasmania features twice on the list with the Overland Track and The Bay of Fires Lodge Walk coming in first and third place respectively. Mr Hobbs puts this down to the 'alpine or European environment' of the state's walking tracks. 'Tasmania has always been one of the most popular areas for walking and hiking,' he said. 'I think Tasmania is popular just because the scenery is different to mainland Australia and it allows Aussies to experience that alpine or European environment without leaving the country, so that's always been a strong state.' Mr Hobbs said he would advise hikers to do as much research as possible before they embark on a walking holiday, as this type of holiday can be quit draining. 'There are companies that cater for beginners, but if you are a beginner maybe opt for a package that is taken by a guided tour operator just because they know the lay of the land. They can pace the day's journey out evenly so you're not overextending yourself to get from one camp-site to the next,' he said. 3:Tasmania makes its second appearance on the list as the Bay of Fires Lodge walk comes in at number three. Named after its characteristic lodge - the only building on the 20km walk - the Bay of Fires Lodge walk is a four day hiking journey.It's Ideal for those wanting a scenic getaway yet still looking to retain a hint of luxury with modern accommodation.

For those travellers who prefer life's simple luxuries, you needn't worry as tour companies are also offering an eco-luxury hiking holiday where you will be provided with a lot of benefits along the way so you're not completely ruffing it. Widely considered one of the world's best bushwalks, Tasmania's Overland Track comes in at number one on the list.  The stunning location features an environment reminiscent of  Switzerland and New Zealand and is roughly 65km long. The six day journey provides walkers with all the best hallmarks of alpine scenery – mountain streams, waterfalls and meadows making for a breathtaking spectacle.

The mountain area – part of the Great Dividing Range which was given World Heritage status back in 2000 - is a true 'region' in itself for walkers and hikers. The Blue Mountains boast over 140 kilometres worth of trails and tracks of varying degrees of difficulty, rather than one single walk.

The scenic walk is Australia's longest coastal walk running alongside the Indian Ocean from Cape Naturaliste in the north to Cape Leeuwin in the south.Unique rock formations, cliffs, limestone caves and the Karri forest make for a diverse journey for hiking enthusiasts . The Great Ocean Road  offers up a plethora of coastal scenery leading to the iconic 12 Apostles rock formations. The rocky cliff faces and open stretches of beaches are one of the country's essential walks for hiking enthusiasts that's suitable for walkers of any ability level. Spread out over the course of just 100km, the track combines some of Australia's tallest coastal cliffs with the remnants of various shipwrecks and cliff top walks. and more. Different treks meander away from the coastline in several sections including into Otway National Park. WA's breathtaking Cape to Cape trek makes in onto the list at number five. The scenic walk is Australia's longest coastal walk running alongside the Indian Ocean from Cape Naturaliste in the north to Cape Leeuwin in the south. Unique rock formations,  cliffs, limestone caves and the Karri forest make for a diverse journey for hiking enthusiasts. While there are plenty of smaller and easier segments of the Cape to Cape track that can be done separately, the full-length adventure involves roughly 20 – 25 kilometres worth of walking per day. This including a reasonable degree of soft-sand walking and a high level of accessibility. Flinders Ranges in South Australia rounds of the list, coming in sixth place. The rugged walk is a four day overall trek and is broken up into separate walks of around seven hours per day covering anywhere between 6 to 15 kilometres in one section. 6: Flinders Ranges in South Australia rounds of the list, coming in sixth place.

"Tottenham are showing an interest in Feyenoord winger Jean-Paul Boetius. Spurs are having major difficulty in shifting some of their deadwood out of the club this month, a struggle that is restricting Mauricio Pochettino's attempts to sign new players.

The La Liga club have shown an interest in the Gunners' versatile defender, but were told he will not be leaving the Emirates Stadium. Monreal has been an important figure for Arsene Wenger's side this season, playing regularly at central defence and left-back for the injury hit Gunners. Bilbao may return for Monreal in the summer when they'll have a better chance of nabbing the Spaniard. Atletico Bilbao enquired to Arsenal about Nacho Monreal, but the Gunners will resist any offers . Swansea have joined the race to land Rubin Kazan midfielder Yann M’Vila. Queens Park Rangers are also tracking the Frenchman, but will struggle to get a loan deal over the line due to their lack of finances.

"Bakary Sako is wanted by Tony Pulis as the West Bromwich Albion head coach considers a bold move for the Wolverhampton Wanderers winger. Pulis is determined to add pace and width to his team and the 26-year-old fits the bill having scored seven goals in 27 games for West Brom’s arch rivals this season. Sako only has six months left on his contract and Kenny Jackett has spoken about potentially doing a deal if a large enough bid comes in from a Premier League club. Bakary Sako (right), pictured playing for Mali at the Africa Cup of Nations, is a target for West Brom . The Wolves winger only has six months left on his contract at Molineux . Wolves want ideally to keep hold of one of their best performers and would rather let him leave in the summer for free – aiding their Championship promotion campaign in the process – than sell him now for less than their valuation. West Brom have tabled two bids for Callum McManaman, the latest being around the £4million mark, and the Wigan winger remains a primary target. But Pulis revealed the club has ‘irons in the fire’ and Sako matches this description. Sako is currently away with Mali at the Africa Cup of Nations, playing in the 1-1 draw with Cameroon, and has a final group match this coming Wednesday. Wolves paid £2.5million for Sako in August 2012 and rejected a bid of £4m from Nottingham Forest in August 2013. West Brom were also interested that summer. The Baggies have tabled a £4m bid for Wigan forward Callum McManaman (right) The path to cross the Black Country divide is clearly fraught – the animosity between the two clubs is fierce – but Pulis is desperate for reinforcements this window to strengthen his fight against relegation. West Brom are also interested in Matt Phillips at Queens Park Rangers, and had a £2m bid for Nottingham Forest’s Michail Antonio turned down this week. Pulis said on Thursday: 'I'll be hoping to bring players in and the club is hoping we can bring players in so we will be working very hard over the next 10 days. 'The chairman will ask me if it’s value for money or not but I don’t get involved in the wages. We’ve an interest in McManaman along with one or two others. Tony Pulis claims he has got 'other irons in the fire' if his bid for McManaman cannot be completed . 'If it’s not McManaman we’ve got other irons in the fire. Like a lot of things, you’d love things to drop into place straight away, but it’s often not that way.' Jackett said on Thursday: 'We've had some transparency with Sako. We’ve said, ""look, if a Premier League club comes in for you, we’ll speak to you"". And because of that, we’ve got the best out of him. 'We haven’t had a bid and we don’t want one but if a Premier League club makes the right offer, we’d speak to the player. We wouldn’t accept a bid lower than our valuation. 'We paid £2.5m for him, but there’s no desperation to sell him. (Owner) Steve Morgan and (chief executive) Jez Moxey would love him to see the season out and then talk in the summer.

"Created: . 20:54 EST, 7 March 2014 . Clare Wood, 36, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2009. A new law giving people the right to know if a partner has a history of violence will be rolled out from today . A scheme giving people the 'right to know' if a partner has a history of domestic violence will be rolled out to police forces across England and Wales from today. Clare's Law was created following a campaign by Michael Brown, whose daughter was murdered by her ex-boyfriend. The initiative, officially called the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, is designed to provide people with information that may protect them from a potentially abusive situation. Following a request, the scheme allows the police to disclose information about a partner's previous history of domestic violence or violent acts. Clare Wood, 36, was strangled and set on fire by her ex-boyfriend George Appleton at her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009. The mother-of-one had met Appleton on Facebook, unaware of his horrific history of violence against women, including repeated harassment, threats and the kidnapping at knifepoint of one of his ex-girlfriends. Today's national roll-out has been chosen by Home Secretary Theresa May to coincide with International Women's Day and follows a 14-month pilot scheme in four police force areas, which provided more than 100 people with potentially life-saving information. Today also marks the national launch of Domestic Violence Protection Orders (DVPOs). This new power will enable police and magistrates' courts to provide protection to people in the immediate aftermath of a domestic violence incident. Mrs May said: 'Domestic abuse shatters lives and this government is working hard to provide police and local authorities with the tools they need to keep women and girls safe. 'Clare's Law and DVPOs are just two of a raft of measures we have introduced to hand control back to the victim by ensuring they can make informed decisions about their relationship and escape if necessary. 'Protection for victims is improving but sadly there are still too many cases where vulnerable people are let down. 'I am determined to see a society where violence against women and girls is not tolerated, where people speak out, and where no woman or girl has to suffer domestic abuse.' DVPOs can be used to provide immediate protection to a victim where there is not enough evidence to charge an alleged perpetrator and provide protection to victims via bail conditions. They can last for up to 28 days, during which time the perpetrator can be prevented from having contact with the victim, giving them the opportunity to make decisions about their future safety with the help of a support agency. Crime prevention minister Norman Baker said: 'Domestic violence is illegal and this coalition government has made significant progress in tackling abuse in all its forms. Clare's Law was created following a campaign by Clare's father Michael Brown (second left). The initiative, officially called the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, is designed to provide people with information that may protect them from abuse . 'Last year we extended the definition of domestic violence to include controlling and coercive behaviour and in December re-launched the This Is Abuse campaign to highlight to young people that it's not just physical violence that makes a relationship abusive. 'We have also ring-fenced nearly £40 million of funding for specialist local support services and national helplines to help people escape abusive situations.' The implementation of Clare's Law and DVPOs form an integral part of the Government's Call To End Violence Against Women And Girls' Action Plan 2014. The plan includes a commitment to put in place a new code of practice to ensure that safe addresses of victims of domestic and sexual abuse are protected. This will take effect where victims might otherwise have to reveal details of their address to people who could threaten them - for example in court cases unrelated to their abuse, or when required for their children's school records, or the family's access to benefits. Clare's Law was trialled in Greater Manchester, Gwent, Wiltshire and Nottingham from September 2012. Clare's Law was created after 36-year-old Clare Wood was murdered by a man who became known as the 'Facebook fugitive'. In the days after her brutal killing, detectives issued a warning that her ex-boyfriend George Appleton might attempt to communicate with other women via the internet. Unbeknown to Miss Wood, Appleton had a history of violence towards women and was known to prowl online dating websites and Facebook in search of partners, often using different aliases. The mother-of-one's body was discovered in the bedroom of her home in Salford, Greater Manchester, in February 2009. She had been strangled and set on fire. Police watchdogs concluded afterwards that she had been badly let down by 'individual and systemic' failures by Greater Manchester Police (GMP). In the months before her murder she had repeatedly contacted GMP alleging Appleton had caused criminal damage, harassed her, threatened to kill her and tried to rape her. Appleton, from Salford, was found six days later after her death, hanged in a derelict pub. Clare's father, Michael Wood, who has backed the campaign, later said he had taken an 'instant' dislike to Appleton. Miss Wood had told her father Appleton had a criminal record - though only for motoring offences.In fact he had been jailed for three years in 2002 for harassing another woman and for six months a year earlier after breaching a restraining order on another ex-girlfriend. At the inquest into Miss Wood's death in May 2011, Coroner Jennifer Leeming said women in abusive relationships should have the right to know about the violent past of the men they were with, just as Sarah's Law recommends parents have the right to know of any child sex convictions of men with access to their children. Ms Leeming recorded a verdict of unlawful killing by strangulation as the cause of Miss Wood's death before making a number of recommendations to be passed on to police and the Government. The family's campaign was also taken up by Salford and Eccles MP Hazel Blears and backed by police and Home Secretary Theresa May, who agreed to run the pilot. Mr Brown, a former prison officer from Batley, West Yorkshire, said at the start of it: 'My daughter wasn't stupid. Had she known about George Appleton's past she would have taken herself and my granddaughter out of there in a heartbeat.' Following an article on March 8 about ‘Clare’s Law’,which allows police to disclose information about a partner’s previous convictions for domestic abuse, we are happy to clarify that the scheme applies to men as well as women.","Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme will help people with abusive partners .

"Beneath the Regency splendour of Sussex Square in Brighton is a little-known tunnel that connects the square’s private gardens to the seafront. When writer Lewis Carroll used to visit Brighton, the ivy-strewn tunnel fascinated him and, according to some, was the inspiration for the hole through which Alice fell in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland, so starting her escapades with the Mad Hatter, Queen of Hearts and the Cheshire Cat. Now, 150 years since the publication of the children’s classic, which will be marked with a number of special events, literary fans have the rare chance to buy a complete Regency townhouse just above the tunnel. Regency splendour: The Alice in Wonderland townhouse in the exclusive Lewes Crescent in Brighton . The house, which inspired author Lewis Carroll, comes with a west-facing balcony and a 65ft Italianate rear garden . The Grade I listed five-storey property in exclusive Lewes Crescent carries a £4.25million price tag, making it one of the most expensive homes ever to have come to market in the seaside city. Lewes Crescent sits at the bottom of Sussex Square on the seafront in the Kemp Town area. The house itself was designed by Charles Busby and Amon Henry Wilds in the 1820s and built by Thomas Cubitt. According to Brighton Heritage Department, it is one of only a few Regency properties that has not been converted into flats, and it comes with access to the private gardens and incredible unobstructed sea views. Musician Nick Cave and his model wife Susie Bick live nearby in Sussex Square, and when fellow Australian Cate Blanchett bought a house there in the Noughties, the road had to be closed while an enormous new bath was winched into her home. Price: £4.25million . Location: Kemp Town, Brighton . Bedrooms: Six . Unique features: One of the city's few Regency houses, cinema room, iPad-operated lighting . Barry Grogan, 59, who owns the Lewes Crescent property, says it was in a dilapidated state when he bought it with two business partners last January. The property developer adds: ‘We befriended the former owner when we worked on a nearby property in 2010. He was an art dealer who had lived here for about 40 years. A large, vaulted room with roof lights at the top of the building was probably a former studio, but latterly he just lived on the lower ground floor. He loved the place and had no intention of moving, but he sadly passed away in January 2013.’ Barry has since brought the 4,600ft six-bedroom house up to date, adding a cinema room, steam room and state-of-the-art Helvar lighting system that is operated via an iPad. He even managed to gain permission to add a double-height glass conservatory. Revamp: The Grade I listed home's modern kitchen maintains its intricate coving . The ivy-strewn tunnel outside the home is said to have provided Carroll with the inspiration for the hole Alice falls through at the start of the book . There are grand Doric pillars at the entrance, four reception rooms, three bathrooms, a fantastic sweeping staircase, a west-facing balcony and a 65ft Italianate rear garden. There are parquet floors throughout the ground floor, high ceilings, intricate coving and original fireplaces. The lower ground floor has underfloor heating and a huge family room, while the highlight of the first floor is the ‘grand lounge and library’, which has three floor-to-ceiling French windows opening on to the large balcony. New skylights on the top floor flood the bedrooms with light and there are views from the back to the Sussex Downs. Explaining the high asking price, Barry says: ‘It is like a new build dressed up in Regency clothing. None of the other complete Regency properties has had such a thorough redevelopment.’ Apart from the Alice connection, the property is rich in history, having been the original home of Roedean girls’ school. So who does Barry think the house will suit in the future? ‘We’d love it to be a family house so that all of its many delights are fully used. However, it would just as easily suit being a weekend or holiday home. ‘It would be good if the buyer was from Brighton, but they will more likely come from London or overseas.’ Or maybe the new owner will be a big fan of Alice who fancies a new adventure down by the sea… . brandvaughan.co.uk, 01273 683111 .","Mansion which inspired author Lewis Carroll is up for sale for £4.25million .

"Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson insisted it was vital the Merseyside club do not become another shock FA Cup fourth-round victim. Having seen the Premier League's top three of Chelsea, Manchester City and Southampton plus sixth-placed Tottenham all lose at home to lower-placed opposition, the Reds were then held to a goalless draw at Anfield by Sky Bet Championship side Bolton on Saturday evening. While Henderson said knowledge of those upsets had not affected the way they approached the match, they were still grateful to be in Monday's draw for the next round. Jordan Henderson (left) talks tactics with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers on Saturday evening . ""It was obviously a big shock for City, Chelsea and Tottenham to go out but the main thing is we are still in the competition,"" said the England midfielder, leading the side in the absence of Steven Gerrard who was rested with the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Chelsea coming up on Tuesday. ""To be honest we were pretty focused on what we were doing but the results came on the tannoy and one or two players might have heard but at the same time we just focused on what we needed to do. ""We've seen it for many years, lower league teams have beaten Premier League teams and Saturday was no different but we have shown good character to not lose the game and that is the main thing. Former Liverpool ace Emile Heskey is congratulated as he is replaced during the FA Cup game . ""We are a bit disappointed we didn't win but we are still in the draw and are looking forward to the game on Tuesday."" While Liverpool created a number of chances they were not clinical enough and also found goalkeeper Adam Bogdan in top form. The 27-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and - having lost his place as first choice early in the campaign because of injury - Wanderers may struggle to keep hold of him. However, manager Neil Lennon is hopeful a deal can be done and will have a meeting with Bogdan's representatives in the next week in an attempt to get him to sign a new contract. ""It was a fantastic performance from our goalkeeper, which is what you need when you come away from home,"" said the former Celtic boss. Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan sends a refreshed Raheem Sterling sprawling during the 0-0 draw . ""We know Adam's quality and I like his temperament. He had a great presence and he will have done his reputation no harm at all. ""We are very lucky in that we have two exceptional goalkeepers: Adam had a broken finger when I came through the door (in October) and Andy Lonergan has played sensationally. ""We want to keep him (Bogdan) - his contract is up in the summer - and we will sit down with his agent this week hopefully and try to resolve it. Sterling tussles with Bolton's Neil Danns at Anfield as Coutinho looks on . ""You are always worried when players are coming to the of their contracts and they are talented; Lee Chung-Yong is the same. ""I can ill-afford to let the quality of players we have go but that is the situation I find myself in."" Lennon's focus remains trying to get his side into play-off contention, having dragged them off the bottom of the table, but while he does not want to lose sight of their primary objective - staying up - he admits he is enjoying their cup exploits. ""We are not out of the woods yet in terms of the bottom three in the Championship so we have a bit of work to do on that but this mini cup run is a fantastic distraction,"" he added.
