"Nemanja Matic is not the only player prone to violent reaction after being hit by a bad tackle, as this video of QPR midfielder Sandro proves. The Brazilian midfielder has not featured for relegation-threatened Rangers since suffering a knee injury on November 19, and has been easing his way back towards full fitness. But Sandro's return from injury took a dramatic twist when he was sent off for violent conduct while playing for QPR's Under 21 side on Monday. With clear echoes of Matic's sending off for Chelsea against Burnley on Saturday, Sandro earned himself a red card for retaliating to a bad tackle on him towards the end of the game against Bristol City. VIDEO Scroll down for Sandro sent off for push in QPR reserve match vs Bristol City . Sandro cuts inside with the ball from the right during QPR's Under 21 match against Bristol City on Monday . But his progress was abruptly halted by a lunging tackle by City's Jake Andrews . Sandro was sent flying by the reckless challenge by the City youngster . Sandro, here falling after the tackle, was stepping up his return from a knee injury by playing in the game . Matic was the victim of a studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes, and the Serbian midfiedler furiously raced after his assailant, shoving the Burnley striker to the floor. Referee Martin Atkinson failed to show Barnes a red or even a yellow card, while Matic was sent off, much to Jose Mourinho's disgust. Sandro also found himself on the wrong end of a nasty challenge during injury time in QPR's 3-1 victory. Cutting in from the right touchline, the 25-year-old former Tottenham star was felled by a reckless lunge from 17-year-old Jake Andrews. Perhaps with the pain of his recent injury still fresh on his mind, Sandro leapt to his feet and ran back towards the tackler before violently shoving him to the ground. As his opponent tried to get to his feet, Sandro grabbed him by the collar and again furiously shoved the City youngster. Unsurprisingly, he was quickly shown a red card. YouTube/OfficialQPR .

Spurs sold Sandro to QPR at the end of last season following a public falling-out with then boss Tim Sherwood. Hailed as a key signing by Harry Redknapp, he has been limited to just nine appearances due to injury. Redknapp has since left the club due to health reasons with Chris Ramsey taking over the club's fight against the drop until the end of the season. But Sandro will not feature in too many more QPR games unless he learns to control his temper. Matic, who will miss the Capital One Cup final after his own red card, is also finding that out the hard way.

"Manchester City target Fernando is so desperate to join the club he has cut short his holiday in Brazil.

Manuel Pellegrini has been interested in the 26-year-old for some time and sees him as the ideal player to assist Yaya Toure and Fernandinho in central midfield next season, as City try to challenge on four fronts. City’s plans for next season’s Champions League campaign have received a huge boost after it was confirmed the club will only need to name five rather than eight home-grown players in their reduced 21-man squad. Pressure from the players’ union FIFPro has forced UEFA to agree to water down its sanctions imposed against City and Paris St Germain for breaching financial fair play rules.

"Urging John McAfee to turn himself in, the prime minister of Belize called the antivirus pioneer 'bonkers' as he remains on the run while cops investigate the murder of his neighbor. McAfee said yesterday that he is in hiding, unarmed and accompanied only by a young woman, changing locations and telephones frequently to stay one step ahead of a Belize police unit he claims wants to kill him. Prime Minister Dean Barrow said McAfee was only wanted for questioning and should report to authorities. Barrow also expressed doubts about . McAfee's mental state, saying: 'I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I . believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers.' Scroll down for video . On the run: John McAfee, seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor, claims he is being set up by the Belizean government . Tropical: John McAfee, founder of the anti-virus software firm, moved to Belize in 2008 . In the early 2000s John McAfee pioneered the invention of a new sport called aerotrekking out of his New Mexico property . Belize police have said they want to question McAfee, who they describe as a 'person of interest' in the slaying of fellow American Gregory Viant Faull. Faull, 52, was shot to death over the weekend on the Caribbean island where both men lived. From his secret location, McAfee,  67, has been in contact with reporters, including Wired editor Joshua Davis, who has been providing updates on the case through his Twitter feed. The latest update read: '[McAfee] says his hideout has a cathode ray tube TV and he watched an episode of Rawhide. His girlfriend thinks it's boring.' Suspicious: Gregory Faull's home in San Pedro. Belizean police want to question anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee, 67, about the murder of his neighbor and fellow U.S. citizen, Faull, 52 . Pastime: Mr Faull posted several pictures of himself on his boat in Belize. He titled this photo 'new friends' McAfee, who had a run-in with police earlier this year, told The Associated Press by telephone that he didn't kill Faull, though he acknowledged he had differences with the dead man. 'I barely knew him, I barely spoke ten words to him in the last three years,' McAfee said, speaking on a cellphone. 'Certainly he was not my favorite person and I was not his.' 'He was a heavy drinker and an annoyance. But the world is full of annoyances; if we killed all of our annoyances, there would be nobody left,' McAfee said. Other expat residents of the island of Ambergris Caye, where San Pedro is located, have described Faull, the owner of a construction business in Orlando, Florida, as peaceful and well-liked. Lying low: McAfee, is pictured at his former home in Rodeo, New Mexico . Famous friends: Gregory Faull is seen here with basketball legends Michael Jordan, left, and Patrick Ewing, right . The dispute apparently involved several dogs that McAfee kept at his beachside villa and that drew complaints from neighbors. McAfee said that four of his dogs were poisoned late last week, but that he didn't initially suspect Faull of having killed them, though he knew Faull didn't like the dogs. 'He did threaten to shoot them once or twice,' McAfee said of Faull, adding that his neighbor was 'always angry at them.' But he said he now believes government agents or police poisoned the dogs. Death: Gregory Viant Faull who died in November. Authorities in Belize want talk to McAfee about his death . Bad blood: Mr Faull and McAfee reportedly were at odds after a police complaint Mr Faull filed . 'My assumption was it was some kind of government action again. This is more harassment - that was the first thing that went through my mind, and still is going through my mind. What else could it have been?' he said. Faull was found with a gunshot wound to his head inside his two-story home north of San Pedro. The housekeeper discovered the body Sunday morning and called police. Raphael Martinez, spokesman for Belize's Ministry of National Security, said no charges had been filed in the case, but asked that McAfee turn himself in, accompanied by someone else, if he felt safer that way. But McAfee said he feared that Belize's notorious Gang Suppression Unit, the GSU, a paramilitary-style squad that has been accused of rough treatment and that raided another property McAfee owns in Belize in April, would beat him and he would later die in custody. Beach house: The home of anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee in San Pedro November. McAfee, 67, has been identified as a 'person of interest' in the killing of 52-year-old Gregory Viant Faull, whose body was found on Sunday . Pictured are some of the weapons that Belize's Gang Suppression Unit claim they recovered from McAfee's home. He is now wanted for murder . 'The GSU will do what the GSU does, beat me soundly until I confess to a multitude of sins, including I guess the murder of Jimmy Hoffa, and then just execute me,' McAfee said. He accused authorities of detaining his friends and associates in a bid to pressure him to turn himself in. 'Of course, and it's almost working,' McAfee said. 'I'm sitting here, the young woman who is with me now and who has been by my side, and trying to keep me upbeat through this, I said, ""You know, I'll just call and say I'll turn myself in, just let these people go."" And she said, ""Absolutely not, they will kill you.""' 'I keep moving constantly, sir ... and I keep changing telephones constantly, this phone will expire shortly,' he said. McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus program, has led a life of eccentricity since he sold his stake in the anti-virus software company that is named for him in the early 1990s and moved to Belize about three years ago to lower his taxes. Grim task: Police officers carry the body of US citizen Gregory Viant Faull following his murder this weekend . Yesterday, McAfee told Davis that his last-ditch effort to evade authorities was ‘radically alter(ing) my appearance,’ dying his salt-and-pepper hair and beard jet black. 'I'll probably look like a murderer, unfortunately,' he said, according to Davis. McAfee told the Associated Press via . email in May that ‘the government wants me out of the way. Too many . people have died in custody in this country so I intend to do nothing . that puts me in their custody.’ He has been in hiding since a raid on . his house in April where authorities accused him of running a . methamphetamine lab. Because he’s in an undisclosed location away from . his house, he told Wired that he’s afraid police have planted . incriminating evidence, perhaps guns or ‘four tons of cocaine.’ He said he heard Faull had been . shot but that he believed it to have been a case of mistaken identity . and it was in fact him who the shooter had intended to kill. Scene of the crime: This is the house where Faull was murdered in Ambergris Caye, Belize between the night of November 10th and Sunday November 11th . Insisting that the murder was carried . out by the police themselves, he added: 'They got the wrong house. Call . me paranoid [but] They've been trying to get me for months. They want . to silence me. I am not well liked by the Prime Minister.' He had earlier phoned the reporter to say: 'Power was just cut to . the house I’m in. I think this is it,' but hours later, called again to . say that he changed locations and that he was safe for the time being.' Millions: McAfee made millions on his antivirus software of the same name . The revelation came after it emerged McAfee had discussed experimenting with the dangerous drug known as . bath salts in extensive online postings on a drug-friendly Russian message board. 'I’m a huge fan of MDPV. I think it's . the finest drug ever conceived, not just for the indescribable . hypersexuality, but also for the smooth euphoria and mild comedown,' he . wrote. He posted on the online message board . between 2010 and 2011, but leaving and saying that his online . activities were interfering with his experimentation with drugs. Radar Online reports that McAfree bought the drugs online and worked in a makeshift lab in a hut to purify them. 'The . on-line world is more of a distraction than the self induced effects of . the many experiments I've done using my own body over the past year or . so, and I have work to do,' he wrote. John McAfee has been a follower of alternative therapies and philosophies all his life and taught yoga after he sold his business .","Prime Minister Dean Barrow says nobody is trying to kill John McAfee, and he should turn himself in .

"Dave Attwood studied physics and philosophy at university, so when he is throwing his weight around in the colours of Bath, he has a fundamental grasp of the attitude he must adopt. Playing on the edge, but not over it; that is the key. He already knew the theory and over time – via a couple of jolting reminders – he has learned to apply it. The 27-year-old lock is intelligent, a deep thinker and an assured talker. He is armed for a debate, as well as for the gruelling demands of his day-job. Having made a storming start to the new Aviva Premiership season and a strong case for England recognition, Attwood considers the extremities of his role. He may have lost a few pounds, but his brief is to impose himself on the opposition. In the past, he has occasionally over-stepped the mark in that regard and the tag of ‘enforcer’ has duly been applied. Dave Attwood pictured at Bath's picturesque Farleigh House training ground in Somerset . The second row has been one of the form players this season and is pushing for an England position . Attwood will come up against England rival Joe Launchbury at Adams Park on Sunday afternoon . Most occupants of the second row would embrace it, but Attwood is wary. ‘I think the connotations of it are the difficult thing,’ he said, ahead of Sunday’s showdown with Wasps and their leading England lock, Joe Launchbury. ‘The term “enforcer” harks back to an era when rugby was a very different game; when a bit of shoe on someone’s shoulder was completely acceptable. Rugby has changed and I am testament to that. Rugby is a different game to when I started playing and you have to adapt to that. ‘The trouble with the term “enforcer” is that it harks back to an era when that sort of player ran round grabbing people by the face and throwing them around, or laying down the law under the cover of a ruck or scrum. That doesn’t exist anymore and you can’t do that. ‘There’s no real benefit either. People are so professional these days that putting in a bit of a cheap shot on someone doesn’t really make a difference and you risk getting yourself cited and banned. So it’s a difficult term, but I do think there’s a place for it, in terms of being someone who takes a lead when it comes to physicality. That is definitely something I aim to do. ‘You have to impose yourself, without doing it illegally – put in a big tackle, then get up and do another one. When your defensive line is pushing the attack back, pushing the attack back, pushing the attack back; you have to be the guy leading the charge. If anyone was to use the term “enforcer” about me; that is what I would want them to mean.’ Back in June, 2010, when England were on tour in Australia, the uncapped Attwood made a major impression on the-then national manager, Martin Johnson. The former lock-enforcer saw the rookie as an emerging talent in his own image, but since then he hasn’t quite taken the next step to become a fixture in the Test pack. Dave Attwood of Bath holds off Ken Pisi of Northampton in last season's Amlin Challenge Cup final . Dave Attwood makes a charge forwards for England against Samoa at Twickenham in 2010 . Attwood looks on during an England training session held at Bath University in 2011 . To date, he has earned 12 caps but started just twice for his country, on tour in Argentina last year while the Lions were in Australia. His status as a regular replacement appeared to be under threat on the recent trip to New Zealand, as Ed Slater made a positive impact as midweek captain, but the Leicester skipper has been ruled out for the season and Attwood had been outstanding for Bath. When his club smashed the Tigers 45-0 at The Rec last month, he was bloodied and brilliant, in front of watching England forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, and he has maintained supreme standards, thanks in part to more mobility. ‘They (England coaches) want the same explosive qualities, but they want us to be a bit lighter and fitter,’ he said. ‘After the Argentina tour last year, the feedback from England was, “We want you big, strong and as effective as you can be in a five-metre square. Now the emphasis has shifted; they still want me to be destructive, but also get my numbers up. That is going well for me so far – I’ve made a fairly good account of myself in the early part of this season. ‘I am a very good scrummaging second row – one of the best scrummaging second rows around. It is great for me to be working with David Wilson, who is one of the best tightheads in Europe at the moment. So I have that string to my bow, but for the last Test in New Zealand I was weighing around 127kg and now I’m about 119. I’m trying to get around the pitch a bit more.’ Dave Attwood claims a line-out for Bath . Sunday’s game at Adams Park will act as another momentous examination of his Test ambitions. In recent weeks, Attwood has thrived in match-ups with Geoff Parling and Courtney Lawes, now Launchbury is on his radar. He is driven, but wary of being side-tracked by a personal agenda. ‘You can’t just run round the pitch, following the guy, saying, “I’m coming after you!”,’ he said. ‘I think I’m on a good road. I’m not the one holding the shirt – I’m chasing someone else’s shirt at the moment. I’m third or fourth or fifth choice, but I’ve got a possibility of getting hold of it. I do feel like there’s an opportunity for someone with my skills-set to be a reigning England second row.’ His superb form has come in the build-up to becoming a first-time father. He senses he is entering a critical phase, in various ways. ‘It may be coincidental that things are going particularly well with Bath so far this season, the World Cup is looming, we’ve got a baby on the way and I’m on the verge of getting established in international rugby,’ he said. There’s an awful lot going on at the moment. ‘I’m very excited and aware that I’m on the cusp of a life-changing period.’","Second row Dave Attwood has become known for his physical approach .

Blog: Before he died at age 98, Cutie and Harry 'PopPop' Cooper were known for their blog 'The OGs' 'It's true that when your babies are small, there isn't much time left over for romantic gestures. But the wonderful thing about romance is that it is the quality, never the quantity, that matters.' She suggests throwing a blanket on the living room floor when the baby is sleeping and slicing some peaches or plums, pouring a glass of something bubbly, and enjoying a 'mini picnic.' 'Write love notes to each other and slip them in between the clean diapers,' she writes. 'Be creative, and if you want your love to flourish, it certainly will do so.' 1. Make time to make love 'I don't understand couples who say they are too busy or too tired to sleep together. Unless they are building roads all day or running a multi-national corporation, I expect they have just lost sight of priorities. If you wish to stay connected and happy in your marriage, my advice to you is to never be too tired or too busy to feel love for your partner. When your life is nearly over, you will regret it if you look back and recall too many nights when you made excuses instead of making love.' 2. Always greet your partner 'If you want your relationship to survive and to thrive, you will have to train yourself to focus most of your attention on the person you love. When your sweetheart comes into the room, whether it's just from taking care of some chores in the garage or from a long day at work, your job is to put down whatever you're doing, look him in the eye, and verbally express your delight at seeing him again. It's really so little to ask, and delivers so much - to both of you.' 3. Keep the romance alive, even when you have children 'It's true that when your babies are small, there isn't much time left over for romantic gestures. But the wonderful thing about romance is that it is the quality, never the quantity, that matters. So when the baby is napping, throw a blanket on the living room floor, slice some peaches or plums or whatever you have in the house, pour a glass of something bubbly, and enjoy a mini picnic. Write love notes to each other and slip them in between the clean diapers. Be creative, and if you want your love to flourish, it certainly will do so.' 4. Be honest about money problems 'The most important ingredient for getting through tough economic times is THE TRUTH - it's so important it should be capitalized and italicized. So this means that if you have any financial secrets you are keeping from your partner, you must put them on the table. Doesn't that sound scary? I am sure it does, but as with so many unpleasant things that only get bigger and stronger in the dark, these secrets have a funny way of shrinking in the light of the truth. And as they get smaller, your stress and worry will fly away. There's never a better time to be honest with your partner and yourself and make a plan for dealing with your debts and your excess spending - together. I promise, you will not regret it.' 5. Control your anger 'Have you ever noticed that you can't spell dangerous without anger? I'm no linguist, but I don't think that's a coincidence. When you're ready to blow, you might say anything hurtful, things you would normally spare the person you love from hearing. Don't say something you'll regret forever. Don't give your partner an excuse to come back to you with his or her own resentments. Instead, find a way to get your anger under control. For myself, I simply run through my mind a short movie of how foolishly I have been acting. You may have better luck singing a silly song, or patting your head while rubbing your tummy, or doing whatever little trick helps bring you outside of yourself long enough to regain control.'","Los Angeles grandmother Barbara 'Cutie' Cooper was married to husband Harry, who passed away in 2010, for an incredible 73 years .

"Nemanja Matic's three-match ban has been reduced to two after an appeal but Chelsea claim they are 'appalled' by the Football Association's ruling. An independent commission reduced the suspension after examining the evidence from the incident which took place during a 1-1 draw against Burnley at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Matic was dismissed for violent conduct after retaliating to a high tackle by Ashley Barnes, which Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho described as 'criminal' and 'career ending'. Nemanja Matic will miss the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham after his red card against Burnley . This studs-up tackle from Ashley Barnes infuriated Matic and Jose Mourinho backed up his player . Matic learned the outcome of his appeal on Tuesday after an initial three-match ban for his reaction . Chelsea uploaded a story on their website about how they were 'appalled with the FA's decision' Chelsea tweeted their own story about how they are 'appalled with the FA's decision on Matic' Roger Burden, chairman of the Regulatory Commission, explained the reduction took into account the 'level of force' used by Matic, who will miss Sunday's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur and a Barclays Premier League game against West Ham. Burden said: 'In reaching this decision the members of the Regulatory Commission rejected the mitigation advanced by Nemanja Matic in respect of the provocation and tackle he received which led to his act of violent conduct. 'The violent response of Mr Matic to the nature of the tackle cannot be condoned and does not vindicate his subsequent actions. The members of the Commission did, however, accept the mitigation in respect of the level of force used by Mr Matic and the nature of the contact he made with Mr Barnes of Burnley FC. 'Having made those considerations we determined that the standard punishment of a three-match suspension would be clearly excessive and, therefore, ordered that the suspension be reduced to two matches.' Matic's ban was reduced to two matches after he was was sent off for reacting to Barnes's horror tackle . Chelsea and manager Mourinho produced a dossier to present to the FA as part of midfielder Matic's appeal . Chelsea were quick to react to the judgement with a statement on their website, headlined: 'Chelsea appalled with the FA's decision on Matic.' It added  the board were 'extremely disappointed and frustrated' by the FA's decision not to reduce the ban further. The statement added: 'There has been universal condemnation of the reckless challenge made by Ashley Barnes on Matic and it is the club's view that he has been unjustly punished with a two-match ban for his reaction to a career-threatening tackle. 'It is Chelsea's opinion that referees and the football authorities must do more to protect players at all levels of the game from dangerous challenges. This decision also clearly demonstrates a need for consistency and fairness in the disciplinary process. 'The club awaits The FA's written reasons, prior to commenting further.' Wayne Routledge (left) and Jan Vertonghen (right) were part of the subject of Chelsea's dossier sent to the FA . Joe Hart's headbutt on Michael Oliver (left)  and Jack Wilshere's on Marouane Fellaini (right) were included . Chelsea had prepared a dossier of incidents featuring Jan Vertonghen, Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart to present to the FA as part of their appeal against Matic's three-game ban. Chelsea hoped that by flagging up other similar decisions that the FA would cut the sentence. The Premier League leaders prepared a number of examples within their evidence submitted to the FA on Tuesday, with Vertonghen, Wilshere, Hart and Swansea's Wayne Routledge all involved. The five incidents - none of which saw the culprits banned - picked out for inclusion are taken from the last four months of the season and aim to show that Matic's ban is excessive in comparison. November 2, 2014: Joe Hart . The Manchester City goalkeeper dips his head into the face of referee Michael Oliver over a disagreement over a decision in the Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium. Verdict: No action taken. Hart dips his head into the face of Oliver during the Manchester derby back in November of last year . November 22, 2014: Jack Wilshere . Arsenal midfielder violently pushed his head into Marouane Fellaini's chest during Manchester United's 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium. Verdict: No action taken. Wilshere pushes his head against an incredulous Fellaini when Manchester United visited the Emirates . January 1, 2015: Wayne Routledge . Swansea winger reacts to a challenge from Karl Henry and is adjudged to have kicked out at the QPR midfielder. Swans manager Garry Monk later describes Henry's initial tackle as a 'leg-breaker'. Verdict: Routledge sent off. Cleared on appeal. Routledge was sent off for his reaction to a foul by Henry but later cleared of any wrongdoing . January 28, 2015: Jan Vertonghen . Tottenham defender grabs Sheffield United's Chris Basham by the throat after a clash with Spurs goalkeeper Michel Vorm. Verdict: No action taken . Vertonghen had an angry clash with Chris Basham and later had his hand around his opponent's neck . February 21, 2015: Jan Vertonghen . In scenes similar to Matic's reaction just a day earlier, Vertonghen clearly pushes Mark Noble in the chest and knocks him to the floor in reaction to a foul on Nabil Bentaleb.

"A mother who still breastfeeds her five-year-old daughter has likened stopping the habit to robbing a child of their favourite toy. Sharon Spink, 44, from Sherburn in Elmet, North Yorkshire, has said that she continues to feed her daughter Charlotte because she wants 'mummy milk'. She said: 'It’s like taking away her favourite teddy, would you do that to a child? Would you take her favourite toy?' Scroll down for video . Mother Sharon Spink said that she will continue feeding her five-year-old until her daughter tells her she no longer wants 'mummy milk' Mrs Spink sparked controversy earlier this week during an exclusive interview with The Sun when she revealed that she continued to feed her five-year-old. The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding as a sole form of feeding until six months and combined with other food until the age of two. Today, Mrs Spink told viewers of ITV's This Morning that the choice to feed was down to her daughter and that she would only stop once she is ready. She said: 'It's her choice. It's her choice to feed and it's her choice to stop.' Mrs Spink said her breasts would continue producing milk because the liquid is created on a 'supply and demand' principle. She added that her daughter would not be able to continue feeding aged 11 or 12 because her mouth would become too large. When presenter Eammon Holmes asked the mother-of four: 'Is the demand there?' she said that Charlotte asked her for 'mummy milk'. Mrs Spink admitted that she sometimes would like to stop breastfeeding because she is occasionally left with painful teeth marks. Mrs Spink has divided public opinion on social media after appearing on This Morning to discuss why she still breastfeeds her five-year-old daughter . Mrs Spink said that she rarely received criticism for the habit and was often praised for her decision. She said that she would stop feeding when her daughter no longer wanted the milk . Mrs Spink said: 'I don't have any choice in it really'. She added that she would stop if her daughter no longer wanted to feed. At the moment both Charlotte and her mother are 'happy' with the arrangement and Mrs Spink believes that breastfeeding should be down to personal choice. She said her daughter sees the process as a form of comfort and likes having milk before going to bed. Mrs Spink hit back at critics again saying that she believed many other parents breastfeed their older children - but  that the habit is kept behind closed doors. When Eammon Holmes asked the mother-of four: 'Is the demand there?' she said that Charlotte asked her for 'mummy milk'. She said that there were 'plenty' of older children still having breast milk. But Mrs Spink claimed that she rarely receives criticism for feeding her daughter and is generally praised for her decision. Charlotte's classmates sometimes ask what their friend is doing but when Mrs Spink explains the process to them they generally walk off and say 'ok then', the mother said. In television series Little Britain, David Walliams plays Harvey Pincher, who continues to ask for his mother's 'bitty' so that he can have breastmilk - despite being in his twenties. Ahead of Mrs Spink's appearance on today's programme Little Britain actor David Walliams posted a picture of The Sun's article with only the word 'bitty...' Mrs Spink send a scathing reply to the actor in which she wrote: 'Thanks so much for doing breastfeeding mums such a disservice. You really need to educate yourself.' This afternoon, Mrs Spink continued to defend her decision. Speaking to Julie Hartley-Brewer she told radio station LBC: 'We know there are benefits to breastfeeding those benefits don't go away just because the child has got to five. 'It's like saying broccoli suddenly loses all its nutritional value because you're now thirty years old.' She said that feeding was predominantly a comfort mechanism for Charlotte. She said that the milk acted as a 'natural anesthetic' so her daughter often wanted the milk when she was hurt or upset. Charlotte was once at a party and fell over so Mrs Spink fed her to comfort her. But Mrs Spink has continued to receive mixed messages on social media both criticising and praising the mother-of-four. One parenting blogger wrote: 'It's a disgrace a culture that promotes milk from a cow over a human, such ignorance.' In a second tweet she added: 'I fully support women breastfeeding their child until the child chooses.' But other tweeters blasted Mrs Spink describing the decision as 'disgusting' and 'ridiculous'. Many expressed concerns about the possibility of Charlotte becoming a victim of bullying. Around 78 per cent of women in England breast feed, research shows. According to the World Health Organisation, women are recommended to breastfeed their new-born babies for around six months. The NHS Start 4 Life site highlights, however, that breast milk is the most natural food for a child - and so on most occasions, the longer child receives it the better. Breastfeeding can provide numerous health benefits to both mother and child. It can help a baby fight against infections and can also protect babies against becoming overweight. There is also evidence to suggest the process helps new mothers avoid putting on weight also. A lot of mothers prefer breast feeding as it is available whenever and wherever a baby needs. It is always the right temperature, also. The process of breastfeeding can also build a strong physical and emotional bond between mother and baby. Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting website Netmums supported Mrs Spink in her actions. She said: 'In the UK breastfeeding beyond a year or two is seen as strange, but it's normal in many other cultures and countries. 'While some children will wean themselves off by a year, others like the comfort and closeness breastfeeding brings. 'While it is undoubtedly unusual to still be feeding a school age child, if the parent and child are happy then that is their decision. It's down to the individual family and what works for them.' Lactation consultant Catherine Cooper is a member of the Lactation Consultants of Great Britain association. She said that she believes the decision should be down to each mother and that no one should be judged for the choice that they make. She said that breastfeeding boosted a child's immune system but the process was 'far more than just nutrition'. She added: 'Breastfeeding is also about the closeness, there is emotional re-booting, breastfeeding is really just like a cuddle.'","Sharon Spink continues to feed her five-year-old daughter Charlotte .

"Opinionated: Jennifer Saunders, pictured with her husband Adrian Edmondson, believes it is important that children are disciplined by their parents . As Britain’s top comedienne, it’s not difficult for Jennifer Saunders to see the funny side of life. But parenting is one subject that she does not consider a laughing matter. The Absolutely Fabulous star has revealed that she has no time for modern child rearing which she claims prevents parents from disciplining their children and setting boundaries. Miss Saunders, 55, who has three daughters with her husband Adrian Edmondson, said: ‘That ‘conscious parenting’ is rather odd, where you spend ‘quality time’. 'They [children] have to learn what life is like, that people have bad moods. People get cross. If I’m tired, and you’re pushing it, I’m going to shout.’ And referring to the need to teach children the importance of responsibility rather than being kind, she added: ‘If you want a pony, even if it’s wet and dark, you go out there and you do your bloody pony.’ The actress, also best known for her comedy partnership with Dawn French, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 following a routine mammogram. Tests revealed it to be several malignant lumps. Miss Saunders underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Following the treatment she was given Tamoxifen which she has revealed plunged her straight into menopause and depression. In her interview with the Saturday Times magazine she said: ‘I just thought that I was cross and that the whole world was wrong. Everyone was being stupid.’ Traditional: Miss Saunders, pictured with her husband and two of their three daughters in 2004, claims modern parenting techniques prevent adults from setting boundaries for their children . Miss Saunders, who has written a new book, Bonkers: My Life in Laughs, is still taking an anti-depressant. Controversially she claims some people like to wear cancer like a badge: ‘I’ll give you why. Because it’s the job you don’t have to work for. You suddenly get so much attention and if you’re not used to that, I bet it can sway you a little bit. ‘I’m used to it! My job gives me the attention I would otherwise crave. They must be so p***ed off when their hair grows back. And you think, ‘Oh, come on, cancer is so common now.’ Absolutely Fabulous: Her real-life opinions are very different from that of her Ab Fab character Edina, pictured with Patsy, played by Joanna Lumley .","Miss Saunders has three daughters with her husband Adrian Edmondson .

"Aliens are here and they have chosen the perfect landing pad - the lush green fields of a wind farm in Devon. That is, if you choose to believe these photos of a bizarre shape hovering in the sky in broad daylight. The images show what appears to be a UFO floating above turbines at Fullabrook wind farm. Scroll down for video . Strange sighting: This photo shows what appears to be a UFO hovering in the sky in broad daylight . Bizarre object: The mysterious shape can be seen floating above Fullabrook wind farm in Devon . The mysterious object - which is grey in colour, quite large and oval-shaped - was unintentionally captured by a professional photographer. He had been taking pictures of the wind farm, which lies between Barnstaple and Ilfracombe, last Saturday. However, when he later examined his footage, he realised he had captured the unidentified shape hovering in the sky. The photographer zoomed in on the object - but was still unable to identify what it could be. Mystery: The oval-shaped, grey-coloured object was unintentionally captured by a professional photographer . Chivenor Search and Rescue told the North Devon Journal that it had not received any reports of UFO sightings in the area. It also pointed out that rescue workers had been on a training exercise on Saturday, so the mysterious object may have been one of its aircraft. However, since the photos were published by the newspaper, people across the southwest of the country have spoken out about their own spooky aerial sightings in the past week. Matt Naughton, from Devon, said: 'Driving to Torrington on Thursday night, I saw strange bright lights in the sky and the car had flashes of blue in it. Very creepy!' Erica Whiteley reported her husband had spotted something 'unusually bright' above Fullabrook - adding: 'He was joking around saying he had seen a UFO'. Jacqueline Leighton Boyce, from West Somerset, even managed to capture what appears to be a UFO on video. 'I too saw a strange very large bright thing in the sky on Saturday about dusk time,' she said. Her footage shows a bright object hovering in the dark sky in Dulverton, which is situated near the border of Devon.","Mysterious object captured hovering above Fullabrook wind farm in Devon .

"Sir Donald Sinden, pictured receiving his knighthood at Buckingham Palace in 1997,  has died aged 90 . Theatre, TV and film actor Sir Donald Sinden has died aged 90 after years battling cancer. Sir Donald made his name on stage as a Shakespearean actor and also had more than 70 credits for film and TV productions since the late 1940s to now. He had been battling prostate cancer over several years and his death, just weeks before his 91st birthday, at his home in Romney Marsh, Kent, has been described as a 'huge loss' by his family. His son, actor and film director Marc Sinden, said in a statement: 'My father has finished dying. He suffered for a few years from prostate cancer which slowly spread. 'Even though his death was expected, it is still a huge loss to his family and we, his brother, his son, his four grandchildren and great-grandchild will all miss his humour and knowledge and we would all like to share our appreciation for the Pilgrims Hospice and the carers that looked after him and us with such dignity, consideration and care until the end.' Sir Donald trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and made his film debut in 1953 with The Cruel Sea, later going on to perform with the Royal Shakespeare Company in leading roles such as King Lear and Malvolio in Twelfth Night. But for all his classical roles and theatrical prowess, many will remember him for TV sitcoms such as Two's Company and Never The Twain, as well as a running spoof in satirical puppet show Spitting Image which poked fun at his wonderfully rich voice. The actor was born in Plymouth on 9 October, 1923, the son of a country chemist. He had fully intended to pursue a career as an architect and surveyor. However, he was spotted in an amateur theatrical production in the Brighton Little Theatre and in 1942 was asked to join the Charles F Smith Company, which entertained the troops. Sir Donald had himself been turned down for naval service because of asthma. After brief training in a drama school, he quickly established himself as a stage performer, particularly in Shakespearean roles. He joined the Shakespearean Memorial Theatre Company in the 1940s and in the 1960s he became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), starring in their productions of King Lear and Othello. The star, pictured last year left and right in 1975, was born in Plymouth, and started his career on the stage in roles such as King Lear before finding further fame on TV and film . For some years he alternated between the RSC and modern comedy, making his screen debut in the film classic, The Cruel Sea in 1953 as naval officer Lockhart, and thereafter became a suave leading man in British films during the rest of that decade. He also starred in screen hits Doctor In The House and Doctor at Large. As his film appearances became less frequent, Sir Donald worked steadily in the theatre, primarily with the RSC. Sir Donald has his arm round Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe in 2007, and proved an inspiration to many other actors . Theatrical knights: Sir Donald with fellow actor Sir Ian McKellen at the Lyceum Theatre, London . Here's to us! In the 1970s, he appeared as an unflappable butler alongside U.S. actress Elaine Stritch, who died earlier this year, in the TV series Two's Company . Best of enemies: He also starred alongside Windsor Davies in Never The Twain, playing neighbours and business rivals who hated each other but were brought together when their children got married . In 1970, he played Sir William Harcourt Courtly in the RSC's revival of Dion Boucicault's London Assurance. He also appeared in Terence Rattigan's double bill, In Praise Of Love (1973) and as Dr Stockman in Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy Of The People at Chichester in 1975. In 1982 he starred in Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, while in 1990, he gave a solo appearance as Oscar Wilde. Sir Donald was also a regular on the small screen. Treading the boards: Sir Donald played the title role in The Scarlet Pimpernel in 1968, just one of the many roles he played on stage . In the 1970s, he appeared as an unflappable English butler alongside U.S. actress Elaine Stritch, who died earlier this year, playing a brash American, in the TV series Two's Company. And he played for further laughs alongside Windsor Davies in Never The Twain, playing neighbours and business rivals who despised each other but found themselves tied by family when their children married. The programme was a mainstay of ITV schedules and ran for 11 series. Sir Donald also played Sir Joseph Channing, a senior appeal court judge in the popular BBC series Judge John Deed. His other TV credits include The Canterville Ghost (1997), The Treasure Seekers (1996), All's Well That End's Well (1981), as well as a memorable guest-starring turn in the cult 1960s drama The Prisoner. He appeared, too, in numerous radio productions and guested on TV shows such as Blankety Blank and Open House, as well as providing the instantly recognisable voice-overs for many TV commercials. In his later years, Sir Donald appeared in a brief cameo role in the 2012 film Run For Your Wife, adapted from the popular theatrical farce, which was a box office flop. In 1948, he married Diana Mahony who died a decade ago. They had two sons, one of whom Jeremy - also an actor – tragically died from lung cancer in 1996, while the other, Marc, is a director and producer. He was awarded a CBE in 1979 and was granted a knighthood in 1997 for his services to drama. His son Marc, who has his own production company, added: 'He bravely continued presenting our Sky Arts documentary series Great West End Theatres in spite of a minor stroke, until it became just too difficult for him and at his insistence his illness was kept from all but the closest friends. 'It had been an ambition of his to get as many of his wonderful theatrical memories and anecdotes down on film to share with people, in and outside of our profession, who may have never heard his extraordinary tales of a hugely long career.

'Not many knew, for instance, that he was the last person living to have known Oscar Wilde's lover Lord Alfred Douglas (Bosie) and was one of only two people to attend his funeral. 'The breadth of his friendships, his love of serendipity and his hugely varied and very successful career as a Rank Organisation movie star, West End and television star and award-laden Shakespearean actor was probably unique in our business. 'He worked out that he only had a total of five weeks unemployment between 1942 and 2008, which was probably a record in itself. Another record he held from 1949 until 2013 was at the Haymarket Theatre in his beloved West End of London, where he gave more consecutive performances in one play than any other actor since it was built in 1820.

The venue and date for a memorial service will be announced later,' he said. Sir Roger Moore was among those paying tribute on Twitter, calling him 'a wonderful actor'. The two worked together on 1975 film That Lucky Touch. ‘Sad to wake up to news another mate has left us,’ the former James Bond star said. ‘Awful week.’ And comedian Miranda Hart wrote: ‘Another loss. Sir Donald Sinden. I like to think his beyond wonderful voice is dramatically booming around a heavenly realm.’ Magician Paul Daniels also paid tribute, saying the actor was ‘a truly nice gentleman with a wonderful sense of humour.’","Shakespearean actor also appeared in 70 film and TV projects in his career .

"The Christmas Tinner, pictured, from GAME is made up of nine layers including a scrambled egg starter, turkey dinner, and Christmas pudding . With gamers admitting they’d give up Christmas dinner to avoid having to stop playing, one store has invented an entire festive feast in a tin. Dubbed 'Christmas Tinner', the nausea-inducing concoction comprises of nine layers of food - ranging from a starter to a pudding. The top layer is made of scrambled egg and bacon and this sits above a layer of fruity mincemeat. The middle layers combine turkey and potatoes, roast carrots and other trimmings before being finished off by a layer of Christmas pudding. It has been created by retailer GAME, with designer Chris Godfrey and costs £1.99. The launch comes after the gaming retailer found almost half (43 per cent) of gamers in the UK intend to spend the majority of the holidays on their consoles. It also said the tin saves on the washing up and there is even a ‘Without Sprouts’ version that uses broccoli instead. The full nine layers, from top to bottom, include scrambled egg and bacon, two mince pies, turkey and potatoes, gravy, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, Brussels sprouts with stuffing - or broccoli with stuffing - roast carrots and parsnips and Christmas pudding, . All the food is sealed in gelatine before being added to the tin one at a time. The Christmas Tinner has been trialled in the Basingstoke store, and the firm said it plans to sell it in stores across the country if there is enough demand. Research from Domino’s Pizza recently found that gamers will do anything in order to carrying on playing. Almost half of male gamers admitted they have turned down sex to continue playing, while a fifth of female gamers said they’d missed weddings and hen dos. The layers (top to bottom) include scrambled egg and bacon, mince pies, turkey and potatoes, gravy, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, Brussels sprouts with stuffing, roast carrots and parsnips and Christmas pudding.

Users simply pierce the can, which kickstarts an exothermic reaction to warm the meal to around 60 degrees celsius. The 400g tin takes 12 minutes to cook.

HotCans consist of a can of food surrounded by an outer shell, with a water sachet and processed granular limestone in between. Customers pierce the rim of the can and this sachet, which causes the water to flow into the limestone. This triggers a natural heat-producing reaction which warms up the food to between 60 and 70 degrees celsius. The 400g tin then takes 12 minutes to cook and the chemical reaction means user don't even need a cooker or microwave.","The 'Christmas Tinner' is made up of nine layers of traditional festive food .

"Gerry Adams will not be prosecuted over the murder of Jean McConville or membership of the IRA because of a lack of evidence, it was suggested last night. Prosecutors already believe there is insufficient material to convict him of either offence, the BBC claimed. It came less than 24 hours after police said they would pass a file to Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service within a week. Scroll down for video . Gerry Adams, pictured with Deputy First Minister if Northern Ireland Martin McGuinness, was released without charge after arrest over the 1972 abduction and murder of Jean McConville . Meanwhile, Adams’ wife Collette has been warned by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) of a credible death threat against him. Tensions continued to rise yesterday amid a war of words in the aftermath of the incendiary arrest and 96-hour detention of the Republican leader. Adams denies any involvement in the abduction, murder or secret burial of mother-of-ten Mrs McConville by a masked gang in 1972. But her son Michael McConville said yesterday that the Sinn Fein leader personally warned him of a ‘backlash’ if he publicly identified those responsible. Mr McConville, who was 11 when he watched his screaming mother dragged out of their family home, said he knew several of those involved. He was warned soon after her disappearance that he would also be shot if he told police. Free to go? As prosecutors allegedly believe there is insufficient material to convict him, the Sinn Fein leader, pictured being hugged by a well-wished outside the party offices in Belfast, will not be prosecuted . Michael McConville, right, who was 11, when he saw his mother being dragged away to her death, added: We know it is going to be a long road. But we have already been fighting for justice for 40 years and we are not going to stop now' Under threat: Gerry Adams' wife Collette has been warned by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) of a credible death threat against him . Mrs Jean McConville, who was one of 'The Disappeared' and believed murdered by the IRA . After campaigning to bring the killers to justice, Mr McConville attended meetings with IRA members brokered by Adams between 2004 and 2006. He said: ‘Gerry Adams says to me “Michael, you are getting a letter of support from the Republican people”. 'He says “If you release the names I hope you are ready for the backlash”. I took it as a threat.’ Mr McConville said that even if Adams told him he was now safe to ‘name names’ he  would refuse. ‘I don’t trust Gerry Adams. If I told their names something would happen to me or my family,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Adams has denied he threatened Mr McConville with a backlash if he released the names. The BBC’s Northern Ireland home affairs correspondent, Vincent Kearney, said in an article on the Corporation’s website on Sunday that there was not much prospect that there would be a charge, unless significant new evidence emerged. Gerry Adams, depicted on this mural which has just been repaired following a paint bomb attack, denies the allegations against him . Nationalists gather in support of Gerry Adams and to call for his release in Belfast on Friday . But Mrs McConville’s daughter, Helen McKendry, said there is no doubt in the minds of many people that Adams played a key role in  the IRA. She told the Mail: ‘The  dogs in the street knew he  was the leader of the IRA in our area at the time of my mother’s abduction.’ Mrs McKendry also met with Adams in 1995 and was unconvinced by his promise to help. She said: ‘He told me he was there to listen to my story and to hear who I thought was responsible. But he couldn’t look me in the eye.’ Yesterday, Sinn Fein Stormont Assembly member Raymond McCartney said a PSNI officer had told Adams’ wife Collette that ‘they had information of a credible threat to the life of Gerry, who was not at home at the time’. He added: ‘Clearly there are elements that are opposed to the peace process and anti-Sinn Fein.’","Prosecutors allegedly believe there is insufficient material to convict Adams .

"Apple's iconic cube store in Manhattan on Fifth Avenue was another high-profile victim of the snowstorm which hit New York City on Tuesday. One of the huge 32-foot glass panels that make up the entrance to the iPhone giant's flagship store was reportedly accidently smashed by a city snowblower that threw up a stone. While there was no immediate threat that the glass would shatter completely, the estimated cost to the Californian firm to restore the cube is estimated to be around $450,000. Smash: This image taken on Tuesday night shows the shattered panel of glass at the Apple cube just off Central Park in New York after it was damaged during the snowstorm which hit the city during the day . 'It's kind of ironic,' quipped Marvin Washington, 53, of Midtown as he passed by to DNAinfo.com . 'Everyone drops their phones and the screens break. Now, it's happened to them.' Other passersby who navigated the Central Park location which was hit by 11 inches on Tuesday said that in fact, the cube would look quite interesting if the entire structure had the same shattered effect. 'It looks kind of cool,' said Griffin Stewart, 30, a web designer from Williamsburg. 'If they did the rest of the cube like that, it would look pretty neat.' Damage: It is estimated that the cost to repair the panel which shattered on Tuesday night will be $450,000 . Interesting effect: The panel is one of 15 at the iconic Apple cube and was installed in 2011 after a $6.7 million renovation of the structure . Others seemed to put their faith in Apple's famed design and said that even though the glass looked precarious, they trusted it was safe. 'I should not, but I do feel very comfortable,' said Guy Levi, 33, to the New York Post. 'It’s nice because there is a view and natural light. It’s like sitting outside but it’s not cold.'

"Forty two shots at goal. That was the incredible total registered by Brentford as they blew Blackpool away. Forty two. Four of them went in and 14 of them were on target, including a hat-trick from Jon Toral. Just why is it they are sacking Mark Warburton at the end of the season again? Still their soon-to-be-former manager kept alive chances of promotion to the Premier League, having only guided them up from League One last season, with this obliteration. Brentford striker Jon Toral jumps for joy after he completed his hat-trick in the 89th minute of the game . Toral is congratulated by team-mate Jonathan Douglas after he opened the scoring for Brentford .

Blackpool: Lewis, McMahon, Aldred (Delfouneso 25), Clarke, Hall, Dunne, Perkins, Rothwell, O'Hara (Oliver 39), Davies (Ferguson 53), Madine. Subs not used: Parish, Telford, Cameron, O'Dea . Sent off: Dunne . Ref: Andy D'Urso . Att: 8,765 . Owner Matthew Benham claimed he had the long-term interests of the club at heart when he made the decision axe Warburton after this campaign. He may live to rue that largely unpopular choice if Warburton’s replacement fails to work the same miracles with this set of players. After 16 minutes of constant pressure they took the lead. A slick passing move - one of many - ended with Jonathan Douglas in plenty of space inside the box on the left and he could have shot himself but passed into Jon Toral to poke in. Two minutes later and Brentford were two ahead. This time they found space down the right and Andre Gray crossed deep to Toral to head in completely free at the back post for his second of the night. Blackpool’s first-half penalty area was heavily patched up with sand, but it made the Seasiders no more at home as Brentford poured forward with waves of attack. Gray should have put Brentford three ahead when he ran through on goal with time and space, but Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis was out quickly to block. Brentford goalkeeper David Button celebrates following Toral's opening strike at Griffin Park . Brentford's Andre Gray scores his side's third goal of the night despite the attention of Connor Oliver . When Blackpool’s Charles Dunne was shown a straight red card for a lunge on Jota a minute before the break, it was hard to imagine a worse half of football for one side. Predictably, seven minutes into the second half the home side went three ahead when Gray saw a spectacular volley saved but collected the rebound and beat the keeper via the right post. Alex Pritchard had a vicious shot saved from inside the box on the right and Gray had another go, turning a defender and getting a shot away which was again kept out. Blackpool manager Lee Clark (right) shouts some orders on the sideline as his side suffer yet another loss . Granted, Blackpool are an embarrassment to the division, rock bottom and already 12 points adrift of safety. But no team, however much a gulf in class between the sides, should be so cut open in one match. As the game rolled on it became more like a training ground affair; an attack versus defence drill. Warburton threw on two more forwards - Tommy Smith and Chris Long - for shooting practice. But it was Toral who completed the rout, and his treble, with a close-range finish in the 89th minute. Deservedly, Warburton’s name rang from the stands as the final whistle blew.","Jon Toral grabs brace in space of three first-half minutes for Brentford .

"Wimbledon women's semi-finalist Agnieszka Radwanska has been dropped by a Catholic youth movement she had been representing after appearing naked on the front cover of a magazine. The Polish tennis star, who is the world number four, was pictured nude sat in a plastic deckchair next to a swimming pool filled with tennis balls in the shoot for a special 'Body Issue' of ESPN Magazine. She posed side-on while clutching two tennis balls in the image, shielding her modesty with careful positioning of her arms. Ballsy: Tennis world number four Agnieszka Radwanska stripped off for a magazine shoot . The 24-year-old is a proud Catholic but youth group Krucjata Mlodych (Youth Crusade) has condemned the shoot as 'immoral behaviour' and dropped her from its campaigns. She had starred in a commercial for the group where she spells out 'Jesus' with tennis balls and tells people not to be ashamed of their faith. Senior Catholic priest Father Marek Dziewiecki said: 'It's a shame that someone who has declared their love for Jesus is now promoting the mentality of men looking at a woman as a thing rather than a child of God worthy of respect and love. 'If she meets a man who she can truly love and establish a happy family and raise Catholic children, then she would probably have to hide these pictures from relatives.'

In an interview with ESPN Magazine she said: 'I feel fortunate that I can stay pretty lean without having to do too much gym work.' And she said she liked to do 300 sit-ups at a time to make her stomach 'rock hard'.

She also revealed a strange habit of filling up on food around half an hour before her matches. 'Unlike most players, who eat at least two hours before matches, I can . eat a full meal and go straight out on the court. In fact, I prefer to . do that,'' she told the magazine.

"Barcelona may have slipped from the summit of European football but this tie proved that Manchester City are still stranded half-way down the mountain. The Catalan giants arrived in Manchester on the back of a shock defeat to Malaga on Saturday that left them four points behind Real Madrid at the top of La Liga. And they were besieged by controversy about Lionel Messi’s visit to a casino in the early hours of Monday morning with team-mate Gerard Pique. Luis Suarez fired home from a tight angle after outwitting Vincent Kompany to put Barcelona ahead . Suarez (left) finishes off a lovely move from a tight angle to give City a mountain to climb . The City defence can only look back in anger after Suarez hit his second of the game to stun the hosts . But City soothed all their visitors' uncertainties away with a performance that was timid, insipid and ineffective. City were, quite simply, the dream opponents, supine and dull. Barcelona strolled through the first half as if it were a practice match. It felt as if they could not quite believe their luck. This is the kind of result and performance that could act as a catalyst for Barcelona as they try to reclaim their crown, at home and abroad. For a side that frets about its Messidependencia, this was a performance that suggested Barcelona are more than a one-man team. The old Holy Trinity of Messi, Xavi and Andres Iniesta is no more. Xavi was on the bench and there are doubts about the longevity of Iniesta. But even though Messi was sublime, there were signs a new Holy Trinity is emerging. Sergio Aguero, City's saviour in the group stages, gave his side a glimmer of home with this sublime effort . The Argentine striker was his bustling, energetic best giving Marc-Andre ter Stegen little chance . Aguero breathed life into the tie with his 69th minute strike pegging back an irresistible Barcelona . So far, Luis Suarez has been content to play a supporting role to Messi and feed the Argentine’s goalscoring genius. Those close to the team say Suarez has made a conscious decision to sacrifice individual glory in the pursuit of the trophies that have largely eluded him. Suarez knows that making sure Messi is functioning at his peak represents the team's best chance of being successful and he has resolved to do everything he can to assist him. It is one of the reasons why Suarez and Messi, who does not like to share the scoring spoils, get on so well. But on his first return to England since his £75million move from Liverpool in the summer, Suarez showed the match-winning talent that was his trademark during his time on Merseyside. Hart saves Lionel Messi's spot kick to hand City a Champions League lifeline . Time stands still as Messi throws himself at the rebound, but his diving header goes wide of the post . Manuel Pellegrini’s 4-4-2 system played into Barcelona’s hands by leaving City hopelessly outnumbered in central midfield where Barcelona literally ran rings around them. That was Barcelona’s foundation but it was Suarez, Messi and Neymar who ripped City’s defence to shreds. Barca’s front three were a joy to watch. Messi, listless and ineffective against Malaga, was back to his dazzling, dribbling, mesmerising best. He played the provider. It was his curling cross that flummoxed Vincent Kompany after 16 minutes and allowed Suarez to rifle in the rebound. And it was his beautiful run across the face of City’s box and his lay-off to Jordi Alba that allowed Alba to curl a cross into the path of Suarez that the Uruguayan touched home. The maddening thing for City and their fans was that this was an opportunity missed. Gael Clichy's reckless tackle on Dani Alves was rewarded with a second yellow of the night and an early bath . Hart and Lionel Messi share a light-hearted moment during a tense Champions League encounter . Barcelona are still a fine, fine side, of course. The fact that they had won 11 straight games before that defeat to Malaga tells you that. But they are vulnerable, too. Or they would have been if City had offered any type of threat. There was a reason why Messi’s casino visit caused a furore. There was a reason why the issue poisoned Barcelona coach Luis Enrique’s press conference here on Monday night. A few seasons ago, when Barcelona were sweeping all before them, the casino visit would have been ignored. But things are different now. Barcelona are different. Their dominance has gone and so has the confidence of their fans. They find more reasons to fret. Suarez's two-goal salvo silenced the Etihad and left City's Champions League hopes hanging by a thread . Kompany was at fault for the first and the City captain trudges ruefully to the half-way line . David Silva, Edin Dzeko and James Milner cut dejected figures after Suarez's second of the night . So after the defeat to Malaga on Saturday afternoon, the casino visit felt like a symbol of a team whose focus has slipped. And the Barcelona team that walked out on to the pitch at the Etihad was a team that has lost its assumptions of superiority. It is a team in transition. Some say it is at the beginning of a new cycle. Some argue it has not yet ended the old one. Against that backdrop, it turned out that a visit to the Etihad was exactly what Barcelona needed. It was the perfect tonic. By midway through the second half, most City fans were resigned to their team’s fate. Neymar was a nuisance and is pictured giving Pablo Zabaleta a run for his money . Messi was also outstanding and is manhandled by Fernando with Kompany and David Silva looking on . They gasped in awe when Messi took down a high ball that was falling over his shoulder and killed it stone dead. City forced their way back into the game with a goal from Sergio Aguero 20 minutes from time but that was largely because Barcelona had taken their foot off the pedal. When they pressed back down on it, City were chasing shadows again and would have gone further behind if Messi had converted either his injury time penalty or the rebound that he headed wide. It felt like we were turning back time to when Barcelona were revered as the kings of beautiful football, the epitome of everything that is good in the game. It was a time to sit back and marvel.","Manuel Pellegrini named an attacking line-up and his selection was punished .

"Wasps hope their relocation to Coventry will persuade Joe Launchbury to reject interest from Aviva Premiership rivals Saracens. The two-time European champions believe the £20million move from Adams Park in High Wycombe to the Ricoh Stadium will provide the financial muscle to re-establish themselves among the continent's elite. At the top of their priority list is convincing England second row Launchbury to sign an extension to his contract, which is due to expire at the end of the season. Maintaining second row Joe Launchbury is top of Wasps' priority list as they look to re-establish themselves . Wasps moved away from Adams Park, located in High Wycombe, to prove their ambitions as a club . The two-time European champions' relocation to Coventry's Ricoh Stadium cost the club £20million . Director of rugby Dai Young believes that by moving to the Ricoh Stadium, Wasps have convinced Launchbury they are ready to become a force once again. ""We've had have to demonstrate certain things to Joe to make his decision easier,"" Young said. ""He wanted to know that we're an ambitious club, that we will attract players and improve the squad and that we won't overplay him. ""He's not demanding that we win things, but certainly that we compete. And on top of that he wants clear evidence that we're sustainable. ""I think we've pretty much ticked all those boxes now. ""Whatever Saracens offer him - and we know they can't speak to him until January - we have to pay the market value. They're professional players and we have to pay what they're worth. ""Discussions are ongoing but we expect to put this to bed in the next month to six weeks. If it goes on any longer you have to fear the worst."" Wasps chief Dai Young is convinced their recent move to the Ricoh Stadium is enough to hold on to Launchbury . Wasps were one hour away from bankruptcy two years ago and the club have used the threat of liquidation to explain the move away from their roots in London and the south east. Responding to opposition from supporters, they stress that losing £3million a year is unsustainable and that salvation is offered by the revenue streams of Ricoh Stadium's conference, hotel and entertainment facilities. Now possessing the financial clout to attract top players, Young is in search of the marquee signings that will lure supporters to their new 32,000 capacity home. ""I'm shopping in Marks & Spencer now when I have been in Lidl for three years. It is a different shop,"" Young said. ""I am looking at a different market, different players. It is really exciting to think of the players. ""We know that the stadium will take a bit of filling and that will take a lot of hard work. ""It's my task to try and attract three or four big-name players that can excite the local rugby followers and attract new supporters. (Wasps owner) Derek (Richardson) is 100 per cent behind that.

"Barcelona beat Manchester City 2-1 at the Etihad to take control of their Champions League last 16 tie and will be confident of finishing the job in the return leg at the Nou Camp on March 18. Luis Suarez bagged a double in the first half half to send the Catalan giants on their way, before Sergio Aguero struck in the 69th minute to give his side a glimmer of hope. Lionel Messi had a chance to further increases Barca's lead but his last-minute penalty was saved superbly by Joe Hart. Here, Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein rates every player's performance at the Etihad... Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez celebrates his opening goal at the Etihad . MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-2) Joe Hart 7 – Busier than he'd wanted to have been. No chance with Suarez's goals, dived bravely at the feet of Messi at 2-0 and then kept City in the tie, just, with an injury-time penalty save from Messi. Pablo Zabaleta 5 – His recent good deserted him. Bamboozled by Neymar early on and struggled to recover and gave away an injury-time penalty for clipping Messi. Vincent Kompany 4.5 – Suarez gave him twisted blood as the famous saying goes. Simply couldn't keep up with the Uruguayan . Manchester City keeper Joe Hart can only look on as Suarez fires Barca into the lead after 16 minutes of play . Martin Demichelis 6.5 – Sent off in this fixture a year ago, he made a brilliant block from Messi early but beaten by Suarez for the second goal . Gael Clichy 5 – Looked dazed and confused every time Messi and Alves marauded down his flank, which was regularly. Sent off for two yellows. Samir Nasri 6 – The defending part of a winger's game is not his forte – and it cost City. Nearly scored on the stroke of half-time but the damage had been done. City skipper Vincent Kompany had a torrid night trying to contain Suarez and his fellow forwards . James Milner 6 – Had a brilliant season so Manuel Pellegrini gave him a central role due to Toure's suspension. Alas, our James is no Yaya when it comes to midfield drive and switched back wide after an hour. Fernando 5.5 – Signed in the summer for these kind of games. But he couldn't get near the Barca midfield as City were repeatedly cut open in the first half. Booked. David Silva 6.5 – Not at his best out wide to accommodate Dzeko but he did come infield to try and get the ball. City midfielder James Milner (left) tries to shut down Suarez during the opening 45 minutes of action . Edin Dzeko 5.5 – Had chances to justify his surprise selection, but twice fluffed his lines in front of goal with headers. Sergio Aguero 6.5 – Looked forlorn as Suarez took the first half glory but hit back with a fantastic lofted finish past Stegen. Substitutes: Fernandinho (for Nasri 62), Bony (for Dzeko 68), Sagna (for Silva 78) Manager: Manuel Pellegrini 5 - Stubborn like Arsene Wenger, he persisted with 4-4-2 when it hadn't worked in Europe before. Over-ran in midfield and made the switch to bring on Fernandinho too late. Sergio Aguero smashes the ball past Barca keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen to give City hope in the second half . City striker Edin Dzeko (right) cuts a dejected figure as his side struggles to deal with the Barca attack . BARCELONA (4-3-3) Marc-Andre ter Stegen 6 – Virtually a spectator until the end of the first-half when he nonchalantly saved from Nasri. Only plays cup games. Daniel Alves 6.5 – Nobody told the Brazilian that right-backs are meant to stay back in away first legs in Europe. Like an extra forward. Booked. Gerard Pique 7 – Given Barca's relative lack of physical presence, Pique did well as a main defensive barrier. Took up great position to block Dzeko shot. Barca centre back Gerard Pique (right) heads the ball clear under pressure from Aguero . Javier Mascherano 6.5 – City tried to target his lack of height by including Dzeko, but the Argentine is as tough as old boots and built play too. Jordi Alba 6.5 – Spaniard was rewarded for his adventure from full-back by laying on a second goal for Suarez on a plate. Sergio Busquets 6 – The unsung hero of the Barca team, keeps the back door closed and perfectly comfortable hitting pinpoint passes to Messi and co. Veteran midfielder Andres Iniesta (left) shields the ball from City's David Silva . Ivan Rakitic 6.5 – You've got to be good to keep Xavi out and Ratikic was a metronome, building play and venturing forward to find the incisive pass. Booked. Andres Iniesta 6 – Has reinvented himself, a bit like Ryan Giggs. Doesn't tear forward any more but kept the tiki-taka pattern of play going. Luis Suarez 9 – Instinctive finish to give Barca the lead after reacting quicker than Kompany to a bouncing ball. Celebrated with guttural roar. Lionel Messi watches on as Hart does brilliantly to save his last-minute penalty . Suarez is overjoyed as the Barca forward grabs his second goal of the night at the Etihad . Lionel Messi 8.5 –The Champions League record scorer was dazzling in a supporting role. Set up Suarez for the first and beat three men in the move for Barca's second. Ironically, fluffed his late penalty - and the rebound. Neymar 6.5 – Showed off the skills he learned in futsal back in Brazil. A magical entertainer who had Zabaleta bamboozled on one occasion. Substitutes: Mathieu (for Ratikic 71), Adriano (for Alves 75, booked), Pedro (for Neymar 80) Manager: Luis Enrique 7.5 – Rewarded for being bold, not only picking Messi, Suarez and Neymar but also ordering full-backs Alves and Alba forward. Man-of-the-match: Luis Suarez (Barcelona) Referee Felix Brych 7 - There will be a campaign to bring in overseas referees soon judging by the way the German official ran the game.

"The number of illegal migrants reaching European borders is on track to swamp the 140,000 who fled the Arab Spring in 2011, according to new figures. Frontex, the European Union border agency, said that 42,000 illegal immigrants reached the European Union between January and April this year, four times the number in the same period last year. Italian authorities have said that in May another 14,000 arrived in their country making the total who have used central Mediterranean routes for illegal immigration at least 55,000. An excavator destroys an illegal camp in Calais where around 650 migrants were living . French police search the illegal immigrant camp at Calais for anyone hiding there before the site was bulldozed . Examining patterns of illegal immigration means that of those who have arrived in Europe, unknown numbers will try to reach Britain via Calais. Last week, the French police disbanded and demolished two squatter camps near the Channel. With this information, serious questions will be asked about how Britain will cope with an influx of yet more immigrants. The immigration question was a key factor in the recent European elections and could be again ahead of the General Election less than a year from now. Ewa Moncure, a spokesman for Frontex, said: ‘By the end of April the number of illegal border crossings was close to 42,000, including 25,500 through Italy. ‘The Italians gave a new figure a couple of days ago of over 39,000 so far this year, so the overall total will have grown significantly. Migrants and activists scuffle with police after French authorities started to clear out makeshift camps in Calais, housing hundreds of illegal migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Africa . Migrants try their luck on lorries out of Calais in an attempt to get into Britain. These three were caught but many others are expected to try . ‘If we look at the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy last year compared with the number who have arrived in the first five months of this year, the total has already been exceeded. It was 40,000 or so for the whole of 2013 and it seems like we have nearly reached that point by the end of May.’ The figures are especially worrying as they come ahead of the traditional summer peak months for illegal immigration. Miss Moncure said: ‘There have historically been more arrivals in the summer because of the weather and particularly because the sea is less treacherous for boat crossings from Africa.’ Frontex’s annual report also showed the whole of 2013 saw a 48 per cent rise in illegal migration compared with the previous year, from 72,437 to 107,365. Syrians accounted for almost a quarter of last year’s total - 25,546 - with Eritreans (11,298), Afghans (9,021) and Albanians (9,500) making up the main other nationalities. Detections of Nigerians (3,386), Malians (2,887), Gambians (2,817) and Senegalese (1,643) all quadrupled last year, it added. Gil Arias Fernandez, Frontex’s deputy executive director, also cautioned that large numbers of Syrian and Eritrean refugees are in Libya ready to be illegally smuggled to the European Union. His warning comes in the wake of comments earlier this year by Salah Mazek, the Libyan interior minister, who said that it would think of helping migrants get to Europe unless countries agreed to help his nation. ‘I’m warning the world and Europe in particular – if they do not assume their responsibilities, Libya could facilitate the transit of this flood,’ he said.","140,000 fled Arab Spring; at least  55,000 have arrived already this year .

"The organisers of the newly-formed European Rugby Champions Cup – formerly the Heineken Cup – have promised to deliver more money for England's Aviva Premiership clubs and a more attractive competition for fans. The popular tournament came perilously close to folding last season following a bitter dispute over the distribution of revenue as English clubs refused to continue under terms they saw as being grossly unfair. Wasps, Saracens, Northampton, Bath, Leicester, Harlequins and Sale will take part in new tournament . The tournament was saved following a carefully negotiated settlement between broadcasters BT Sport and Sky. Bruce Craig - one of the executive directors of the newly slimmed down competition which begins a week on Friday – insists the new deal will see more revenue for England’s top clubs. ‘After 19 years we have now reached a position where the clubs are in control of their financial future,’ he said. ‘We have increased the television money (with BT Sport) by 60 per cent to around £17.4million over four years. That’s a significant uplift on the turnover of last year’s competition.’ Teams from England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales will contest European Rugby Champions Cup . There is a new business model with five prospective sponsorship slots and Craig believes it is a matter of time before more big-name companies join Heineken in backing the tournament. He added: ‘It’s a complicated position because the TV rights weren’t in place. They are now. There's been a lot of interest from a lot of big multi-national companies. We are very confident of bringing in more partners over the next 12 months.’ Tournament organisers are also pushing for an end-of-season clash between the winners of the ERCC and the southern hemisphere’s Super Rugby competition. ‘If we get the approval for it we’re not very far away,’ said Aviva Premiership boss Mark McCafferty.

Burgess is not expected to play for Bath before Christmas. Bath boss Mike Ford said: ‘He’s come out of surgery. It’s good, it’s gone well. They’re just sitting around figuring out when he can travel.

"The United States is now the world's biggest supplier of oil overtaking the world number one, Saudi Arabia, according to latest output figures. A surge in US oil output, which includes natural gas liquids and . biofuels, has swelled 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) since 2009. The spike in oil production is the fastest expansion over a four-year period since Saudi Arabia's output surge from 1970-1974, energy analysis firm PIRA said in a statement. Lead supplier: The U.S. has overtaken Saudi Arabia as the world's leading supplier of oil, including crude, natural liquid gas and biofuels. Pictured, a well pumping oil in an field near Ponca City, Oklahoma . It was the latest milestone for the US oil sector caused by the shale revolution, which has upended global oil trade. While still the largest consumer of fuel, the rise of cheap crude available to domestic refiners has turned the United States into a significant exporter of gasoline and distillate fuels. Last month, China surpassed the United States as the largest importer of crude, according to the US government, as the rise of domestic output cuts the U.S. dependence on overseas oil. '(The US) growth rate is greater than the sum of the growth of the next nine fastest growing countries combined and has covered most of the world's net demand growth over the past two years,' PIRA Energy Group wrote. While the U.S. trails several other nations for crude oil production and stockpiles imported crude at the St James Terminal, pictured, near Baton Rouge, La., on the Mississippi River, it has ramped up production of shale . 'The US position as the largest oil supplier in the world looks to be secure for many years,' it added. Total liquids produced by the United States, which PIRA defined broadly to include supplies such as crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and biofuels, should average 12.1 million bpd in 2013, pushing it ahead of last year's No. 1 supplier, Saudi Arabia. Output from the OPEC state also rose last year, but the gains lagged those from the United States, the consultancy said. Shale production remains a controversial industry in the U.S. however, due to fears over the impact on the environment. Pictured, artist and musician Sean Lennon at a gas drilling site in Pennsylvania during an 'Artists Against Fracking' tour of gas drilling sites in upstate New York and Pennsylvania . PIRA said the increase in oil from . shale, which has been centered in areas such as Eagle Ford in Texas and . the Bakken in North Dakota, has seen U.S. supply grow by 1 million bpd . in 2012 and again 2013. The . United States still lagged both Saudi Arabia and Russia in production of . just crude oil by abut 3 million bpd, PIRA noted. Rounding out the top . 10 oil suppliers were China, Canada, UAE, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and . Mexico. Fracking involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into the ground at high pressure to crack shale rock holding oil and gas reserves deep underground. It generates around 43 per cent of oil and 67 per cent of the current natural gas production in the United States. First, engineers drill down through up to 10,000 feet of earth to reach a shallow layer of shale. They then turn their drills sideways to bore thousands of feet horizontally . Then vast amounts of sand and chemicals are pumped into the hole under high pressure - a technique called hydraulic fracturing - which creates fissures in the shale. The fissures allow the gas locked in the shale to escape back along the pipe and up the well to the surface. Fracking in the US first began in 1949. According to the US Department of Energy as of 2013 at least 2million oil and gas wells in the US had been hydraulically fractured. CONCERNS . There are fears, however, that toxic chemicals used in fracking may contaminate underground water supplies, a problem which will only grow as fracking proliferates, environmentalists warn. Case studies have shown that residents living near some fracking sites can ignite water that comes out of their taps. Tests in Wyoming found high levels of methane, ethane, diesel and phenol in water supplies which could have been caused by nearby fracking. Concerns also surround increases in earth tremors, believed to be caused by injecting fluid at high pressure into geological structures.","US oil output has surged in last four years overtaking the world leader .

"Though Michelle Obama is admired for her fashion sense and love of shopping, Chinese authorities made sure one item was out of reach -- T-shirts showing husband Barack Obama in a Mao hat. According to a pool report in The Weekly Standard covering the First Lady's trip to China, 'authorities made sure, for a day, that Mutianyu [a section of the Great Wall] was visibly free of Obama-Mao t-shirts.' Reporters following the First Lady's trip investigated the claim that sales were temporarily suspended -- and several merchants denied selling the shirts when asked. One female merchant, however, offered to sell shirts showing the US President wearing a Mao hat for approximately $60 to one correspondent that she took to the back of her tent. Other merchants reportedly came by and warned the vender to be careful before she eventually put the shirts away. Chinese authorities made sure, for a day, that Mutianyu was visibly free of Obama-Mao t-shirts, like the ones seen in this 2009 file photo, during Michelle Obama's trip to the area . Shirts showing Obama wearing a Mao hat, like the one in this file photo, have been very popular in the past . Michelle Obama and daughters Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12, were left alone to explore the Mutianyu section of the historical landmark in the northern Beijing suburbs though Chinese police officers looked on protectively.

U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters visited the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall in Beijing on Sunday . Mrs Obama has also been photographed at famous spots including the Forbidden City during her trip, which marks the first time a U.S. president's wife has traveled independently to China. The first lady has won compliments for her elegant clothing and her interactions with ordinary people in a country where it is rare to see leaders' spouses or children in public. 'She is very warm and frank, and when she is talking to people she conscientiously listens to what they have to say,' said Wu Qing, a retired professor of Beijing Foreign Studies University who met Mrs Obama on Sunday. 'In China, we usually use weather to express our mood or state of mind, so the fact that the weather has been so nice these few days means she is very welcome in China,' Wu said. Earlier Sunday, Mrs Obama hosted a discussion about education and told Chinese professors, students and parents that she wouldn't have risen to where she was if her parents hadn't pushed for her to get a good education. 'Education is an important focus for me. It's personal, because I wouldn't be where I am today without my parents investing and pushing me to get a good education,' the first lady said. 'My parents were not educated themselves, but one of the things they understood was that my brother and I needed that foundation.' The White House women were left alone to explore the Mutianyu section of the historical landmark in the northern Beijing suburbs . Michelle Obama arrived in Beijing on March 20 with her mother and daughters to kick off a seven-day, three-city tour to focus on education and cultural exchange . She said she and her husband wanted as many young people as possible in the United States and the world to have access to education. She then hosted a roundtable with a handful of Chinese professors, students and parents at an event at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that was attended by new U.S. Ambassador to China Max Baucus and closed to the media. On Saturday, Mrs Obama gave a 15-minute speech at China's prestigious Peking University in which she promoted the free flow of information and freedom of speech, the only time during her trip that she has brought up a contentious issue. China routinely filters out information deemed offensive by the government and silences dissenting voices. Those remarks by Mrs Obama were absent from China's state media but were circulating in social media, where they were widely praised. 'I was very impressed by her speech mentioning freedom of speech,' said Zhang Lifan, an independent historian who said he had read about it in overseas Chinese media. 'Although the Chinese constitution guarantees freedom of speech, Chinese citizens don't really enjoy that right. I think she just reminded China in a polite and mild way that not allowing freedom of speech is not conducive to China.'

A Chinese police woman stands guard from the wall as U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, visit the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall of China in Beijing . The trip, the first time a U.S. president's wife has independently visited China, also has given Mrs Obama an opportunity to engage with President Xi Jinping's wife, Peng Liyuan. On Friday, the two first ladies toured a Beijing high school, where Mrs Obama tried her hand at calligraphy and pingpong and visited with students who had built robots. She also met with Xi that evening. On Tuesday, she will visit a high school in the southwestern city of Chengdu. Students who met Mrs. Obama praised her affability. 'She was so approachable,' said Lu Yuhong, 16, who guided the first lady in writing the Chinese character 'eternal' in calligraphy at the Beijing school. Mu Rongduomijia, 16, said she traveled Saturday from the northeastern city of Dalian to Beijing, hoping to hear Mrs. Obama's speech. Instead, she waited outside for glimpses of the first lady's entourage. 'It was touching to see so many people waiting for her arrival and departure, and that's because of her personal charisma,' Mu said, noting she was impressed with the manners of Malia and Sasha. Mrs Obama, Malia, 15, and Sasha, 12, and her mother, Marian Robinson, who is also traveling with them, will visit the cities of Xi'an and Chengdu before returning to Washington on Wednesday.

"Former sitcom actor Giles Watling has been selected as the Conservative candidate to head off a Ukip advance in Clacton . A former sitcom actor has been selected as the Conservative candidate to head off a Ukip advance in Clacton. Giles Watling, best known for his role in 80s series Bread, about a family living on benefits in Margaret Thatcher’s Britain, will stand against Ukip defector Douglas Carswell in next month’s crunch by-election in the Essex seaside town. Two polls have predicted Mr Carswell, who shocked Westminster with his defection to Ukip, will retain the seat by a landslide. If he becomes the party’s first MP, it would be a major blow to David Cameron’s authority just months before the General Election. Mr Watling, 61, still an actor and director who lives in the Frinton-on-Sea area of the constituency, has been a Tory councillor since 2007. His website says he has two small yachts. He was selected last night in a US-style ‘open primary’ at Clacton town hall in which 240 local residents turned out to vote, beating Sue Lissimore, also a Tory councillor in Colchester. She was the only other candidate to make it through the local party’s election process. Last night Mr Watling said: ‘It’s an honour and great privilege to be selected. ‘I’ve served as a councillor for seven years. I care passionately about this area and we’re going to lift it, we’re going to take it somewhere else. ‘ . Most of the questions from voters, in an hour-long session chaired by LBC presenter Nick Ferrari concerned the EU, immigration and local GP services. Michael Gove, who was knocking doors in the seaside town yesterday with a group of some 30 Tory MPs, said he believed they could win the seat by picking up Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters voting tactically for the Conservatives to keep Ukip out. Mr Gove insisted the result remained ‘all to play for’. Scroll down for video . Mr Watling, best known for his role in 80s series Bread (pictured), about a family living on benefits in Margaret Thatcher's Britain, will stand against Ukip defector Douglas Carswell in next month's crunch by-election in the Essex seaside town . He said: ‘The exciting thing is I don’t think anyone can predict how this election is going to turn out because I’ve found and my colleagues have found, people who voted Green, Labour, Liberal Democrat in the past who are going to vote Conservative because they don’t want Ukip to win’. He did not go as far as encouraging tactical voting, saying he would try to make a positive case, but added: ‘Its a fact that we’ve met people who are switching to the Conservatives for that reason‎. That’s great.‎’ Some senior Conservatives have warned that the by-election could be a costly failure and that they should not run a vigorous campaign to keep it. Mr Carswell, who is popular locally, won 53pc of the vote in 2010, with Labour a distant second on 25pc. Ukip did not field a candidate . Mr Carswell, who is popular locally, won 53pc of the vote in 2010, with Labour a distant second on 25pc. Ukip did not field a candidate. But Mr Gove said MPs would be expected to campaign there and no one would get a ‘free pass’. ’Yes I’ve met people who are going to vote Ukip but I’ve met more people who voted Conservative last time round and feel disappointed that Douglas is not continuing to sit as a Conservative MP so I think it’s all to play for’, he said. At the Ukip headquarters in Clacton yesterday, Gordon Parkin, the party’s regional organiser for the North East who had been campaigning all week said: ‘We’ve had a great response in areas you would expect to be solidly Conservative.’","Tory councillor Giles Watling is best known for his role in 80s series Bread .

"Wasps chief executive Nick Eastwood has told fans dismayed over the imminent £20million move to the Ricoh Arena to 'throw eggs at him' rather than vent their anger at the players. Sunday's Aviva Premiership clash with Bath at Adams Park is the first opportunity supporters will have to protest publicly against the decision to relocate to Coventry. Wasps are prepared for 'all possibilities' as they await the fans' reaction, noting the outrage evident on Twitter, internet forums and blogs has been offset by the lack of complaint made directly to the club. Wasps' James Haskell, Dai Young and Andy Goode during the announcement of a new stadium and sponsor . Coventry City Football Club have only recently returned to the Ricoh Arena after a year away . 'What I'd say to the fans is, the players didn't make the decision, I made the decision,' Eastwood said. 'If there is any adverse reaction, you're just damaging the team because on Sunday we're playing what is probably the best side in the country in Bath. 'So get behind the team and if you want to come and throw eggs at me at the fans' forum, then throw eggs at me. But the players are the wrong people to go after.' Eastwood attended the first of two forums for Wasps' 2,700 season ticket holders on Thursday night with around 400 making it to the event in Marlow. It was explained that the club was losing £3m per year, was being kept afloat by a £10m outlay from owner Derek Richardson and had been one minute away from administration in January 2013. The two main complaints have been the absence of consultation with fans and the location of the new home away from Wasps' traditional roots in London and the south-east. Wasps chief executive urges angry fans to 'throw eggs' at him instead of the players due to the relocation . Wasps are moving away from Adams Park, located in High Wycombe, to further their ambitions as a club . Eastwood insists the confidentiality of negotiations made communication with fans impossible and that all options in the search for a site in and around the M25 had been exhausted. 'It's a heart and heads thing, we absolutely understand that,' Eastwood said. 'That's what being a fan is about - following sport is a completely irrational thing based on emotion as much as logic. 'Once the emotion has played out and logic starts to take over, people will start to understand why we're doing this. 'There were two options - we do this or go bust at some point in the future. Those at the forum understood that. 'There were some angry voices, but people were prepared to listen. 'Not everyone will come with us, but it would be good if we could take 2,000 of our season ticket holders to the Ricoh.' Wasps will decide in the next couple of days when they will make their Ricoh Arena debut, with Castres and London Irish in mid-December the options.

"Juventus will meet Borussia Dortmund's famous 'yellow wall' in three weeks with a narrow advantage after a tap in apiece from Carlos Tevez and Alvaro Morata saw the Serie A leaders escape this Champions League last 16 tie with a slender lead. Jurgen Klopp's rejuvenated team arrived off the back of three consecutive Bundesliga wins, and a composed first-half finish by Marco Reus means they travel home with an away goal in a 2-1 defeat. The Italian champions searched for a third late on but it was in vain as Juventus must travel to Dortmund for the second leg on March 18 at the Westfalenstadion with the tie in the balance.

Juventus players celebrate at the end of the match against Borussia Dortmund as they hold a slender 2-1 advantage . Juventus left Turin with a slender advantage over Borussia Dortmund in a Champions League last 16 tie that remains in the balance . Borussia Dortmund will fancy their chances of scoring against Juventus at home in the second leg on March 18 .

Goals: Reus (18) Referee: Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz (Spain) MOTM: Carlos Tevez . It took just 13 minutes for Juventus to show why they sit nine points ahead of Roma in Serie A. Morata's low drive from the left across Roman Weidenfeller saw the Dortmund goalkeeper spill it into the path of Tevez, and the former Manchester United and City striker's tap in from less than six yards gave them an early 1-0 lead. Tevez celebrated his fourth goal in the Champions League this year with a dummy in his mouth, and Klopp may well have got a sinking feeling. Yet this was not the same Dortmund  that were bottom of Bundesliga on February 6. The German club had managed wins over Stuttgart, Mainz and SC Freiburg ahead of this tie to lift them to 12th, and they were soon gift-wrapped an equaliser. Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini's slip on the edge of the 18-yard box  saw Reus steal the ball with just goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon to beat. The man that rejected Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United by signing a new four-year deal with Dortmund this month gave the Italian the eyes, slotting the ball to the left as the 37-year-old dived to the right. All square after 18 minutes, and an away goal in their back pocket. That chance for Dortmund proved to be a fluke. The Germans kept possession well, tried to press, but Juventus restored order shortly before half-time after Andrea Pirlo was forced off through injury. Tevez held the ball up before feeding Pogba on the left, and the ex-Manchester United midfielder's cross found Morata in space six yards from goal. Like Tevez, the 22-year-old former Real Madrid youth made no mistake. Two shots on target, two counter-attacks, two goals from Juventus during a first half that was largely controlled by the visitors from Germany. It was same again after the break as Klopp's team looked cool in possession but lacked the threatening touch they will need come March 18. Juventus, knowing a 2-1 advantage may not prove enough, could have made it three when Tevez met Stephan Lichtsteiner's cross, but the Argentina international could not make another fool of Weidenfeller.

Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp embraces  Ciro Immobile during the Champions League match . It was Tevez again on 71 minutes that, among a melee of players, tried to find the bottom-left corner from 20 yards, but his shot dragged wide to Klopp's relief. Dortmund, likely to fancy their chances at the Westfalenstadion, were living dangerously. A rare chance for the visitors arrived late on, though Ciro Immobile's strike swerved away from goal and was never troubling Buffon or the 41,182 inside the Juventus Stadium. The Italians, so dominant in Serie A, are not used to seeing play dictated by the away side, and frustration grew as the attacks became more frequent. Roberto Pereyra, Pirlo's replacement in the 37th minute, could have made it 3-1 when he had a one-on-one chance on an angle to the left. He should, at the very least, have hit the target with Weidenfeller approaching, but his shot went wide of the far post and Dortmund survived. And so the tie ended with both sides content with it all to play for in the second leg in three weeks.

"A former IRA member whose taped interviews played a crucial part in the arrest of Gerry Adams has said he fears for his life as tensions grow in Northern Ireland. Anthony McIntyre's series of interviews with former comrades cast the Sinn Fein leader into the frame for one of the most notorious murders of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Adams was arrested on Wednesday in connection with the 1972 death of Jean McConville. The Police Force of Northern Ireland were, in part, compelled to turn their attention to Adams as a result of the Boston College Belfast Project. Mr McIntyre led the team responsible for interviewing dozens of former IRA members, creating an oral history of the Troubles from the mouths of those who took part in violent loyalist and republican armed campaigns. Anthony McIntyre said he fears for his life as tensions mount following the arrest of Gerry Adams. Mr McIntyre was the lead researcher on a project with Boston College, where former IRA members gave testimonies, on the proviso the recordings would not be released until after their deaths . But 10 tapes were secured by the Police Service of Northern Ireland after a landmark U.S. ruling, leaving those who took part fearing for their safety as republicans lash out labeling them 'Boston College Touts' and 'In-former Republicans' in graffiti across west Belfast . Those who opened up and revealed their parts, did so on the proviso that none of the interviews were to be released until after their deaths. But a landmark legal judgement in the US supreme court resulted in Boston College being forced to hand over 10 taped interviews. The tapes included information about the kidnapping, killing and burial of Ms McConville. They are believed to name Adams as an IRA commander involved in the decision that she be killed and secretly buried for being an informer. Adams denies any involvement in the murder and says he was never a member of the IRA. His arrest led to growing tensions in Northern Ireland this week. His detention threatens to undermine his party Sinn Fein's support for policing in the region. That threat could endanger the power-sharing settlement in Northern Ireland, it is feared. Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was arrested on Wednesday over the kidnapping, killing and burial of Jean McConville in 1972 . The only photograph Mrs McConville's (left) family have of her, after her abduction and murder by the IRA 25 years ago. She is pictured with her children Robert, Helen McKendry, Arthur jnr, as well as their father Arthur (bottom right) In a highly inflammatory outburst, his . deputy Martin McGuinness threatened to withdraw republican support for . the police if the Sinn Fein president had been charged with ordering the . abduction and killing of Jean McConville in 1972. The move would have devastating consequences for security and stability in the province, where police officers were routinely shot by IRA terrorists before the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Mr McIntyre told the Observer's Henry MacDonald: 'The hate has been ratcheted up since the Adams' arrest.' Martin McGuiness threatened to withdraw republican support for the police if Adams had been charged with ordering the abduction and killing of Mrs McConville in 1972 . He is no stranger to protests outside . his home. Following the publication of Voices From The Grave by . journalist Ed Moloney in 2010 he said excrement was smeared across the . house next door to his. The book included a tape from the former hunger striker Brendan Hughes. It included allegations that Adams gave the order that Ms McConville 'disappear' for allegedly being a British army agent. Hughes also claimed that Adams set up a covert IRA unit called the Unknowns, given the task of weeding out informers during the 1970s. In the face of mounting tension Mr McIntyre has been critical of Boston College, claiming he feels they were not fully invested in protecting those who agreed to take part in the controversial project. He said: 'Its lack of resolve has put both me and the research participants in a position that is close to precarious.' He said Mr McGuiness has accused the participants of working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, while Sinn Fein's former publicity director Danny Morrison has reportedly been labelling them informers. Police officers used a UK-U.S. Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, to argue they were entitled to examine those tapes which discussed Ms McConville's murder. A Boston College spokesman said they did all they could to oppose the subpoena. He said: 'Once the U.S. federal courts issued their final decision, Boston College had no choice but to comply.'","Anthony McIntyre said he is concerned for his life as tensions grow .

"Glass half full: Britons are cutting down on their drinking, according to industry figures (file photo) Britons have dramatically reduced how much they drink, cutting back over the last decade by the equivalent of 110 glasses of wine a year or 73 pints of beer. Drinking – at home as well as in pubs and clubs – has fallen by some 18 per cent since a peak in 2004, against a background of rising prices driven by inflation-busting increases in tax and duty, according to industry figures. The fall calls into question the image of Britons as a nation of heavy drinkers and lager louts. Indeed, the official handbook from the British Beer & Pub Association points out that UK drinking is an average of 25 per cent below the level in Germany and 15 per cent less than in France. The fall appears to be part of a major cultural shift that has also delivered drops in alcohol-fuelled crime and vandalism. The BBPA figures show drinking peaked in 2004 with annual consumption of 9.5 litres of pure alcohol. This is equivalent to 404 pints of 4 per cent beer or 604 small (125ml) glasses of wine. There were falls in seven of the following nine years with the total down to 7.8 litres in 2013. That is equivalent to 330.8 pints of beer or 494.4 glasses of wine. The figures, which use information from HMRC and the Office for National Statistics, cover pubs as well as shop-bought drinks. While the trends point towards a permanent change in attitudes for the research also shows that today’s teenagers are taking a far more adult approach to drinking than earlier generations. In England in 2013, some 39 per cent of 11-15 year olds had never drunk alcohol, which was sharply down compared to 43 per cent in 2012 and 61 per cent in 2001. Among those youngsters who had a drink in the last week, average weekly consumption was 8.2 units, which is equivalent to less than three pints of beer and is well down on the 12.5 units in 2012. The fall in total consumption will be one of the factors behind the crisis facing the nation’s pubs with evidence showing that they are closing at a record rate of 31 a week, despite efforts to build trade by offering more and better quality food. Change: The fall appears to be part of a major cultural shift that includes drops in alcohol-fuelled crime . The BBPA figures show drinking peaked in 2004 with annual consumption of 9.5 litres of pure alcohol, which is only a small proportion of the beer or wine in each glass. The 9.5 litres is equivalent to 404 pints of 4per cent beer or 604 small (125ml) glasses of wine - 11.6 a week. There were falls in seven of the following nine years with the total down to an average of 7.8 litres in 2013. That is the equivalent to 330.8 pints of beer or 494.4 glasses of wine, which works out at around 110 fewer a year. Price is likely to be major factor, for the cost of drink in Britain is among the highest in Europe after successive governments increased duty and tax at above the rate of inflation under pressure from doctors and the police as part of a policy to tackle binge drinking. The current Chancellor, George Osborne, has rowed back a little on this by making cuts to beer duty. However, the UK still has among the highest drink taxes in Europe, which work out at around 53p on a pint of beer or £2.36 on a bottle of wine. The BBPA’s chief executive, Brigid Simmonds, said: ‘Despite the recent cuts in beer duty, Britain’s consumers are still subject to some of the highest tax rates for beer in the EU. Let’s hope we see another tax cut next year.’ Shift in opinions: The drinks industry claims a more responsible approach to selling and marketing drinks . Earlier this year, the Government implemented a new policy requiring stores to stop using cut-price alcohol to tempt customers through the doors by introducing a new regime banning them from selling drink at less than the cost of duty plus VAT. The drinks industry claims a more responsible approach to selling and marketing drinks, which was triggered over the rise of alcopops in the mid-1990s, has helped reduce problem drinking among the young. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the sugary and powerful drinks like Hooper’s Hooch and Two Dogs triggered a wave of underage drinking. However, sales have since collapsed. At the same time, the industry is now promoting a raft of lower alcohol options. For example, Jacob’s Creek and Blossom Hill are marketing wines with 5.5 per cent alcohol, while the Foster’s Radler and Carling Zest, which are just 2 per cent, are selling well. Miss Simmonds said: ‘It’s great to see trends in alcohol harms coming down, showing that investment by the industry and partnership with Government, through targeted measures, is having a positive impact.’ The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has sounded the alarm over pub closures and has called for urgent changes to planning rules to help protect what are important community buildings. Specifically, it wants to make it harder for supermarkets to buy and convert pubs into convenience stores. Spokesman, Tom Stainer, said: ‘Popular and profitable pubs are being left vulnerable by gaps in English planning legislation as pubs are increasingly being targeted by those wishing to take advantage of the absence of proper planning control. ‘It is utterly perverse that developers are able to demolish or convert a pub into a convenience store or many other uses without any requirement to apply for planning permission. 'It is wrong that communities are left powerless when a popular local pub is threatened with demolition or conversion into a Tesco store.’","Figures released in annual handbook of the British Beer & Pub Association .

"Together: Francois Hollande (left) and Valerie Trierweiler (right) last year, before their split . Valerie Trierweiler has threatened to publish her former partner François Hollande’s private text messages to her to prove he had made fun of the poor, it was revealed today. The jilted 49-year-old author has accused the French President of disliking the poor in a tell-all book called Merci Pour Ce Moment (Thank You For This Moment), which its publisher said is one of the decade's top best-sellers. And, according to The Sunday Times, Miss Trierweiler has told friends of her willingness to make public his texts, to prove in court his mockery of ‘les sans dents’ (‘the toothless ones’) - a phrase he allegedly used to label the poor. In her book, she said of him: ‘He presented himself as a man who disliked the rich. In reality, the president doesn't like the poor. In private, this man - the left-winger - calls them “the toothless” and is so pleased at how funny he is.’ The Socialist ended his seven-year relationship with Miss Trierweiler after his affair with actress Julie Gayet, 42, came to light in January. Earlier this month at the Nato summit in Newport, south Wales, Mr Hollande insisted he was entirely devoted to helping the poor. He said: ‘I won't allow to be brought into question something I have stood for all my life... and notably the human relationship I have with the weakest, the most modest, the humblest, the poorest, because I am here to serve them and they are my reason for existence.’ Mr Hollande, 60, has also denied her claims that he called the poor 'les sans-dents'. But Miss Trierweiler’s book, which shot to the top of the Amazon.fr French bestseller list and was quickly out of stock in many bookstores, has been further undermining the President's image. Very popular read: Miss Trierweiler's book shot to the top of the Amazon.fr French bestseller list . This has already been damaged by broken promises to turn around joblessness and the stagnating economy. And last Thursday, a poll showed nearly two thirds of French voters would like to see their deeply unpopular Mr Hollande resign before the end of his term in 2017. 'He presented himself as a man who disliked the rich. In reality, the president doesn't like the poor. In private, this man - the left-winger - calls them “the toothless” and is so pleased at how funny he is' Valerie Trierweiler . The IFOP/Le Figaro magazine survey showed that 62 per cent of respondents wanted him to quit, three years before the next scheduled presidential election. A quarter of Socialist voters said they wanted to see the resignation of Mr Hollande, who is the most unpopular French president since the Second World War. And earlier this month, a junior trade minister resigned just nine days after his appointment in a cabinet reshuffle after it emerged he had not paid income taxes for three years.","Valerie Trierweiler accused French President of disliking poor in her book .

"Aitor Karanka slammed Middlesbrough’s ‘worst’ display of the season – despite the victory which got their promotion push back on track. ‘It was one of the worst performances since I came here, I did not recognise some of my players,’ said the Spaniard, whose side responded to Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at home to Leeds to stay within two points of leaders Derby. ‘Four days ago we played very well and lost. Today, we played very badly and won. I prefer this, of course. But we had a lack of ambition. My players normally have personality and character.'

Bolton boss Neil Lennon saw the Trotters lose for the fifth time in their last six outings and was surprised by Karanka’s comments. ‘If that’s the worst they’ve played then they must have played some pretty good stuff earlier in the season,’ he said. Ghanaian winger Albert Adomah – without a goal since October – fired what proved to be the winner on 34 minutes. It could have been a far more comprehensive success had Chelsea loanee Patrick Bamford not spurned a series of opportunities which came his way. The first of those arrived when he ballooned over from Adam Reach’s delivery and he had the chance to make amends when Grant Leadbitter sprung him clear soon after. His low poke, however, was flipped over the crossbar by the instinctive arm of Ben Amos. But the Manchester United goalkeeper – making his first start for the Trotters – was soon beaten. Lee Tomlin was the inspiration with a pass which defined defence-splitting and Adomah did the rest with a cool finish for his fourth of the season. Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka labelled the win the 'worst' display of their season thus far . Bamford, though, was left entering the break wondering just how he hadn’t bagged a first-half hat-trick when he fired over from point-blank range in stoppage-time. The 21-year-old didn’t fare much better after half-time and swept wide from 12 yards after good work by defender George Friend. Adomah’s earlier goal, however, ensured Bamford’s blushes were spared.

"Bec McDonald was due to fly home from a holiday in Europe on MH17 last week . An Australian student who was due to fly home on MH17 and changed her booking at the last moment has spoken about her terrifying near-miss. Bec McDonald, 20, from Geelong in Victoria was on a month-long Contiki tour through Europe that ended in Amsterdam last week. The Deakin University psychology student was booked to return to Melbourne on Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was believed to have been blown out of the sky last Thursday by a surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 passengers and crew. Days before the flight, Ms McDonald's brother, who is a travel agent, suggested she take the free connecting flight offered by Contiki to London, from where she could get a cheaper flight to Melbourne. Ms McDonald flew home from London on Thursday at the same time MH17 was believed to be shot down over Ukraine. She learnt of the tragedy during her stopover in Kuala Lumpur. While she was waiting to board her flight from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne, Ms McDonald's brother messaged her to inform her that the plane that had been shot down was the one she had originally been booked on. 'I didn't realise the gravity of it until I got home and my family were really overwhelmed to see me. It was definitely scary,' Ms McDonald told MailOnline. 'I was quite scared to get on a plane normally. I've never flown more than five hours before and I was by myself. 'Everyone says, ""You'll be fine, it's so unlikely that anything will happen."" And to know that happened while I was in the air, it was pretty scary.' Scroll down for video . The 20-year-old student changed her flight just days before she was due to return to Melbourne on the plane, which is believed to have been shot down over Ukraine killing all 298 passengers and crew . Ms McDonald's stepmother passed away late last month while she was travelling. Ms McDonald said she couldn't imagine the impact it would have had on her family if she had been on board MH17 . Ross McDonald, Bec's father, said he was 'very emotional and shaking' when he saw news of the plane crash in the middle of the night and immediately got up to check his daughter's travel documents to make sure she was safe. The fear was even more pronounced for Mr McDonald, because he had lost his wife, Bec's stepmother, late last month while Bec was overseas. 'It's been a tough period of time for us,' he told MailOnline. '[Bec and I] are very close and I was looking forward to her coming home and to find out she was almost on that flight was overwhelming. 'What should have been moments of relief turned to thoughts of ""What if?"" and ""What would that mean for our family?"" 'I hate to have thought what the outcome would have been.' Ms McDonald said she had debated going to Europe, given her stepmother's condition, but her stepmother had told her to go and live her life to the full. She said that she felt someone, perhaps her stepmother, was watching over her. 'Someone's got to be looking after me. What if I did get on that plane? Someone's guiding me, I know that sounds corny, but that's how I feel,' said Ms McDonald. Ross and Bec McDonald said their hearts go out to the families and friends of those on board the flight. 'I can't even begin to imagine how they feel,' said Ms McDonald. 'It would just be so devastating and I just wish them so much love and support. 'It's just horrible, it shouldn't happen.' Ross McDonald said he was 'very emotional and shaking' when he learnt of the crash and immediately looked up his daughter's travel documents to make sure she was no longer booked on MH17 . Bec McDonald (centre front in white shirt) posted a photo of her 'Contiki family' just before boarding her flight home thanking them for the 'experience of a lifetime' and for supporting her through a tough time .","Bec McDonald, 20, was booked to fly home from Amsterdam on MH17 .

"England’s Young Lions started the UEFA Development Tournament with a disappointing defeat as Switzerland fought back from two goals down to win at St George’s Park. Steve Cooper’s charges were playing the first of three matches at the national team’s Staffordshire HQ this week with Slovakia and France still to come. And despite Chelsea’s Martell Taylor-Crossdale and Newcastle United’s Mackenzie Heaney putting them into a very strong position, Swiss superiority ultimately told. Cendrim Kameraj (centre) celebrates after scoring the winning goal for Switzerland U16 against England U16 . Mackenzie Heaney scored England's second, and it looked like the Young Lions would go on to win the game . Heaney (centre) celebrates with his England team-mates after his goal at St George's Park on Monday . England U16 (4-3-3): Taye Ashby-Hammond (Fulham); Dujon Sterling (Chelsea), Edward Francis (Manchester City), Japhet Tanganga (Tottenham Hotspur), Vashon Neufville (West Ham United); Andre Dozzell (Ipswich Town), Callum Slattery (Southampton) (c), Mason Mount (Chelsea); Keanen Bennetts (Arsenal), Martell Taylor-Crossdale (Chelsea), Mackenzie Heaney (Newcastle United) Subs: Trevoh Chalobah (Chelsea), Sadou Diallo (Manchester City), Jonathan Leko (WBA), Matthew Yates (Derby County), Lewis Thompson (Manchester United), Jaden Brown (Chelsea), Okera Simmonds (Liverpool), Anthony Scully (West Ham United), Tyrese Campbell (Manchester City) Switzerland U16: Hunn, Herter, Ribeiro, Hajrizi, Ndau (c), Pusic, Blasucci, Bajrami, Zeqiri, Asllani, Kameraj . Subs: Schadeli, Da Costa, Baratovic, Cucinelli, Eberle, Morandi, Saliji, Toma, Bertelli . The under 16s represent the bottom rung of the England development ladder and for many of these schoolboys it was a proud moment as they pulled on the Three Lions jersey for the first time. And it didn’t take long for them to click as Taylor-Crossdale produced an emphatic close range finish to give them a fourth-minute lead. Although England were ahead, it quickly became apparent that Switzerland were an accomplished passing outfit and they tested home goalkeeper Taye Hammond-Ashby of Fulham on several occasions in the first-half. But against the run of play, England doubled their lead when Heaney curled in a splendid far corner effort that goalkeeper Lars Hunn couldn’t get a glove to. As half-time approached, the hosts were unable to hang on any longer and Switzerland hit them with a double blow. First, Cendrim Kameraj halved the deficit with a header before Andi Zeqiri levelled with a firm low strike. Chelsea's Martell Taylor-Crossdale opened the scoring for England, but they could not hold on to their lead .

"It seems that Urban Meyer's good luck has finally run out. A little over a month after leading the Ohio State Buckeyes to the national championship, Meyer is stuck at sea on a cruise ship with thousands of college football fans. This as he was the guest of honor at an annual cancer fundraiser. The ship was forced to circle the waters for 24 hours before docking in Tampa Tuesday night. Scroll down for video .

The Royal Caribbean ship Brilliance of the Seas was expected to dock on Monday, but due to severe fog it had been forced to wait in the waters off Florida as Tampa had to close its port. This however did not seem to be bother any of the 2,160 guests on board. 'We’re all Buckeyes, we’re all from Ohio,' Lanne Bennett told ABC News. 'We’ve weathered worse things.' She also added that the trip has 'been absolutely amazing.' There is certainly plenty to do on board as well, with six pools for guests, 16 bars and lounges and over 100 spa treatments. Food and water are also not a problem, as the ship has plenty, and should anything happen the captain would be able to bring the ship to another port. Guests will be able to spend the night on board Tuesday and leave Wednesday. This comes just one year after 689 of 4,237 passengers and crew became very ill while aboard the Royal Caribbean ship Explorer of the Seas due to an outbreak of norovirus. That ship docked two days early, and guests were given 50percent of their money back. Brilliance of the Seas was previously in the news when in 2005 a guest is believed to have fallen off of one of the balconies and died, a case which the company settled for $1million.","Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer and thousands of Buckeye football fans are stuck at sea off the coast of Florida .

"Exeter  wing Jack Nowell will return to England’s starting XV in Dublin on Sunday at the expense of Jonny May. May was released back to Gloucester on Tuesday night, paying the price for a glaring lapse against Italy at Twickenham when he failed to capitalise on a three-on-one overlap. Nowell has been operating at outside centre for Exeter and was in electric form as the Chiefs swept to victory at Harlequins last weekend. He was a fixture in the senior team during last year’s RBS 6 Nations and scored a maiden Test try against Italy in Rome. But that was his last appearance as injuries checked his progress. He damaged a shoulder and, during the enforced break, had surgery on a knee problem. Exeter wing Jack Nowell will return to England’s starting XV against Ireland in Dublin on Sunday . Stuart Lancaster's England squad warm-up at their training base at Pennyhill Park on Tuesday . The England forward pack hit the scrum machine as forwards coach Graham Rowntree watches on . Rowntree brings his pack into a huddle for a team talk as they squad continue their preparations for Dublin . England have started to use the choke tackle more often with flanker James Haskell leading from the front . Nowell, 21, is likely to be part of a back-three unit showing two changes as Alex Goode is on standby to take over from Mike Brown if, as feared, the Quins full-back fails to recover from concussion in time. Chris Pennell of Worcester is another full-back in a trimmed-down squad of 26 but he is there merely to gain experience. Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood and Geoff Parling have all returned to training after injuries but have been sent back to their clubs to play in the Aviva Premiership. With Newcastle tighthead prop Kieran Brookes nursing a hip strain, Bath’s Henry Thomas is poised to take over as a replacement. Head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘Preparation has gone well. We’ve had to make some tough decisions but it’s a good position to be in. Those players going back to their clubs have another big weekend ahead to lay down a marker for later in the tournament.’ Rowntree pinpointed hooker Rory Best and lock Paul O'Connel as key 'chokers' in the Irish team . The choke tackle involves a defender wrapping his arms around the neck and chest of the ball-carrier — often one who is isolated and too upright — and preventing him from going to ground. With assistance from team-mates, this can lead to the ball being stripped or a maul forming, which can produce a penalty to the defending team if the opposition collapse it in their bid retrieve the ball. If a maul forms and the ball doesn’t emerge, the defending team will win the put-in at the subsequent scrum. Meanwhile England plan to use Ireland’s favourite weapon — the choke tackle — against their rivals on Sunday. While the Irish long ago mastered the art of holding up isolated runners to win turnovers and penalties, now England have acquired the knack, led by the recalled Wasps captain in their back row, James Haskell. The order from Lancaster and his assistants will be to carry on choking, but not to overplay it. ‘It’s a powerful tool if a team can do it well — stand you up there and quickly get mass under the body,’ said forwards coach Graham Rowntree. ‘We’ve done it more of late. We’ve got a couple of personnel in our team now who are good at it and maybe weren’t in our team six to 10 months ago. But it’s been around for six years. You’ve got to employ it at the right time. We encourage our guys that they can choke, but they have to do it appropriately, at the right time. If you do it wrong you just get danced back for five metres, it goes into a ruck and you’ve lost territory. But if you get it right, it’s a hell of a tactic.’ Jack Nowell is choke tackled by Dave Kearney (left) and Gordon D'Arcy at Twickenham last season . Best puts in a crunching hit on France scrum half Rory Kockott during his side's victory against France . O'Connell (centre) worked with Rowntree during the 2009 and 2013 British and Irish Lions tours . Rowntree initially refused to identify the leading English exponents of the ploy but eventually mentioned Haskell, adding: ‘It’s not limited to him. Billy Twelvetrees won a crucial penalty at the end of the Wales game with the same tactic.’ Rowntree pointed to three key Irish chokers — two of whom are available to face England. ‘For Ireland, Best, Heaslip and O’Connell are all good at it,’ he said, before paying tribute to the young England lock who will go toe to toe with Paul O’Connell: George Kruis of Saracens. Injuries to Lawes and Joe Launchbury left the coaches with a problem but Kruis has been the solution, first in the autumn and lately in victories over Wales and Italy. He is making a powerful case for a World Cup place. George Kruis has been outstanding for England following injuries to Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury . Kruis, 25, revealed that when O’Connell was leading the Lions in South Africa six years ago he was cheering from the stands as a teenage prospect on a playing stint in Cape Town. Asked if he ever imagined that one day he would find himself up against O’Connell, Kruis said: ‘It was a very distant dream. I was rather underweight and not the best rugby player. I weighed less than our backs coach.’ A notable victory was secured by campaigners in the House of Lords on Tuesday that will curb online ticket touting ahead of the Rugby World Cup and the Ashes series this summer. Proposals for a provision in the Consumer Act — to ensure that tickets traded online include block, row and seat number plus the face value — had previously been rejected by the House of Commons. But the persistence of the House of Lords, backed by cricket’s ECB and rugby’s RFU ruling bodies, led to the Government’s capitulation on the issue yesterday. The new regulations will be in place in time for the start of the Ashes series in July.","Jonny May was released back to Gloucester on Tuesday night .

"Luis Suarez looked like a man determined to settle a score at the Etihad. The former Liverpool striker struck a first-half brace on his return to England to guide Barcelona to a 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium in the Champions League last 16 first-leg. Perhaps Suarez was fired up after reading a feature in the Manchester City match programme on Tuesday, which labelled the Uruguayan Barcelona's 'dogsbody' Â and someone 'who does the donkey work.' Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez scored a brace to help secure Barcelona a vital away win in Manchester . The piece in the City programme acknowledged the sublime Barcelona attack that was visiting the Etihad but couldn't resist mocking Suarez, who is less of a central figure at the Nou Camp with stars Lionel Messi and Neymar leading the attack. 'It's a measure of the task facing City's defence tonight that Luis Suarez is the one who does the donkey work in Barcelona's front three,' said the piece. 'He is very much the dogsbody in this trio of artful dodgers,' continued the feature in reference to Messi and Neymar's apparent superiority.

Manchester City chief Manuel Pellegrini said: ‘It was a very important save and it was a very unnecessary penalty. ‘It gives us more chance to win in Barcelona because 3-1 would have been a very difficult score to try to erase. ‘It is important for this team to continue in the Champions League as far as possible. ‘It is possible for us to demonstrate we can compete at this level.

Messi was brought down by Pablo Zabaleta but was unable to beat the formidable Hart, who denied the away side on many occasions . City will be without Gael Clichy, tormented throughout by Messi, for the second leg in the Nou Camp after he was sent off for two reckless bookings. They will need to score twice to stand any chance of progressing to the quarter-final and one bookmaker had odds of 1/25 against City getting through to the next round. Pellegrini added: ‘Barcelona managed to get through the game without committing errors. We committed mistakes. Until the goal the game was quite even. Gael Clichy was tormented throughout by Messi and was sent off for two reckless challenges which will see him miss the second leg . Hart celebrates after saving Messi's penalty and seeing the rebound bounce wide of the post to keep City in the tie . ‘With the way we play, I think we can do it.

We finished with the penalty and Joe saved very well. ‘In the first half we couldn’t put three passes together and there was a bit of confusion. ‘We committed a very soft error for the first goal.

"Davis Love III will captain the United States Ryder Cup team at Hazeltine in 2016, the PGA of America has announced. Love was the skipper in 2012 when the USA threw away a 10-4 lead on Saturday afternoon to lose 14.5-13.5 to Europe in what became known as the 'Miracle at Medinah'. And he has now been handed a second chance at the job as the Americans attempt to avoid a fourth consecutive defeat following their 16.5-11.5 loss at Gleneagles in September. Love's first act as captain at a press conference in Florida was to appoint Tom Lehman as one of his four vice-captains. Davis Love III will captain the United States Ryder Cup team at Hazeltine in 2016 . Lehman, the 1996 Open champion, captained the United States in 2006 as Europe claimed an 18.5-9.5 win at the K Club. 'I am thrilled to be the Team USA Captain and represent our country as we work to win back the Ryder Cup,' said Love. 'It is a great honour to be in the position to help build the team, but our mission doesn't end there. What we accomplish in 2016 at Hazeltine must serve as the foundation for future USA Ryder Cup teams. 'As the son of a PGA Professional and representing all PGA members, I am very proud to accept this responsibility and eager to get started.' He added: 'I am very pleased that Tom Lehman has accepted to serve as a vice-captain, bringing his outstanding experience and the respect of all players to our next Team,' said Love. 'Tom has been a trusted friend who I can call upon to provide valuable advice as we go about preparing Team USA.' Love was the skipper in 2012 when the USA threw away a 10-4 lead on Saturday afternoon to lose  to Europe . Love was part of an 11-man task force charged to look into all aspects of the United States' approach to the Ryder Cup after they suffered an eighth defeat in the last 10 contests in Scotland. The founding of the task force was sparked by Phil Mickelson's public criticism of 2014 captain Tom Watson immediately after the defeat in Scotland . Mickelson, who was left out of a full day's play for the first time in his Ryder Cup career on the Saturday, said: 'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups, and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.' That seemed to point to a second spell as captain for successful 2008 skipper Paul Azinger, with three-time Presidents Cup-winning captain Fred Couples also a strong contender. Love was not being talked about in the same terms initially but now becomes the eighth man to captain the United States on multiple occasions, joining Walter Hagen, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Burke, Jack Nicklaus and Watson. The 1997 US PGA champion was a popular captain in 2012 despite the defeat in Chicago which saw the home team seemingly cruising to victory after a day and a half. Love's first act as captain was to appoint Tom Lehman as one of his four vice-captains . But Ian Poulter's inspired run of five consecutive birdies on Saturday evening helped the Europeans take the final two points of the day and eight and a half points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday gave Jose Maria Olazabal's men a remarkable victory. Love will go head-to-head with Darren Clarke, who was announced as Europe's captain last week ahead of Miguel Angel Jimenez and Thomas Bjorn. Reports emerged before Clarke's appointment that Love was due to be handed a second chance at the captaincy and, speaking before the American decision was confirmed, Clarke expressed his delight at the prospect of facing his friend. 'If so that would be wonderful,' he said. 'We've played many practice rounds together and are very good friends. He is a gentleman and there isn't a nicer man in our sport.' Love is a 20-time winner on the PGA Tour and played on six consecutive Ryder Cup teams from 1993 to 2002, holing the winning putt at the Belfry on his debut and also tasting victory at Brookline in 1999.","Davis Love III will captain United States team during the 2016 Ryder Cup .

"Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore and FA chairman Greg Dyke will fight to save England’s Christmas football programme when the World Cup moves to winter in Qatar in 2022. But the plan now mooted by FIFA’s task force will wreck the global club calendar for years. The most severely disrupted season for the English game will be the 2022-23 campaign, but it will not be the only one with fixtures shunted around. The 2021-22 and 2023-24 seasons will also be affected and some 50 other leagues will pay a price for FIFA’s discredited decision to award the world’s greatest tournament to a desert nation that is too hot to stage it in the summer. FIFA President Sepp Blatter names Qatar as the winning hosts of 2022 at a conference in Zurich in 2010 . Qatar's delegate party celebrate being awarded the  2022 World Cup back in December 2010 . Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore is among those on the World Cup task force . October, November and December are the only months the 2022 World Cup can be held, according to a graphic provided by the FIFA task force . The FIFA task force has recommend that the 2022 World Cup be held later in the year, when temperatures are lower. JUNE . Average min temperature - 29C . Average max temperature - 42C . JULY .

Average max temperature - 25C . *Figures from worldweatheronline.com . Scudamore on Tuesday voiced his fears that a tournament pencilled in from November 26 to December 23, 2022 will devastate ‘the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and New Year programme that season’. Football across all levels in England could grind to a halt for around 20 days so as not to distract from the World Cup, even at clubs without players involved. Scudamore added: ‘We are extremely disappointed with the recommendation to move the 2022 FIFA World Cup to a November and December schedule. It is clear that the views of the European leagues, along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected, have not been given serious consideration. ‘We will consult our clubs, other stakeholders in English football and other leagues before deciding on what, if any, further action might be appropriate or worthwhile.’ The most probable scenario is that England’s top-flight clubs will play an 11-month season from mid-July 2022 to June 2023, breaking for two months for players to prepare and compete in the World Cup. November and December will probably have no top-flight domestic football. A computer-generated image of the 'Education City' stadium to be built in Doha for the World Cup . FA Cup replays that season will probably also have to be scrapped to ease fixture congestion and two-legged ties in the League Cup will likely be reduced to one match. FIFA will ratify the dates next month, with Scudamore and Dyke sure to be lobbying hard to save part of that season’s festive programme. Former Manchester United captain and current England coach Gary Neville was a rare voice in saying that football had to ‘get over’ the disruption that the winter switch will cause. Here is a computer-generated image of how the main stadium in Doha is set to look for the World Cup in 2022 . He said: ‘You’re making the World Cup sound like the Sherpa Vans Trophy. The World Cup’s the World Cup, it’s hardly a tin-pot competition. The Premier League will be disrupted for a year, every 24 or 28 years, for a continent to have a World Cup. We’ve got to get over it. Football’s a world game.’ Neville added that it was ‘shoddy’ that the decision to move the tournament ‘has taken so long and been a shambles of a process. But I’ve been to the Middle East a number of times and they deserve a World Cup. FIFA have now got to the right place, to make allowances for a continent to host a World Cup in normal heat.’ A switch to November and December 2022 had been virtually inevitable because FIFA’s task force, headed by Asia confederation head Sheik Salman bin Ebrahim Al-Khalifa of Bahrain, had little room for manoeuvre. A computer-generated image of the 'Al Khor' stadium to be built in Doha for the World Cup . A computer-generated image of the 'Sports City' stadium to be built in Doha for the World Cu . January and February 2022 were ruled out to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympics, then the month of Ramadan precluded the event, and May to September is too hot. ‘Some people have concerns, but whatever decision you’re going to take will have some questions about it,’ Sheik Salman said. ‘But we need to look at the overall benefit for everybody.’ Dyke said November and December are the ‘best of the bad options’, adding: ‘We cannot possibly play in the summer in Qatar.’ He then blasted FIFA’s decision to award the event to a nation incapable of staging it during the period for which it bid to host it. ‘The best option would be to not hold it in Qatar,’ he said. ‘But we are now beyond that. You might be able to keep the disruption to one season if you start earlier and end later but it’s going to be tough.’ The FIFA task force members, including Richard Scudamore, in discussion on Monday in Doha . Hassan Al Thawadi, head of the 2022 organising committee, speaks to the media on Tuesday . FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke addresses the media ahead of the meeting in Monday . We are extremely disappointed with the FIFA Task Force recommendation to move the 2022 FIFA World Cup to a November and December schedule. It is clear that the views of the European leagues, along with the numerous other competitions globally that will be negatively affected, have not been given serious consideration throughout this process. The prevailing view from the leagues has been that displacing the 2022 World Cup significantly from the original summer dates disproportionately impacts the sporting integrity of our competitions. Our particular concern is that a FIFA World Cup that finishes late in December could result in damaging one of the English game’s great traditions and attractions, with the removal of the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and New Year fixture programme that season. Clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further, but first we will consult with our clubs, other stakeholders in English football, and other leagues before deciding on what, if any, further action might be appropriate or worthwhile. The Chalifa International stadium in the Aspire Zone in Doha will be used at the World Cup . An open-air Doha stadium built with zero carbon, solar powered cooling technology to combat high heat . When will the 2022 World Cup in Qatar run? The exact dates have yet to be confirmed but ‘late November to late December’ 2022 has been recommended by FIFA’s task force, with Saturday November 26 to Friday December 23 mooted as a possible 28-day slot. A final decision is expected on March 20. A World Cup final near to Christmas sounds crazy... It would mean travel chaos over an already tricky holiday time. There is sure to be lobbying to play the final earlier, perhaps on Sunday December 18, which is also Qatar National Day. What’s the problem with having an earlier final? Whenever it’s played, domestic seasons will need to stop weeks before the first match to allow squads to prepare. Typically this run-up period is a month. It will need to be a minimum of two weeks. A World Cup ending on December 23 would mean domestic competitions breaking in early November. Any earlier and football might have to stop as early as October. What happens to the 2022-23 Premier League season? Two months of club football will be ‘displaced’, and if the period cleared for the World Cup is as mooted, that will essentially be November and December. That would mean 10 Premier League games and three Champions League games being played earlier or later. So, for example, the Premier League season may have to start a month earlier (mid-July 2022) and finish a month later (mid-June 2023). The seasons before and after would also need to shift to accommodate this. There will be disruption, to about 50 leagues, for about three years. What about the Football League? Club football across England would almost certainly be suspended for a chunk of the World Cup as FIFA insist on a ‘blackout’ of about 20 days when no attention is taken from their showpiece. How will the fixture congestion affect domestic action? FA Cup replays could be one victim for at least a season. Premier League clubs might play fewer League Cup games. Some European competition fixtures will need to be rescheduled. The Africa Cup of Nations due for January 2023 may have to be shelved. Will the move to winter hit clubs in the pocket? Almost certainly in terms of missing out on the holiday-season bonanza of capacity crowds, but also untold millions if TV companies bid less for disrupted domestic seasons. Arguably hardest hit will be smaller Football League clubs, reliant on turnstile cash, who are forced to go without games — and income — for weeks. What do Sky and BT Sport think? Both broadcasters declined to comment. But by 2022-23, we will be two more Premier League TV deals down the line after the £5billion extravaganza just agreed. Who knows who will have UK live rights then? Maybe beIN Sports… based in Qatar! You’re not serious? That’s what several hundred million fans said when it was announced in December 2010 that Qatar would host 2022. Rule out nothing, no matter how seemingly ridiculous or outrageous. Is there any chance this ALL won’t even happen? Very little. And when FIFA announce a world-record sponsorship deal with Qatar Airways later this year, as insiders expect, none at all.

That offer, which was made five years ago this week, was not the first he received to leave Liverpool, nor was it the last, but it illustrated how the powerhouse clubs in Europe viewed him - a big-game player who produced the big moments exactly when they were needed. Of course, there was never any chance of Stevie going to Madrid, but had he done so it would have been impossible to begrudge him the opportunity. Those with his quality deserve to perform on the biggest stage and deserve to have trophy cabinets that are full to the brim. Had he chosen to leave, he could have doubled his collection of 11 major honours. If, say, he had joined Chelsea when the chance first arose in 2004 — the same year Manchester United tentatively enquired about him —  Stevie would have lifted the Barclays Premier League trophy three times. My only advice to him back then, when Chelsea ramped up their efforts, was to look at the big  picture. He could have gone to Stamford Bridge and returned  with all kinds of medals but when he eventually returned home to  Liverpool, how would he have been viewed? Would Liverpool fans have congratulated him? Would they have been happy to see him be  successful? Given the rivalry between the clubs, it would have been impossible. That’s why one title with Liverpool would mean more to him than 10 anywhere else. Ultimately, he was right to stay; 12 months after that first offer from Chelsea, Stevie got his hands on the biggest prize of all in Istanbul. He immortalised himself with his performances that season, most notably in the Champions League final against AC Milan. No go: Gerrard was asked by Raul when he was going to join the Spanish giants . It could have been so different: Chelsea made a move for Gerrard but he opted to stay at Liverpool . Tittle winner: Gerrard could have won the Premier League title if he had moved to Chelsea . When you think about it, though, his loyalty to Liverpool has been unbelievable. Had he not come from this city, I don’t think for one moment he would have stayed, particularly given that Liverpool haven’t been anywhere near the Champions League for five years. I don’t believe he needs the medal to cement his legacy but if you are a genuine football fan, for everything he has done over the past 15 years, you should want to see him complete his collection. There are parallels with his  current situation to how it was for Bryan Robson at United in the early 1990s, a club captain who had enjoyed great success, led his country with distinction but had found the one honour he craved most of all frustratingly out of reach. Robson was still United’s driving force when they mounted their first real assault on the title in 1991-92, but their quest to end a 25-year wait was shattered at Anfield when Liverpool won 2-0. Stevie could easily find himself in a similar position on Sunday. If Chelsea beat Aston Villa and  Liverpool lose at Old Trafford, I feel a 10-point gap would be too difficult to overhaul, but Stevie is going into this make-or-break collision playing some of the best football of his career. He has been questioned at times this season and there was even a theory Liverpool would be better off without him after they blitzed Tottenham 5-0 in December, but such talk about a man who has scored in each of the four major cup finals and at two World Cups was nonsense. Without any kind of fuss, he has slotted into what has been called ‘the Pirlo role’ and dictated  Liverpool’s play, showing his exemplary range of passing. It is the  latest role he has mastered. He is a player who grandfathers will tell their grandchildren about. We love foreign players who can star in a variety of positions. We hear about how they have been well-schooled but what about Stevie? He has thrived as a No 10, a deep-lying central midfielder, on the right flank or at right back. He could even play as a central defender and don’t forget Fabio Capello used him on the left for England. Landing the big one: Gerrard's won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005 . Here to stay: Gerrard speaks with then Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez after committing his future to the club in 2005 following interest from Chelsea . Silver lining: Gerrard has won every domestic trophy in his time at Anfield - except the Premier League . There has been talk he will end his international career after the World Cup but he is still England’s first-choice midfielder and I can’t see anyone emerging to dislodge him. Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson are the new kids on the block but they are still playing catch-up. Leading England to Brazil is something I know he is very proud of, but nothing would make him prouder than leading Liverpool to a first title since 1990. Full steam ahead: Gerrard will lead England in Brazil . The next generation: Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere could be the future of England's midfield . After the Rafa Benitez era was over, we both felt our chance to become champions of England had gone. Certainly when Brendan Rodgers became manager, that feeling was even more acute as we knew it was a new project that would take a while to get going, so to be in this position is not something Stevie is going to want to let slip. Captain Marvel: Bryan Robson went years at United without winning the league title . Job done: Robson finally got his hands on the Premier League title in 1993 . Followers of Chelsea and  Manchester City will disagree — so, too, will Manchester United fans and Evertonians — but there would be no more romantic end to this  season than seeing Stevie lift the Premier League trophy at Anfield on May 11. For his quality and loyalty, it would cap a glorious career. It was a privilege to be in the Nou Camp on Wednesday to see the exhilarating battle between Lionel Messi and Vincent Kompany. Earlier this season, after his colossal display against Manchester United, I said Kompany had given one of the best performances I’d seen by a central defender, and had City managed to get through to the last eight, I would have said the same again. Star turn: Lionel Messi played a big part in Barcelona beating Manchester City on Wednesday . Dink of delight: Messi scores at the Nou Camp against City . To see him playing with such power, presence and understanding, it reminded me of Marcel Desailly at his best. He was like a man playing against boys. His signing for £6million in 2008 must rate as City’s best value-for-money signing of their modern era. But it has to be noted that Kompany was marking a Messi who was only playing at 70-80 per cent of his maximum. You could see him walking around for long periods, protecting himself so he didn’t suffer any further hamstring problems. Marked man: Vincent Kompany gets to grips with Messi . Dejected: Kompany reacts after his team's defeat in Barcelona . When Messi came alive, though, he was a joy to watch. He was always aware of what was going on around him and he produced six or seven pieces of play that took the breath away. When he got the chance to finish the tie, there was never a sense he would miss. We must all hope that Messi does not get plagued by hamstring trouble because he could light up the World Cup this summer. If he produces in Brazil what we have seen him do for Barcelona, Argentina will have an outstanding chance of winning their first title since 1986. What’s more, if Messi peaks in June and July, we’ll be talking about the greatest player of all time. A fortnight has flown by since my last column and once again I’ve had plenty of things to keep me busy. 1 Dinner with Roy Hodgson - It was good to catch up with my old manager in Barcelona. He’d been to watch Manchester City’s Champions League game and, after I’d finished my duties with Sky, we had a bite to eat. He is relishing going to the World Cup. Good catch up: Jamie Carragher went for dinner with his former manager Roy Hodgson in Barcelona . 2 Watching some authentic football - Marine, who play in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier League, are based not too far from where I live and last weekend I took my son, James, to see them play Ashton United. Marine lost 1-0 but it was an enjoyable game and we will go again. 3 Starting a new playing CAREER - It was good to be involved in the ‘Game against Poverty’ with a host of stars 10 days ago in Switzerland but earlier this week I stepped on to the five-a-side court for the first time. It certainly got the old legs moving! Star turnout: Carragher joined Ronaldo, Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane and a many more stars in the Match against Poverty . 4 Tuning into the Six Nations - I’ve become more interested in rugby union since my visit to Twickenham last month and the action this afternoon promises to be riveting. Fingers crossed England get the convincing win they need to become champions. Final chance: Stuart Lancaster and England go into their final game with Italy with a chance of winning the Six Nations . 5 Waiting for the Great Escape - I will be at Old Trafford to see if Manchester United can retrieve a difficult situation against Olympiacos and that will evoke some memories. Liverpool, of course, needed a dramatic victory against the Greek side on the way to the Champions League final in 2005. Can United do the same? You beauty: Gerrard celebrates scoring for Liverpool against Olympiacos in 2004 to earn a 3-1 win .","Liverpool man has had plenty of chances to leave Anfield but stayed loyal .

"Luis Enrique is insistent that Lionel Messi will remain Barcelona's chief penalty taker, but he might be wise to revise that stance. The head coach came out fighting in defence of Messi inside the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night after the 27-year-old spurned a last-minute opportunity to almost put their tie against Manchester City to bed. Had he converted, the Catalans would have taken a two-goal lead to the Nou Camp in three weeks. Joe Hart saves a late penalty from Lionel Messi in Manchester City's 2-1 loss to Barcelona on Tuesday . Four-time world player of the year Messi has now missed four of his last seven penalties for Barcelona . Messi's shot was the perfect height for the England keeper but boss Luis Enrique backed his forward . But Messi's struggles from 12 yards continued as Joe Hart saved his spot-kick before the forward nodded wide the rebound. Remarkably, he has somehow managed to miss four of his last seven penalties for Barcelona; that dismal record stands at five misses from 10 for club and country. Only Thierry Henry (five) and Ruud van Nistelrooy (four) have failed to score on more occasions from penalties in Europe's premier club competition. Enrique, however, is unwavering in his support for Messi. 'Those who miss penalties are those who dare to take them and our penalty taker is undoubtedly Leo Messi,' he said. Messi misses a header from the rebound in an incident which gives Manchester City hope . The Argentine No 10 was outstanding at the Etihad but missed an open goal and the chance to make it 3-1 . Messi missed in the Champions League semi-final aggregate defeat against Chelsea in 2012 . 'We have the utmost confidence in his capacity to take them.' Comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo are never far away, with the Portuguese scoring 54 of his 59 penalties for Real Madrid. Messi, meanwhile, has netted 46 from the same number. Manuel Pellegrini was buoyant in the immediate aftermath, claiming City remain in the last-16 tie because of Hart's heroics. 'It was a very important save,' said Pellegrini. 'It would have been very difficult at 3-1. 'It is not the best result to lose at home, but we will go to Barcelona to try to win. We still have the chance to do it.'","Lionel Messi's recent penalty record has been poor for Barcelona .

"Harry Redknapp called it, when he said Arsenal were his dark horses for the Champions League. Praise from an unlikely source given he was manager of their bitter rivals Tottenham less than three years ago. Recent history would suggest Redknapp is wrong - they have exited the competition at the last-16 stage in their previous four seasons - but Arsenal appear poised to amount a serious assault on one of the few trophies to elude manager Arsene Wenger during his 18 years at the club. Arsenal players celebrate during the 2-1 win against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Arsene Wenger's side appear to be mounting a serious challenge for the Champions League this season . Alexis Sanchez celebrates Arsenal's victory over Crystal Palace in his underwear with his team-mates . GETTING INTO THEIR STRIDE . Like a nervous-yet-primed 100m sprinter, Arsenal have uncurled from their delayed push out of the starting blocks and are starting to open out and power towards the finish line. Perfect timing for a Champions League charge. They have won 10 of their last 12 matches in all competitions and are on a run of nine straight home wins, which began back in November. Hitting form has coincided with Olivier Giroud netting eight in his past 11 games, taking some of the pressure off free-scoring Alexis Sanchez. French striker Olivier Giroud has scored eight goals in his past 11 games for the Gunners . DAT GUY WELBZ . Back in February 2013, Sir Alex Ferguson surprised many when he included Danny Welbeck, facing a difficult second season after breaking into the Manchester United first team and up until that point have only scored once, to face Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the first leg of their knockout double header. Welbeck responded brilliantly. He upstaged Wayne Rooney after scoring early on from his team-mate’s corner in a 1-1 draw. Ferguson said afterwards: ‘They found it difficult to handle him. He was marvellous. He worked so hard.’ His work-rate, which often comes at the detriment to goals, should not be underestimated and could prove crucial in key Champions League ties. Danny Welbeck (right) should not be underestimated and his work-rate could prove crucial in Europe . LUCK OF THE DRAW . Arsenal only finished runners-up in their group and could have faced Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Monaco, Bayern Munich, Barcelona or Porto. The French Ligue 1 side are arguably the easiest draw of the lot. Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United have all demonstrated in previous years that a sprinkle of the magic stuff can help to win the competition. It takes monumental comebacks, penalty shootout victories or sometimes two goals deep into stoppage-time to win Europe’s greatest club competition. Drawing Monaco could be the bit of luck Arsenal need. Drawing Monaco and Dimitar Berbatov could be the bit of luck Arsenal need to progress to the quarter-finals . COQ-A-HOOP . Arsene Wenger has been delighted with the emergence of defensive midfielder Francis Coquelin from exiled to exceptional. He appeared on his way out of the club until a spate of injuries forced Wenger’s hand. Coquelin has excelled, mopping up in front of the back four. Arsenal have so many midfield options, but the problem is none of them want to defend and Coquelin is the enforcer they were so badly lacking. He was offered a new contract in January, which he signed this month. 'I saw that he made huge improvements in training so I sent him on loan for match practice,’ Wenger said. ‘He took that challenge and he's done very well. He is a long-term solution.’ Francis Coquelin (right) has been a revelation for Arsenal in recent weeks and is seen as a long-term solution . INJURIES ABATING . Fourteen players have missed chunks of this season with injuries this season. Fourteen. That’s almost an entire starting XI and substitutes bench. And most of them have been first-team players. They’ll have to get a revolving door installed in the treatment room fairly soon if this continues. But key players are returning and the pressure is easing on the final run-in. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere are all on their way back and Theo Walcott is playing again after a year out. They have also missed the likes of Mesut Ozil, Giroud and Laurent Koscielny who are now back to full fitness. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is back training again while Theo Walcott is playing after a year out through injury .","Arsenal have exited the Champions League in last-16 in last four seasons .

"Fernando Alonso  left hospital in Barcelona and returned to his family's home on Wednesday, three days after crashing in pre-season testing, McLaren confirmed. Alonso was airlifted to hospital after his McLaren-Honda left the track and hit a wall side-on at turn three of the Circuit de Catalunya on Sunday. The Spaniard remained conscious and able to speak to doctors after the incident, but he was concussed and airlifted to hospital for precautionary checks, including CT and MRI scans.

There were hopes that he could return to the McLaren car this weekend for the final winter testing in Barcelona, though the team have confirmed that reserve driver Kevin Magnussen will take his place. A McLaren statement on Wednesday read: 'Following his testing accident at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya last Sunday, we are pleased to confirm that Fernando Alonso has now left hospital. He has returned to his family’s home in Spain for further rest and recuperation. As a result, he will sit out this week’s final winter test, at which he was due to share driving duties with Jenson Button. Kevin Magnussen, McLaren-Honda’s test and reserve driver, will replace him. Jenson will be testing the McLaren-Honda car tomorrow (February 26), and the team will confirm the full day-to-day running order in due course. Alonso is shielded by his team as he makes his way to the helicopter on Sunday . The McLaren driver was airlifted to hospital but was said to be 'OK and conscious' McLaren have carried out tests on Alonso's car and insist the crash was not caused by mechanical failure. 'Our findings indicate that the accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time, and which had affected other drivers similarly (eg, Carlos Sainz Jnr),' McLaren said. 'We can categorically state that there is no evidence that indicates that Fernando's car suffered mechanical failure of any kind.' Alonso's McLaren was recovered back to the pits on the back of a truck after crashing in Barcelona . The 33-year-old pictured in action earlier on in the morning session at the Circuit de Catalunya . The incident occurred on the final day of the Formula One pre-season test, with the new campaign due to begin in Australia on March 15. Alonso's manager Luis Garcia Abad told the Spanish media he 'doesn't think there will be any problems' with regard to the two-time world champion making the start line in Melbourne and he also denied reports that Alonso had been feeling dizzy prior to the crash. 'I deny that Fernando was feeling unwell prior to the incident,' he said. 'The car had grip, there was tremendous wind and he went into the wall, the rest is speculation. 'The car telemetry has stated that he was correcting from left to right. 'Fernando was hitting the brake and changing gears until the moment of impact.' Alonso, who has 32 career grand prix victories, rejoined McLaren this season after a disappointing fifth and final campaign with Ferrari.

"England full-back Mike Brown has been ruled out of Sunday's RBS Six Nations match against Ireland after suffering a setback in his recovery from concussion, the Rugby Football Union has announced. Brown suffered the injury in a clash of heads during the win over Italy. England head coach Stuart Lancaster said: 'Mike and our medical staff have been diligent during every step of the graduated return to play protocol and they will continue to work to get him back to full health.' Mike Brown is out of England's clash with Ireland after suffering a setback in his recovery . Brown has had concussion symptoms since being knocked out in an accidental collision against Italy .

Brown's absence comes after Wales wing George North missed a match after he took two blows to the head in their Six Nations opener against England. North has been recalled for Saturday's clash with France, though. England assistant coach Andy Farrell revealed that Brown woke up with a mild headache after completing Tuesday's running session. 'This morning Mike woke up not feeling 100 per cent. The right and proper thing to do was to make the call. His health is the main priority here and we need to get him right for the next game,' Farrell said. Alex Goode will take the place of Brown at full back for England against Ireland on Sunday .

"World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro has been sentenced to 10 months in jail for breaching orders to keep out of his property after it was seized by authorities. Cannavaro, 41, has been under investigation for tax evasion and in October authorities in Naples seized almost €1m (£732,737) of goods linked to the former Real Madrid and Juventus star and his wife. Cannavaro's brother Paolo, 33, who plays for the Italian Serie A team Sassuolo, was sentenced to six months and his wife Daniela Arenoso, 40, to four months in jail. All three have appealed and the sentences have been suspended until the appeals court considers the cases again. Fabio Cannavaro (centre left) captained Italy to World Cup glory back in 2006 . Cannavaro won 136 caps for Italy and claimed two La Liga titles while at Real Madrid . Cannavaro made a big-money move to Real Madrid and won La Liga twice in his time at the club . According to an investigation led by prosecutor Luigi Cannavale in the southern Italian city of Naples, the three went to the villa for a dip in the pool - ignoring the fact the property had been seized and they were banned from entering. Prosecutors said that at the time the villa had been confiscated for suspected abuse of building regulations - including the fact that they had failed to secure planning permission from the local council to carry out works to the house, garden and pool. The Cannavaro brothers and Arenoso were acquitted over the planning permission allegations, but convicted for entering a property illegally. Cannavaro won the Ballon d'Or in 2006 after leading Italy to their World Cup triumph. He moved to Real Madrid that summer and won two La Liga titles with the Spanish giants.

"Two million young people have no intention of voting for the first time in next year’s general election, a new study has found. Fed-up 17 to 21-year-olds think politicians are more interested in big business, pensioners, and even celebrities. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has less . backing among young people to run the country than comedian Russell . Brand and Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson. Just 41 per cent of first-time voters aged 17-21 say they plan to vote in next year's general elections . Among those who say they will vote, Labour has a clear majority over the Tories . In total 3.3million people will be eligible to vote for the first time in 2015. But a YouGov poll for the think-tank British Future found only 41 per cent are planning to have their say at the ballot box. It found 40 per cent of those will choose Labour, 25 per cent will go for the Conservatives, while 12 per cent will pick Ukip and 9 per cent the Green party. Just 5 per cent plan to support the Liberal Democrat, a result the report links to the party's notorious U-turn on tuition fees. Asked who would be the best person to run the country, Labour leader Ed Miliband came out top as the best person to run the country, backed by 17 per cent of the overall group. David Cameron and his great Tory rival Boris Johnson were both supported by 15 per cent. But Apprentice star and businessman Lord Sugar and comedian Russell Brand were both backed by 12 per cent of the young voters as most suited for the job followed by Top Gear’s Clarkson on 11 per cent. Labour leader Ed Miliband is seen as the best person to run the country by 17 per cent of the group, compared to just 9 per cent who said Ukip leader Nigel Farage . Asked who should be running the country, 17 per cent backed Labour leader Ed Miliband (top left), followed by David Cameron and Boris Johnson both on 15 per cent, Apprentice star Alan Sugar (bottom left) on 12 per cent, comedian Russell Brand on 12 per cent and Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson on 11 per cent . Young people believe politicians are more interested in big business, pensioners, homeowners and even celebrities . Ukip leader Nigel Farage scored 9 per cent while the Deputy Prime Minister languished on just 6 per cent, tying with television chef Jamie Oliver. Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, said: ‘The next generation of Britain's voters clearly feel they're affected by big political issues like jobs, education and housing. But they also think that political leaders don't understand their worries or listen to their concerns. ‘The message for our political class is clear: get better at engaging young people and representing their views. ‘But there's also a challenge for young people. Not voting may show that they are disaffected, but it's the least likely way to get politicians to listen. First-time voters may pay a high price if they sit out the election rather than using their power to get heard. ‘Young people think differently to their parents and grandparents' generations. They could change the balance of opinion in the country. ‘If the 2015 election is as close-run as everyone thinks, just half of the missing two million first time voters could decide the result - if they turn up.’","Poll reveals 59% of 17-21-year-olds say they will not vote in 2015 .

"'Horrific abuse': This Yemeni claims he was tortured and had his hand amputated in public by the Al Qaeda-linked group Ansar al-Sharia  while it was in power of the Abyan region . Al Qaeda committed 'truly shocking' human rights abuses including crucifixions and the beheading of an alleged sorceror during its 16 months in control of a southern region of Yemen, a report by Amnesty International claimed today. The London-based charity has also released a video which appears to show a suspected thief having his hand amputated by the Ansar al-Sharia militia, which seized power of the Abyan governorate in February 2011. Amnesty said dozens more civilians were then killed during reckless counter-insurgency operations by the Yemeni government as it sought to win back the territory from the Al Qaeda-affiliated group. The tragedies would 'haunt Yemen for . decades to come' unless the perpetrators were caught and the families . compensated, the charity said. Amnesty . International Middle East and North Africa Director Philip Luther said: . 'Abyan experienced a human rights catastrophe as Ansar al-Sharia and . government forces vied for control of the region during 2011 and the . first half of 2012. 'The . Yemeni authorities must ensure that a commission of inquiry announced in . September covers the truly shocking abuses committed. 'The . tragedy of Abyan will haunt Yemen for decades to come unless those . responsible are held to account and victims and their families receive . reparations.' Amnesty's . 55-page report, Conflict in Yemen: Abyan's Darkest Hour, documents . violations of the rules of war during the armed conflict between . government forces and Ansar al-Sharia, an Islamist armed group . affiliated to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Scroll down for video . 'Catastrophe': The Yemeni says he had his left hand amputated (above) without attending a trial and without prior knowledge of the punishment . Instilling fear: Residents told Amnesty that the amputated hand was later suspended by a rope in the town's market for all to see . It . details horrific human rights abuses committed in the governorate of . Abyan and other areas in the south of Yemen during the rule of the . Islamist group between February 2011 and June 2012. In addition, the report shows that the . Yemeni government response to Ansar al-Sharia included indiscriminate . attacks resulting in the unnecessary loss of civilian life, obstructing . medical care and subjecting suspected fighters to enforced . disappearance. There are . also reports that some of the air strikes documented in this report may . have been carried out by U.S. drones, which appear to have been active . during the conflict. After . it took control of most of Abyan during 2011-12, Amnesty says Ansar . al-Sharia was responsible for widespread human rights abuses, including . via its newly-established 'religious courts'. No Justice: Amnesty says Ansar al-Sharia was responsible for widespread human rights abuses, including via its newly-established 'religious courts' after it took power of Abyan in February 2011 . Coercion: According to a video released by Amnesty these two men are among many who were forced into making confessions to crimes by Ansar al-Sharia . 'Widespread abuses': The Islamist group controlled the Abyan region from February 2011 until it was ousted by government forces in June this year . These frequently imposed cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments on alleged criminals, suspected spies, those accused of 'sorcery' and people who transgressed cultural norms, it added. Punishments included summary killings - including at least one post-execution crucifixion - amputations and floggings. In one case, 28-year-old Saleh Ahmed Saleh al-Jamli was found guilty by a religious court in the town of Ja’ar of planting electronic devices in two vehicles carrying Ansar al-Shari’a commanders. Shocking: This image from the Amnesty video reportedly shows a Yemeni's body being crucified in public after they were executed . The ruling obtained by Amnesty said the devices had enabled U.S. drones to kill commanders in Zinjibar and claimed Saleh al-Jamli 'confessed' to a judicial committee. The court ruled that Saleh al-Jamli should be killed, and his remains crucified. Meanwhile, Ansar al-Shari’a amputated the hand of at least one person suspected of theft. One of them was a young man Amnesty met whose left hand had been amputated in a public square in Ja’ar. He was arrested along with two of his friends by members of the armed group and accused of stealing electric wires. The . friends were eventually released but the youth, a member of a . marginalised community widely referred to as al-akhdam (servants), said . that he was tortured for five days without access to a lawyer or his . family, and then had his left hand amputated without attending a trial . and without prior knowledge of the punishment. Amnesty . has been given a 90-second video appearing to show the amputation being . carried out. Residents told Amnesty that the amputated hand was later . suspended by a rope in the town's market for all to see. Ansar . al-Sharia also sought to tighten its grip on power through threats, . intimidation and the enforcement of a highly repressive social and . religious code. The . rights of women and girls in particular came under attack and severe . dress codes were imposed, as was a strict separation of the sexes and . restrictions at work and in schools. After Ansar al-Shari’a took over . Abyan and extended its reach to other areas in the south, the Yemeni . military launched several attacks to regain control, culminating in a . major offensive on May 12 this year using air power and artillery. Amnesty claims dozens of civilians were killed by reckless counter-insurgency operations by the Yemen government as it sought to seize back control of Abyan . Heavy-handed: Amnesty claims the Yemeni government forces used inappropriate battlefield weapons such as artillery in civilian residential areas . By the end of June, government forces had succeeded in driving the group out of Abyan and surrounding areas. In . the process, Amnesty claims the Yemeni government forces used . inappropriate battlefield weapons such as artillery in civilian . residential areas. Scores of civilians, including children, were killed and many more injured as a result of air strikes and artillery and mortar attacks by government forces. Amnesty says the tragedies will 'haunt Yemen for decades' unless the perpetrators are brought to justice . Although Ansar al-Sharia were driven out of Abyan in June, there remains a danger the group will re-emerge and that the armed conflict will resume . Ansar al-Shari’a meanwhile used residential areas as bases, particularly in Ja’ ar, recklessly exposing civilian residents to harm. The toxic mix of fighting and human rights abuses meant an estimated 250,000 people from Yemen’s southern governorates, particularly Abyan, were displaced. While Ansar al-Shari’a were driven out of the cities and towns they controlled in June, there remains a danger the group will re-emerge and that the armed conflict will resume. The report is based on the findings of an Amnesty fact-finding mission to Yemen in June-July 2012.

"A 72-year-old New York woman has described for the first time how she was held prisoner in the early 1960s as a young bride in an Afghanistan harem. In a new book, 'An American Bride in Kabul' released early next month, Phyllis Chesler writes about five months she spent in the Muslim country, and how she almost died before she managed to escape and annul her ill-fated marriage. Chesler was 18 when she fell in love with a handsome older Afghan man who she met when the pair were studying together at Bard college. After dating for two years, Chesler told Adul-Kareem she wanted to travel but her boyfriend insisted they must be married before they could embark on their adventures. Against her outraged parents' wishes, Chesler wed her Muslim prince at a civil ceremony in Poughkeepsie with no family present. Interesting life: Phyllis Chesler, pictured in 1972, spent five months in a compound in Afghanistan . They traveled to Europe for their honeymoon with a plan to stop off in Kabul to meet his family. 'I did not know that this would be our final destination,' she writes in an exert of the book in The New York Post, explaining that 30 relatives awaited the newlyweds as they landed in the Afghan capital. Among them, there was not one but three mothers-in-law, Chesler recalls. She was too shocked to speak, and wondered what this meant for her own future as a wife of an Afghan man. The . family was warm and inviting so she tried to forget her husband's . starling omission -- until an airport official demanded that she turn . over her American passport. She refused. 'Everyone . stops. Both the official and my husband assure me that this is a mere . formality,' she writes. 'It will soon be returned to me, so I . reluctantly relinquish it. I will never see my passport again.' Her lack of passport meant she would not be able to leave Afghanistan at will. 'I . am now subject to the laws and custom of Afghanistan, and as a Afghan . woman, that means hardly any rights at all,' she writes. Former life: In her new book, 'An American Bride in Kabul' released early next month, Chesler, pictured left and right, writes her harrowing experience in Kabul . She was taken to her rich father-in-law's spacious compound -- where the patriarch, his three wives, 21 children - ranging from infancy to their 30s - two grandchildren, at least one son-in-law, one daughter-in-law and an unknown number of servants and relatives lived in a number of luxury two-story European-style houses, with patios, indoor gardens, and verandas. 'This is my new home. My prison. My harem,' she explains in the book. The family went out of their way to . impress Chesler when she arrived and the couple was welcomed with a . feast of 'unending and delicious dishes' cooked without the traditional ghee, a clarified butter that often makes foreigners ill because their stomachs are not used to it. Abdul-Kareem came alive during the celebration, she recalls, speaking Dari, . which she herself could not speak, and leaving her alone with the other women. Despite . having never prayed at home, her husband, like all the other men, . suddenly dropped to the floor on all fours to profess his devotion to . Allah. She said from that point on she was left almost constantly alone or with her biological mother-in-law and female relatives. The special treatment quickly stopped and soon all her meals were being made . with ghee, making her so sick she stopped eating them. She instead horded canned food but this was later . confiscated. Compelling: Chesler's story, pictured, is released early next month . She was not allowed to leave the compound without an entourage of people guarding . her -- as such, she left just twice in her first two weeks and five . or six times in total. 'I have no freedom at all,' she wrote in her journal at the time. 'No opportunity to meet anyone or go anywhere. His family watches me suspiciously. Am I getting paranoid?' Her mother-in-law then stopped boiling her drinking water and she immediately contracted dysentery. 'Perhaps she thinks I am already 'Afghan enough' to withstand any and all germs. Perhaps she wants me dead,' she writes. She explains her mother-in-law then attempted to convert her to Islam, giving her prayer rugs and prayer beads. She feared that if she didn't convert, her mother-in-law may sickened her further or even kill her. Passport: Chesler, pictured, had her passport confiscated when she touched down in Kabul with her new husband . But converting to Islam still wasn't enough. Her mother-in-law would spit at her and call her ""Yahud"" or ""Jew"" when she became angry. When she told her husband, he said she was being dramatic. At that point, she realized she had to escape. She tried three times to get to the American embassy, hoping her country would protect her and help her get home. But without a US passport, she no longer had any rights as an American. Meanwhile, Abdul-Kareem had become short-tempered. 'He has begun to hit me,' she wrote in her journal at the time. 'Had I known something like this could ever happen, had I known that we would have to live with his mother and brothers, I would never have come here.' Her efforts to leave were scuppered when she became seriously ill. After days of struggling with her unsympathetic family, they called a local doctor who diagnosed her with hepatitis. She begged to see an American doctor and, though closely guarded, the doctor managed to get her alone for a moment and told her she must return to the US for treatment. The next thing she remembered was her mother-in-law tugging at her IV line, trying to end her life, she believes. Chesler's husband, realizing his young bride would leave him if her health improved, conspired a way to make her stay -- he climbed into her bed and forced himself on her, knowing that if she was pregnant with his child she wouldn't be allowed to leave Afghanistan. Luckily, her health did improve and knowing this was possibly her last chance at freedom, she appealed to her father-in-law who alone had the power to return to her to America. 'He arrives and almost immediately says: ""I think it will be best if you leave with our approval on an Afghan passport, which I have obtained for you. You have been granted a six-month visa for reasons of health.""' He has a passport in hand for his American daughter-in-law, who by that stage had missed two periods. Escape: Chesler, pictured in 1972, tries three times to escape to the US embassy but finally gets so ill she has to return to America for treatment . She felt a huge sense of relief at that moment but when she got back to the compound her husband was incensed at the news and hit her. She boarded the first plane out. 'When the plane takes off, I am filled with more fierce joy than my body can contain. And when I finally land on American soil, I literally kiss the ground,' she writes. When she arrived home she suffered a miscarriage. 'My body made that decision for me,' she explains in the book. She returned to college where she was studying literature, found a job and applied to graduate school. Two years later, she got her marriage to Abdul-Kareem annulled. Chesler said she has shared her story, some 50 years on, to show her first-hand experience of the 'deep-seated the hatred of women' in Islam culture. 'I see how endemic indigenous barbarism and cruelty is and unlike many other intellectuals and feminists, I don't try to romanticize or rationalize it,' she writes, adding that she was lucky to escape with her life and will never return. Chesler is a feminist scholar and a professor emerita of psychology and women's studies at City University of New York. She has changed the name of her former husband in her account.","In a new book, 'An American Bride in Kabul' released early next month, Phyllis Chesler reveals her nightmare experience as a young bride in Afghanistan in the early 1960s .

"Ron Klain, the former longtime Democratic Party operative named last week to be the White House's 'Ebola czar,' will skip a Republican-led congressional panel's hearing on Friday about the government's response to the disease outbreak. The Democratic-controlled Senate won't hold its first hearing on the epidemic crisis until after Election Day. The White House's decision to spare him tough questions from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee comes after he missed two Ebola-focused meetings chaired by President Barack Obama in the first 48 hours after his appointment. The first came Friday afternoon, hours before he a White House pool reporter spotted him entering the White House at 5:30 p.m. The second – a nighttime gathering of 20 government VIPs, including Obama – came a day later after the president finished a round of golf. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Klain (standing, right) was VP Joe Biden's chief of staff after holding the same job during the 1990s with then-VP Al Gore – but he's not a medical doctor or health care expert . UNEASY: Americans have grown more and more wary of the government's chosen methods of handling the Ebola crisis, with some demanding the U.S. be closed off to people who have been in western Africa . White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz confirmed Monday that Klain did not attend, according to a different pool reporter. Schultz also confirmed that he would officially start work on Wednesday. 'It is not that long of a lapse,' he told reporters in Chicago, citing the cumbersome and bureaucratic employee 'onboarding process' that can take weeks or months. Schultz explained the White House's decision to refuse congressmen the chance to question Klain. 'That will be day three of his tenure,' the Obama spokesman said. The notion that Klain might be unprepared to fully participate in the administration's Ebola response plans on Day One brought words of disbelief from conservatives . RON KLAIN . Ebola's response coordinator didn't attend a Saturday night Ebola response meeting at the White House. The list of who did attend was a 'who's who' of top Obama administration officials: . 'Mr. Klain is not a doctor, he's not a health care professional,' Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz said on Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union' program. 'He doesn't have background in these issues. We don't need a White House political operative, which is what Mr. Klain has been. What we need is presidential leadership. The person who needs to be on top of this is the president of the United States.' 'We should be less concerned about giving the public the feeling that the government is on top of this,' Cruz said, 'and more concerned about the government actually being on top of it.' Klain, a venture capitalist and former chief of staff to two Democratic vice presidents who led the 2000 legal team that tried to eke out a presidential election for Al Gore in Florida, has no experience with the health care sector. 'It befuddles me what they want' for the Ebola czar job, American Enterprise Institute scholar Scott Gottlieb told Reuters. 'You want someone who can help coordinate across NIH, CDC, FDA; someone who understands the issues, the optics and knows what to ask for and knows who to go to.' 'There is a very steep learning curve' for Klain, he added. Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said Sunday on the CBS 'Face the Nation' program that Klain also lacks 'emergency response experience.' 'Maybe the Bush-Gore recount qualified in that,' she zinged. Still, Monday's pool report from Schultz's informal press briefing noted that Klain has already met with White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough 'and some other folks,' putting him on reasonable footing to bring Congress up to speed during acommittee hearing. White House Communications Director Jen Palmieri told USA Today that Klain's meeting with McDonough occurred Saturday, before the evening all-hands gathering. Old haunt: Klain (center) is no stranger to the White House, meeting with Obama as his vice president's chief of staff. Also shown in this May 2009 photo is Cynthia Hogan, then Biden's chief legal counsel . House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chair Rep. Darrel Issa, a California Republican, won't get his chance to grill Klain on Friday . The House Oversight Committee did not immediately respond to questions about who from the White House, if anyone, will be testifying in Klain's place. Schultz told reporters that 'the administration will have representatives there.' Fox News first reported on Klain's pending absence on Capitol Hill. 'The White House has informed us that he has not yet officially started and will not be able to attend Friday,' a House Oversight committee aide told the cable news network. Obama is on a political fundraising trip to Chicago, where Schultz said he is also doing 'a little bit of work from home.' That includes a briefing from Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco on the Ebola meeting that happened Monday in his absence.","Ron Klain will officially start work on Wednesday .

"Brazil has admitted all six of its World Cup stadiums under construction will not be ready in time to meet FIFA’s December 31 deadline. But the Brazilian government brushed aside the importance of more delays in completing 2014 World Cup stadiums, saying that missing the deadline will not affect the country's ability to successfully host next year's tournament. Yesterday FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said three stadiums would not be ready in time for the December 31 deadline, but today Brazilian officials said they actually plan to deliver all six remaining venues after that date. Missed . deadline: Brazil has admitted all six of its World Cup stadiums under . construction will not be ready in time to meet FIFA’s December 31 . deadline. Pictured: One of the three stadiums Sao Paulo Arena -Itaquerao . Arena Pantanal, in Cuiaba. The Brazilian government brushed aside the importance of more delays in . completing 2014 World Cup stadiums, saying that missing the deadline . will not affect the country's ability to successfully host next year's . tournament . Arena da Baixada in Curitiba. The other six World Cup stadiums were ready for the Confederations Cup . They claim only three are delayed, . with the other three being handed over after the expected date only . because of problems accommodating the schedule of Brazilian President . Dilma Rousseff, who wants to be present for the ceremonies. Brazil's . Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said Brazil is like a bride who gets to the . wedding late, but the event still goes on as expected. 'In . every wedding that I attended the bride was late. I've never seen a . bride arrive on time. But I've never seen a wedding not happen because . of that,' Rebelo said. Analysis: Brazil's Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said Brazil is like a bride who gets to the wedding late, but the event still goes on as expected . Deadline: FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke, left, originally said three stadiums would not be ready in time for the December 31 deadline . 'It's probable that there will be a delay here or there, but nothing too significant. What is important is that all of the stadiums will be ready (in the end).' FIFA has already said it will have to change plans at the venues because of the delivery delays. FIFA Marketing Director Thierry Weil said the schedule for the release of tickets has already been slightly altered because the seating plans have not been finalized, and football's governing body said other areas will also be affected. 'Due to the reduced timeline, FIFA, the LOC, government and stadium authorities are adjusting the stadium operational program to ensure that the stadiums are delivered and host events prior to the FIFA World Cup without compromising on safety or quality,' FIFA said in a statement. Brazilian officials reiterated there was no reason for concern. 'We are in a much more advanced stage at this point in time than we were before the Confederations Cup,' Brazil's deputy sports minister Luis Fernandes said. 'In March, there were still doubts whether the Maracana would be ready for the final. We are in a much better position now. The only doubt we have is related to the Sao Paulo stadium.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter today revealed Sao Paulo, where a crane collapse last week killed two workers and damaged part of the stadium, will not be ready until April . But there is still confusion about the delivery date of the other five stadiums that aren't ready, with the government, local World Cup organizers and FIFA saying different things. The other six World Cup stadiums were ready for the Confederations Cup. Valcke had said that in addition to Sao Paulo, the southern city of Curitiba and the wetlands city of Cuiaba also would not be ready to deliver their stadiums by the end of the year as expected. He said they would likely be ready in January or February. Tragedy: Firefighters recover the body of a worker who was killed when the crane collapsed . View: An aerial shot of the Sao Paulo stadium after the tragic accident last week . Rebelo, the government official in charge of Brazil's preparations for the World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics, said Wednesday that the stadium in Porto Alegre was also delayed, and that the remaining stadiums will only be delivered in January. The local World Cup organizing committee had said that only Sao Paulo and Curitiba were facing delays, and that Curitiba might not be ready until March. 'They will all be delivered with enough time for the test events that are needed before the World Cup,' Rebelo said. Last week two people were killed after a crane collapsed at the Brazilian football stadium due to host the opening match at next year's World Cup. The final part of the structure, which was due to be one of the centerpieces of the 2014 tournament,  was being installed at the Corinthians stadium when the 500-ton crane cut through the roof of the east side stand, causing extensive damage. One of the dead workers, 42-year-old Fabio Luis Pereira, was inside a truck when it was hit by the falling metal structure. The other, 44-year-old Ronaldo Oliveira dos Santos, was said to be 'napping' during a break in an area that was supposed to have been cleared. It was not the first time Brazil has suffered setbacks and experienced accidents at stadium construction sites. One worker died during construction of a stadium in the capital Brasilia last year and another in the Manaus venue in March. Also in March, heavy rains flooded the construction site of the Maracana Stadium, forcing the cancellation of a FIFA inspection visit at the time. In May, a small part of the roof at the Salvador stadium fell in after it wasn't able to sustain the large amount of water that settled on top of it. In April, another worker died at the construction site of the new Palmeiras stadium, which may be used for teams training for the World Cup in Sao Paulo. The construction site was stopped for 10 days after the incident, but the damage was not as significant as at the Corinthians venue. In Rio, the stadium which will host athletics in the 2016 Olympics has been closed for several months because of fears that its roof could collapse. Renovation work is underway at the venue.","FIFA yesterday said three of the stadiums would not be ready .

"A man infected with a Sars-like illness has become the first person in Britain to die from the virus. The 39-year-old, who died in the intensive care unit at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, caught the illness from his father, who had become infected while travelling in Pakistan and the Middle East. So far there have only been four confirmed cases of the illness in Britain and 12 anywhere in the world, with six deaths. Scroll down for video . Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) The illness, known as novel . coronavirus, causes a cough, breathing difficulties and fever which can . lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. It is from the same virus family as Sars, which claimed 900 lives worldwide in 2002 and 2003. But scientists say novel coronavirus is nowhere near as dangerous as it has difficulty spreading between humans. The man who died on Sunday was suffering from a long-term condition which made him more susceptible. His father is still being treated at a hospital in Manchester. And another member of the same family who also caught the virus is being treated at the hospital in Birmingham. Separately, a 49-year-old man infected in Qatar in September is also in hospital. Scientists think the illness may be spread via bat droppings or through water droplets from coughs and sneezes. Three people have died in Saudi Arabia and two in Jordan. A hospital statement released today said: 'The patient was already an outpatient at . Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB), undergoing treatment for a long-term, complex unrelated health . condition. 'The patient was immuno-compromised and is believed to have . contracted the virus from a relative who is being treated for the . condition in a Manchester hospital. 'QEHB is working closely with the Health Protection Agency which is . currently following up other household members and contacts of this . case. Professor John Watson, head of the . respiratory diseases department at the HPA, said: ‘This case is a family . member who was in close personal contact with the earlier case and who . may have been at greater risk of acquiring an infection because of their . underlying health condition. 'To date, evidence of person-to-person transmission has been limited. Although this case provides strong evidence for person to person . transmission, the risk of infection in most circumstances is still . considered to be very low.' Infected patients have presented with serious respiratory illness with fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. The lining of the lung, or epithelium, represents an important first barrier against respiratory viruses . A statement issued this afternoon by . the HPA said the man who died and another of the UK cases had no recent . history of foreign travel, suggesting that transmission had occurred in . Britain. A HPA spokesman said: 'One person has . sadly died. This patient had an underlying condition that may have made . them more susceptible to respiratory infections. 'The first patient in this cluster, who had recent travel history to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, is still receiving treatment. 'The third case, who had a mild illness, has recovered.' Today, experts suggested the virus could potentially be treated by targeting the immune system. The coronavirus (NCov) belongs to the same family as the coronavirus SARS, which surfaced in China more than a decade ago and infected 8,000 people worldwide, killing around one in 10 of them. It's thought the virus can penetrate the lining of the passageways in the lung and evade the immune system as easily as a cold virus can. The research also reveals that the virus is susceptible to treatment with interferons, components of the immune system that have been used successfully to treat other viral diseases, opening a possible mode of treatment in the event of a large-scale outbreak. Now scientists at the Institute of Immunobiology at Kantonal Hospital in Switzerland, have tested how well the virus could infect . and multiply in the entryways to the human lung using cultured cells manipulated to mimic the airway lining. The lining of the lung, or epithelium, represents an important first barrier against respiratory viruses. But, said co-author Dr Volker Thiel, this part of the body does not put up a big fight against NCoV. He and his colleagues found that human airway epithelial cells are highly susceptible to NCoV infection and that the virus is able to multiply at a faster initial rate than the SARS virus. He said: 'Surprisingly, this coronavirus grows very efficiently on human epithelial cells.' The researchers asked themselves whether boosting this weak immune response might diminish the virus' ability to infect airway epithelial cells. They found that pre-treating the cells with proteins that are released in response to infection, significantly reduced the number of infected cells. But he added:'We don't know whether the cases we observe are the tip of the iceberg, or whether many more people are infected without showing severe symptoms.' The findings were published in the online journal mBio.","The patient, who was being treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, died on Sunday .

"Watford striker Odion Ighalo is the hottest property in English football since the turn of the year and is driving the his side towards the Premier League. The striker has scored 13 goals in nine games in 2015 as Slavisa Jokanovic’s men remain in the top six and in the hunt for a return to the Premier League. He has scored more goals this year than both Harry Kane and Danny Ings and is the top scorer in all four professional divisions in England in 2015. Odion Ighalo celebrates with Troy Deeney  after he scored against Rotherham . Ighalo has scored 13 goals in 2015 - the highest in English football . Ighalo netted just four goals up until December 28 but has really found a rich vein of form since then. The 25-year-old was born in Lagos and began his career in Nigeria before moving to Watford’s partner club Udinese in 2008. His first real break came when he moved to Spain with Granada – who also have links with Watford – and he scored 35 goals over two loan spells. Ighalo joined Watford initially on loan at the beginning of the season before making the deal permanent in October. His nine goals this year – including four against Blackpool and two apiece against Charlton, Brentford and Rotherham – have attracted interest. Ighalo scored just four goals in the first half of the season - but has bagged 13 since the turn of the year . Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic is keen to put the emphasis on the team rather than individuals . But manager Jokanovic is not keen to heap praise on any individual. Speaking earlier this month, he said: ‘There is no memory in football - this game is already history and so is his [Odion Ighalo] part in it. ‘Ighalo is just doing his job - he is in a good moment. ‘The team won the match, not just one player. They will see his name first but behind are many others.’","Odion Ighalo has scored 13 goals in nine games for Watford in 2015 .

"The Bill Shankly Memorial Gates, Liverpool's permanent tribute to the legendary manager, have been removed to ensure their safety as improvements are made to Anfield. The gates were carefully removed and taken to safe storage on Tuesday while major works on the stadium's Main Stand ramps up. The gates have been in place since August 26, 1982, when they were officially opened by his widow Nessie. The Bill Shankly Memorial Gates, erected in 1982 in tribute to the late manager, have been removed . The gates were carefully removed by contractors on Tuesday before being placed in safe storage .

'It's an honour,' Andy told the Liverpool Echo  of being entrusted with the tribute to Liverpool's former boss who led the club from the second division to become a powerhouse in Europe. 'I’m not a bitter Blue,' he said. 'Me mates are not gonna like this though. My grandkids won't like it either. 'We done the memorial as well,' Andy said, referring to the The Hillsborough Memorial, which was relocated to the same warehouse the gates will be kept in earlier in February. The Hillsborough Memorial has also been carefully removed and stored with the Shankly Gates . Shankly won three First Division titles, two FA Cups, four Charity Shields and a UEFA Cup at the Reds . 'We’ve had no problems at all, except for the wind, it was blowing them everywhere when we were trying to move them.' Work on the Main Stand began earlier this year and will increase the capacity of the ground by about 8,500 to 54,000. The stand itself will become one of the largest all-seater stands in Europe. Liverpool say 'the design will ensure that the unrivalled atmosphere and spirit of Anfield is retained.' Under Shankly, the Reds won three First Division Championships, two FA Cups, four Charity Shields and one UEFA Cup, before he retired after 15 years, handing the reigns over to Bob Paisley.","Liverpool are developing Anfield's Main Stand to increase capacity .

"Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti and keeper Iker Casillas had reason to celebrate in training on Wednesday as they were presented with commemorative shirts for reaching milestones with the club. Ancelotti was marking his 100th game in charge at the Bernabeu, while Casillas was celebrating his 500th La Liga game between the sticks, both of which came during the 2-0 victory away at Elche on Sunday. Madrid's boss, who was presented with a shirt with his name and '100' on the back by club president Florentino Perez, has won the Copa del Rey, the Champions League, the Spanish Super Cup, the UEFA Super Cup and the World Club Cup during his century of games in charge. Carlo Ancelotti (right) of Real Madrid is presented with a shirt to commemorate his 100 matches by club president Florentino Perez . Ancelotti and Perez pose for a picture as the Real Madrid boss is surrounded and applauded by his squad . Long-serving goalkeeper and captain Iker Casillas was also presented with a commemorative shirt for 500 league games with the club . Ancelotti also recorded his 78th win in the game against Elche to help him eclipse Jose Mourinho as the most successful Real Madrid manager after 100 games. The former boss, who was in charge at the Bernabeu between 2010-13, recorded 77 victories in his first 100. Third on the list is legendary figure Miguel Munoz, who won 70 of his first 100 - as well as three European Cups as a player and two as a manager between 1955-66. Fourth is Jose Villalonga (64 wins) and fifth is Leo Beenhakker (63). Casillas, meanwhile, marked his 500th La Liga game with a clean sheet at Elche and was also presented with a shirt by Perez. The Spanish goalkeeper has been a regular at Madrid since making his debut in the 1998-99 season. 'I am thankful, this record is not easy to get being a Real Madrid player, maybe in another club it would have been easier,' said Casillas, after the game on Sunday. 'I never thought about reaching a certain number.' While Ancelotti added: 'I think that if we've done well in my first 100 games, then we'll try to do even better in the next 100.' Casillas has come under increased scrutiny this season after a series of high-profile errors. He has come under pressure from summer signing Keylor Navas while the club have also been linked with Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea. However De Gea, 24, is closing in on a new long-term deal at Old Trafford and manager Ancelotti has made clear he is more than happy with his current goalkeeping options.

"Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud admits he needs to stop being so emotional on the pitch and prove he has a 'killer' attitude - similar to Chelsea striker Diego Costa. The Frenchman is in fine form at present, netting eight goals in his last 11 games, but still divides opinion in the stands and in the public eye. Part of the reasoning behind that is his mentality on the pitch, often throwing his hands up in the air and letting the occasion get the best of him after missing an opportunity. He says Costa is the perfect role model in that respect. Olivier Giroud admits he needs to stop letting his emotion getting the best of him at Arsenal . Giroud says Diego Costa shows no emotion on the pitch and he should follow his lead in the Premier League . 'When I do this (he puts his head in his hands) after a missed chances, the coaches get a bit annoyed,' the former Montpellier striker told L'Equipe. 'They want me to have a 'killer' attitude, almost insensitive. Diego Costa shows no emotion. I am more emotional. I have therefore learned to control my emotions. I try to be less demonstrative. Despite Giroud's impressive form since signing for the Gunners in 2012 and Danny Welbeck's arrival in the summer, Arsenal have been consistently linked with other strikers. Most recently a move for Porto's Jackson Martinez has been mooted, with the player admitting he would like a move to the Emirates Stadium, while Arsene Wenger has been praising the Colombian star. Giroud says such talk simply motivates him to score more goals. When you talk about a guy to play in your place, you feel offended because it is your place,' he said. 'I here them saying: 'They have Giroud and Welbeck but they need a world-class attacker'. It is like saying, we are not world-class attackers.

'Does it upset me? No but it stings. Recently there was a buzz around Jackson Martinez (Porto). The coach said nice things about him, the player said he would like to come.

"The left wing mayor of New York City will be the star speaker at next week’s Labour Party conference in Manchester. Bill de Blasio last year became the city’s first Democratic mayor since 1993 – winning on a radical campaign to tax the rich and introduce a mass house building programme. He campaigned on the slogan ‘One New York, Rising Together’ – reminiscent of Ed Miliband’s ‘On Nation’ Labour. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio (second left with his son Dante (left), daughter Chiara (right), and wife Chirlane McCray in Brooklyn . Mr De Blasio has been held up by Labour insiders as proof that left-wing leaders can win without adopting Tony Blair-style centrist policies. He will speak about the urgent need to tackle income inequality around the world – while also holding private talks with Mr Miliband. Mr De Blasio isn't the first New York mayor to speak at a UK party conference. In 2007, his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, addressed the Tories in Blackpool. His role as ‘international speaker’ at the Labour conference will see him follow in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela and Bill Clinton. Mr de Blasio has been been dubbed by his critics as ‘as red as Ken Livingstone’. The Tories will highlight Mr De Blasio’s support for higher taxes and US claims that he is ‘anti-business’. Ed Miliband said Mr De Blasio was helping 'everyday New Yorkers' share the success of the city . In his inaugural speech, the Mayor said: ‘We are called to put an end to economic and social inequalities.’ Mr De Blasio won a landslide victory in 2013 to become the first Democratic mayor of New York for 20 years. The Mayor said: ‘The fight against income inequality doesn’t stop at a city limit, a state line or an international border. ‘It’s an issue that confronts us all, in every corner of the world, and it demands a unified response. ‘To truly lift up more people, families and communities struggling to make it in tough economic conditions, we must truly have a shared vision, and a shared strategy.’ Mr Miliband said: ‘There have always been close links between the Labour Party and leading Democrats. ‘But I am particularly pleased that Bill de Blasio has agreed to speak at our pre-election conference this year. I followed his election campaign closely and I have been impressed by the work he has done since taking office in January for everyday New Yorkers so they can begin to share in, as well as create, a successful future for their great city.’ The Labour leader added: ‘We both recognise we face a generational challenge to ensure that hard work is properly rewarded, that young people get a fair shot in life, and that the cost-of-living crisis for working families is tackled. ‘It is an international challenge for progressive leaders in the United Kingdom, in the United States, and across the developed world.’","Ed Miliband reveals his delight at left-wing US politician's guest appearance .

"From clumsily eating a bacon sandwich to posing in a ‘feminist’ T-shirt made by exploited female labour, Ed Miliband’s public appearances during recent months have been a catalogue of gaffes. Few of these moments have been more awkward than his spontaneous decision to give some loose change to a young beggar while he walked along a street in Manchester last week. If this was an attempt to parade his decency, it backfired disastrously. Instead of looking compassionate, he came across as foolish, opportunistic and embarrassed. Scroll down for video . Founder of the Big Issue John Bird, who says giving money to beggars does nothing to alleviate their plight . Much attention has focused on the reportedly small sum he gave the girl, later identified as a 14-year-old Romanian immigrant. Miliband has also attracted criticism for the disdainful look on his face as he handed over the cash, as if he were repelled by his own action. Yet that air of self-disgust was appropriate. For Miliband knew only too well that he was doing the wrong thing. The key problem was not the size of his donation, but the fact that he actually handed over any money at all. Mr Bird's comments come after Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured dropping money into a beggar's cup outside Manchester Town Hall . It’s a familiar predicament when we’re faced with another desperate-looking figure huddled on the street, palm outstretched. It’s only human to feel that impulse to help — to give a few coins to alleviate another’s misery — and, all too often, for that impulse to override the quiet voice which asks: am I really helping? The answer is no. Giving to a beggar might momentarily salve the donor’s conscience, but in the longer term it does absolutely nothing to alleviate the plight of the recipient. On the contrary, it locks the beggar in a downward spiral of abject dependency and victimhood, where all self-respect, honesty and hope are lost. Indeed, by reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness. If there is one thing most beggars detest more than people who refuse to give, it is those who do. I should know, because I was a beggar for much of my early life. Growing up in an Irish immigrant family in London with a father who made it his life’s mission to single-handedly prop up the drinks trade, I first experienced homelessness at the age of five, and between the ages of seven and ten was raised in an orphanage, supplementing my meagre pocket money with what I could get on the streets. Mr Bird says that reinforcing the beggar’s pitiable condition, a donation is really an act of cruelty rather than kindness . Begging descended into crime, and through my teenage years I was in and out of prison. But it was that background which gave me the determination to do something for the homeless beyond the usual mix of counter-productive financial concern and judicial punishment (begging and rough-sleeping have been illegal here since the 16th century). What I wanted to do was something that would give the destitute a sense of purpose. So, in 1991, I came up with the idea of the Big Issue magazine, a product which people could sell for a decent profit. The Big Issue represented dynamic street trade, not degraded street aid. Instead of remaining passive, dependent victims, the sellers would become active merchants, gaining discipline, self-worth and honesty. The initiative was widely adopted here and abroad, transforming institutional attitudes to homelessness. I am still gaining insights into how well the scheme can work. The other day, I met up with an old mate called Mark Dempster. More than 20 years ago, he was a real hard-case: an alcoholic drug-dealer who lived on the streets and had served time in prisons all over the world. Mr Miliband made his donation while walking through Manchester with Shadow Transport Secretary Mary Creagh, left, and Manchester Withington candidate Jeff Smith, right . Thanks to the self-respect the Big Issue gave him, he cleaned up his act, escaped his destructive habits and became a responsible adult. He is now a Harley Street specialist in drug and drink addictions, helping others to break free as he did. The alternative — embodied in Ed Miliband’s desperate move — of people giving money to those who simply sit on the street asking for money, only worsens the begging problem. Moreover, such an approach amounts to a collusion with criminality, for not only is begging illegal under a host of laws, such as the 1824 Vagrancy Act, but it is often accompanied — as in Mark Dempster’s example — by other law-breaking, like drug possession, theft, disorderly conduct, and even violence. So there is no doubt that giving to beggars worsens criminality by encouraging the destitute to remain outside the margins of society. Most of the homeless are mentally ill or in the throes of addiction, so cash enables them to spend more on drink or drugs. Alternatively, they can become part of an organised gang that exploits the public’s generosity. That is why I often say the Big Issue is a also ‘crime reduction initiative’, because it helps to steer the magazine vendors away from the possibility of sliding into illegal behaviour. This is true even of the large number of Romanians who now sell the Big Issue on British streets; on my estimates, one in five of all Big Issue vendors is East European. Now, understandably, many British people strongly object to this trend. Why on earth are we, a small country with overstretched public services, importing destitution on such a scale from Eastern Europe? The beggar was later revealed to be 14-year-old Rebeca State, who lives with her aunt as her parents have returned to Romania . That is a question not for the Big Issue organisation, but for the politicians such as Ed Miliband who opened the sluice gates and insisted, for ideological reasons, on open borders within Europe. They are the ones who decided the Romanian poor and homeless should be allowed to settle here. At least the Big Issue gives them work, an income, a roof over their heads and a route away from crime. But that does not mean I am blind to some of the excesses and abuses. Unfortunately, thanks to the ill-conceived bureaucracy of the welfare system, some Bulgarians and Romanians have been allowed to exploit their positions as vendors to gain self-employed status, opening the way to a raft of income-related welfare benefits. That is certainly true in the case of the girl beggar who Mr Miliband met in Manchester. Rebeca State, 14, lives with her aunt, Livia Stoica, in rented accommodation; her parents have returned to Romania because of a family illness. As a ‘self-employed’ Big Issue seller six days a week, Ms Stoica can claim £550 a week in welfare. But again the Big Issue should not be the organisation under attack. It is up to the politicians to close the loopholes over self-employed status and access to social security. This whole case shows the laxity of the authorities’ approach. Ms Stoica might be within her rights to claim welfare as a self-employed individual, but she should certainly not be allowing her 14-year-old niece out on the streets to break the law by begging. Are social services and the police investigating? If not, why not? And why is Rebeca, still only a child, not in school or back with her parents? Mr Bird estimates that one in five people selling the Big Issue on the street are of Eastern European decent (file picture) I fear the answer is there is far too much sentimentality and cowardice in our political system, which has been ruthlessly exploited by society’s parasites. I have absolutely no time for the pathetic, bleeding-heart mentality so prevalent these days — and which destroys traditional concepts of morality and justice. I firmly believe that anyone who breaks the law or abuses our generosity should be deported — not protected by the morally perverted human rights regime which allows them to remain in this country on the basis of their so-called ‘right to a family life’. Indeed, early this year I led calls for the deportation of Razvan Dumitru, a Romanian Big Issue seller based in North London who robbed a blind pensioner of £50 when she tried to pay him for the magazine. For this sickening crime, he was sentenced to just four months in prison. But it is the politicians who created this mess, through their contempt for our borders, reluctance to uphold our laws, and remorseless expansion of our welfare benefits. Ed Miliband’s desperate donation is a classic illustration of warped priorities and lack of ethical rigour. He should be ashamed of himself.","John Bird co-founder the Big Issue in 1991 after being a beggar himself .

"Arsene Wenger savaged his Arsenal team and blamed ‘suicidal defending’ after they crashed to a 3-1 defeat against Monaco at the Emirates in the Champions League. The furious Arsenal manager claimed his players were not mentally prepared for the first-leg as goals from Geoffrey Kondogbia, Dimitar Berbatov and substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco condemned them. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had scored a spectacular goal for Arsenal to bring it back to 2-1, but Arsenal will need at least three in the return leg on March 17 to progress. Arsene Wenger scowls during the 3-1 home defeat to Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday . Wenger said: ‘We missed the chances and we were a bit suicidal defensively. We were not at the level we want to be. ‘The second and the third goals are suicidal. We came back to 2-1 and we have no right to let them score as third. ‘It makes our task difficult in the second leg. We lost our nerves and rationality on the pitch, and the heart took over the head. ‘At this level it doesn’t work. Mentally we were not ready, we were not sharp enough to get into this game. We paid for it. ‘In the first 20 minutes there was enough room to win it. If you look at the chances we could have won. Per Mertesacker looked despondent as the Gunners put in a shocking display to lose 3-1 to Monaco . ‘Football is not down to paper it is down to performance. The players wanted to come back from 2-1 to 2-2 and forgot the elementary cautiousness needed. ‘We have a smaller chance to win but we will go for it. We have to recover from that.’ Wenger claimed his team were naive in the first leg and they face a massive battle to reach the quarter-final after losing this first leg in these circumstances. Oxlade-Chamberlain had brought Arsenal back into the tie after coming on as a substitute, but his mistake allowed Monaco to score a breakaway third. Arsenal players look stunned having put in a dismal performance against Monaco in the Champions League . The Arsenal manager added: ‘We had a lot of possession and defensively we were not at the level we need to be. ‘But our weakness was mental more than anything. We rushed our game, we knew it was bad at half time and were too impatient. This is a 180 minute game and if you look at the second and third goal it is difficult to explain how this happened. ‘Oxlade-Chamberlain is very disappointed. How can can it happen if you lose a ball 70 metres away from goal?’ Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim said: ‘Football is an art, defending and attacking. It is difficult to score a lot of goals in the Champions League, but we were able to take advantage of the space Arsenal gave us. ‘Berbatov played a terrific match in terms of his positional play, he was our first target when we tried to build our play. He had a great game.’ Former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov compounded Arsenal's misery with Monaco's second .","Arsene Wenger's side suffer disastrous 3-1 home defeat to Monaco .

She was greeted by the Prime Minister David Cameron, the first time the two have apparently been photographed together. The Duchess completed her outfit with a pair of the palest pale grey . suede heels, tan tights and hooped Kiki McDonough earrings. Unusually she . wore her hair swept back in an elegant chignon showing off her new . earrings, which she also wore to the Olympic Games opening ceremony on . Friday, to their best advantage. New look: Kate wore her hair up in an elegant side-chignon, showing off her Kiki McDonough earrings . Opening the event, the Prime Minister David Cameron made a short speech . and revealed a fascinating conversation he enjoyed with Prince William . at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games with Prince William. Turning to the Duchess, he said: 'My favourite part of the opening . ceremony was when your husband leant over and said to me 'I don't know . if you know, Prime Minister, but my grandmother is a great fan of Dizzee . Rascal.' The comment prompted howls of laughter, not least from the Duchess. Guest of honour: Kate was greeted on arrival at the Royal Academy of Arts by Prime Minister David Cameron and RAA President, Christopher le Brun . Going solo: The Duchess, who attended the event without her husband, Prince William, walked the red carpet with Mr Cameron and Mr le Brun . Aides said they were confident that the prince made the quip - but less sure as to whether it was true.

"The working group that is supporting fan ownership of Leeds has welcomed apparent interest from Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe in the club. New Zealand-born Crowe caused a stir amongst Leeds fans on Wednesday when he asked his 1.6million Twitter followers whether or not he should buy the club. The 50-year-old is a lifelong fan of the West Yorkshire club and has recently reiterated that, tweeting a message of support when they beat Middlesbrough 1-0 on Saturday. Russell Crowe, a lifelong Leeds United fan, has responded to a fan's plea to buy the club . Crowe asked his 1.6million Twitter followers if he should consider buying the ailing club . He caused further ripples on Wednesday when he replied to a tweet from a supporter, asking him if he would consider buying Leeds. United fan @Samwild90 wrote to Crowe saying: 'Please buy Leeds. In need of help!!' Crowe retweeted the message and added the comment 'Anybody else think this is a good idea?' The message was retweeted over a thousand times with numerous hopeful and positive responses, one of them coming from the recently-formed group Leeds Fans LLP, a working party of supporters which is trying to get a seat on the Elland Road club's board. The group immediately asked Crowe to make contact with it and he did, replying with some advice over three messages. LLP has been aware of Crowe's interest for some time and a spokesperson told Sportsmail: 'Russell's a big Leeds supporter, he has a background in fan ownership and we'd love for him to work with us on fan ownership at Leeds United.' Crowe has ownership experience after guiding Sydney Rabitohs rugby league team to global success . Crowe is joined by Sam Burgess (left) and actor Djimon Hounsou (centre) during a World Club Series victory for the Rabitohs and St Helens on Sunday . Crowe was in England over the weekend promoting his latest film, the Water Diviner, as well as being with the Australian rugby league side he co-owns. The star of the likes of Gladiator and Robin Hood bought a 75 per cent stake of the South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2006 in partnership with Peter Holmes a Court, and on Sunday watched them be crowned the best team in the world as they beat St Helens 39-0 in the World Club Challenge. Crowe replied to LLP's messages, referring to his ownership of the Rabbitohs. Writing about the club he took from the bottom of the Australian league to the NRL title in 2014, he said: 'Look at a show called South Side Story you'll see how we handled this at South Sydney. It's up on you tube, 6 episodes. 'We set up a member company that has its own board and seats on the football club board. There has to be a singular vision. 'There has to be one voice that sets the tone. Every thought and every decision has to be about success on the field.' Liam Cooper applauds travelling fans after defeat to Brighton leaves them 14th in the Championship . Supporters group Leeds Fans LLP has welcomed Crowe's interest and advice . Sportsmail understands that Wednesday's apparent expression of interest is not the first time Crowe has made positive noises about being involved with investment in Leeds. Were Crowe, the man who played Maximus in Gladiator, to actively pursue involvement with an investment, he could use the LLP group as a vehicle. LLP is limited liability partnership which will invite Leeds supporters to become partners by buying stakes worth £100. A maximum of 100,000 stakes are to be made available with fans able to buy up to 1,000, with each stake worth one vote. Regardless, his comments have caused further commotion amongst Leeds' long-suffering supporters, who are currently waiting to see what banned president Massimo Cellino decides to do. The 58-year-old Italian has sold his personal stake in Eleonora Sport - the company he set-up to buy Leeds a year ago - in order to independently appeal his Football League disqualification after failing its owners' and directors' test following a tax evasion conviction. His ban expires on April 10 but Cellino said on Tuesday that he would not be returning to office while he tries to clear his name, giving rise to speculation he could be about to sell up. Crowe dates his support of Leeds back to watching them on television in the 1970s when they enjoyed a period of success under Don Revie. Banned president Massimo Cellino will not be returning to Elland Road while he tries to clear his name . In a 2011 interview he said: 'I started following Leeds in the early 70s. They can be heartbreakers, but that's the joy of sport.' He tweeted in 2013 that: 'I don't currently have a premiership team. Faithfully waiting for Leeds United to rise again.' Leeds were unavailable for comment on Wednesday, while Sportsmail was awaiting a response from Crowe's representatives.","Leeds fan sent message asking Russell Crowe to buy the struggling club .

"Arsenal take on Monaco at the Emirates stadium on Wednesday night, knowing they have their best chance for years to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. But in their way are a team in form, with a strong defence and some dangerous players - and old foes - going forward. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel tells you all you need to know about the French club... The Monaco players share a laugh while training on the Emirates pitch ahead of the Champions League tie . Who's the boss? Portuguese manager Leonardo Jardim isn’t the best known manager left in the competition, but that won’t faze him. Despite being only 40, the Monaco boss already has 13 years of coaching experience behind him, joining AD Camacha as assistant manager in 2001 before moving into the top job two years later. Spells at Chaves, Beira-Mar and Braga led to a move to Greek side Olympiacos before he returned to Portugal to take charge of Sporting in 2013. He took over at Monaco last summer. At 40 years old Leonardo Jardim is still young for a manager, but has plenty of experience in football . Joao Moutinho is Monaco's crucial playmaker and will try to dictate the game from the middle of the park . Who are the dangermen? 4 Monaco scored just four goals on their way to finishing top of Group C, accumulating 11 points. 2+ Arsenal have scored at least two goals in their last five Champions League matches. 5 Monaco have kept five clean sheets in their previous six matches in the Champions League. Joao Moutinho will pull the strings in central midfield and Arsenal’s ball-winner Francis Coquelin will have to harry the Portugal international. Arsenal must also stop Monaco’s box-to-box midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia. The Gunners should know about the France international, having scouted him extensively in recent seasons. Yannick Ferreira Carrasco has added pace and trickery to Monaco’s attack from the flanks. And then, of course, there’s Dimitar Berbatov... Any familiar faces? Having spent eight years gracing the Premier League with his poise, skill and swagger, all eyes will be on Berbatov. Dimitar Berbatov will present a familiar threat as he seeks to prove he is still a top-level player . Moutinho and Geoffrey Kondogbia, who Arsenal have previously scouted, are the players to watch . The former Tottenham, Manchester United and Fulham man will want to prove he can still cut the mustard against England’s elite. Likewise, Moutinho is a name that’s become well known in English football in recent years — particularly during transfer windows.

"Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho were among eight senior players missing from the squad when Liverpool’s flight touched down in Istanbul on Wednesday. Gerrard misses out on a return to the Ataturk Stadium – the scene of his greatest moment as Liverpool captain in the 2005 Champions League final – as Brendan Rodgers’s side prepare to defend their 1-0 first-leg lead against Besiktas on Thursday night. The veteran midfielder has not played for two weeks due to a hamstring problem, and has been left on Merseyside in a bid to be fit for Sunday’s clash with Manchester City. Brendan Rodgers has decided to rest key players ahead of Liverpool's Europa League clash with Besiktas . Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling speaks at a press conference ahead of the game in Turkey . Steven Gerrard has not played since scoring against Spurs (above), but could return against Manchester City . Gerrard misses returning to the scene of his greatest moment, winning the 2005 Champions League in Istanbul . Coutinho has been rested to help him be in peak condition to face the champions at Anfield after playing in all of Liverpool’s last 19 games. Lazar Markovic is still suspended while Jordan Henderson, Glen Johnson, Jose Enrique, Mamadou Sakho and Lucas are all injured, meaning there could be a youthful look to Liverpool for the second leg. ‘We’ve got a few injuries,’ said Rodgers. ‘We’re probably out here without eight of our squad who have knocks, some with previous and some who picked up something at the weekend. ‘We still have a squad strong enough to hopefully get the job complete. But we’ ve got a few knocks and niggles from the weekend. ‘The confidence is very high in the team and the changes we make and the players that come in, they know their collective jobs. They’re performing at a very high level so we expect that confidence level to continue and to carry that into the game.’ Rodgers is expected to field a young side as Liverpool look to protect a 1-0 first leg advantage .

Gerrard is the only current Liverpool player to have appeared in the famous victory over AC Milan at the Ataturk when they came from three goals down to beat the Italians in a penalty shootout. ‘Of course it was a great historic night for the club and everyone associated with Liverpool respects that,’ added Rodgers. ‘It was a little while ago and there won’t be too many of our players that were involved at that time. ‘It’s a real iconic stadium for the club and a big part of that history. For us to go there and play with a lot of young players and a new squad against a good team, we’ll look forward to that. ‘It’s obviously a big pitch that suits us. If you look at the size of the field, in terms of the Premier League it would be the third biggest pitch. ‘So in terms of the pace and movement in our team, the pitch should suit us quite. We’re looking forward to the atmosphere and we want to get the job complete.’ Liverpool players take part in a final training session at Melwood before leaving for Istanbul . Mario Balotelli (left) brings a smile to assistant coach Colin Pascoe's face . Spanish defender Alberto Moreno (centre) tries to gain possession during a training ground exercise . Mario Balotelli’s late penalty gave Liverpool victory in the first leg after he took the ball off Henderson to score the decisive goal, and Rodgers is confident that his team will finish the job in Istanbul. They are playing with renewed confidence having won seven of their last eight games away from home. Asked by local reporters if Liverpool were lucky at Anfield last week, he replied: ‘No I don’t think so. Besiktas had two shots on our goal and our goalkeeper had to make one save of note. Simon Mignolet made a very good save from Demba Ba but apart from that we dominated the game. ‘But we respect our opponents. We haven’t arrived in Turkey being arrogant enough to think it will be comfortable. We understand it will be a difficult game but this is a team that is playing very well away from home, not just at Anfield. Away from home we’re performing extremely well. This is another challenge to that but we look forward to it.’ Liverpool carry a 1-0 advantage after Balotelli took the ball off Jordan Henderson to score from the spot . Sterling insists the atmosphere in Istanbul won't be any more intimidating than Anfield . England international Raheem Sterling insists Liverpool’s young side are well equipped to handle a typically hostile atmosphere in Turkey. ‘The support in Turkey looks incredible,’ said Sterling. ‘It’s going to be a really exciting game, for me personally as well, because I’ve always wanted to play in Turkey and see what the fans are like. ‘Everyone says how amazing they are. People say “you might get intimidated” but I think the fans at Anfield are quite intimidating as well. So I don’t think it will be too different. ‘Coming away to play in Turkey, it’s going to be difficult and we know that. We’ ve got to stick to our game plan that the manager has set out for us. We’ll be trying to play possession football and attacking football at the same time.’","Liverpool face Besiktas in Europa League last 32 second leg on Thursday .

Gold Coast tripled over the past year, with 142 Griffith University students registered - up from 44, while Bond University jumped from 21 to 100. The third highest state is Victoria with 418 students using cashed-up older men. Canberra was fourth on the leader board with 165 sugar baby sign ups, followed by Western Australia with 155 and in last place was South Australia with 129 students. The statistics only show students who registered with their university email addresses, as part of an incentive to get a free premium membership. With thousands of sugar daddies currently living across Australia, they are providing between $3000 to $20,000 allowance per month or even paying off university debts for their babies. While Australia’s university fees have increased by 30 per cent over the past six years for local students, tuition for international students has increased 166 per cent since 2002, according to the International Education Advisory Council. The new figures found college students now make up over 42 per cent of Sugar Baby memberships, making them the largest demographic on the website. Seeking Arrangement is an American dating company that allows Sugar Babies to enjoy a life of luxury by being pampered with fine dinners, exotic trips and allowances from men who have an income of over $200,000. An average sugar baby's age is 19-26 and the average sugar daddy is as young as 39. Sugar daddies are mostly professional men – ranging from lawyers, doctors, engineers, architects, executives, corporate sectors and accountants. ‘Why hope for financial aid when you can guarantee it with a Sugar Daddy?’ Founder and CEO of Seeking Arrangement Brandon Wade said. ‘Student loans lead to endless debt, which amounts to more than a new graduate can handle. Sugar Scholarships provide real solutions to the problem of student debts,’ he said. With thousands of sugar daddies currently living across Australia, they are providing an average of $3000 allowance per month to their 'babies' One Gold Coast woman, who wanted to be known as Annaliese, 39, told Gold Coast Bulletin that she was in an arrangement with one sugar daddy for nine years. ‘I was drawn to it in the first place because I wanted to meet a better class of people – people I wouldn’t necessarily meet in my circle of friends,’ she told Gold Coast Bulletin. ‘They are normal, very successful and busy men – but they worry about the people who come into their lives – there’s not a lot of trust there. ‘This way they can filter out the people they’re interested in before they reveal their identities. 'It strikes me how lonely people are – they’re disconnected because of business and sometimes they just want to be friends.'","Students across Australian universities who signed up for a sugar daddy has increased by 25 per cent over the past year .

"With a swing of his right boot unleashing a sumptuous curling strike into the top corner of Danijel Subasic's net, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had breathed hope into Arsenal's Champions League ambitions as the game entered added time. After an atrocious performance against a Monaco side that only scored four times in the group stages, a 2-1 defeat, rather than 2-0, gave a different dimension to the cup tie for Arsene Wenger's side. Those Arsenal fans left inside The Emirates could sense it. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hauled Arsenal back into the Champions League tie with Monaco with a late goal . Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic dived left but was unable to get close to Oxlade-Chamberlain's strike . But Oxlade-Chamberlain lost possession three minutes later, his error resulting in Monaco's third goal . But only three minutes and seven seconds later, that hope had turned into a dying breath for Arsenal and it was Oxlade-Chamberlain who helped administer what could prove to be the knock-out blow. He ran into trouble in midfield, lost possession to Bernardo Silva and once again, Monaco sprang into attack. Arsenal had too many men forward as the tired legs of their defenders tried desperately to keep up with Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, a 74th minute substitute, who gleefully raced clear and punished Oxlade-Chamberlain with a finish so cool and clinical, Dimitar Berbatov, the man he replaced, was undoubtedly tipping his hat. Realising the cost of his mistake, England international Oxlade-Chamberlain covers his face with his shirt . Theo Walcott (left) consoles team-mate Oxlade Chamberlain after the game had ended at The Emirates . The England international could see the damage his mistake had caused, covering his face with his shirt as Monaco celebrated extending their advantage to two goals. On March 17, Arsenal will be in Monaco for the return leg, where there will only be room for the merciless finishing and defensive stubbornness that they were subjected to on their own patch on Wednesday.","Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored to give Arsenal hope against Monaco .

"Arsenal usually spread around the goals and the glory. They had hit the net 76 times this campaign but now, in their biggest game of the season, they drew a blank until injury-time. While Arsenal’s strikeforce do not have the class of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, they should still have been good for more than Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s late goal against Monaco. At times Olivier Giroud, usually so reliable, Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil, Danny Welbeck and the deeper-lying Santi Cazorla looked like they had never played together. Arsenal's expensively assembled front line look dejected during  the 3-1 Champions League loss to Monaco . Main men Alexis Sanchez (centre) and Olivier Giroud (third right) could not find the net at the Emirates . Arsenal centre forward Giroud was particularly guilty of missing several inviting chances . Chile international Sanchez has gone off the boil since his blistering start to the season . Here at the Emirates Stadium, the five figures Arsene Wenger turned to in this first leg failed him. Miserably, as it turned out, because his former club Monaco romped to a 3-1 victory. Despite Giroud’s catastrophic miss in the second half, when he skied a shot into the stands after Danijel Subasic had failed to hold Sanchez’s shot, there was something wrong about the reaction when he was substituted. Arsenal were 2-0 down by the time Giroud was replaced by Theo Walcott in the 62nd minute. He left to howls of derision from home supporters. Giroud, who has been leading the line brilliantly of late, did not deserve that. This Monaco side are the clean-sheet kings, with five in their six Champions League group games against Bayer Leverkusen, Zenit St Petersburg and Benfica. They are a resilient bunch . The first cries of ‘Come on Arsenal, come on Arsenal’ came after half an hour, betraying frustration that the forward line had hit a brick wall. They had Tomas Rosicky, Walcott and Oxlade-Chamberlain sitting on the bench. Something had to change. Danny Welbeck (second left) races through but could not add to his meagre tally of goals for the season . Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil (centre) struggles to evade the attention of Monaco defenders . Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic claims another cross as Arsenal struggle to get on the scoresheet . In-form Santi Cazorla had a relatively quiet game in comparison to his recent displays for the Gunners . Last weekend, when Arsenal went to Crystal Palace and won 2-1, they kept plenty in reserve by boxing clever. Here they lacked any punch, with the killer instinct deserting them after Monaco had taken a surprise lead through Geoffrey Kondogbia’s deflected strike. Arsenal struggled to find their rhythm, blocked by the powerful presence of Wallace, who might have given away a penalty when he appeared to handle, and Aymen Abdennour. It is rare for this Gunners team to look around for answers but they lacked conviction, returning to the bad old days when they believed they could walk the ball into the net. Monaco took a surprise lead after Geoffrey Kondogbia (left) shot was deflected off Per Mertesacker . Former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov doubled Monaco's lead with a smart finish . Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco celebrates after coming on to score their third in injury time . Sometimes Sanchez wants it too much, as he did on Saturday when he was taken out of his comfort zone in the victory over Palace. The Chilean has been desperate to get things going again, to hit another purple patch like the one which saw him score in successive games against Hull, Burnley, Anderlecht and Swansea in the autumn. Sanchez was electric then, the spark in this Arsenal team while they waited for the return of Ozil from his injury lay-off. There were chances to make an impression in the first half, but Arsenal lacked the expression that they have shown during their recent run of good form. Giroud hit a couple of chances high and wide in the opening 45 minutes and it is fair to say that much more was expected of the man up top. Arsene Wenger watches on as his Champions League hopes look to end in the last 16 for another season . Arsenal couldn't score despite calling on the likes of substitute Theo Walcott (second left) Ozil produced some lovely touches, including a cushioned lay-off into the path of Hector Bellerin as he made his way into the penalty area. For some reason, referee Deniz Aytekin penalised the full back for a foul. Walcott offered an alternative when he came on, forcing a save from Subasic that fell at the feet of Welbeck. His follow-up shot struck Walcott and flew over. Wenger gambled, sending for Oxlade-Chamberlain to replace Francis Coquelin with 22 minutes left. He provided a goal, only for Arsenal to blow it again. Big time. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) came on to finally score, but Gunners have it all to do in the second leg .","Arsenal were defeated 3-1 by Monaco in Champions League last 16 clash .

"The hair is fair once again but in other respects it was the same old grumpy Fernando Torres that Liverpool and Chelsea fans will recognise as he suffered a nightmare return to the Champions League with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night. Torres, who played a cameo in Chelsea's 2012 Champions League triumph, had waited 10 long months to take part in Europe's top club competition, last appearing in Chelsea's defeat against Atletico in last April's semi-final. Since then, he has been shown the door by Jose Mourinho and sent out on loan back to Madrid by his new club AC Milan.

Torres (right) and his Atletico team-mates are incensed after his 75th minute headed goal was disallowed . The Spanish striker continues his protests as he asks the official behind the line why his goal was ruled out . With Atletico trailing 1-0 to Leverkusen, the script was written for Torres to save the day when he was sent on as a 64th minute substitute by Diego Simeone. At one time, particularly around his Euro 2008 peak, Torres would have been the hero. Not any more. His 75th minute header from close range was ruled out because referee Pavel Kralovec adjudged the initial Atletico corner to have gone out of play before it reached the stooping Spaniard at the far post. Torres looked irritated by that decision, waving his arms in impotent fury. And further sulking was to come, in the final minute he was chopped down by Emir Spahic. Enraged, he got up and shoved the nearest Leverkusen player to him, which happened to be Son Heung-Min. Torres became the 10th player on the night to be booked and soon after the final whistle blew, leaving last season's beaten Champions League finalists to contemplate going out at the last-16 stage this time.

The second leg, in which Atletico have to claw back a 1-0 deficit without another ex-Chelsea player Tiago who was sent off in Germany, might be the last chance for 30-year-old Torres to show he still has super-human powers, even if they haven't been seen for a number of years. He signed for Milan in the summer, scored one goal for them in Serie A, and though Atletico fans were excited by his three goals in the Copa del Rey, he is still looking for his first strike in La Liga. And yet, Atletico is the club where it all started for him. The fans love him and the team need him as Simeone admitted. 'I brought on Torres because we needed some fresh impetus,' he said. 'We have a lot of injuries and suspensions going into the second leg but we still have hope.' Torres will have to put the tetchiness of the first leg behind him and start smiling, and scoring, again quickly.","Fernando Torres made a first appearance in 10 months in the Champions League on Wednesday night .

"Luis Suarez has revealed the boos aimed in his direction from Manchester City fans inspired his double for Barcelona on Tuesday night. The frontman scored twice as Barcelona earned a 2-1 Champions League last-16 first leg win at the Etihad Stadium. Suarez, who split opinion among football fans during his two-and-a-half years playing for Liverpool in the Premier League, says the hostile reception he received on his first return to England since his £75million summer move, spurred him on to score.

'There are certain types of players like me who get more inspired, more motivated when fans boo them - it helps motivate you a bit more.' Part of Barcelona's fearsome trio alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar, Suarez opened the scoring on 16 minutes as he fired a left-footed shot past goalkeeper Joe Hart after the ball had landed kindly for him in the box.

"Arsenal were left feeling red-faced on Wednesday night after not only falling to a humiliating defeat at the hands of Monaco, but also hyping themselves up in pre-game banter between them and their French opponents on social media. The Gunners face an uphill battle to qualify for the last eight of the Champions League after a heavy 3-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium, but prior to the game they were certainly confident - with the club's social media team expressing that in abundance on their official Twitter account. They began the exchange simply with: 'And how about you @AS_Monaco? Feeling confident? Nervous? Worried?' Arsenal and Monaco engaged in Twitter banter on their respective accounts prior to Wednesday night's game . Alexis Sanchez had scored in his last four Champions League games at the Emirates prior to facing Monaco . The Ligue 1 side responded candidly by merely stating they were 'just feeling excited to play in such a big match', before the Gunners upped the ante by asking which player they should look out for - with star name Falcao now on Manchester United's books. The French team then asked if Dimitar Berbatov would fit the bill, adding that the Gunners fans were very complementary of him during his time at north London rivals Tottenham. While admitting they knew all too well of the veteran striker's talents, the north Londoners quashed his impact by stating former striker Nicklas Bendtner made the difference that day when Berbatov hit the net for Spurs in a derby meeting in December 2007. Former Tottenham man Dimitar Berbatov enjoyed his second-half strike which put the game beyond Arsenal . Oliver Giroud and Mesur Ozil cannot fail to hide their gloom after Berbatov's crucial goal . Arsene Wenger endured a night to forget against his former side Monaco at the Emirates . The next reply from Arsenal would come back to haunt them as they sent the French side a graphic of star striker Alexis Sanchez, with the stat that he had scored in his last four Champions League games at the Emirates prior to Wednesday night's clash. The French side had the last word though, and in superb fashion, thanking Arsenal for their warning but reminding Arsene Wenger's men that they had - and still do have - the best defensive record in the Champions League - conceding just once in the group stages. A number of Arsenal fans asked for the club to stop engaging in the Twitter banter throughout the exchanges, believing it could jinx their chances before the game even started. Unfortunately for them they were proved right, as the Gunners suffered a heavy defeat with Berbatov and Co having the last laugh.","Arsenal lost 3-1 to Monaco on Wednesday night in their last-16 Champions League clash at the Emirates .

"Travelling support . Monaco may only have 37,000 residents but they still managed to take up their allocation of 3,000 away tickets at Arsenal, all of whom were bedecked in either red or white and organised into the correct rows in order to represent the Monaco national flag. As is traditional, they made more noise than the Emirates home crowd. A Monaco supporter orchestrates the 3,000 travelling away fans at the Emirates . Bare bones . Monaco had already had to cut their cloth in the summer, loaning Radamel Falcao and selling James Rodriguez, in a bid to comply with UEFA’s financial fair play restrictions and to take account of a £35m payment they had to make to the French league. So, having their entire back four out injured on Wednesday as well as captain Jeremy Toulalan suspended, they really were down to the ‘bare bones’ by Monte Carlo standards. Monaco skipper Jeremy Toulalan (above) was suspended for the clash and the back four were all injured . No part-time prince . His Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco, the ruler of the principality, who was in London for the game is another who was part of the club when Wenger was there. The Prince is no part-time glory hunter, however. He took in Swansea-West Ham on a recent visit to Wales for Six Nations rugby, demonstrating an admirable fan-like devotion for sneaking an extra match in to a trip. Prince Albert II of Monaco (centre) was in attendance for the match at the Emirates . Francis' new deal . Franics Coquelin’s new four-year deal with the club should be announced soon. The Frenchman was concerned he wasn’t in Wenger’s mind as a first-team player - but starting such an important tie as this one was another demonstartion of the manager’s faith. Even Mikel Arteta’s return from injury won’t derail his progress with the club viewing Coquelin as their key holding midfield. Francis Coquelin, in action against Monaco, is set to have new four-year at Arsenal announced soon . Don't forget the youngsters . It’s been an overlooked fact in the focus on the glamorous transfers at Monaco, which started with Mark Hateley and Glenn Hoddle, but Monaco have run one of the great youth programmes in French football. Thierry Henry, Emmanuel Petit, Lilian Thuram from the 1998 World Cup winning team came through their ranks and Wednesday's starting eleven featured Almamy Toure and Anthony Martial, both graduates from the youth team. Arsenal legend Thierry Henry (right), pictured in action against Juventus, came through the ranks at Monaco . Familiar face for Wenger . There aren’t many still left at Monaco associated with Arsene Wenger’s time at the club. But Jean Petit, who was Wenger’s assistant, is still a coach at the club and Wenger revealed that they still meet up whenever the Arsenal manager is back in town to have lunch and ‘talk about the good old times.’ Jean Petit (right) served as a coach under Arsene Wenger at Monaco and is still there now .","Monaco's 3,000 fans made more noise than the Arsenal supporters .

"Arsene Wenger is unlikely to have popped out the 'pop-out Wenger' souvenir from the match-day programme to place on his mantelpiece. He will not want any reminder of the occasion, his first reunion with Monaco. Rather like his 1,000th Arsenal game, a 6-0 defeat at Chelsea, this turned out to be a long sentimental preamble followed by 90 disastrous minutes.

Kondogbia (centre) celebrates with his Monaco team-mates after putting his side ahead at The Emirates . Berbatov celebrates scoring Monaco's second in front of a stunned Emirates crowd . He seemed utterly dejected as he tried to analyse the performance. All the recent glimmers of encouragement were washed away and what seemed a genuine chance to reach the last eight of the Champions League for the first time in five years turned into one of the worst European performances of the Wenger era. Even after 15 years of elite European football, Arsenal still gallop headlong into these two-legged ties with astonishing naivety. With priorities all wrong, too loose at the back, without urgency on the ball, unable to prevent an away goal, over-committed to attack and unable to recognise the signs and adjust when things are going so badly it's time cut losses. Perhaps after routinely drawing powerhouses like Bayern Munch, Barcelona and AC Milan at this stage, they thought it was too easy. It had been received as a good draw when the teams were paired, back in December; one Arsenal had dared to hope for, and then this… . Boom, to quote the firecracker launched from the away end as the travelling fans celebrated Dimitar Berbatov scoring Monaco's second of the night. Berbatov, a former Tottenham striker, had been jeered when he first touched the ball, but the home crowd seemed to have lost interest in such tactics of intimidation by the time he lashed the ball past David Ospina, early in the second half. Don't expect to see any jubilant 'selfies' from the home dressing room to go viral after this one. For Wenger and his players, thoughts quarter-finals suddenly seem a long way off against Leonardo Jardim's team who rarely leak goals even last night when they were without their entire first-choice back-four. Jardim's team were well-drilled and composed in their defensive duties. The revitalised team from the millionaire's paradise on the Med parked the Bentley. Then they suckered Arsenal on the break as they admired the wheels. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pulled a goal back for Arsenal in stoppage team with strike from the edge of the area . Danijel Subasic, the Monaco goalkeeper, leaps to his left but is unable to keep out Oxlade-Chamberlain's shot . But with one of the final kicks of the game, Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco made the score 3-1 to Monaco . Monaco have never lost to English opposition in the knock-out rounds of this competition and it will take a heroic effort from Wenger's team in the second leg to buck that trend. Chelsea have fought back from 3-1 down to win at this stage of the Champions League, twice in the last three years, but that was with the second leg at home. And, that was Chelsea, a mature team with strength and character. After watching this game, it is hard to imagine Arsenal keeping a clean sheet in the Stade Louis II as they pour forward in search of goals. The win at Manchester City offered encouragement but last night the defensive problems were back in full force, while in possession they lacked any urgency until Theo Walcott came on and the strikers misfired badly. Wenger's decision to replace Olivier Giroud was celebrated by home fans who hailed him a two goal-hero in the FA Cup against Middlesbrough on his last outing at the Emirates Stadium. It is a painfully delicate balance inside the Arsenal family. On came Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to join Santi Cazorla in one of the holding midfield partnerships you thought you would never see. It was a night to forget for Arsenal's players, as they slumped to a Champions League defeat against Monaco . Olivier Giroud was unable to inspire Arsenal in an underwhelming performance from Wenger's side . Danny Welbeck (centre) lifted a good chance over the bar in the early exchanges of Arsenal against Monaco . Wenger was frantically gambling long before his team set foot in Monte Carlo. No sooner had Oxlade-Chamberlain pulled one back to offer a lifeline, than Arsenal fell to pieces again and gifted Monaco the third. After months of planning since the draw in December, this was such a hastily scrambled mess. The original midfield pairing of Cazorla and Francis Coquelin, so impressive and well balanced since it came together, was missing as Monaco took the lead. A ripple of discontent washed around the Emirates, an oh-no-not-again ripple. This place has yet to witness any of those truly great European nights which Highbury enjoyed. Perhaps until it does, it will always seem strangely cold and corporate. There were times last night when the away fans made more noise, with their colour-coordinated plastic ponchos, which had the pleasing effect of producing a large Monaco flag. For Wenger this was Champions League match number 161. His status as one of the iconic modern coaches was underlined by the build-up to a game which was all about him. Monaco's supporters wore colour-coordinated ponchos that displayed the Monaco flag . Arsenal defender and captain Mertesacker was not his usual authoritative self for his team on Wednesday . Hector Bellerin (left) of Arsenal tries to deliver a cross as Monaco's Anthony Martial (right) tries to close down . Giroud was substituted after an hour after a hapless display from the striker as Arsenal lost to Monaco . But the nearest he has ever been to lifting this trophy came in Paris, nine years ago, when a team reduced to ten men, could not cling on to a lead and were beaten by Barcelona. This morning, after such a sobering night, those giddy heights seem unlikely to be scaled again. Will he ever win it? The dream is fading.","Geoffrey Kondogbia's deflected strike in the 38th minute put Monaco ahead .

Season ticket holder Hammad added that Neymar's comments in Brazilian media about the row, where he said 'my mother gave me an education. What his mother did not tell him, my mother taught me' were not directed at him, because he does not speak Portuguese. 'To clarify, I did have an altercation with Neymar but his quotes in the media weren't directed at me,' Hammad said. 'I didn't understand him as I don't speak Portuguese and he doesn't understand English - I wasn't the one who his quotes were directed at.' Hammad alleges that Neymar could have been referring to a Portuguese supporter who he may have exchanged words with. 'I don't speak Portuguese,' Hammad said. 'I sit lower tier, the Portuguese fan was upper tier.' The same fan had earlier taunted Neymar and the Barcelona  bench after Lionel Messi's missed penalty . Neymar confronted the fan by offering a hand signal to beckon him over from the stands . The Manchester City fan is then seen making a diving motion at the Brazilian forward after full-time . Hammad said the clash started shortly after Lionel Messi missed a penalty for Barcelona in the final moments of the game. 'My first interaction with Neymar was when Messi missed the penalty - I made a diving gesture to the bench, just the same as everyone else,' Hammad said. 'Neymar pointed and singled me out, he gestured for me to go towards him. I told him to come to me, the next thing final whistle blew. 'Neymar walked around towards me and came face to face. He said things in Portuguese but I don't speak Portuguese. Stewards told me I was in trouble and Neymar walked off. That was the end until the video was sent to me. 'I was just doing what everyone else was and I couldn't believe the reaction. Most players just ignore fan gestures and taunts.' Hammad admitted that taunting players is not acceptable behaviour but believes players must be able to ignore it, due to the number of fans that do it.

"Thibaut Courtois expects to keep his place in the Chelsea team for the Capital One Cup final but admits he has never been involved in a competitive penalty shoot-out. It adds another dimension to a familiar selection dilemma for Jose Mourinho, who could opt for Petr Cech at Wembley, the hero of the 2012 Champions League final when he saved three Bayern Munich penalties. The Chelsea manager could even send on Cech as a penalty expert if Sunday’s final against Tottenham is heading for spot-kicks, as his mentor Louis van Gaal did with Holland keeper Tim Krul in the World Cup.

I’ve only been in one shoot-out, in a friendly tournament with Atletico Madrid.’ Courtois arrived in London last year after spending three years on loan at Atletico and has become Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, starting 28 games this season to Cech’s 12. Mourinho, however, keeps them guessing. Cech was a surprise starter against Everton in the Barclays Premier League two weeks ago. He produced a splendid display but was back on the bench for the next game, away at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. He has not conceded a goal in the Premier League since March when he was beaten by a John Terry own goal.

It’s the manager’s decision, but if you come back from loan, obviously you want to play as much as possible. Otherwise it’s better to keep being on loan. ‘I think Petr and I have both done well. We’ve helped the team every time we could.’ The Belgian was in goal when Chelsea conceded five at White Hart Lane on New Year’s Day and was left out of the next three games, before returning to play in both legs of the Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool.","Chelsea take on Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley .

The man attempts to forcibly gain entry to the Paris Metro train but struggles with passengers on board .

'Opposition supporters using terms as a form of identity is no excuse for abusive chanting or behaviour. The club asks that all supporters realise such actions cause huge offence to those around them. 'If we receive evidence that supporters have engaged in anti-Semitic or any other form of discriminatory chanting or behaviour, we will take the strongest possible action, including supporting criminal prosecution.

'Chelsea is proud of the diversity within our club and our vision embraces equality regardless of race, gender, sexuality, disability or religion. We all share the common cause of supporting our team.' Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley promises to be a passionate and exciting match with both sets of supporters contributing to an excellent occasion. After consultation between the Metropolitan Police and both clubs, we would like to remind supporters of their responsibilities on the day. For a small minority, this game has historically brought a deeply unpleasant and unwanted level of anti-Semitic abuse, which has no place in football or anywhere in society. As such, we urge everyone to keep their support positive. Opposition supporters using terms as a form of identity is no excuse for abusive chanting or behaviour. The club asks that all supporters realise such actions cause huge offence to those around them.

"It  was the night after Liverpool had been put to the sword by Manchester United and Raheem Sterling was at home in turmoil. He was trying to unwind by watching television but his mind was back at Old Trafford. Sterling had squandered three glorious chances during a 3-0 defeat that left Liverpool in 10th place and he felt personally responsible. Raheem Sterling rediscovered his goal scoring form after watching footage of his misses against Man United . The forward laughs with Daniel Sturridge (left) ahead of Liverpool's Europa League clash with Besiktas . Sterling could not find a way past an inspired David de Gea in December's 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford . The England international reacts after missing three golden chances against the Reds' arch rivals . Some players are able to move on swiftly but Sterling had been sent clips of his duel with David de Gea by Liverpool’s analytics department and he wanted to see how he had been outwitted, so he pressed ‘Play’. He watched them so much it was as if they were on a permanent loop. It made uncomfortable viewing, but triggered the required response. On December 14, Sterling had just three goals to his credit but he will face Besiktas in the Europa League this evening having moved his tally impressively to 10. That bleak afternoon in Manchester was a watershed. ‘That day for me was massive,’ said the England international. ‘I had a few chances to win us the game and I missed them. I was devastated. I went home and watched the clips over and over again. I watched it just to see what I could have done better. ‘United was a low day because everyone at this club wants to win those games and I had missed the chances that would have helped us do that. It was definitely a real low and I had to pick myself up quickly.’ Sterling responded by scoring a brace in Liverpool's next game, a 2-0 FA Cup victory against Bournemouth . The 20-year-old followed that up with the match-winning goal against Burnley in the Premier League . Despite Liverpool eventually being beaten, Sterling scored against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Two goals immediately after at Bournemouth, in a Capital One Cup quarter-final, helped rebuild his confidence but it was his finish in the Boxing Day win at Burnley that demonstrated progress; when Philippe Coutinho sent him scurrying through on goal, he didn’t look like missing. ‘The manager told me I was up front against Bournemouth and I was really focused,’ Sterling explained. ‘I wanted to improve my finishing and said next time I will be a bit more relaxed. ‘I said to myself the next time I get into the position like I did against United that I would just stay calm if that chance came. ‘My form has been a bit stop-start but for a young player it is natural. If I want to get to the next level, I need to be consistent. I have got 10 goals but I could easily have had 15 if I’d taken half of my chances. When the penny drops hopefully that will improve my game.’ Sterling wheels away after netting against West Ham at Anfield for his fifth Premier League goal . Sterling celebrates after scoring against Bolton to send Liverpool into the FA Cup quarter-finals . Sterling was on target again as Liverpool put pressure on top four rivals Southampton with a win at St Mary's . Sterling has been a hot topic for much of Liverpool’s season, primarily because the contract he has been offered by the club — one which Brendan Rodgers recently described as ‘a wonderful deal’ — remains unsigned. The 20-year-old, however, insists it is not a distraction. ‘I speak to my representative every day and he has told me to concentrate on playing football and he and the club will deal with it,’ said Sterling. ‘Hopefully it will be done soon. I’m focused on winning games and trying to do my best for this football club.’ Brendan Rodgers is expected to name a young side in Europe ahead of the weekend's clash with Man City . Sterling and Liverpool team-mates practice during training as their recent resurgence continues . It remains to be seen whether Sterling starts as Liverpool look to defend their 1-0 first-leg lead as Rodgers will need to make changes, given that his side face Manchester City 56 hours after they return from Istanbul. Rodgers travelled to Turkey without 10 established players, including Jordan Henderson (ankle), Steven Gerrard and the rested Philippe Coutinho, and he accepted that Manuel Pellegrini’s side will have an advantage for a game which will start at noon. ‘There wasn’t a great deal we could do about it,’ said Rodgers. ‘The Europa League is tough, especially when you don’t get help. It is unfortunate but we will do our best.’","Raheem Sterling missed three chances in 3-0 defeat by Manchester United .

"A feeble display from Arsene Wenger's side saw them sink to a 3-1 defeat at home to Monaco in the last 16 of the Champions League. Geoffrey Kondogbia put Monaco ahead after 38 minutes and former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov doubled the lead eight minutes into the second half. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain pulled one back as the game went into stoppage time, but Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco added a third for Monaco in the final seconds.

"Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero is determined not to let standards slip as he bids to get the club's season back on track. Aguero scored a sensational hat-trick against Bayern Munich on Tuesday to revive City's hopes in the Champions League. The prolific Argentinian took his goal tally for the season to 17 as he followed up an early penalty by striking twice in the last five minutes to hand City a dramatic 3-2 win at the Etihad Stadium. Sergio Aguero celebrates his third goal against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday night . Manchester City striker Aguero passes the ball beyond Manuel Neuer to seal a 3-2 victory for his side . It was City's first win in the competition this season and gives them hope of reaching the last 16 with victory at Roma next month. Aguero will also hope to maintain his form as the champions, who are eight points behind leaders Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League, travel to second-placed Southampton on Sunday. Aguero said: 'It was important to win. Apart from my goals the three points were vital, so we're delighted. I am happy with my form. This season things are going well for me and it is important to carry on like this and keep the results coming.' City were expected to take control against an already under-strength Bayern when Medhi Benatia was sent off for bringing down Aguero and the 26-year-old converted the resulting penalty. But Bayern regrouped and the brilliant Xabi Alonso equalised from a free-kick before Robert Lewandowski got between two defenders to put the visitors ahead. Aguero (right) gets City back on level terms at 2-2 after pouncing on a poor pass by Xabi Alonso . The former Atletico Madrid forward had given City the lead with a well-taken penalty in the first half . Time looked to be running out for City when Stevan Jovetic intercepted a rare bad pass from Alonso and Aguero burst clear to score five minutes from time. He pounced on another error in the last minute to snatch victory. Aguero said: 'In the first half we got the first goal and we were doing more or less okay but then we lost two goals when we didn't expect it. 'In the second half we applied a bit more pressure and luckily we got the win. We've a chance now in Rome to qualify and it's a question of going there and winning and just thinking about ourselves.' City are yet to find their stride this season and without the output of Aguero their position might be well below where they would expect to be. Manchester City's players celebrate after Aguero's late winning goal at the Etihad stadium on Tuesday . Defender Bacary Sagna admitted the performances of Aguero were setting the standard for the rest of team. Sagna said: 'He is bringing the team up at the moment. I think we will have to follow his steps. He showed the right example. 'He keeps fighting and in front of goal he is clinical. As long as he keeps scoring we can be happy.'","Sergio Aguero scored a hat-trick as Manchester City beat Bayern Munich .

"Russia manager Fabio Capello will be forced to appear before parliament to explain the country's dismal showing at the World Cup in Brazil. The head of the State Duma's Sports Committee, Igor Anansikh, says he will demand Capello explain to lawmakers how he intends to improve the Russian side and make them more competitive. Under Capello, Russia failed to win a game in Brazil - drawing 1-1 with both Algeria and South Korea, as well as losing 1-0 to Belgium - and finished third, leading to a group stage exit. Hearing: Russia coach Fabio Capello will have to appear before parliament to explain their dismal World Cup . Dismal: Russia failed to win a game an were eliminated in the group stages in the World Cup in Brazil . Since 2008, Capello has earned £26m from his time as England and Russia manager, delivering just a solitary World Cup victory over two campaigns. Capello signed a new £7million-a-year contract extension in January which ties him to the Russian Football Union (FUR) until 2018 - when the country will host the World Cup for the first time. The FUR expect the team to be competitive by the time the country hosts football's biggest tournament in four years' time and parliament will seek assurances over how the Italian intends to turn their fortunes around. But if the FUR were to terminate Capello's contract then they could be forced to pay the Italian £15m in compensation. Amazingly, before his contract renegotiation Capello would only have been due £3m if he had been sacked, according to ITAR-Tass. And when he was in charge of England, Capello was paid an estimated £6m-a-year. Since January 2008 when he accepted the Three Lions job, Capello has been paid close to £26m and has delivered just a solitary win over two World Cup campaigns. Wage: Capello, 68, is paid a huge £7million-a-year by the Russian Football Union . 'Thief': To release Capello from his contract would cost the Russian Football Union £15m . The vast sums Capello has been paid have led to the Russian ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovski brandishing him as a 'thief'. Russian politician Oleg Pakholkov has also demanded that the Italian returns all - or at least half - of the £10m he has received from the Russian Federation for the delivery of a 'shameful' result. Anansikh also that told R-Sport and Lenta.ru that he believed 'the current Russia team is one of the weakest in the last 15-20 years'. Capello, however, defended his record as Russia manager and how his side performed at the World Cup upon their exit. The 68-year-old said: 'With this team we got to the World Cup for the first time in 12 years. 'I think I did a good job so far and it is a pity that we could not go forward.' Money: Capello was paid £6m-a-year as England manager but failed at the 2010 South Africa World Cup .

"A 16-year-old boy whose life was strictly controlled by his protective parents appeared in court today accused of their murders. The homeschooled  teen, who has not been named, appeared before a judge wearing an orange prison jumpsuit on Tuesday over the murders of his parents, Ryan and Maria Elena Callens, aged 48 and 49 respectively. The teenager was shackled at the wrists and ankles but appeared calm during the hearing in Frisco, Texas, reports revealed. He remained in custody after being charged with the double murder. Scroll down for video . Ryan Callens, 48, and his wife Maria Elena, 49, were killed by their youngest son at 2am on Monday, police said. Neighbors revealed that the parents were 'strict' with the 16-year-old boy . According to The Dallas Morning News, following a 911 call from the home at 2am on Monday, officers arrived on the scene to find the boy sitting outside the home alongside his elder sister who was extremely distressed. According to court documents on Tuesday that the sister was overheard asking: 'What do you mean you did it?' The teen accused answered: 'I did it', according to the News, before the sister responded: 'Was this your plan?' He did not reply and was taken into police custody after indicating that he had left the gun in the home. Officers found Mr Callens lying on the floor with a gunshot wound and a rifle with a flashlight taped to it, according to The Dallas Morning News. Mrs Callens was found in the master bedroom with bullet wounds to her head and arm. The autopsies on the couple, who have four other children, have not yet been completed. The 16-year-old's next hearing is in two weeks. Mr Callens owned his own company, Callens Innovation Group. Mrs Callens homeschooled the teenage suspect at their Texas home. Police have no motive in the murders . The boy was described as 'very sheltered' by neighbors after being arrested for allegedly shooting dead his 'strict' parents. The 16-year-old was barred from drinking soda, had all of his online activities monitored and wasn't allowed to watch any R-rated movies. The PG-13 films he watched were screened to remove violence and other adult content, neighbors revealed. Jonathan Marcum, 15, who played with the teenage suspect, said the Callens closely monitored what their son did online and restricted what he was allowed to watch and even what he ate, according to the Dallas Morning News. 'They didn't allow any PG-13 movies, and if they did they would have it on Clear Play, which would take all the violent moments and skip it,' Marcum told KXAS-TV. 'So there was pretty much no violence in that family.' Teens in the neighborhood said the Callens were very strict with the 16-year-old suspect and that any time the teen broke the rules, he would be punished. 'His parents were really uptight on him,' William Castillo, who played sports with the boy, told the Morning News. Neighbors said the boy went to public elementary school and middle school. However, his parents kept him out of the classroom and homeschooled him instead of sending him to high school. One neighbor said the teen preferred it that way and that he said he'd 'never go back' to school. The murders shook up the quiet, middle-class neighborhood in Frisco, Texas, where the Callens lived. The family, even the teenage suspect, were known to their neighbors as friendly . Authorities removed several bags of evidence from the home, including a computer. They worked at the crime scene until well into the evening on Monday . The teenage suspect was the youngest of the Callens' five children. He has two siblings who are in college, one who just finished college and an older sister who attends Centennial High School in Frisco. At least one sibling was home at the time, but was not hurt, authorities said. Neighbors in the middle-class neighborhood were shocked by the murders, according to KTVT. They described the teenager as a 'good kid' and said that the Callens were friendly fixtures in the neighborhood, where they have lived for eight years. 'From what we saw, he had a very good heart,' Nikki Williston, 15, told the Morning News. Authorities have not said where the teen got the gun he used to kill his parents. Neighbors say they don't believe the Callens owned a firearm. Mr Callens owned his own company, The Callens Innovation Group, which he operated out of his home in Frisco. Police worked at the house until well into the evening on Monday - removing several bags of evidence, including at least one computer. Police said they do not have a motive in the killing.","Police arrived at Texas home in the early hours of Monday to find the teenage suspect outside with his extremely distressed sister .

"Appointed: Anthea McIntyre has been made an MEP, despite there having been no election and no votes cast . A Tory businesswoman was made Britain’s newest MEP yesterday without a single vote being cast. Anthea McIntyre from Ross on Wye, Herefordshire, was handed the £84,500-a-year post after Brussels said the UK had qualified for another seat in the European Parliament. The move results from the Lisbon Treaty which created an extra 18 MEPs. Britain qualified for one, which officials said should be for the West Midlands region. The Electoral Commission analysed the results of the 2009 European elections to decide who would have won the seat if it had then been contested. Foreign Office minister David Lidington announced yesterday that Miss McIntyre had been judged the winner. She is expected to take up her seat in Brussels next week, when she will also qualify for a range of lavish expenses and benefits. The total cost to the taxpayer of each MEP is estimated at more than £2million a year. UK Independence Party MEP Mike Nattrass condemned the method of Miss McIntyre’s election as deeply undemocratic. Mr Nattrass said: ‘It is an outrage that somebody becomes an MEP on the basis of a decision by the Electoral Commission, rather than a decision by the people of this country. Worse still that the individual is forced upon them by a party, not chosen by an electorate.’ 'I've got my bags packed': Miss McIntyre is all set to join her colleagues in the debating chamber of the European Parliament in Brussels . But Miss McIntyre, who has made a number of unsuccessful bids to enter Parliament, said she was ‘thrilled’ by the decision. She said she had faced a ‘long wait’ while the Lisbon deal was agreed by all 27 EU states. She added: ‘I have got my flight booked and I’m going to Brussels on Monday and I’m really looking forward to getting stuck in.’ European elections are decided by a complicated system of proportional representation involving lists of candidates drawn up by party officials. Miss McIntyre was the third candidate on the Conservative slate – making her the highest ranked losing candidate in 2009.","Anthea McIntyre's appointment a result of the Lisbon Treaty opening up extra UK seat .

"Pep Guardiola is normally one of football's cooler customers but has a habit of letting his frustrations boil over when things don't go his way - particularly when he is in Manchester. The Bayern Munich manager was visibly-upset after the 3-2 defeat by Manchester City - just as he was following a 1-1 draw against United at Old Trafford in April - and swore during his post-match press conference. 'I am sad for the players, they didn't deserve to lose,' Guardiola said. 'If we lose and we play s***, then we play s***. Pep Guardiola throws his arms up in frustration as Bayern Munich throw away a lead in the final minutes . Guardiola looks downcast as Manchester City surge back in the dying moments at the Etihad Stadium . The Bayern boss wasn't happy after his side snatched a defeat from the jaws of victory at the Etihad . Sergio Aguero celebrates after his winning goal against Bayern Munich at the Etihad on Tuesday . 'And if the opponent is better you just have to shake hands and say congratulations. So I am sad for the players because they didn't deserve to lose. They played amazingly. I am so sad.' Guardiola went on to say that the defeat could not have come at a better time for Bayern, insisting his side would learn from the mistakes that led to a first defeat since August. Munich had already secured top spot in Champions League Group E before their trip to Manchester but were 2-1 ahead and still in control of the contest until the 85th minute despite playing with 10 men for most of the match. Bayern boss Guardiola can barely watch as the game slips away from his stars . However, individual mistakes gifted two goals to the home side in the dying minutes as the English champions rallied for an unexpected victory. 'It is good that this happened here,' said Guardiola, who saw Sergio Aguero score all three goals against his usually well-drilled defence - the Argentine's hat-trick matches the total amount of goals Bayern have shipped in 12 Bundesliga games this season. 'This will be a lesson for us because if something like that happens in the round of 16 or the quarter-finals then you are out of the competition,' the Spaniard added. The Argentine powers his spot-kick beyond the outstretched hands of Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer . Bayern celebrate the goal from Xabi Alonso (centre) which gave them a 2-1 lead going into half-time . Bayern's only previous loss this season was against Borussia Dortmund in the German Super Cup in August, having since stretched their unbeaten run to 18 games. 'We lost and if we lose playing badly, then that is not good. But the team did not deserve to lose. I am very proud of my players.' Guardiola said. 'Playing for 70 minutes with 10 men against the English champions takes a lot of effort. We had a lot of personality.' 'Twice we lose the ball and twice we were punished,' winger Arjen Robben lamented. 'It is a real shame because we played really well. We deserved more.' 'We can be proud of ourselves because we did not hide. We were strong although we were a man less.'

"Prime Minister’s Questions should be shown live on TV in a prime time slot, Nick Clegg has claimed as he railed against the ‘ridiculous’ spectacle of MPs hollering at each other each week. The Lib Dem leader said voters should be able to send in questions to be answered by the Prime Minister as he called for an end to the ban on MPs calling each other by their names. In an extraordinary attack on parliamentary tradition, Mr Clegg condemned the ‘highly aggressive, macho, chest‑beating, testosterone‑driven’ charade which is deeply off‑putting to the public. Nick Clegg backed a Mumsnet petition calling for PMQs to be moved to an evening time slot so it can be watched live by more people . Mr Clegg warned that each failure to change the way Parliament is run, including party funding and electing the House of Lords, is ‘another nail in the coffin of public interest in participation in politics’. Senior politicians have repeatedly tried to alter the way the Commons is run, with David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband all vowing soon after becoming leader to change the culture of Prime Minister’s Questions. But attempts to end the heckling and insults rarely last long, despite repeated warnings that the public are put off by it. Asked what he would like to change about the Commons’ culture, Mr Clegg replied: ‘Pretty well everything. I just despair sometimes about just how totally out of step with modern life politics generally appears and, certainly, in the House of Commons.’ Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband go head-to-head at noon every Wednesday, meaning few people who work ever watch the clashes live. Mr Clegg backed a Mumsnet petition calling for PMQs to be overhauled and made more accessible. ‘I think it’s brilliant… basically saying, ‘When is Prime Minister’s Questions is going to be, a) scheduled to the time when people below the 65 watch it? When is it actually going to allow other people to ask questions? ‘When is it going to become less of this kind of Punch and Judy formula?’ The Deputy Prime Minister said he had tried - and failed - to make changes to the House of Lords and party funding . Mr Clegg told a Q&A with Mumsnet: ‘It’s just ridiculous. You can’t even call people by their name. You can’t even address people like human beings. ‘And so the whole thing is in a language which wasn’t used since 1867 and in a kind of highly aggressive, sort of, macho, chest‑beating, testosterone‑driven idiom which is deeply off‑putting to – to any normal person.’ Under Commons rules, MPs cannot refer to each other by name, but their constituency. It means Mr Clegg is known as ‘the Right Honorable member for Sheffield Hallam’. MPs must also speak through the chair, so instead of telling an opponent ‘you are wrong’, they must say ‘he is wrong’. MailOnline last year revealed details of letters sent to Commons Speaker John Bercow about behaviour at PMQs. MPs were branded them ‘morons’, ‘t**ts’, ‘braying donkeys’ and a throwback to the 19th century. David Cameron and Ed Miliband go head-to-head at noon every Wednesday, meaning few people who work ever watch the clashes live . MailOnline last year revealed details of letters sent to Commons Speaker John Bercow about behaviour at PMQs, branding MPs 'morons’, ‘t**ts’, ‘braying donkeys’ and a throwback to the 19th century. Mr Clegg said he had tried – and failed- to modernise Parliament. ‘I couldn’t even manage to persuade the powers that be to introduce a smidgen of democracy into the House of Lords or even change the rules by which parties were funded. ‘My own view is that every time the Westminster establishment fails to reform itself, whether it’s on how Prime Minister [Questions are] conducted, how parties are funded, whether you let voters in to decide who’s in the House of Lords… every time they do that, there is just another nail in the coffin of public interest in participation in politics.’ He said the failure to back change will ‘only make the later crises – which will come – in public confidence in politics all the worse.’ Meanwhile, Commons Speaker John Bercow last night urged MPs to complete the 'revolution' in Parliament triggered by the expenses scandal five years ago. In a speech at Westminster, Mr Bercow said that reforms passed after the public outcry over MPs' expense claims had had a 'transformative' effect on the work of the House. He highlighted in particular select committees, which had adopted a more confident, 'gladiatorial' approach since their members were elected in a secret ballot of party colleagues, with the chairmen elected by the whole House, rather than chosen by party whips. He suggested they should go further, extending the system of 'confirmation' hearings for important public appointments, following up their reports more vigorously and employing in-house researchers.","Lib Dem leader rails against the 'ridiculous' rules which put off voters .

"Shocking images of Charles Saatchi grabbing Nigella Lawson by the throat were said by him to show nothing more than a ‘playful tiff’. But now it appears the wealthy art collector’s ugly physical manhandling of his wife went further than first realised and may have lasted as long as 27 minutes. Disturbing photographs have emerged of Saatchi repeatedly tweaking and twisting Miss Lawson’s nose, and even putting a finger in one of her nostrils. Grab: Nigella looks tearful as her husband Charles Saatchi grabs her nose and closes her eyes as he twists it . She looks uncomfortable and upset throughout, and becomes tearful. The pictures were taken minutes after the infamous ‘throttling’ images were captured as the pair dined outside Scott’s restaurant in Mayfair earlier this month. The photographer who took them timed the incident at just under half an hour, describing it as ‘27 minutes of madness’. In . the nose-tweaking images, Saatchi is first shown lifting the end of his . wife’s nose and apparently peering up her nostrils, as she grimaces and . closes her eyes.She then uses a napkin to dab at her nose and eyes. Upset: Nigella's face reveals her agony as he husband continues to twist her nose . Shortly after, Saatchi, his back to . the camera, grabs at his wife’s nose again, and puts the tip of one of . his fingers inside her right nostril. She again looks upset and dabs at . her nose with the napkin. Initial . photographs showing the 70-year-old former advertising tycoon grabbing . his wife by the throat caused a furore when published a week ago. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault. TV . chef Miss Lawson, 53, apparently carried on with married life as normal . after the incident. But as soon as the pictures were published she left . the £14million family home in Chelsea to live in a £10,000-a-week . apartment in Mayfair. She . was seen outside on Wednesday and Friday without her wedding ring. On . Saturday a bulging bag of clothes was delivered, leading to speculation . that she is settling in for a long stay. Miss . Lawson has two children from her first marriage to journalist John . Diamond who died from throat cancer in 2001. She and Saatchi married ten . years ago. Yesterday her spokesman said she was maintaining her silence on her marriage difficulties. But . it emerged that in recent years she had been close to actor Paul Rhys, . 49, a father of one who appeared in the Spooks TV spy series, on one . occasion two years ago meeting him for a two-hour lunch. Miss Lawson . said at the time: ‘Paul’s a friend of mine.’ Mr Rhys’s girlfriend, Arkie . Whitely, died of cancer in the same year that Miss Lawson lost her . first husband to the disease'. Distress: Nigella pictured out in London as a member of her family delivers clothing to her flat on Saturday . Dining in: A tray of food is delivered to Nigella Lawson's £10,000-a-week rented Mayfair flat where she is now living after leaving the £14million family home in Chelsea . Movements: Charles Saatchi was seen leaving his home in Chelsea yesterday before jumping into a waiting cab . Concerns: As Nigella (pictured on Friday) faces a second week away from Mr Saatchi, 70, friends have said she wants him to undergo anger management therapy or counselling to control his volatile moods . A . source told the Sunday Mirror yesterday: ‘Paul can relate to Nigella in . the way only someone who has experienced bereavement can. He is a tower . of strength to her on occasions.’ Another . source, who has worked with Miss Lawson, told the newspaper it was . obvious she and Saatchi had had ‘rocky times’ over the past two years. The source said: ‘A lot of us involved on her telly shows knew if Nigella and Charles had been having arguments. 'It was often easy to tell if Nigella was feeling slightly upset or angry about something at home.’ Law meet: Raymond Tooth, the lawyer of Charles Saatchi and Fiona Shackleton, the lawyer for Nigella Lawson, met for a secret lunch at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair on Sunday . Yesterday, two of the country's top lawyers met for a secret lunch at the central London restaurant where Charles Saatchi grabbed the throat of his wife. Raymond Tooth, Saatchi's lawyer, and Baroness Fiona Shackleton, Miss Lawson's lawyer, were at Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, the same restaurant where Mr Saatchi was pictured arguing with his wife. The legal experts, considered the best in the country by some, hugged and kissed as they greeted each other on Mount Street. Tooth appeared to present Shackleton, dressed in a colourful floral outfit, with a small gift before they went inside the eatery. It is not known what the meeting was about.","Incident between Nigella and husband went on for longer than thought .

"A man is on an international quest to track down a couple after he stumbled across a long lost memory card with 1600 romantic happy snaps from their Australian honeymoon. Richard Pussell, who manages Sydney Aquarium, was carrying out a routine check of lost property on Tuesday when he found the camera card. The photos were taken in 2012 and document the mystery couple's entire trip around Australia from Kakadu and Ayres Rock to Melbourne and Sydney. Sydney man Richard Pussell found the camera memory card packed with photos from around Australia and tracked them down on Facebook . Mrs Benetti said she was initially mad at her husband for losing the pictures . 'We were doing an inventory of lost property and as usual there are lots of cameras. I found a box full so I took everything out and underneath there was a lonely SD card,' Mr Pussell told MailOnline. 'It had been there for a while so I took it home with the intent of reformatting it so I could use it in my camera.' Do you recognise this couple? Let us know who they are by emailing editorial@dailymailonline.co.uk . Mr Pussell said he was shocked to find hundreds of romantic photos of a couple in front of Australia's most famous landmarks. 'The first photo is of her showing off her wedding ring. The last photo is in (Sydney's) Darling Harbour. They're classic honeymoon photos and they've been everywhere,' he said. 'I couldn't bring myself to delete them.' The photos Mr Pussell found document Mr and Mrs Benetti's entire trip around Australia, like this shot from Kata Tjuta in the Northern Territory . Mrs Benetti was completely surprised and overwhelmed that she was reunited with the photos . The only information Mr Pussell has to go off is a photo of a welcome card in a hotel congratulating the 'Benetti's' on their recent marriage. He also suspects the couple are from Italy because a number of photos capture signs and plaques written in Italian. Mr Pussell posted a photo of the pair on Facebook on Tuesday to try and track them down in a bid to return the photos. His post on the mystery couple had been shared 100,000 times by Thursday morning. 'It would be a real shame if I couldn't find them,' he said. 'My wife and I got married two years ago and I thought imagine if we lost our photos.'

"The Christian mother who was sentenced to death in Sudan for refusing to become a Muslim was today dramatically freed from her latest detention - and could now come to the US. Meriam Ibrahim was let out after 48 hours in jail for problems with her paperwork that stopped her from leaving the African country. She is now set to fly to South Sudan and from there on to America where she could start her new life. Campaigners however have urged caution and said that they will wait until Meriam actually gets out of Sudan before celebrating. The US State Department is now under pressure to do everything in its power to ensure her swift and safe passage after being criticized by Senators for its response. Meriam’s release appeared chaotic as the Associated Press initially said she had been freed, only for multiple media outlets and MailOnline sources to say that she was in fact being kept in for another three days. Scroll down for video . Cruel twist: Meriam poses hours after her release with her husband, Daniel . (left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya and all . those who bravely fought for her freedom in Sudan . Secrets: The family were seized by the National . Intelligence Security Services, dubbed the 'Agents of Fear' by Amnesty . International, which accused them of a catalogue of abuses . Hours later it was revealed that she was being freed. The Guardian . said that Eman Abdul-Rahman, one of Meriam’s lawyers, said she had been . released from a police station in the capital Khartoum after pressure . from foreign diplomats on the Sudanese government to free her. Also . in custody with her in the police station cell in the Sudanese capital . Khartoum was her husband Daniel Wani, an American citizen, and their two . children, Maya, one month, and Martin, 21 months. Meriam . was only freed on Monday after nine months in jail for adultery and . apostasy, for which she was sentenced to death and 100 lashes. The . US State Department is now under renewed pressure to do everything in . it power to get Meriam out of the country after being criticised by Senators for its slow . response.She was detained again on Tuesday as she tried to fly out of Sudan from the airport in the capital Khartoum. The . mother-of-two was detained as she tried to fly out of the African . country hours after a death sentence against her was dropped. Dr . Ibrahim, 27, was charged with obtaining a false travel document and . giving false information to immigration officials - and banned from . leaving Sudan. The move was another twist of the knife as Dr Ibrahim tries to get to America with her two children where she can live with her husband, a US citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire. Menacing: . Meriam, her husband and children were detained by 40 National Security . guards on Tuesday . Mr Wani was also locked up with them . as an 'accessory' at the Al Sheradee police station in Khartoum after . being confronted at Khartoum airport by 40 agents of the feared National . Intelligence and Security Services. It . is believed they were trying to travel to Washington DC and Sudanese . media have claimed that the US vice consul was with the family at the . airport. A diplomatic row . erupted at the escape from Sudan and the Sudanese Foreign Ministry . summoned the American and South Sudanese ambassadors to explain . themselves. Dr Ibrahim had been granted emergency travel documents by the government of South Sudan to travel there and then on to the US. Mr Shareif insisted that the documents were legitimate and that it was ‘not right’ to claim otherwise. Dr Ibrahim was released from the grim Omdurman Women’s Prison on Monday after nine months in custody during which time she was sentenced to death and 100 lashes for apostasy and adultery and gave birth to Maya in her call whilst shackled to the floor. A judge had ruled that she had broken strict Islamic law by failing to renounce her Christian faith and become a Muslim. 'Barbaric': As well as the death sentence for apostasy (the crime of abandoning your religion) Ibrahim was also sentenced to 100 lashes for what the court deemed her adultery for marrying a Christian . On Monday an appeal court overturned . her conviction after an international outcry but on Tuesday she and her . family were detained again. They had been staying at a safe house because of threats to her life from her 'family'. A . man claiming to be Dr Ibrahim’s half brother went to the prison in . Khartoum the night she was released and, upon discovering she had been . freed, flew into a rage and vowed to kill her. According to CNN, al-Samani al-Hadi, said: ‘The family is unconvinced by the court’s decision. ‘We . were not informed by the court that she was to be released; this came . as a surprise to us. The law has failed to uphold our rights. This is . now an issue of honour. The Christians have tarnished our honour, and we . will know how to avenge it.’ Speaking . to Sudanese paper, al-Samani al-Hadi, said that Meriam had been . 'kidnapped' from the family who she should have been returned to, not . her husband. Fight for life: Mr Wani, an American citizen, has been fighting for his wife and children's release but his lawyers believe the help he has received from the US embassy has been 'shameful' State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in her Tuesday briefing that the Sudanese government had assured it of the safety of Dr Ibrahim and her family.

"Even David Cameron’s mother is not convinced about the merits of his gay marriage plans. Mary Cameron, 78, was asked at a lunch why her son was pressing head with the legislation which had alienated many grassroots Tories and said: ‘I know, David just won’t be told’. The policy was also heavily criticised by local activists and some Tory MPs, but Mr Cameron sees it as central to his modernisation drive. Right and wrong: Mr Cameron with his wife Samantha mother Mary who, when asked why her son was pressing ahead with gay marriage plans, said: 'I know, David just won't be told' He told MPs: ‘I don’t support gay marriage in spite of being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I am a Conservative.’ Mrs Cameron, 78, is a retired magistrate who once said her work had helped her to teach her son about right and wrong. She said: ‘I used to come home with stories sometimes, to almost warn the children about the perils of doing the wrong things.

"Comeback: Agnetha Faltskog pictured in her heyday when she sang with Abba . It has been 30 years since she turned her back on the glitz and glamour of the music world. But now Abba’s golden girl Agnetha Faltskog, is ready to launch a long-awaited comeback at the age of 62 – alongside Gary Barlow. Miss Faltskog has proved to be the band’s most elusive member and has largely shunned the limelight since the four went their separate ways in 1982. She pursued a solo career for a few years after the split but has since lived quietly on the secluded island of Ekero, west of Stockholm. The singer has said that she wasn’t even sure her voice still ‘worked’, as it had been so long since she had last sung. But two years ago she was approached by Swedish producer Jorgen Elofsson, who also penned Britney Spears’ Crazy and Kelly Clarkson’s Stronger, who asked if he could play her some songs he wanted to record. She says she found his approach ‘flattering’ but had reservations about stepping back into the studio after so many years. ‘It was flattering, it really was, ‘ she said. ‘I couldn’t say no. I really loved the songs from the beginning. But I told him “we have to talk about a lot of things first”. ‘It was nine or ten years since I’d sung so I didn’t know if I [my voice] worked.’ The new project will see her duet with Take That star Barlow on the song When You Really Loved Someone, the first track to be released from her new album ‘A’ – her first in a decade – which is out later this year. Abba burst on to the world stage in 1974 when they won the Eurovision song contest in Brighton with Waterloo. They went on to sell 350million records, and their greatest hits compilation album, Abba Gold, stayed in the charts for more than 400 weeks. Miss Faltskog was married to bandmate Bjorn Ulvaeus after first meeting him at a cafe when she was 19. Agnetha Faltskog is ready to launch a long-awaited comeback at the age of 62 alongside Gary Barlow . Abba burst on to the world stage in 1974 when they won the Eurovision song contest in Brighton with Waterloo . They wed in 1971 and had two children before they divorced at the height of Abba’s fame. Bjorn, 67, now owns several stage and music companies, and has made millions alongside band mate Benny Andersson, 66, thanks to the success of Mamma Mia. Abba’s fourth member, Anni-Frid Lyngstad, 67, now lives in Switzerland as the Countess of Plauen  following her marriage to Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss of Plauen. Miss Faltskog says she still looks back fondly on the Abba years but has donated all her costumes and memorabilia to the Abba Museum and does not believe that she and her former band members will ever perform together again. She said: ‘It was such a long time ago and we are getting older and we have our different lives.’","Agnetha Faltskog largely shunned the limelight since the band split .

"Third in command: Abu Zubaydah was only behind Osama Bin Laden and the group's current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri . The US government have released private diaries of a Guantanamo Bay prisoner thought to be third in command in terrorist organisation Al Qaeda. Translated journals, belonging to Abu Zubaydah, were made public under a Freedom of Information request by Al Jazeera and give a startling insight into the inner workings of the operation. The diaries start in 1990, span the decade leading up to the 9/11 attack and end just day before Zubaydah is captured in March 2002 in Faisalbad, Pakistan. Al Qaeda's growth from battling against the Soviet occupiers of Afghanistan into the terror organisation that carried out the 2001 attack in New York is tracked through the the six volumes. Zubaydah changes from student to jihadi over the course of his writings, the Independent writes. The Saudi-born Palestinian – was a 19-year-old student in computer sciences in Mysore, India, a few months before he travelled to join the Afghan civil war that followed the Soviet departure. When he was caught by American troops, he was regarded as the third-ranking figure in Al Qaeda, behind only Osama Bin Laden and the group’s current leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, by the CIA. Zubaydah was thought to be one of the planners of the 9/11 attacks and also involved in every other major attack perpetrated by Al Qaeda in the past decade, including the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa. The prisoner was one of the first detainees from the terrorist organisation to be subjected to the 'enhanced interrogation techniques' and was waterboarded 83 times at a CIA site in Thailand by officers trying to get information about future terror attacks. The Bush administration changed its view of how important Zubaydah was when they realised he was not a frontline operative. Attack: Zubaydah was thought to be one of the planners of the 9/11 attacks and also involved in every other major attack perpetrated by Al Qaeda in the past decade . Detained: Zubaydah was taken to Guantanamo in 2006 and remains there although he has never been charged with any crime . January 6, 1991Yesterday, and only yesterday, I decided to go to Afghanistan. I believe that I have talked to you about a plan to go to Afghanistan before, which was unsuccessful. However, this time it is different [the rest of the sentence is crossed out and illegible]. I have decided to visit the place, receive training and come back to conclude my education. The intent is bona fide, God willing. Almost everything is ready except that I am scared of the circumstances. Yet I trust in God. And we seek refuge in Him.January 19, 1991We arrived yesterday morning; we are in Peshawar.The system here, as we have learned later on, is as follows:First: the services office; it is an office that handles jihad matters and Arab mujahedin’s organisation as well as support to both Arab and Afghani mujahedin. From that office branches many houses for the incoming mujahedin from outside Afghanistan, Arabs and others. The spiritual atmosphere here is good.Some came to train for a short period and go back just to be prepared. Others are here for jihad and until God decides for something to be done. Some are young; their beards or moustache have not appeared yet. Others are old in their fifties or more. Also, the idea of settling here is enticing me and I cannot seem to control it.May 1, 1991My brother, Mahir, came finally. In short, we sat together and talked. He talked about many things that are somehow frustrating; the mother, the father, the brothers and parents’ obedience and, in addition to few quick fatwas created by his emotions. Anyway, we both do not and will not understand each other.Also, dear Hani, we sat by the stream that runs through the camp. He was reading my father’s letter to me; I gave it to him to read it. He said, “Read your father’s letter; it is better for you.” He meant what they are suffering from because of me. I smiled and ripped it before his eyes while he is shocked and hurt and his face became gloomy. I tried explaining to him the importance of sacrifice for the sake of the religion and he tried, may God bless him, to explain to me the importance of having the parents’ approval for jihad.May 17, 1991, Khaldan Camp, AfghanistanYesterday, the group and I began a special course in  explosives. The morning exercise line-up begins at 6am; jogging, fast-pace running, mountain climbing and special exercises. As you notice, most of the ideas I’m dealing with now at the jihad level are practical and they were the same ideas but unorganised and not fully clear. Perhaps, life’s stress and order prevented from enhancing them practically or even from thinking about them; such as caliphate and Islamic principles.July 3, 1991, Gardez,  AfghanistanI, rather, we the explosives group, are in Gardez now at the back line since last Friday. Airplane shelling, and one of the shells landed in the heart of the camp; but praise God, no one was injured. Continuous artillery shells, digging ditches, carrying rocks from the mountain, dirt, sweat and exhaustion; a true mental relaxation, God willing and oh God!July 7, 1991, Gardez, AfghanistanToday is Sunday and the time now is perhaps 12.30pm.Place: The big tent which houses more than l5 people.  The planes are hovering around us; they strike one time and other times they don’t; however the artillery shells are continuous.Running to the ditches and face down on the ground, but I am relatively cool and don’t run to the dugout and don’t even go face down on the ground sometimes; as a matter of fact, I don’t know why. According to Al Jazeera America, the personal diaries were taken by a former US intelligence official who worked with the CIA and FBI on Al Qaeda issues. The journals mention key figures in Al Qaeda including Osama Bin Laden and their contents have been used as evidence to hold some of the 160 prisoners in Guantanamo. Zubaydah is believed to have written more diaries while he was being held by the CIA and has allegedly detailed his torture. He was taken to Guantanamo in 2006 and remains there although he has never been charged with any crime. His diaries have become the property of the Pentagon - something which traumatised Zubaydah. In March 2007, he told a tribunal that keeping his diaries from him was like 'kidnapping a child' and said he asks '20 hours a day' for their return.

"A chief constable used a publicly-funded credit card to spend thousands on restaurant bills and more than £1,000 buying flowers, it has been revealed. Sean Price, who is currently suspended from his role at Cleveland Police, based in Middlesbrough, spent over £55,000 on his corporate card over a five-year period. Just over half the total was spent on hotel stays, with around £7,000 spent on restaurants. The town of Yarm, in North Yorkshire, pictured, was a popular destination for Sean Price according to his records released following a Freedom of Information request . Another £1,350 was spent in one purchase from a furniture supplier while smaller-scale spending was also recorded with the likes of John Lewis, Argos and Marks & Spencer. Spending on the card is forming part of an ongoing police inquiry into a range of allegations surrounding Cleveland Police Authority and the Cleveland force. Any wrongdoing identified could result in either misconduct or potential criminal charges against Mr Price. A law firm representing Mr Price, who lives in North Yorkshire, said he was unable to comment on the details of the spending while investigations continued. But the firm added he 'strongly refutes any wrongdoing' and 'all transactions/purchases were made in support of his role as chief constable.' Mr Price’s credit card records show he bought flowers on 30 separate occasions with payments ranging between £20 and £98. Domestic hotel bills were as high as £819.72. One of the bills - £539.18 -  was for Mr Price’s attendance at the Liverpool Lord Mayor’s parade on a Saturday in June 2008. Spending on the card is forming part of an ongoing police inquiry into a range of allegations surrounding Cleveland Police Authority and the Cleveland force . Mr Price previously worked for Merseyside Police but left in 1998. It is unclear why he attended the event or stayed overnight. The town of Yarm, in Cleveland, was a popular destination for Mr Price according to his records. Restaurant bills in excess of £200 were among many which made up most of the £3,000 spent in the upmarket town. Cleveland Police Authority has declined to comment on any recorded explanations which may have been provided for spending on the credit card. It has previously been reported that more than £30,000 was spent on two trips to the US and one to Estonia, all of which involved Mr Price. Two also included the chief constable’s former staff officer, Heather Eastwood, who subsequently became his partner and the authority’s former deputy chief executive Julie Leng. Mr Price’s credit card records, obtained via a Freedom of Information request, show significant chunks of that spending were paid for on his card. Mr Price is among a clutch of senior officials connected to Cleveland Police and its police authority currently under an investigation run by Keith Bristow, head of the new National Crime Agency. Operation Sacristy is largely staffed by North Yorkshire Police. The chief constable was suspended last August after being arrested. A spokesman for Operation Sacristy said: 'We are not prepared to comment on any detail at this time as misconduct and criminal investigations are ongoing.' A Police Authority spokeswoman said: 'A comprehensive review of all governance processes is underway and many changes have already been made to ensure that such issues do not arise again. 'The Authority tasked its Auditors to carry out an independent review of the use of credit cards and the results of this have been published and are in the process of being implemented. The number of credit cards in use has been vastly reduced. 'In addition the Force has set up an Integrity Board to ensure the recommendations of the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary Report, ‘Without Fear of Favour’, are implemented in force. One of the issues that this is looking at is the use of corporate credit cards.' Cleveland Police Authority announced a major overhaul of credit card usage in February, shortly after it was revealed that thousands of pounds had been spent on restaurant bills by councillor Dave McLuckie, who resigned as chairman of the authority last May.","Sean Price spent half the money on hotels, £7,000 on restaurants and £1,000 on flowers .

"A massive search is underway for a mountain lion that mauled a six-year-old boy as he hiked with his parents in California on Sunday. The boy, who has not been identified, was lucky to escape alive after the beast pounced on him from behind at 1pm as he walked though the Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve in Cupertino. After grabbing the boy, the lion began dragging him away before the child's father and another man fought it off, authorities said. The youngster suffered bite wounds and scratches to his head and neck following the attack and is recovering at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, where he was listed in fair condition. Scroll down for video . Attack: A six-year-old boy was attacked by a mountain lion (file picture) while hiking with his parents and another family in California on Sunday - and he was only saved when his dad fought the animal off . Picking up the scent: ABC 7 reporter Elissa Harrington shared this photo of the boy's torn shirt being taken from the trash so authorities could get the lion's DNA. If the same lion is found, it will be killed . Closed off: Following the incident, the trails at the Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve were closed . Lieutenant Paul Foy of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife said authorities are  deploying dogs on the trail on Monday to track the animal and if DNA samples from saliva on the boy's shirt match any animal captured, it will be killed 'in the interest of public safety'. While tracks have been found and dogs have picked up on the scent of the cat, there has still not been a visual sighting of the animal. The boy was among a group of 10 -comprised of his parents, another pair of parents and kids - hiking at the Picchetti Ranch Open Space Preserve. The boy's father told investigators his son was about 10 feet ahead of the group when a mountain lion 'came out of nowhere' and attacked the boy, Foy said. Danger: A sign at the park's entrance warns visitors about mountain lions and tells them how to fight back . Shut down: Trails were closed as officials searched for the animal responsible for the attack . The search is on: Authorities say they will kill the lion if they find it, in the interest of public safety . There have been 13 verified mountain lion attacks in California between 1986 and 2013, resulting in three fatalities, aged 35, 40 and 56. The last attack was in July 2012 when a lion attacked a 63-year-old man as he camped near the Yuba River in Nevada County. But the victim managed to fight the animal off. 'It's quite rare,' Lt. Patrick Foy of the state Department of Fish and Wildlife told the LA Times. 'People are far more likely to be attacked by a dog.' Even though lions tend to avoid humans, about half of California is mountain lion habitat, so residents and visitors should be prepared. If you come face-to-face with a lion, you should stand tall, wave your arms, shout aggressively and fight back, Foy said. People are also discouraged from hiking or biking alone or during lions' most active times, which are dawn, dusk and night. Residents living in mountain lion country are also encouraged to deer-proof their land, cut back bushes to reduce hiding places and bring their pets and pet food inside at night. 'It's quite extraordinary the lion would attack a person with so many people in the immediate vicinity,; Foy said. He said the mountain lion attacked in the same way it would at a group of deer and targeting the easiest prey, that being the smallest member of the group. The boy's father and the other male adult in the group shouted and acted aggressively toward the mountain lion to scare it away, Foy said. 'He's very, very lucky that the parents were so close,' he said. Hours after they managed to carry the boy to safety, teams found track marks showing that the lion continued to follow the group after they had fought it off. The boy, who was roughly 15 feet in front of the group when he was attacked, is expected to recover from his injuries, which were described as moderate and included puncture wounds and scratches. 'The man came down the trail carrying his son,' park visitor Shawn Ardaiz told KTVU. 'It looked like he had a laceration on his neck and was bleeding pretty heavily all over.' Trails in the area have been closed. There have been 13 verified mountain lion attacks in California between 1986 and 2013, resulting in three fatalities. The youngest victim ever attacked was a five-year-old girl in Caspers Wilderness Park in 1986, but she escaped with his life. More than half of California is considered prime mountain lion habitat, and an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 cougars roam statewide.","A six-year-old boy hiking with his parents and another family was attacked from behind by a mountain lion in Cupertino, California .

"The chance to get married in a beautiful castle is usually reserved for royalty and is something many can only dream of. But Kate Stahl, from suburban Sydney, will live the fairytale for real when she ties the knot to her knight in shining armour, Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell, in Germany on Friday. The 30-year-old had no idea she would live happily ever after as a countess when she met her future husband at a party, aged just 15. Happily ever after: Kate Stahl will become a countess when she marries Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell on Friday . The pretty blonde Australian, who has swapped her old home on Bobbin Head Rd in Turramurra for Munich to live with Count Faber-Castell, will say her vows at his stunning family home in Stein. He is the 31-year-old son of Count Andreas-Wilhelm von Faber-Castell, the managing director of one of the world's largest manufacturers of pens, pencils and office supplies. 'Regardless of the surroundings, for me I am so very excited to be marrying my high school sweetheart and best friend,' Ms Stahl, who works in marketing, told the Daily Telegraph. The pair first met when they were teenagers, when they were both living in Sydney's northern suburbs. Though he currently lives in Munich to pursue a fish-farming business, Count Faber-Castell's family moved to Australia in 1971, and he was born and raised in Sydney, where he attended the prestigious Knox Grammar School. Ms Stahl and Count Faber-Castell got together in November 2009, when they both happened to be in the U.S. at the same time. They both currently live in Munich. 'Getting hitched': Kate holds up a sign to announce her engagement to her highschool sweetheart . Best friends: Ms Stahl, who works in Munich in a marketing job, described the count as her closest confidant . Stunning setting: The loved-up couple will marry at Count Faber-Castell's family's German castle . She added: 'Becoming a countess does not change who I am as a person.' But the grand splendour of Count Faber-Castell's castle will surely add some magic to their special day. The structure, which was first built by Baron Lothar von Faber in the 1840's, boasts endless classically decorated rooms. Including, a maple wood finish music room, a book-lined gentleman's library, a smoking and games room, a study and a romanesque hall, which is pannelled in dark stained oak. Then there's the French classically designed Louis Seize drawing room, a tapestry room and a grand dining hall, which seats up to sixty people, to explore. What dreams are made of: The Faber-Castell castle boasts endless beautiful rooms for their 300 wedding guests to explore . Grand: A formal ball will be held in the evening at the turn-of-the-century home . The loved-up couple have invited 300 guests to an elegant, formal ball on the evening of their big day. The complex will be decorated in white hydrangeas and Ms Stahl will wear an original dress created by Australian designer Rhonda Hemmingway, who is known for creating perfectly cut, superbly fitted gowns. Stunning pear-shaped 10-carat diamond earrings worth more than $250,000 will ensure her transformation from Sydneysider to countess is complete. Ms Stahl is not the first Australian commoner to have caught a royal's eye. It has been ten years since Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, 45, married Hobart-born Mary Donaldson, 42, the girl he bumped into at a pub in Sydney. Now the Crown Princess of Denmark, Mary lives in Copenhagen with her husband and their four children HRH Prince Christian, eight, HRH Princess Isabella, seven, and three-year-old twins HRH Prince Vincent and HRH Princess Josephine. Love story: The pair fell for each other when they were both in the US in November 2009 . Countess: Ms Stahl will wear an original dress created by Australian designer Rhonda Hemmingway . Wilhelm von Faber (1851-1893) is one of the count's ancestors, though Wilhelm was of an artistic bent and not cut out for business. Both his sons died in childhood meaning that the business was passed down to his daughter . Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell comes from a long line of pencil makers, dating back to Kaspar Faber, who  lived in Nuremberg in the mid-18th century. The pencil maker set up his own business, which he passed on to his son Anton Wilhelm Faber, who built it up into a flourishing factory. Lothar Faber who took over the company in 1839 at the age of 22, was the first Faber to be elevated to peerage, when he was  granted a life peerage by King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1862. This recognition was in honour of his social and economic services to the community, which included donating significant funds to one of Germany's first kindergartens, as well as setting up a health insurance scheme, savings bank for his employees, and building them apartments to live in. His commitment to his employees' welfare so impressed the French emperor Napoleon III, the he sent a delegation to investigate the welfare of Faber's workers and then made him a knight of the Legion d'Honneur. The family name became Faber-Castell when Lothar von Faber died without a male heir and the business passed on to his granddaughter, Baroness Ottilie von Faber. Lothar von Faber earned a hereditary peerage from King Maximilian II of Bavaria in 1862. He was responsible for expanding the business and for embarking on a program of social improvement . She married Count Alexander zu Castell- Rüdenhausen in 1898, but kept her name, which was one of the conditions of her grandfather's will. This was a very unusual step at the time and required permission royal permission. The couple became known as the Count and Countess von Faber-Castell, a name which was then transferred to the company. The business continued to expand and is the oldest family-run manufacturer of writing instruments in the world. Count Andreas Wilhelm Eberhard von Faber-Castell, the father of the groom, was born in Nuremberg, he moved to Australia in 1971 and is the managing director of Faber-Castell Asia Pacific. His son, Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell was born in Sydney, and is currently living in Munich where he is working on a fish-farming business.","Kate Stahl, 30, from Sydney will marry her high-school sweetheart, Count Anton Andreas von Faber-Castell, 31, at his castle in Germany on Friday .

"Jake Baynes resigned amid claims that the party had been 'infiltrated by the Glastonbury occult' A UKIP parliamentary candidate has resigned amid claims the party has been infiltrated by ‘occultists’. Teacher Jake Baynes was due to stand in next year’s general election, but has stood down amid a row over a ‘continuous campaign’ to oust him as the candidate. And his allies have pointed the finger at two ‘oddball’ party members who run an ‘angelic healing group’ in the Somerset town of Glastonbury. They say the pair are responsible for stirring up trouble at the local party branch in Wells. The members in question, Glen and Colleen Tucker, practise ‘alternative healing’ and work, according to their website, ‘hand in hand with the Angelic Realms…and Galactic Beings’. They have been described as ‘oddballs’ belonging to ‘the Glastonbury occult crowd’ by one of Mr Baynes’s allies. Graham Livings, who has also resigned from his post as branch manager, said of the Tuckers: ‘They put on these weekend retreats where they guarantee the angels will be present. They are oddballs. The public can be very wary of that sort of thing. UKIP has a prescribed list which states that no one who has been a member of the BNP or the English Defence League should be a member. ‘But when they sat down and wrote out the prescribed list, they wouldn't have thought to put occultists down. ‘I'm nervous about the occult and many people I know who’ve seen that these people are involved in UKIP have said, “well, I'm not voting UKIP with them in position”. These people say that they take angelic guidance and defer in all things to St Michael the Archangel – and at the same time we’re experiencing such vitriol and bile from them.’ Mr Baynes, 40, won 1,711 votes in 2010 and may have helped Liberal Democrat Tessa Munt win the Wells seat, which she took with a majority of just 800 over Tory David Heathcoat-Amory. He was re-selected as UKIP’s Wells candidate in April. But soon afterwards he claims he became the victim of a vendetta by the Tuckers. They say Mr Baynes is simply ‘not up to the job’ and deny having any vendetta. Nigel Farage, UKIP's leader with Jake Baynes who was due to stand in next year’s general election . In return, his supporters say the Tuckers are just the kind of ‘fruitcakes and loonies’ which have dogged Ukip’s attempts to be seen as a serious party. Resigning on Tuesday evening, Mr Baynes explained: ‘There has been a continuous campaign by people who, for some reason didn't want me selected, to work their very hardest to oust me. ‘It’s got so bad that I really want to get out of it – I don’t want to get involved in politics again. ‘I've realised politics is a very ugly, dirty business, and I want nothing more to do with it.’ Referring to the owners of the Angelic Guidance and Healing Centre in Glastonbury, a town said to have ‘mystic’ properties, he said: ‘Glastonbury has many different quirky things about it, and that’s what makes it unique I love that. ‘But I don’t think it has a place in politics, especially when you are in conversation with the Archangel. I don’t think I have experienced any of their [the Tucker’s] angelic healing in my career and the campaign they have against me.’ Mr Tucker stood unsuccessfully as a UKIP candidate in the county council elections a couple of years ago, while Mrs Tucker is the UKIP Somerset treasurer. He said of Mr Livings: ‘He accused us of being part of the occult, which is ridiculous. ‘What we do here has nothing to do with our involvement in UKIP. We’re stalwarts of the community in Glastonbury.’ ‘He is confused, if he thinks it is an occult he really doesn't understand what we do. We are spiritual people.’","Teacher Jake Baynes, 40, was due to stand in next year’s general election .

"Burnley have announced the signing of former Blackburn defender Steven Reid on a one-year deal. The 33-year-old was a free agent after being released by Albion at the end of last season but will stay in the Premier League after moving to Turf Moor. The Premier League veteran, of 185 top flight appearances across spells at The Hawthorns and seven seasons with Blackburn, is Burnley's fifth signing of an already busy summer window. Grin: Reid holds up the Burnley shirt he will be wearing next season in the Premier League . And manager Sean Dyche decided to swoop for Reid after playing alongside the Republic of Ireland international at Millwall. 'Steven is a very strong minded professional,' Dyche said. 'He has had years in the Premier League so he has that bit of experience and know how. 'I know him personally from his younger days at Millwall and he was a very solid pro then and he still is now, perhaps a more rounded version of what he was then. 'Along with Matty Taylor we want that experience in the building as well as the vibrancy in the team. 'Both of . those players played in some really awkward games for West Brom and West . Ham respectively and hopefully that experience can rub off on others.' Cutting all ties: Reid spent seven years with Blackburn but has now signed for their bitter rivals Burnley . Reid follows Michael Kightly, Matt Gilks, Marvin Sordell and Matt Taylor in joining the Clarets - who will be looking to secure safety in the Premier League having been relegated immediately after their last promotion in 2009. The 33-year-old began his professional career with Millwall before moving to Burnley's east Lancashire rivals Blackburn in 2003. He spent seven years at Ewood Park but had brief loan spells at QPR and West Brom before making a permanent move to The Hawthorns in 2010.

"Barcelona are out of the Champions League and far from a shoo-in for the La Liga title but at least even the average players in the Nou Camp squad are unlikely to worry about money ever again. A new report on global pay in sport has found an average first-team Barca player has earned £24,995,540 over the past five years, which is more than the average five-year pay at any team in world sport.

"A quarter of teachers and a third of police have now been dragged into the 40p tax rate, it emerged last night. And one in ten nurses are paying the higher rate of income tax, showing that the 40p band once aimed at the rich is now the ‘norm’ for hundreds of thousands of workers who would not consider themselves wealthy. Over the past decade more than 1.6million employees have started to pay the higher rate, which kicks in when wages exceed £41,865 a year. Scroll down for video . A third of police - 70,000 officers - have now been dragged into the 40p tax rate, figures revealed last night . Critics say this ‘fiscal drag’ has been lucrative for the Treasury but hurts families facing rising food and energy prices. The revelation will pile pressure on David Cameron to use next year’s Conservative manifesto to pledge to raise the threshold in line with rising incomes. He said last month that he would ‘love’ to raise the 40p threshold. The figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that 120,000 teachers, 70,000 police officers and up to 72,000 nurses have been pulled into the 40p band. Last night one Tory backbencher said the shocking analysis showed that it looked as if the ‘socialists have won’. Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, said the shocking analysis showed that it looked as if the 'socialists have won'. Douglas Carswell, MP for Clacton, said: ‘Where did Margaret Thatcher go? I thought we had sorted all this out in the 1980s, when we wanted less government and for people to keep all their money. ‘If you had said 20 years ago that we would be paying these sorts of tax rates, you’d have thought Michael Foot had won the election. Who is arguing for lower taxes now?’ The Office for Budget Responsibility says that one in three workers will be higher rate taxpayers within two decades. More than ten million will have been dragged over the higher rate threshold by 2033, twice as many as at present. In April, Chancellor George Osborne used his Budget to increase the tax-free personal allowance from £10,000 to £10,500, a change that the Treasury says benefits all workers earning up to £100,000. But calls to raise the threshold for the 40p rate in line with rising incomes were ignored. According to the ONS, the number of ‘teaching professionals’ paying the higher rate has trebled, rising from 100,000 to more than 300,000 in the past decade. They now include 87,000 secondary teachers and 34,000 primary teachers. In 2003, the figures suggest that there were no nurses who were paying the higher rate. By last year, the figure had risen to 72,000, as well as more than 5,000 paramedics. Electricians have also been dragged into the higher rate for the first time, with more than 10,000 paying. Homeowners in the North with properties worth over £400,000 should pay the ‘mansion tax’, says a Labour councillor in Tameside, Manchester. The proposed tax is aimed at homes worth £2million-plus but Claire Reynolds, who is married to Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds, said: ‘In the North there are people who could be paying more and aren’t.’ Labour said the idea would not become party policy.","The 40p tax band once aimed at the rich is now the 'norm' for thousands .

"The campaign to save the Union has more than doubled its lead to a record high following Alex Salmond's TV debate meltdown, a sensational new poll has revealed. An exclusive survey for the Scottish Daily Mail has found that viewers overwhelmingly believe Alistair Darling crushed his opponent, and nearly a quarter of those who watched are now more likely to reject independence. At the end of a torrid week for the SNP, Mr Salmond now has only 39 days of campaigning to revive his lifeless bid to break-up Britain before the historic referendum on September 18. Scroll down for video . The poll, carried out after the live debate between Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond and Better Together campaign leader Alistair Darling, shows nearly a quarter of viewers are now more likely to reject independence . The shock Survation poll, carried out on Wednesday and Thursday, shows that opposition to separation has soared to 50 per cent for the first time since the firm began asking the question. That is a remarkable four point increase in the space of a single week, with only 37 per cent now in favour of a Yes vote – down three points. When undecided voters are excluded, the No camp is on 57 per cent – a massive 14-point lead over Yes, compared to just a six-point lead last Sunday. Mr Salmond's failure to answer questions about the currency of an independent Scotland is at the heart of the dramatic collapse. More than two-thirds of the 1,010 Scots polled by Survation said the First Minister should produce a 'plan B' to his unrealistic bid to keep the pound before voters cast their ballots. Asked to pick adjectives to describe the SNP leader's performance in the pivotal STV debate last Tuesday – which was watched by 1.7million people – the most popular choices were 'weak', 'uninformed' and 'dishonest'. His opponent, former Chancellor Mr Darling who is spearheading the Better Together campaign, was described as 'knowledgeable' and 'strong'. Mr Salmond's leadership is now under unprecedented scrutiny, with senior SNP figures privately briefing against him throughout the week and some suggesting his deputy Nicola Sturgeon should replace him for a crunch TV debate on the BBC later this month. The survey found that viewers overwhelmingly thought that Alistair Darling (right) crushed opponent Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond (left) during a live televised debate on Tuesday night . Alarmingly for the First Minister, 15 per cent of Scots who backed the SNP in the 2011 Holyrood election would be more likely to vote Yes in the referendum if Miss Sturgeon was the leader. A staggering 45 per cent of independence supporters now believe Miss Sturgeon should represent the Yes camp in the BBC debate on August 25. And to compound the crisis for Mr Salmond, the collapse in support is largely due to huge numbers of female voters who have switched to the No camp in recent days. Patrick Briône, director of research at Survation, said: 'Following his unexpected success in the debate, Alistair Darling has seen support for No jump to its highest ever level in a Survation poll, at 50 per cent and a 13-point lead. 'Whilst this post-debate boost may fade over time, with little over a month remaining until Scots head to the polls it looks as though Alex Salmond is fast running out of time to turn things around. Barring a dramatic reversal in the next debate, the dreams of Scottish nationalists appear increasingly likely to be dashed come September 18.' During a visit to Glasgow yesterday, Labour leader Ed Miliband told the Mail: 'I think what this shows is that Tuesday night was a very big moment because of Alistair's persistent and very forensic questioning. Alex Salmond was exposed on a central question about the referendum and an independent Scotland's currency. 'I think what has been laid bare is that he has no plan, he has no answers, and I think a lot of people seeking to make up their minds in this referendum will be thinking this is just too big a risk when there's no answer on the currency.' Mr Darling hammered his rival over his plans for a currency if Scots back independence in the referendum . Mr Darling added: 'What's happening is the closer we get to polling day, the more people are making their minds up and saying No thanks to the risks and costs of independence, and seeing the advantages that we can have. 'We're not complacent, but I'm increasingly confident that we're going to win this.' The findings come less than a week since Yes Scotland chiefs said a Survation poll for the Scottish Mail on Sunday put them 'within touching distance of success on September 18'. But the new figures suggest that even convincing every undecided voter to back separation may not be enough for victory. According to the poll, 49 per cent of men plan to vote No, with 41 per cent in favour of independence. Among women, 52 per cent plan to reject separation – up six points in a week – and only 33 per cent said they will vote Yes. Younger voters aged 16 to 24 have also overwhelmingly swung behind the No camp, with 60 per cent now in favour of the Union – up from 43 per cent last Sunday. There are also more supporters of the Union than opponents in most regions of Scotland, including the key battleground of Glasgow. Labour leader Ed Miliband said he believes it has been 'laid bare' that Alex Salmond 'has no plan' Asked about Tuesday's TV debate, Survation found that 65 per cent of the 1,010 respondents had watched the show. Of those who saw the live clash, 53 per cent believe Mr Darling won, compared to just 28 per cent who picked Mr Salmond. Even among those planning to vote Yes to independence, the First Minister was seen as the victor by fewer than two-thirds of respondents. Asked if the debate had changed how they intend to vote, 13 per cent said they were more likely to back separation, but 22 per cent said they were more likely to cross the 'No' box on the ballot paper. Mr Salmond can take some comfort in his personal ratings figures, with 39 per cent of Scots satisfied with the way he is doing his job as First Minister, compared to just 19 per cent who are satisfied with David Cameron's job as Prime Minister. Mr Salmond was also considered the best representative for Yes Scotland by 32 per cent of voters, with only 23 per cent picking his deputy Miss Sturgeon. A Yes Scotland spokesman said: 'The poll shows most Scots agree with us that the Westminster parties are bluffing on currency - and a majority want an independent Scotland to keep the pound, which is exactly what will happen. 'The polls will always fluctuate, but what they all show is that support for Yes is well above 40 per cent - and we are very confident our positive message that a Yes vote is Scotland's one opportunity to protect the NHS, create more jobs here and guarantee that Scotland no longer gets landed with Tory governments we reject, will win a majority on September 18.'","Viewers believe Alistair Darling crushed Alex Salmond in live televised debate .

"Six of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl’s former platoon mates are shopping proposals for a book and movie manuscript that are fiercely critical of the former prisoner of war. Since Bergdahl’s controversial release in May, the six have appeared together in the media angered by White House attempts to paint the solider as a ‘war hero’ and united in their belief that he is a deserter. There are known to be at least two versions of the book, including one which depicts Bergdahl as a ‘premeditated’ deserter who ‘put all of our lives in danger.’ Scroll down for video . Six of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's former platoon mates are shopping proposals for a book and movie manuscript that are fiercely critical of the former prisoner of war . Another slightly more sympathetic version acknowledges that he was ‘likely tortured’ during his five years in captivity and that his fate ‘haunted us daily.’ Bettina Sofia Viviano, a Hollywood agent representing the six, told Yahoo News that she is pitching the proposal to studios as an ‘action-adventure in the vein of Lone Survivor or Saving Private Ryan.' The situation is complicated as Bergdahl remains under army investigation and if found guilty of being a deserter could be charged with violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The six vets are all potential key witnesses in the investigation into Bergdahl’s 2009 disappearance and several have already been questioned as part of the Army’s investigation. 'We didn't politicize this': Cody Full, Bergdahl's former roommate, has already been questioned as part of the Army's investigation in Bergdahl's disappearance . 'I think he should be court-martialed,' Evan Buetow, Bergdahl's former team leader . The former service members say they simply want to set the record straight and they have appeared repeatedly in the media in recent months. In June the six soldiers appeared on Fox News and all raised their hands when asked if they thought he was a deserter. ‘I think he should be court-martialed,’ Evan Buetow, Bergdahl's former team leader, told Yahoo News. ‘What we know is he's a deserter.’ Another issue is that Bergdahl’s release has become a political football with Republicans highly critical of the Obama administration’s handling of the affair which saw five Taliban Guantanamo detainees freed in return. The would-be authors insist that they aren't advancing a political agenda but want to set the record straight, as they see it, about Bergdahl's conduct and President Obama's praise for him at a Rose Garden ceremony in May. 'We didn't . politicize this,' said Cody Full, Bergdahl's former roommate. 'They . brought his parents out at a White House Rose Garden ceremony and . presented him as a hero.’ 'There . was no way we were going to sit down and be quiet while Obama was . calling him a war hero,' Buetow. 'We're just trying to tell the truth. It's not my fault this would make Obama look bad.' Some publishers are hesitant to back . the project while it remains a controversial issue according to a litery . agent working on the project. 'Conservatives . are all over Bergdahl and using it against Obama,' Sarah Durand, a . senior editor at Atria Books wrote to one of the soldiers' agents, . according to the report. In June the six soldiers appeared on Fox News and all raised their hands when asked if they thought he was a deserter . '[M]y concern is that this book will have to become a kind of ""Swift Boat Veterans for Truth'"" she wrote, referencing efforts by Navy veterans who served with John Kerry questioning his service in Vietnam. Bergdahl's . former colleagues portray him as an oddball and a 'loner' who seemed . initially excited to fight the Taliban, but then spoke about . disappearing in the mountains. They . also discuss the frantic search for Bergdahl after he disappeared, . codenamed 'Operation Yukon Recovery,' carried out in difficult . conditions. The . account also questions whether he aided the Taliban after he disappeared . from his post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured. Bergdahl was released in May, after the Obama administration for him. He spent nearly five years in captivity. Bettina Sofia Viviano, a Hollywood agent representing the six, told Yahoo News that she is pitching the proposal to studios as an 'action-adventure in the vein of Lone Survivor' The six say they are angered by White House attempts to paint Bergdahl as a 'war hero', such as when his parents appeared with Obama in the White House Rose Garden .","Six of Sgt.

"TV chef Nigella Lawson today told a jury that her infamous row with her ex-husband Charles Saatchi outside Scott's restuarant was over having grandchildren. Shocking images of the couple's argument, in which Mr Saatchi had his hand on the food writer's throat, were published this summer, quickly followed by news of their divorce. Mother-of-two Ms Lawson, 53, today told Isleworth Crown Court said that the row was sparked when she spoke about having grandchildren, with Mr Saatchi telling her 'I'm the only person you should be concerned with'. However, the chef told the court that Mr Saatchi had 'told everyone' he was taking cocaine out of her . nose after he was photographed holding her neck at the Mayfair restaurant. Scroll down for video . Argument: Nigella Lawson told Isleworth crown Court today that the infamous row between her and Charles Saatchi had been sparked by a conversation about grandchildren when he told her 'I'm the only person you should be concerned with' Nose tweak: Charles Saatchi is seen grabbing hold of Nigella Lawson's nose outside the restaurant . Other . images, taken by freelance photographer Jean-Paul and published in a . Sunday newspaper in June, showed Mr Saatchi repeatedly tweaking and . twisting Ms Lawson’s nose outside the Mayfair restaurant, and even putting a finger in one of her . nostrils. She appeared tearful throughout the exchange, but stayed with him to finish their meal. The photographer who took them timed the incident at just under half an hour, describing it as ‘27 minutes of madness’. At the time Mr Saatchi laughed off the incident as a 'playful tiff', and accepted a police caution for assault. However, in July, former advertising tycoon Mr . Saatchi announced via the Mail On Sunday that he would be divorcing Ms . Lawson after 10 years of marriage because she refused to defend his reputation following the publication of the photographs. 'Throttling': Mr Saatchi was pictured grabbing Nigella' Lawson's throat outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair, central London . Evidence: The TV chef, shown in a court sketch, told Isleworth Crown Court that Mr Saatchi had 'told everyone' he was taking cocaine out of her nose in the photographs of their row . Scarred: Ms Lawson said she had not been beaten, but said she was left with 'emotional scars', which were 'very wounding and very difficult and of course we know how things accelerated' Giving evidence last week at the trial of her  two former personal assistants who are accused of fraud, Mr Saatchi denied 'throttling' his ex-wife, and instead said he was trying to 'make her focus' on what he was saying. He added that the couple were not talking about her alleged drug abuse at the time. 'I was not gripping, strangling or throttling . her,' he told the court. 'I was holding her head by the neck to make her focus, can we be . clear?' 'Was it about her drug use? No.' Court appearance: Ms Lawson was giving evidence at the trial of former employees Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, are accused of defrauding her and her former Mr Saatchi . Arrival: Dress in a long black coat and boots, Nigella Lawson made her way through a throng of photographers as she arrived at Isleworth Crown Court . When . asked by Anthony Metzer QC, defending, if he became aware of Ms . Lawson's alleged drug-taking around the time of the 'Scott's Restaurant . incident', he said it was indeed around that time. Today it was Ms Lawson's turn to give evidence at the trial of former employees Francesca and Elisabetta . Grillo, who are accused of using credit cards loaned to them to spend . more than £685,000. She claimed the incident outside Scott's was actually sparked when she commented on a person walking by with a baby. Referring to the infamous incident, Ms Lawson said: 'He [Charles Saatchi] told everyone that he was taking cocaine out of my nose. 'But what actually happened was that somebody walked by with a very cute baby in a stroller and I said ""I am so looking forward to having grandchildren"", and he grabbed me by the throat and said ""I am the only person you should be concerned with. I am the only person who should be giving you pleasure"". 'That is what happened.' Happier times: Nigella Lawson and Charles Saatchi pictured together at a dinner at Joe's Restaurant in London in February last year . The photographs of the incident were not shown to Ms Lawson as she took the witness stand, although they have previously been shown to the jury. Judge Robin Johnson and Mr Metzer clashed when Mr Metzer wanted to show Ms Lawson one of the pictures. Ms Lawson had pleaded: 'Please don't make this go on for two days.' Judge Johnson said: 'I'm not having photographs put to this witness.' When asked again about the incident, Ms Lawson said she had already given a direct, 'almost verbatim' account of what happened, and said she did not intend to speak about it again. Ms Lawson said she had not been beaten, but said she . was left with 'emotional scars', which were 'very wounding and very . difficult and of course we know how things accelerated'. She said she believes Mr Saatchi had a mindset of 'Get her, I don't care what it takes' in relation to her and the current legal proceedings, and she told the court that he feels betrayed by her. In reference to Mr Saatchi possibly suing . her if she did not appear as a witness in this trial, Ms Lawson said it . was 'just another form of bullying'. Denial: Giving evidence last week, Mr Saatchi denied 'throttling' his ex-wife, and instead said he was trying to 'make her focus' on what he was saying . Accused: Sisters Elisabetta (left) and Francesca Grillo (right) deny fraudulently spending almost £700,000 the former couple's money . She said he is on a campaign to 'ruin me in any way', whether financial or otherwise. 'I think he likes everyone to do what he wants,' she said. Ms Lawson added that she feels there is a 'witch hunt' against her, and that she is on trial with no counsel and 'no rights'. It is alleged that between January 1, . 2008 and December 31, 2012, the Grillo sisters abused their positions by . using a credit card for personal gain. The pair, of Bayswater, west London, both deny the charge against them. The case continues.

"Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew admits he understands why Eagles fans are reluctant to attend Saturday's match at West Ham, insisting the club are determined to reduce prices for travelling supporters. Pardew wrote an open letter earlier this week urging the Palace faithful to 'leave the sofa for this one' and the club lifted restrictions on how many tickets fans can buy for the televised fixture. The game costs Palace supporters £44 for adults and £25 for concessions - prices Pardew admits are too high. Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew understands why Eagles fans would avoid match against West Ham . Pardew waves to the Selhurst Park faithful before Palace's Premier League match against Arsenal . 'We wanted to highlight the fact we hadn't sold all the tickets and the fact they're expensive and that I understand that,' Pardew said. 'I wish they were cheaper and I was asking the fans, if they can possibly afford it, to try to come along because it's a big afternoon for us. 'It's an agenda that we as a club are focusing on - that away fans should get a better rate to make it easier. 'With all the finance coming into the game, it's something that has to be looked at by the Premier League and by Premier League chairmen. 'These messages start with your fans. I'm just echoing my personal opinion with what our fans want and what fans up and down the country want. 'They want to follow their team, in a place where they have a good view of the game, and at a decent price that makes it viable to be able to travel.' Palace captain Mile Jedinak is back in full training after recovering from a sore ankle . After a blistering start under Pardew, Palace have endured a dip in form of late, having failed to win any of their last three matches. The Eagles, who are 13th in the table, are boosted this weekend by the return of captain Mile Jedinak, who is back in full training after returning from the Asian Cup with a sore ankle. 'Mile is available but we've had some really outstanding performances in that midfield area so there's a bit of competition in there,' Pardew said. 'Nobody has a given right to play but he's important in terms of his captaincy and his presence. 'It's a big game, both teams need a win in the short-term so both teams will be very focused on victory.' Palace are struggling up front, however, with Fraizer Campbell, Yaya Sanogo and Marouane Chamakh all out this weekend with hamstring injuries. Pardew is hopeful Sanogo and Chamakh may return for the home game against QPR on March 14, but Campbell is likely to be out for five to six weeks.","Alan Pardew understands why fans would want to miss upcoming match .

"The Mojito, a Cuban mix of white rum, sugar, lime, mint and soda water, is the most popular cocktail in Britain according to a report . Sales of cocktails have risen by more than 10 per cent in the past two years. More than one in five of Britain's pubs and bars now serve cocktails and the Mojito – a Cuban mix of white rum, sugar, lime, mint and soda water – is the most popular, according to a report. Pina Coladas (rum, coconut and pineapple juice) and Woo Woos (vodka, peach schnapps and cranberry juice) were also popular. The Mixed Drinks Report, by consultancy firm CGA Strategy, found more women than men choose cocktails, as 54 per cent of cocktail drinkers are female. Bomb and pitcher serves remain popular, with 74 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds admitting to have bought a bomb drink, while nine in 10 in the same age range say they drink pitchers. Cocktails are enjoyed by the core 18 to 35-year-old demographic 'in all on-trade occasions' including throughout the night, as opposed to just the start. Tom Lynch, of CGA, said: 'Cocktails and the bars and pubs that serve them have been surging in popularity over the last few years and our latest research emphasises just how integrated they've become to mainstream drinking,' 'They present a terrific opportunity for bars and pubs to drive footfall and increase spend - but only if they can fully understand what customers want from a cocktail menu and give them a consistent experience every time.' The research also finds that following the Mojito, sales of the Pina Colada, Woo Woo and Sex on the Beach have also grown as increasingly more mainstream venues move into cocktails. Havana is the birthplace of the Mojito, although the exact origin of this classic cocktail is the subject of debate. Some historians argue that African slaves who worked in the Cuban sugar cane fields during the 19th century were instrumental in the cocktail's origin. Cocktails are enjoyed by the core 18 to 35-year-old demographic 'in all on-trade occasions' including throughout the night, as opposed to just the start . Ingredients . 1½ limes, cut into wedges. 20 fresh mint leaves. 2½ tsp granulated sugar. A handful of ice. 65ml/2½fl oz white rum. A splash soda water, to taste. A fresh mint sprig, to garnish. Preparation Method . 1) Place the limes, mint and sugar into a sturdy highball glass. 2) 'Muddle' or mash with the end of a clean rolling pin, to bruise the mint and release the lime juice. 3) Add the ice and pour over the rum. 4) Add soda water to taste and stir well.

"Family members of Nigella Lawson were yesterday seen delivering clothes to the Mayfair flat where she is staying, as the TV chef faces a second week away from husband Charles Saatchi. It comes as 53-year-old Nigella told friends she wants to rebuild her troubled relationship with millionaire art collector Mr Saatchi and insisted: ‘I am not some sort of battered wife.’ She has confided that although she has no current plans to return home from the £10,000-a-week apartment in central London, she is still in love with her husband. No current plans to return home: Family members (left) of Nigella Lawson (right) delivered clothing to the Mayfair flat where she is staying, as she faces a second week away from Charles Saatchi . Marriage: Nigella has confided that although she has no current plans to return home from her Mayfair flat (where relatives are pictured yesterday, left), she is still in love with her husband Mr Saatchi (right, today) As she faces a second week away from Mr . Saatchi, 70, friends have said she wants him to undergo anger management . therapy or counselling to control his volatile moods. In the first insight into the anguish that Nigella is suffering, a close friend said: ‘She desperately loves Charles and says he is her world. ‘She feels that if he would look at getting some sort of help, anger management or therapy then they can work at rebuilding their relationship. Alone: Charles Saatchi was seen leaving his £15 million Chelsea home today in a taxi . 'As in any marriage, there are issues and problems that arise, and he is under a huge amount of pressure and stress. But she feels she is never going to be able to live this down and move on.’ The Mail on Sunday has been told that Nigella would never have left the £14million family home if images of her husband grabbing her by the throat outside celebrity restaurant Scott’s had not been published. The friend said: ‘Nigella feels her hand has been forced. She would not have left if the incident had stayed private.’ Concerns: As Nigella (pictured on Friday) faces a second week away from Mr Saatchi, 70, friends have said she wants him to undergo anger management therapy or counselling to control his volatile moods . Photographer Jean-Paul, who took the pictures of Nigella being throttled by Saatchi, said he was originally expecting to simply take a picture of the TV chef leaving the restaurant. But he told the Sunday People: ‘I was sitting reading the paper but keeping an eye out to make sure I didn’t miss them leaving. Then suddenly I saw Nigella’s head jolt backwards. I thought “this is odd”. ‘I put the camera up to my face to look through the lens and I saw his left hand on her throat, so I started taking pictures. From that moment on I kept taking pictures, and there were 27 minutes of it. ‘When I saw the very first pictures, I thought “he can’t be doing this”. I was in complete disbelief.’ Volatile: Charles Saatchi returns - alone - to Scott's, the restaurant where had grabbed Nigella by the throat . Nigella has fled to a £10,000-a-week Mayfair apartment where she is struggling to consider the best way forward for herself and her two teenage children, and decide whether the couple has a future. The friend added that while Nigella has not consulted divorce lawyers  she feels desperately exposed by the public scrutiny. They added: ‘Nigella feels frustrated that the whole world has an opinion about something she feels is a private situation.’ Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault following the publication of the damning pictures last Sunday, which he initially tried to dismiss  as ‘a playful tiff’. But the incident sparked an outcry. It was raised in the House of Lords on Friday, as Nigella’s father Lord Lawson looked on, when Lord Avebury asked: ‘Do you think that the leniency shown to Mr Saatchi when he half-strangled his wife set the wrong tone?’ But as the public debate rages,  Nigella is craving privacy and quiet, and is tormented over how to proceed. Friends say the removal of her wedding ring last week was merely a sign of her confusion as she struggles to cope under the nationwide scrutiny of her most private relationship. Happier times: When the couple met at a private dinner Saatchi was reportedly immediately totally captivated. But as her career has flourished he has apparently became less comfortable . Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault following the publication of the damning pictures last Sunday, which he initially tried to dismiss  as 'a playful tiff . Most of Nigella’s family, especially her father Nigel and sister Horatia, are said to be furious that Saatchi has created this hugely embarrassing storm. Publicly they have refused to comment, but privately they are believed to have urged her not to return to him. Her brother Dominic, former editor of The Spectator, does not wish to comment. But author Kathy Lette, who is close to the couple, was outspoken. ‘I’m not talking to Charles,’ she said. ‘He’s behaved appallingly.  I can’t believe that after so many years in the public relations business he’s handled this so badly.’ Divorce lawyer Vanessa Platt, who has represented many women who want to leave abusive relationships, was surprisingly supportive of Nigella’s private desire to save her marriage. She said: ‘When a high-profile woman is in a situation with a controlling  husband, people usually wonder why she won’t leave him. ‘But pressure from family and the press can be very overwhelming and doesn’t always help the situation. It can make it difficult for them to make a decision. I always recommend that the couple go for counselling.’ Most of Nigella's family, especially her father Nigel, are said to be furious that Saatchi has created this hugely embarrassing storm . Platt suggests that Saatchi may have a narcissistic personality. ‘If it is the case he has anger issues, then he must see a specialist to get help. Nigella is right to insist that is a requirement for the marriage to continue.’ Baroness Fiona Shackleton, who  represented Prince Charles in his  1996 divorce from Diana and Sir  Paul McCartney in his 2008 divorce from Heather Mills, is a relative of Nigella’s and someone she might turn to for advice should divorce become  unavoidable. The couple are not believed to have signed a prenuptial agreement. Saatchi’s former wife, American Kay Saatchi, the mother of their 19-year-old daughter Phoebe, has previously said he was an ‘appalling bully’ but last week issued a statement saying: ‘While Charles has always had his faults, I never experienced him to be physically abusive. ‘He may be hard work, but I feel he is being treated unfairly.’ Brian Basham, a former business associate, said Saatchi had gone from a sweet and humble genius to becoming a ‘monster’ and a ‘deeply unpleasant man’. They fell out over a business deal in the late 1990s. ‘He was the most brilliant advertising man,’ he said. ‘Back then he was warm and nice, but it is almost as if the more successful he became, the meaner be got. ‘I sometimes wonder what went wrong and whether some personal disappointment turned him into the man he became.’ Nigella, it seemed, was one of the few people able to charm him back to good humour. Yet in spite of her high-voltage radiance, she is a woman who admits she is driven by a desperate desire to please. ‘I am so pathetic  I even crave the approval of my toothbrush,’ she once said. It is not only the personal humiliation that is said to be worrying Nigella. Her new success in America, where she found fame with the television reality show The Taste, could now be vulnerable, after the row . Torn apart: She has fled to a £10,000-a-week Mayfair apartment after the public row . The daughter of former Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson  and Vanessa Salmon, a socialite  and heiress to the Lyons Corner House empire, Nigella has admitted that she was often beaten by her bipolar mother. Her friendship with Charles Saatchi began before the 2001 death of her husband, journalist John  Diamond, to whom she had been married for ten years. That year she moved in to Saatchi’s Belgravia mansion with her children Cosima, now 19, and Bruno, now 17. She was already a household name following the publication of her first cookery book, How To Eat, in 1998. She was named author of the year for her 2000 follow-up, How To Be A Domestic Goddess. Her television cooking shows made her a star. Although Diamond saw her full potential – supervising her ‘makeover’ and persuading her to wear more glamorous clothes and make-up – it was Saatchi who saw her become a superstar. According to friends, none of whom wanted to be named, Saatchi made himself indispensable to  Nigella when her husband was dying. ‘He saw her as Mother Theresa, struggling to cope with two small children, and he rode in like Sir Galahad to rescue the situation.’ He met her at a private dinner and was immediately totally captivated. But as her career flourished he apparently became less comfortable. ‘Charles prides himself on being the lone wolf, the enabler,’ said a friend who knows the couple well. ‘He grew frustrated as he had less and less control over her.’ Another friend said: ‘It appears Nigella has had to put up with a shedload more at home than she  will ever let on.

"‘It’s too easy for Arsenal – Monaco are like mannequins’. The words of Gary Neville at 7.50pm. Less than two hours later it was Arsenal looking like the dummies, beaten 3-1 by an average – yet impressive on the night – Monaco side. In 90 minutes, Arsene Wenger’s team had managed to perform a distressing demonstration of every flaw and criticism which has been aimed at them in the past five years. Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at the shortcomings which leave the Gunners on the brink of a last-16 exit in the Champions League for the fifth season running. Arsene Wenger (centre) slumps into his seat while watching Monaco humiliate his Arsenal team . Laurent Koscielny, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mesut Ozil looked dejected after the injury-time goal . Let’s start at the back, as Per usual… . Per Mertesacker is a World Cup winner, right? He was, of course, afforded a little bit of a World Cup hangover when he struggled for form at the start of the campaign. It’s now looking more like he’s been on a season-long bender. The German is a liability. Blameless for the first goal which deflected into the back of the net via his torso from Geoffrey Kondogbia’s shot? Not likely. It was a half-hearted attempt to close the France midfielder and it was no surprise to see his limp body serve as a detour en route to goal. For the second he inexplicably chose to try and win possession some 60 yards from his own goal. It was a baffling decision and Arsenal paid the price as Dimitar Berbatov – yes, the player last season in Fulham’s reserves – climaxed a swift breakaway made possible by Mertesacker’s absence. His face in the moments after that tie-changing concession told its own story, a pained expression of regret and wondering – wondering, no doubt, just where his career is headed. After this, you’d say he isn’t long for north London. German central defender Per Mertesacker had one of his worst nights in aa Arsenal shirt . Captain Mertesacker (with goalkeeper David Ospina in the background) had an awful night against Monaco . Per’s Kos-tly comrade… . Laurent Koscielny should not escape censure, either. The centre back was nowhere to be seen as Monaco broke and netted the tie-clinching third. Moments earlier he’d been outdone on halfway, his lame attempt to tackle more in keeping with a team chasing an irreversible deficit, and not one trailing by a goal with the second leg still to come. That will ultimately prove costly. Koscielny (centre) should not escape blame after an erratic display alongside Mertesacker . Midfield matters… . In the space of 24 hours we have seen two of the Premier League’s top sides line up with a central-midfield quartet consisting of James Milner, Fernando, Francis Coquelin and Santi Cazorla. Is that really the best we’ve got to offer? Arsenal were out-fought and out-thought by the brilliant Kondogbia and cunning Joao Moutinho. Now that is a midfield pairing. Geoffrey Kondogbia celebrates after scoring the first Monaco goal in north London . The excellent Kondogbia out-muscles Santi Cazorla - a theme to continue throughout the 90 minutes . Arsenal, on the other hand, were operating with the in-form – but out of position – Cazorla in a deeper role in which he looked entirely uncomfortable, while Coquelin, do not forget, was a reserve until one impressive performance at Manchester City cemented his place in the side. When are Arsenal going to sign a midfielder who marries pace and power, craft and graft – like, for example, a certain Kondogbia? Wizard of Oz? He certainly vanished… . At £42million, Mesut Ozil was bought for nights like this. Instead, what we witnessed – when he did bother to seize responsibility – was another wishy-washy display, lacking in urgency and invention and slowed down by too many touches. He’s had too many chances now. Mesut Ozil failed to unlock Monaco all night, despite being afforded plenty of the ball . Ozil has flattered to deceive since his £42million move from Real Madrid 18 months ago . French misconnection… . Moments after Olivier Giroud blazed over the crossbar from point-blank range, a graphic appeared on television screens – attempts 6, on target 0. Giroud just does not boast the clinical mindset of a master marksman. Ask yourself this – would he have scored those chances at home to the likes of a Newcastle? Or even Championship opposition in the FA Cup? Answer: yes. For he did, bagging braces and accepting plaudits against both the Magpies and Middlesbrough of late. Amplify the pressure, however, and he crumbles. Top strikers, the ones who make the difference – like Luis Suarez the previous evening - thrive in such surrounds. Much-heralded good-looks maybe, but Giroud’s finishing was ugly against Monaco. He is another who simply isn’t good enough for where Arsenal want to be, presuming that is further than the last-16 of the Champions League. Olivier Giroud had a dismal night in front of goal and bore the brunt of frustration from the stands . The French striker (here heading over the bar) missed a host of chances on Wednesday night . Giroud somehow conspires to fire wide from close range as Arsenal struggled to convert their chances . Highbury the library? A library? Arsenal’s old home was a cauldron of noise compared with the hushed acceptance of the Emirates. There are groans, yes, but where is the energy and excitement which would accompany a European night at the likes of Anfield or, say, White Hart Lane? No guts, no glory… . They say you’ve got to earn the right to play – which roughly translated in Sunday-morning speak means ‘win your battles first’. Monaco were stronger, quicker and hungrier than Arsenal in every department and were, as a result, deserving winners. Their last two goals were classy and incisive breakaways. But they had earned the right to do that. Arsenal, meanwhile, earned nothing but a costly continental lesson. Again. Arsenal's supporters failed to rouse their side out of its slumber on a disappointing night . Former Tottenham striker Dimitar Berbatov took delight in silencing the boos and scoring for Monaco . Danny Welbeck looks disconsolate after possession runs away from him in the second half . So who is to blame? Poor Arsene Wenger, he’s going to need a shop full of those Arsenal puffer jackets to protect him from the battering he’s going to take if they fail to reverse the deficit in Monaco. But this is his team, he didn’t inherit it. He is, of course, hampered by injuries. But he shouldn’t accommodate injury-prone players if that is repeatedly offered as an excuse. It is a team lacking in key areas – namely goalkeeper, defence, midfield and attack. Against Monaco, each of those was brutally exposed, and so was Wenger. Wenger must take the ultimate blame, given this is his side and they are lacking in key areas . Giroud holds his head with Arsenal staring at an exit from the competition .","Arsenal lost 3-1 at home against Monaco in the Champions League .

"Liverpool are expected to be cleared of any financial fair play breaches on Friday but Hull City will be handed a small fine by UEFA. The Reds have been one of several clubs absent from European competition last season who have been under investigation by the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB). The CFCB will meet on Friday and is expected to announce that investigations into Liverpool have ended without any sanctions to be brought against the Merseyside club. Liverpool are expected to be cleared of any financial fair play breaches on Friday . Hull City have agreed to settle for a small fine, thought to be around 200,000 euros . It is understood that Hull, who played in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League, have agreed to settle for a small fine for FFP breaches. Last year Levski Sofia and three Turkish clubs each received a 200,000 euro (£145,529) fine and Hull's sanction is thought to be of a similar level. The CFCB is also expected to announce that investigations into Monaco, Inter Milan, Sporting Lisbon and Roma are to continue. Liverpool made a loss of £49.8million for the 2012-13 season, and £40.5m for the 10-month period before that but have been able to write off a big chunk of losses as allowable stadium expenditure - the 2011-12 accounts reported that £49.6m was associated with Liverpool's stadium costs, £35m coming from former co-owner Tom Hick's aborted plan to build a new stadium on StanleyPark which new owners Fenway Sports Group had to scrap. Liverpool have been able to write off a big chunk of losses as allowable Anfield stadium expenditure . Manchester City and PSG were the clubs hit hardest by UEFA for breaching FFP rules last season . Manchester City and Paris St Germain were the clubs hit hardest by UEFA last season for breaching FFP rules - they were each fined £49m and handed restrictions on transfer spending and a reduction in Champions League squad size.

"An out-of-sorts Andy Murray lost in straight sets to Croatian teenager Borna Coric to crash out of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Thursday. Murray thrashed Coric in a Davis Cup singles tie in September 2013 in their only other previous meeting, but was second best throughout Thursday's quarter-final encounter as the 18-year-old Coric won 6-1 6-3 in one hour and 19 minutes. Coric's reward for claiming the world number three's scalp is a semi-final match against Roger Federer, providing the Swiss world No 2 can successfully overcome Richard Gasquet later. Andy Murray is out of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships after losing to Borna Coric on Thursday . The world No 3 was out-of-sorts as he crumbled to the Croatian teenager in one hour and 19 minutes . Murray's error-strewn display, in which he hit 55 unforced errors, was in stark contrast to the impressive tennis the Scot played on his way to the Australian Open final just three weeks ago. The two-time grand slam winner began steadily enough, holding his serve to take a 1-0 lead, but found himself chasing the set in a matter of minutes as Coric, who beat Rafael Nadal at last year's Swiss Open, held with ease then converted a second break point against the Scot to move into a 2-1 advantage. Coric did not drop a point as he held his second service game and extended his lead to 4-1 by converting his fourth break point as Murray struggled to get a foothold in the game. Coric breezed through his third service game to make it 5-1 and broke Murray for a third time to win the first set after the Scot sliced a backhand ground stroke into the net to notch his 27th unforced error. Coric will next face either Roger Federer or Richard Gasquet in the semi-finals after overcoming Murray . The 18-year-old broke down on the court in jubilation at securing the scalp of Murray in their quarter-final tie . Murray matched his opponent in the early stages of the second set as it went with serve and drew on all his experience to level to 2-2 as Coric stepped up the pressure. The Croatian, the youngest player in the men's top 100, was exhibiting skill and poise that belied his tender years and after breezing through yet another service game, he produced a fine lob to break Murray to take a 4-2 lead. Coric was in total control by this point and held serve without dropping a point before wrapping up a thoroughly deserved victory moments later when Murray skewed a regulation forehand return wide of the mark.","Andy Murray lost in straight sets to Croatian teenager Borna Coric 6-1 6-3 .

"West Ham could be denied European football in their final season at Upton Park by the ill-discipline of their Premier League rivals in the knockout rounds of this year’s continental competitions. The top three nations in UEFA’s Respect and Fair Play rankings qualify for a Europa League place ahead of next term. England were third behind Republic of Ireland and Holland before the latter stages of the Champions League and Europa League resumed this month. Sam Allardyce's West Ham are currently top of the Fair Play table but could miss out on the Europa League . West Ham are two points ahead of Burnley and Liverpool in the Premier League Fair Play rankings . R/Y: Red & yellow cards, P/P: Positive play, R/O: Respect towards opponent, R/R: Respect towards referee, B/O: Behaviour of officials, PTS: Points, AVG: Average . Were they to stay there then the Premier League would award a Europa League place to the team which tops their own Fair Play table. That is currently Sam Allardyce's West Ham, who sign off from Upton Park after 112 years before moving to the Olympic Stadium at the end of next season. Fulham qualified via the same route in 2011 and took their place in the inaugural Europa League. Burnley currently trail the Hammers by 2.25 points, which are awarded for disciplinary record, positive play, respect towards opponents and referees and the behaviour of team officials. The ill-discipline of other Premier League clubs could harm West Ham's chances of a place in Europe . The UEFA Fair Play rankings show England in third place behind the Republic of Ireland and Holland . But sources at the Premier League believe there is a danger they will lose their extra Europa League spot given the combative nature of knockout-round ties. UEFA – who take into account all international and club matches in their competitions - use the same criteria as the Premier League but also include the behaviour of fans in the stadium. That has not been an issue for English clubs of late but on-the-pitch misdemeanours could make a difference when UEFA’s final table is published in May. For example, Manchester City had Gael Clichy sent off during Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat to Barcelona. Next season is West Ham's last at Upton Park after 112 years, before they move to the Olympic Stadium . On the other hand, were a Premier League club to go on and win the Champions League or Europa League playing attacking football and avoiding too many cautions, then England could yet climb UEFA’s table. Meanwhile, it is Liverpool and Manchester City who occupy third and fourth positions respectively in the Premier League standings. Were they to finish top then the Europa League place would go to the next team who had not yet qualified for European competition. However, given that entry is at the first qualifying round – which begins on July 2 - clubs can refuse the offer. In this instance the association would lose their extra allocation. As from 2016/17 there will no longer be a Europa League prize for the top three nations. Instead, a financial bonus will be paid to the best Fair Play association, the most improved and the nation with the best behaved spectators.","West Ham are top of the Premier League 'Respect and Fair Play' rankings .

"The disturbed gunman who killed six people in California on Saturday has been hailed as a hero by an underground online forum for men unable to date women. Elliot Rodger's massacre has thrown the depraved world of PickUp-Artist's into the spotlight - especially the rage-filled PUAHate.com, an extreme group which describes itself as the 'Anti-Pickup-Artist Movement'. Its members are all men who have spent time and money on books and seminars designed to help them pick-up women - but who have failed and are furious with the 'scams, deception and misleading marketing techniques used by dating gurus and the seduction community.' Scroll Down for Video . Anger: British-born student Elliot Rodger, 22 - son of Hunger Games film director Peter Rodger - who murdered six people in the Isla Vista district of Santa Barbara, California, because he was a virgin and girls would not have sex with him . The bitter and misogynistic tweets are full of tales of woe from men who don't know how to get women to date them and then blame the women themselves for the problem. He posted in 2013, 'If you could release a virus that would kill every single man on Earth, except for yourself because you would have the antidote, would you do it?' 'You will be the only man left, with all the females. You would be able to have your pick of any beautiful woman you want, as well has having dealt vengeance on the men who took then from you. 'Imagine how satisfying that would be.' Pick-up-artist: Elliot Rodger hated the idea that he had to learn to pick-up girls and despised it when these techniques went wrong . Racial: Some of Elliot Roger's posts to the pick-up-artist's web forums were aimed at minorities and their success with women compared to his . In high gear: the 22-year-old boasted about his luxury vehicles, including his black BMW involved in the drive-by shootings . His comments were lauded online by members of PUAHate.com, with some labeling him a hero. Rodger’s posts have disappeared with the website, but on Saturday the Southern Poverty Law Center unearthed some comments, both racist and misogynistic, that he wrote on the forums. One post reads: . 'I was shopping at Trader Joe’s and saw an Indian guy with 2 above average White Girls!!! What rage-inducing sights did you guys see today? Don’t you just hate seeing these things when you go out? It just makes you want to quit life.' Indeed, Rodger, who stabbed three men to death before shooting two UCSB soroity sisters and one male freshman, before taking his own life, was very prominent online in the PUA community. Pick-Up Artists, or PUAs', are men online who talk about their failure to secure girlfriends - and despair about forever being friends and not lovers. Disturbed: Elliot Rodger, 22, took his own life Friday after murdering six people and leaving 13 others wounded in California . Armed to the teeth: Rodger had legally purchased two Sig Sauers like the one pictured right and a Glock 34 . They are determined to date women who score at least seven out of ten on their own scale of attractiveness, and they all trade tips online about how to become the dominant men they all aspire to be. Among their techniques to pick up women is a method called 'negging' - which essentially means, insulting women to break down their confidence. Those on Pick-Up-Artist websites resent women for controlling the sexual market and believe that women only like men who treat them badly. Ultimately, the PUA thinks that women are not deserving of respect and a target to conquer. Indeed, Rodger was also a member of PUAHate.com, a forum that is not designed to attack the methods of pick-up-artist, but in fact, to point out unsuccessful techniques. The site has been taken down in the aftermath of Rodger's killing spree, but according to Slate, the forum is designed to host those interested in 'exposing the scams, deception and misleading marketing techniques used by dating gurus and the seduction community to deceive men and profit from them.' College terror: Police investigate the bloody scene . Chase: Rodger crashed his BMW after he was pursued by police . In YouTube videos and a long written manifesto, Elliot Rodger aired his contempt for everyone from his roommates to the whole human race, reserving special hate for two groups: the women he says kept him a virgin for all of his 22 years, and the men they chose instead. Authorities said he put that bitterness into action in a stabbing and shooting rampage Friday night across the seaside California college town of Isla Vista that killed two young women and four men, at least half of them students at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Thirteen people were injured. Rodger then apparently shot and killed himself inside the black BMW he used in the violence, authorities said Saturday. The rampage played out largely as he laid it out in the public postings, including a YouTube video where he sits in the BMW in sunset light and appears to be acting out scripted lines and planned laughs. 'I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you,' Rodger, the son of a Hollywood director who worked on 'The Hunger Games,' says in the video posted Friday and taken down by YouTube on Saturday with a message saying it violated the site's terms of service. 'I don't know why you girls are so repulsed by me,' he says in the video, describing his loneliness and frustration at never having had sex with or even kissed a girl. 'I am polite. I am the ultimate gentleman. And yet, you girls never give me a chance. I don't know why.' First casualties: Katie Cooper, left, and . Veronika Weiss, right, are believed to be among the seven people slain . not far from the University of California Santa Barbara campus Friday . Deceased: Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, was shot and killed as he entered the IV Deli, in Isla Vista at 9.30pm on Friday night . Of the men he sees as rivals, he said: 'I deserve girls much more than all those slobs,' and that after his rampage 'you will finally see that I am, in truth, the superior one, the true alpha male.' Sheriff Bill Brown, appearing on CNN on Sunday said that investigators are tying up a few ends, but 'for the most part, I think, we have a pretty clear picture of what happened ' The first three killed Friday were male stabbing victims in Rodger's own apartment whose names have not been released, Brown said Saturday. Then, at about 9:30 p.m., the citywide shooting and vehicle-ramming rampage began. His first stop was the Alpha Phi sorority, which he had called 'the hottest sorority of UCSB.' 'I know exactly where their house is and I've sat outside it in my car to stalk them many times,' Rodger wrote in his extensive manifesto titled 'My Twisted World.' No one answered the door after one to two minutes of aggressive pounding, but he soon shot three women who were standing nearby, killing two of them, 19-year-old Veronika Weiss and 22-year-old Katherine Cooper. He then drove to a deli where he walked inside and shot and killed another UC Santa Barbara student, 20-year-old Christopher Michaels-Martinez, the sheriff said. 'Chris was a really great kid,' Michaels-Martinez's father said at a news conference where he choked back tears and eventually collapsed to his knees in agony. 'Ask anyone who knew him. His death has left our family lost and broken.'","Elliot Rodger has been called a hero online for his comments posted to Pick-Up-Artist websites and forums .

"Arsene Wenger’s Wednesday night was up there with the worst in his career, made even more galling by the commemorative pop-up model of the Arsenal manager in the club’s programme.

"James Rodriguez has given Real Madrid fans a boost that he is bouncing back to full-fitness from injury after posting an Instagram video on Thursday. The 23-year-old hasn't featured for the Spanish giants since breaking his fifth metatarsal in his right foot against Sevilla earlier this month. The Colombian was expected to be out for around eight weeks with the injury, but he appears to be making good progress judging by his social media upload. VIDEO Scroll down to see James Rodriguez working out in the gym . James Rodriguez uploaded an Instagram video on Thursday being put through his paces after injury . The Real Madrid star is currently out injured with a broken foot suffered earlier this month . Accompanied with the caption: 'Third week and feeling good, Stronger than ever', the midfielder can be seen going through plyometric exercises to enhance his athletic performance through speed and strength.

"Arsenal put in a woeful performance against Monaco as the Gunners lost 3-1 in their Champions League last-16 first leg clash at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night.

Here, Sportsmail runs down Arsenal's 10 most embarrassing results since Wenger took charge of the club back in 1996.

The Gunners faced AC Milan in a double header for a place in the Champions League quarter-finals in February 2012 but saw the tie ultimately decided at the halfway stage as Arsene Wenger's side succumbed to a heavy 4-0 defeat. Arsenal's hopes of progressing were left in tatters as a Kevin Prince-Boateng strike, Robinho double and Zlatan Ibrahimovic penalty gave the Serie A giants a comprehensive victory. The north Londoners did regain some pride with a valiant 3-0 win at home but the damage was done and the Gunners were out. The defeat was the start of four consecutive last 16 losses for the Gunners.

Having been paired up with German powerhouse Bayern Munich for the last two Champions League campaigns, Arsenal fans breathed a sigh of relief when they avoided the Bundesliga champions and were instead drawn against French side Monaco. Seen as one of the 'easier' ties in the last 16, Arsenal fans went into the game full of confidence. However, the mood soon changed as Monaco took advantage of Arsenal's lethargic display and took the lead through Geoffrey Kondogbia's deflected effort. Wenger's side failed to improve after the break as things went from bad to worse. Former Tottenham and Manchester United frontman Dimitar Berbatov sauntered through to score before substitute Yannick Ferreira Carrasco extended Monaco's advantage following Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's curling consolation. Arsenal have it all to do at Stade Louis II in the return leg but still have a slight chance of progressing and salvaging some pride. Humiliation rating: 7/10 .

Arsenal went in to the 2011 Capital One Cup final as major favourites but gifted the trophy to Alex McLeish's Birmingham after a horror defensive mix-up. With the game seemingly heading into extra-time after Robin van Persie cancelled out Nicola Zigic's opener, Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny missed a relatively easy clearance before clattering in to the onrushing Wojciech Szczesny which allowed Obafemi Martins to steal in and clinch the game for the Blues.

Arsenal versus Manchester United was the definitive Premier League rivalry of the 90s and early 2000s making 2001's 6-1 onslaught particularly difficult to take for the travelling Gunners. Arsene Wenger's men were 5-1 down at half-time as Dwight Yorke claimed a hat-trick on just 21 minutes after Thierry Henry's initial equaliser. United midfielders Roy Keane and Nicky Butt scored before half-time before former Tottenham striker Teddy Sheringham hit Arsenal for six in the 89th minute. Humiliation rating: 8/10 .

Newcastle staged an incredible comeback through Leon Best and two Barton spot-kicks before Cheick Tiote rifled home a stunning left-foot volley which  past a helpless Wojciech Szczesny.

It's never easy losing to your fierce, local rivals but to see Arsenal players falling out during a mauling by Tottenham was a bitter pill to swallow for the red half of north London. As if Tottenham running riot wasn't enough, the sight of Nicklas Bendtner in a heated exchange with goalscorer Emmanuel Adebayor before arguing with William Gallas made for miserable viewing. The Gunners were then left to watch as Tottenham celebrated booking their place in the League Cup final at the expense of their rivals. A night to forget for Wenger and Co.

Ten years on since the initial 6-1 embarrassment, Arsene Wenger was again left humiliated by old foe Sir Alex Ferguson.. and there was an even bigger deficit to contend with this time. The manner of the defeat was brutal on the Frenchman and his young Arsenal side as the Red Devils completely wiped the floor with their opponents to produce one of the Premier League's biggest scorelines.

Twennty minutes on the clock and the Anfield scoreboard made sickening read for the travelling faithful: Liverpool 4-0 Arsenal. The Gunners looked completely shell-shocked as Brendan Rodgers side entered cruise control with seventy minutes of the game remaining after racing into a 4-0 lead in the opening quarter of the game. Unlikely goalscorer Martin Skrtel had a double after ten minutes before Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge made it four. Sterling scored his second on 52 minutes to complete Liverpool's five-star performance before Mikel Arteta netted a consolation penalty. Unsuprisingly, not one Arsenal player was in the mood to celebrate as the game's end couldn't come quick enough. Arsene Wenger later took a tumble at Lime Street station to compound the Frenchman's humiliation on a horrible day on Merseyside. Humiliation rating: 9/10 .

The defeat - on penalties after the game ended 1-1 - proved a major setback for Wenger's side who had lost won a trophy in 2005.

March 22, 2014 was a day Arsene Wenger would never forget as he led out Arsenal for the 1000th time. However, it soon became a match the Frenchman would rather forget as Chelsea ruined his landmark day by recording the Blues' biggest-ever win over their  rivals. Arsenal were two down after seven minutes, saw Kieran Gibbs wrongly sent off for an Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handball before shipping another four which handed Jose Mourinho - one of Wenger's fiercest touchline rivals - his biggest Premier League result. Wenger admitted in the build-up to the clash that every defeat left 'a scar in your heart that you never forget'. This particular loss will remain etched in the memory for a very long time to come.

"How Per Mertesacker must long for the days when he danced onto stage with the World Cup in front of an adoring crowd of half a million in Berlin. That was in July, a few weeks before his return to Arsenal and the promise of a season in which he would silence the doubters and prove his worth as a world champion. There was, to begin with, a World Cup hangover. But six months on and his sobering performance has left Arsenal fans and Arsene Wenger nursing a banging headache. Per Mertesacker looks dejected after Arsenal were beaten 3-1 at home to Monaco on Wednesday night . The defender admits that Arsenal will need a 'wonderful night' in Monaco to qualify for the quarter-final . During Wednesday’s disastrous 3-1 defeat at home to Monaco, Mertesacker was at his indecisive and lumbering worst. And this, don’t forget, was Arsenal’s captain. For Geoffrey Kondogbia’s opener – deflected in via the German – he was lethargic in his closing of the France midfielder and his limp body was an all-too-easy detour on its path to goal. A John Terry, for example, would surely have closed with more aggression and purpose. Mertesacker continued to dither and unnerve until his fatal involvement in Monaco’s tie-changing second. For reasons only known to the 30-year-old, he chose to chase possession inside the opposition half, a pursuit which was always destined to fail. And so it did. Monaco broke, Mertesacker was a spectator and Dimitar Berbatov – the former Fulham reserve – climaxed their attack with a cool finish. Geoffrey Kondogbia lets fly and his shot takes a wicked deflection off Mertesacker's chest for the opener . Dimitar Berbatov enjoyed his second half strike which put the game beyond Arsenal . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain struck a sublime effort deep in injury time which appeared to give the Gunners  hope . But that was extinguished after Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco punished more defensive laxity to make it 3-1 . In the aftermath of the concession the cameras cut to the forlorn centre-back – for it took a few seconds to locate him on halfway. But his face was pained, remorseful for his part in the goal. Even for the tie-clinching third he was slow to close the scorer, although he had been left brutally exposed by the shortcomings of his team-mates. Ironically, Mertesacker’s best performance was saved for the post-match rallying cry he issued ahead of the second leg in Monaco. ‘Let's try to raise everyone's level at Monaco. Let's try to get in our rhythm there. We could have scored more than three goals last night and we can hurt them,’ he said. ‘We have to focus on that. We can't look back and think too much about this game. We will analyse what went wrong, but when we travel to Monaco we have to be on the front foot, be brave and get the best out of ourselves.’ Mertesacker celebrates with the World Cup trophy in the German dressing room after their victory . Mertesacker leads the celebrations in front of the German fans after their World Cup triumph in July . (Left to right) Ron-Robert Zieler, Boateng, Sami Khedira and Mertesacker celebrate in Berlin after their win . Mertesacker can only hope they do not spend too long poring over the ills of the first leg, for he would take star billing in any DVD nasty. Leadership – and, for a second time, let us remind ourselves he is the captain – comes from the heart of a defence. But Mertesacker has cut a subdued and sulky figure all season. Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher tore into him following his abdication of responsibility during the 3-2 defeat at Stoke. It didn’t take forensic inspection to determine just how bad he was that afternoon. Nor does it take analysis from the game’s sharpest minds to pinpoint the weakness in Arsenal’s side right now. Indeed, from stumbling giraffes to turning cargo ships, Mertesacker was the subject of social-media ridicule in the hours after the loss to Monaco. How he must long for the days of summer.","Per Mertesacker had nightmare as Arsenal lost to Monaco on Wednesday .

"Tottenham have crashed out of the Europa League after an agonising 2-0 defeat in Florence. Spurs should have had a half-time lead but Roberto Soldado spurned a glorious chance when through on goal and that was the turning point as Mario Gomez and Mohamed Salah struck for Fiorentina to send Mauricio Pochettino's side out. Spurs now have to quickly turn their attention to Sunday, to prepare for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. Host commentator . Thanks for joining me for the action in Florence this evening. Spurs will certainly need to re-group ahead of facing Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday . Heartache for Spurs, they are out! Fiorentina have won and are through to the Europa League last 16. 22-year-old Salah has done his parent club Chelsea a real favour tonight. The winger, on loan in Florence, has been exceptional. I wonder if Blues boss Jose Mourinho has been watching... Tottenham keep losing possession as the lump the ball forward. It's all very desperate now. Fiorentina's side are a wall of purple as Tottenham continue to fail at breaking their stubborn resistance. Andros Townsend whips in a freekick and Soldado's looping header just cruves over the bar. Here is the picture Spurs fans won't want to see- Salah doubling Fiorentina's lead. Eriksen lets fire from long range but Neto makes a smart save to concede a corner . Joaquin heads off for club legend Pasqual as the hosts try to run down the clock . The Florence side are already time wasting by holding up the ball in the Tottenham corner as Spurs struggle to obtain possession. Time is running out. It's all Spurs at the moment but the attacking play is very disjointed. Harry Kane has the ball in the back of the net but Soldado is offside before his cutback. Tottenham still require two goals. Andros Townsend wins a freekick just on the edge of the area but Eriksen once again hits the wall. Vertonghen trudges off to be replaced by Walker . Salah is booked for his exuberant celebration having ripped off his top during his sprint to the crowd . Spurs shoot themselves in the foot. An innocuous ball isn't dealt with by Tottenham and a one-two between Salah and Gomez puts the Egyptian through on goal. He finishes past Lloris and leaps over the advertising hoardings to celebrate. Spurs on the brink? It's that man again - Badelj is free 20 yards out but Fiorentina waste another decent chance after his blazes well over the bar. Micah Richards has put in a fine performance for the Serie A side. Here's some of his latest acrobatics! Here we go, here come the cavalry. Harry Kane and Andros Townsend come on for Spurs. Chadli and Bentaleb make way. Salah weaves his way through the Spurs defence and finds himself in front of Lloris but his weak shot is hit straight at the French stopper. Unbelievable chance to double the lead. Time for a change? Spurs are getting increasingly frustrated as Bentaleb attempts an audacious cross field pass which goes out for a Fiorentina goalkick! Gonzalo Rodriguez on, Basanta off after the defender pulls up whilst making a clearance. Mario Gomez runs clear after a horror moment from Fazio. The centre back gives the ball away to Badelj, who plays in the former Bayern Munich striker to sprint through and slot past Lloris. Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino is becoming increasingly animated on the touchline, especially after a few decisions have gone against his side . Badelj is in the thick of the action. Salah steals the ball in the Spurs penalty area and cuts it back for Badelj but his effort from the middle of the box is straight at Lloris . Ben Davies is booked for a robust tackle on Badelj. Slightly harsh as seemed 50/50. Chadli bursts down the left wing but his cross is too close to Neto. Massive 45 mins for Spurs who begin the second-half. So whilst free-scoring Harry Kane is on the bench and Soldado has spurned a glorious chance, Pochettino's other striker Emmanuel Adebayor has posted on Instagram a picture of him kicking back drinking from a coconut. A sustained period of pressure from Spurs sees multiple crosses into the Fiorentina box. Nobody can latch onto a cross and it stays 0-0 at the break. That gives gives Spurs 45 minutes to find a desperately needed away goal to progress. A ball over the top sees Salah race through once again but his effort his flashed well over the Tottenham bar. Here is the moment Soldado should have scored for Spurs. Ouch! Mario Gomez out of nothing is clear by the Tottenham touchline, he cuts back inside but his shot is well blocked by Fazio. It ricochets off Fazio's arm but a penalty would have been extremely harsh. Free-kick for Spurs....and specialist Eriksen smacks it into the wall. Disappointing for the visitors but it's all hands to the pump for Fiorentina as the pressure continues to build on their goal. Since Soldado's shocker Tottenham have been well on top. It seems the hosts are giving Spurs far too much respect and Pochettino's side are struggling to break down two banks of defence. Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai, who is at the Stadio Artemio Franchi, sums it up well... Soldado is played straight through on goal as the Fiorentina back-line is far too high. Soldado is joined clear with Chadli but the Spaniard's tame pass fails to find Chadli and Neto is able to intercept and gather the ball. That's a crucial waste from Soldado, but how costly will it prove? So far so good for Spurs. They've managed to get into the game and keep Salah relatively quiet. However Pochettino doesn't seem too thrilled on the touchline... Former Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani enters the fray as Fernandez picks up a muscle injury . Almost immediately after Chiriches swings in a delightful ball from wide right which Savic has to clear with a last-ditch header. Very promising spell for Spurs. Spurs win a corner and from the clearance Stambouli unleashes from 20 yards but his effort is well blocked by Joaquin. Nacer Chadli loses possession wide on the left and a swift counter attack started by Micah Richard sees Mario Gomez in on goal but he fails to find his feet and Ben Davies just about manages to cover the danger and force a goal kick. The Italians are rapid on the break. Spurs really need to close down Salah. The winger finds volumes of space on the edge of Tottenham's area and is narrowly called back for offside. Spurs were in trouble there . Well well, Spurs have a penalty shout! Stefan Savic (a former Manchester City defender) goes to ground and brings down Eriksen in the box. Minimal if any contact with thew ball but referee Hüseyin Göçek waves away some weak appeals. Former Roma forward Erik Lamela volleys at goal from outside the box but it's comfortably saved by Murara Neto . Salah is already imposing himself on the game with his pace. Running down the left he wins a corner for the hosts but Lloris does well to punch clear . As I mentioned, talisman striker Harry Kane is on the bench for Spurs tonight. The Serie A side have the first chance. Chelsea loanee Mohamed Salah does well on the left to set up Badelj but his 20 year strike goes wide of Lloris' post. Their is a raucous atmosphere at the Stadio Artemio Franchi and both sides have begun tentatively. Focus will be needed tonight. Kick-off has started another historic European night for Tottenham... A strong Spurs line-up is out on the pitch. Just a reminder Pochettino's side must score after Fiorentina's away goal at White Hart Lane last week. The Tottenham squad has been out on the Stadio Artemio Franchi pitch for a quick warm up. They'll play in front of 2,200 Spurs fans who have sold out their allocation. Harry Kane is supposedly rested for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday. But will Spurs need him later to rescue their European dream? Fiorentina substitutes: Rodriguez, Aquilani, Pasqual, Lezzerini, Babacar, Tomovic, Ilicic . Tottenham substitutes: Walker, Rose, Paulinho, Vorm, Townsend, Kane, Mason . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino appears in high spirits ahead of kick-off . Here are the line-ups out in Italy. The big news is Harry Kane starts on the bench for Spurs. Fiorentina (4-3-3): Murara Neto; Richards, Basanta, Savic, Alonso;  Fernandez, Pizarro, Badelj; Joaquin, Gomez, Salah .

"Arsenal are staring at a  fifth-straight Champions League last 16 exit following their 3-1 first leg defeat at home to Monaco on Wednesday night - a defeat which has brought a dark cloud over the Gunners' season. With that in mind, Sportsmail have Arsenal fan Lewis Potton of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation.  Let's see what he had to say. After the drubbing Arsenal received at the hands of Monaco on Wednesday, the mood among fans is probably as low as it could be. It was not just the manner of the defeat that has hurt Gunners fans, but the false promise that came before it. After the 2-0 victory over Manchester City last month, it looked as if Arsenal had finally learned how to handle the big occasion, a view shared by most fans I've spoken to. However, Wednesday night showed just how naive and frail this team can be on their day. If we'd have come into the game on the back of defeats and poor form, as we did against Bayern in 2013, then the result may have been less humiliating. However, sitting third in the league and with some encouraging performances since Christmas, it was a different scenario altogether and made the whole experience all the more galling to watch. Arsene Wenger found it painful viewing as his Arsenal side capitulated 3-1 at home to Monaco on Wednesday . Dimitar Berbatov rolled back the years with a glorious finish as Monaco scored three away goals . Arsenal players look dejected during the match as they now face a daunting second leg comeback attempt . Losing 3-1 at home hands the team an enormous task for the second-leg in France. A task I don't see this side capable of completing at this moment in time. There were so many shocking displays across the pitch on Wednesday night that it will take something truly historic for Arsenal to progress to the next stage. According to Infostrada Sports, Arsenal have a 1.5 per cent chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals, and to be honest, that sounds spot on. Let's examine how Monaco have played in Europe this season. They conceded one goal in six matches in the Group Stage and were only breached last night by a top class Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain strike. If that is the calibre of goal needed for Arsenal to win in France, then 1.5 per cent looks generous. Compact and excellent on the break, Monaco were set up perfectly. Their 3-1 lead for the return leg also suits them. Arsenal will have to attack with numbers and will leave themselves open to the same counter-attacks we saw at the Emirates. Optimists will point to Arsenal's experiences against Bayern in 2013; where we similarly lost 3-1 at home, before narrowly going out on away goals after a 2-0 win in Munich. The game in Monaco is a world away from that tie. Monaco won't open up because they are playing at home, like Bayern did. Boss Leonardo Jardim will have them playing the same system. Tight, compact and defensively sound. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave the Gunners hope when he made the score 2-1 late on before Monaco's third . What to say about the manager. Most of us love Arsene Wenger, but he had the wrong idea straight from selecting his team for this game. When will he learn that picking Cazorla and Ozil in a midfield three is not feasible in Europe? Rosicky should have started alongside Coquelin in midfield, at least giving some sort of base from which to play. Some Arsenal fans like to get on Ozil's back because of his style of play, but it's like Wenger is putting a square peg in a round hole. He isn't the sort of player who will track back and battle for you and everyone knows that. Monreal has also played well of late and it was surprising that Wenger suddenly thrust Gibbs into the left back slot. Presumably because he is better going forward. It screamed as though Wenger and Arsenal wanted to put the game to bed at home and have an easy away game, which is ridiculous. As a club, we should know by now that the Champions League is never that simple. Another season, another disappointment in Europe for Arsenal. Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla shouldn't have started together in midfield for Arsenal on Wednesday night .

"Ex-New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez ran up a $243 bar tab and smoked marijuana in the hours before the boyfriend of his fiancee's sister was shot to death, according to testimony on Thursday at his murder trial. Just over an hour before the killing of Odin Lloyd on June 17, 2013, video surveillance shows Hernandez walking unsteadily at a gas station and dancing near the gas pumps. The video also shows a co-defendant, Carlos Ortiz, wearing a white towel around his shoulders. A white towel was found near Lloyd's body later that morning in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home. Prosecutors have said Hernandez left the gas station and drove to Lloyd's home in the Dorchester section of Boston. A different surveillance video already seen by the jury shows Lloyd getting into the rear passenger side of a car at 2.32am outside his home. Lloyd's body was found hours later at an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's house. Scroll down for video .

Former Pats player Hernandez can be seen displaying his hip-hop moves as his rental car fills with gas, earlier that evening he had ran up a $243 bar tab and smoked marijuana . Lloyd, 27, had been shot six times, and police found five empty .45-caliber shell casings nearby. They found another 45-caliber shell in a dumpster at a rental car agency, and witnesses testified it had been removed from a car Hernandez returned. Police have not found the gun used in the slaying. Prosecutors contend Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home, before driving him to the North Attleboro industrial area where his body was found. Prosecutors haven't said who shot Lloyd but said Hernandez orchestrated the killing. Ortiz and another co-defendant, Ernest Wallace, have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Thursday's testimony began with an account from Kelly Rose Belanger, who was bar manager at South Street Cafe in Providence, Rhode Island, on June 16, 2013, which was Father's Day. Another woman, Vanessa Sanchez, testified on Wednesday that she was among the six people in the group, which included Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of his child. Sanchez said Hernandez proposed a toast to Father's Day, and the three couples there talked a lot about their children. Prosecutors displayed a receipt from that night that showed the tab included 30 alcoholic drinks: 11 Hennessy cognacs, 10 Sex on the Beach mixed vodka drinks, seven Bud Lights and two Grey Goose vodkas. Co-defendant Carlos Ortiz wears a white towel around his shoulders in the video - a similar to that found near Lloyd's body later that day . During the evening, Belanger said, Hernandez left the bar several times with one of the men he was with. She could smell marijuana and looked outside and saw Hernandez and the other man smoking it. She asked them to stop, and they did, she said. Hernandez paid the $243 tab at 12:19 a.m. on June 17, leaving a $30 tip, Belanger said. Less than two hours later, at 2:08 a.m., Hernandez and Ortiz were captured on video at a gas station south of Boston. Hernandez is seen putting gas in a Nissan Altima that he had rented the previous week, and Ortiz wore the white towel around his neck. Hernandez, who occasionally stumbles and looks unsteady on his feet, dances with his hands over his head, then goes into the gas station. There, he buys gum and cigars with Ortiz. They get back in the car with Hernandez in the driver's seat and Ortiz in the back. They leave at 2:12 a.m. Lloyd was dead by 3:30 a.m. Lloyd's mother wept and mouthed the words 'my baby, my baby' as photos of his body in the morgue and bullet-shredded clothes were shown in court on Tuesday. Hermandez continued his dance moves as he approaches the store where he can be seen buying bubble gum - an item prosecutors have often used to connect him to the murder . Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez pictured at his murder trial at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Mass., on Wednesday . Ursula Ward quietly mouthed the words over and over as jurors saw photos of his body during Hernandez's murder trial. She also cried as the shirts he was wearing the night he died in 2013 were shown to jurors by a Massachusetts state trooper. The trooper pointed out where the bullets had made holes on the blood-stained material. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Heather Sullivan told the court that the holes in the Lloyd's shirt were around the size of a quarter, suggesting he had been shot at almost point-blank range. Hernandez, 25, is accused of fatally shooting Lloyd, who had been dating his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins' sister, in an industrial park near his North Attleboro, Massachusetts, home in June 2013. He also faces a variety of firearms charges. Ward left the courtroom in tears twice in the early days of the trial, and the judge warned her not to cry while she gave her testimony. Since then, Ward usually leaves the courtroom before graphic images are shown. Tuesday was the first occasion when she has decided to stay while witnesses give graphic testimony about her son's violent death. She was accompanied by Odin's girlfriend, Shaneah Jenkins. Across aisle sat Terri Hernandez, mother of the defendant, who returned to court after a number of days away. As proceedings began, a woman who cleaned Hernandez's Massachusetts home testified that the former Patriots star's fiancée was visibly nervous the day after Lloyd was killed. Massachusetts State Police Trooper Heather Sullivan holds up bloodied clothing with bullet holes from the body of Odin Lloyd as evidence in the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez on Tuesday . Hernandez's fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, spent time on the telephone, peeking out the window and crying after hauling away a large trash bag in the trunk of a red car, 31-year-old Carla Barbosa, a native of Brazil, told the court. Miss Jenkins was not in court on Tuesday. 'She was nervous, she was walking back and forth,' said Barbosa, who added that police were outside when she left the house on June 18, 2013, a day after Odin Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found. Earlier that day, Barbosa testified, she saw Jenkins carry a large trash bag out of the home. 'It was held close to her, she had her arms around it,' she said in Portuguese, which was translated by an interpreter. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury charges for lying to a grand jury about not knowing where she disposed of a box Hernandez had asked her to throw out. She was granted immunity recently but it remains unclear if she will testify. Prosecutors showed video from Hernandez's home surveillance system of Jenkins carrying a large trash bag from the house. The day after Lloyd's body was found on wasteland a mile from the Hernandez home, the football player's fiancée, Shayanna, was seen on their own surveillance cameras taking a large trash bag from the home . On Monday, two other housekeepers testified that they found several guns around Hernandez's home in the weeks before Lloyd's murder . Marilia Prinholato, 28, said that a black handgun fell onto the floor while she was changing sheets in a basement guestroom at the house where Hernandez lived with his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, and their baby. 'I just took the gun and looked at it and put it back,' Prinholato said, adding that the gun was 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 cm) long and had a full magazine. Prinholato said another housekeeper, Grazielli Andrade Silva, showed her a second, smaller gun that Silva found in a pocket of a pair of pants the former tight end left in the master bedroom. It was silver with black accents, she said. Hernandez's house cleaners, Grazielli Silva (left) and Marila Prinholato (right), testified during the murder trial on Monday about finding guns at the NFL star's Massachusetts mansion . Silva testified that the gun was small enough to fit in the palm of her hand, and that she saw another gun, like 'a normal gun that the police use,' in Hernandez's sock drawer. Lloyd's body was found by a teenaged jogger on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park about a mile  from Hernandez's home. Authorities have not located the gun used in the slaying. Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team shortly after being arrested in June 2013. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. He will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012. Earlier on Monday, two people who worked in the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found testified that they heard sounds like fireworks at the time of his death.","Video evidence shown in Hernandez's murder trial on Thursday shows him dancing as he fills his vehicle with gas .

"Ronny Deila had been clear. This was a night for Virgil van Dijk, the defender Celtic rate in the £10million bracket, to make a bold, decisive impact in European competition. It’s doubtful this was what the Parkhead manager had in mind. Van Dijk’s dismissal, for two soft yellow cards in nine first half minutes, was both damaging and contentious. Through Celtic eyes the Slovakian referee Ivan Kruzliak, a card happy, inconsistent character, was a key contributor to their latest night of disappointment on Italian soil. As they left the field Celtic players remonstrated long and bitterly with the referee. Fredy Guarin’s stunning 20 yard strike had broken their stubborn, tired resistance three minutes from time, but the anger lingered long into the night.

Inter Milan: Carrizo, Santon, Ranocchia, Juan Jesus, D'Ambrosio (Campagnaro, 81), Guarin, Medel, Hernanes (Kovacic, 80), Palacio (Puscas, 89), Shaqiri, Icardi. Subs not used: Handanovic, Vidic, Kuzmanovic, Obi. Goal: Guarin (88) Bookings: D'Ambrosio, Guarin. Celtic: Gordon, Matthews, Denayer, van Dijk, Izaguirre, Mackay-Steven (Ambrose, 40), Brown, Biton, Armstrong (Commons, 78), Johansen, Guidetti (Forrest, 59). Subs not used: Zaluska, Stokes,  Wakaso,  Henderson. Bookings: Gordon, Matthews, Izaguirre, Biton. Red card: Van Dijk . Referee: Ivan Kruzliak . The disappointment won’t be eased by the knowledge the club will inevitably face yet another trial by UEFA for events high in the top tier of the San Siro, after a handful of mindless idiots in their 3500 travelling support ignored pre-match pleas to leave their flares at home. For the second successive away game pyrotechnics were witnessed amongst the Parkhead fans, in the 49th minute of a game their team finished with credit. They are out of the Europa League after a sixth successive away game without winning. From the moment Van Dijk sustained his second booking – as soft as the first – their fate looked almost inevitable. Celtic’s number five collided with Rodrigo Palacio in 27 minutes in a clumsy challenge. With an hour to play there was an ominous feel to the flash of yellow and so it proved when Van Dijk clumsily panicked and blundered into the back of Mauro Icardi in 36 minutes. Inter Milan players, the masters of influencing impressionable referees, did their bit. The red card was duly shown and Celtic’s early promise, their growing optimism, was dented. Ironically, there were long spells after Van Dijk’s departure when the Scottish champions looked more secure. They repelled their serie A opponents manfully despite their numerical disadvantage. The shame of it all is this. With eleven men this was a night which promised so much more. In their imposing San Siro cathedral Roberto Mancini’s Inter Milan were here for the taking. With a full complement for half an hour Celtic were confident, composed, dangerous. Van Dijk (right) looks dismayed as he leaves the pitch at the San Siro after being shown a red card .

They had a great chance in eight minutes when Gary Mackay-Steven was in on goal, clean as a whistle. The former Dundee United man gathered Emilio Izaguirre’s probing cross, took a great first touch and made time to pick his spot. His sidefoot was blocked by Juan Pablo Carrizo, Inter sweeping up the park instantly to create a shooting chance for Rodrigo Palacio. But this was a night when Craig Gordon, in contrast with the 3-3 first leg draw in Glasgow, looked the part. He blocked Palacio’s effort and, before him, Van Dijk was beginning to look like the defender people think he can be at this level. Then the roof caved in. There will be Celtic people who suspect the referee was a homer from the start. Long before he started waving his red card around. In 14 minutes the Scottish champions shouted long and hard for a penalty kick. Stuart Armstrong (centre) of Celtic goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by Davide Santon of Inter . Nir Biton (right) competes for the ball alongside Juan (left) of Inter Milan in the Europa League game . In a fine move John Guidetti, starting up front after Leigh Griffiths sustained an injury on Wednesday night, poked the ball into the path of Stefan Johansen, the Norwegian’s first time nudge into the path of Stuart Armstrong sending the midfielder towards goal. What happened next was a huge bone of contention. At first glance Inter full-back Davide Santon leaned into his back. Television pictures were less conclusive. Had Celtic won the penalty it would have been soft. But no softer than the two yellow cards which rendered them numerically disadvantaged after 36 minutes. And, to the despair and dismay of the 3500 travelling support – they left their flares at home this time – forced Deila to introduce Efe Ambrose to the fray for the withdrawn Mackay-Steven. In more ways than one the psyche, the feel, of this game changed. For half an hour Celtic had found their way into Inter’s faces. They pressed high up the pitch, they carved the better chances. The minute Van Dijk went the game changed. Like a pin pricking the bubble of optimism Ronny Deila’s side – chasing the first win in 12 attempts on Italian soil in the club’s history – looked shot. They still had Craig Gordon of course. No one believed the Scotland keeper’s haphazard performance in Glasgow was likely to be repeated here and it wasn’t.

He pulled off an outstanding wrist twisting save from Mauro Icardi’s eight yard header immediately after the red card. In a frantic spell before half-time he then brilliantly blocked a driven, angled effort from Danilo D’Ambrosio after strong defending from Jason Denayer. He was at it again in 55 minutes. Resuming normal service and proving the first leg aberrations were freakish in nature. Expectations of an Inter storm at the outset of the second half proved misplaced. But chances were inevitable and Icardi – a hugely talented footballer – crafted one when he ghosted in behind the visiting defence, failing to angle his low shot enough to put it past a goalkeeper growing in confidence more and more by the minute. The problem for Celtic was obvious. A man down they began to drop deeper and tire. In attack John Guidetti – with two goals in two games – toiled for mobility and pace. The loss of Griffiths the night before in training was now apparent. James Forrest – a winger – replaced the Swede in attack.

Hernanes (centre) plays the ball for Inter during their game against Celtic in the Europa League last 32 . Inevitably it did nothing to prevent Celtic’s slow, weary retreat into their own half. A 4-4-1 formation left Forrest – a player short of match sharpness - to run around up front in the hope of a breakaway. Predictably, Inter dominated possession. They had a fine chance in 66 minutes when Palacio found space at the back post to head square for the unmarked Shaqiri. The ball was inches too high and, again, Celtic survived. Inter didn’t need a goal, of course. Celtic did. To that end the final throw of the dice was the introduction of Kris Commons with 12 minutes to play. He stung the palms of Carrizo in the Inter goal with his first audacious long range shot. There was nothing to lose now. Somehow Celtic needed a goal. The game needed a goal. Regrettably it came for Inter and it was outstanding. Celtic were defending for their lives when Guarin, the Colombian midfielder, wound back his right foot and smashed an outstanding shot into the postage stamp corner.","Virgil van Dijk was sent off in the first half for Celtic for two yellow cards .

"Brendan Rodgers has admitted Manchester City will have a massive advantage when Liverpool relaunch their push for a Champions League place this weekend. Liverpool face the reigning champions at Anfield on Sunday but the game will start at 12pm - which is just 57 hours after they return from their Europa League tie in Istanbul. Rodgers has been forced to shuffle his pack coming out here to Turkey, as an ankle injury to Jordan Henderson and his decision to rest Philippe Coutinho means he is without 10 senior players, as Liverpool look to protect a 1-0 first leg lead. Brendan Rodgers believes Manchester City will have a major advantage over his Liverpool side . Liverpool will not get back from Istanbul until at least 3am on Friday and Rodgers is concerned that City - who faced Barcelona on Tuesday - will be fresher and fitter for what could prove to be a decisive game in the battle to secure a top four spot. 'That extra period of 48 hours that they (City) will have could be crucial, certainly physically,' said Rodgers. 'Especially as we don’t get back until 3am we will have very little preparation time. 'It’ll just be about recovery. We can’ t train on the pitch at Anfield (on Friday night), we can’t make it any worse than it is, so we’re having to train the next day (at Melwood). Liverpool will be without key men Jordan Henderson (left) and Philippe Coutinho for the clash . 'Sometimes you can get back and train later that day, it doesn't help us. But look, it’s the way it’s been dealt and we’ll deal with it the best we can. The players have had lots of challenges to overcome this season and we are ready to keep performing and doing the best we can.' When asked if this showed how difficult the demands of the Europa League is, Rodgers replied. 'Especially if you don’t get help, when we are on when we are, early on the Sunday. It is still a European competition. I would rather be in it than not in it. 'We are playing a lot of games this season because we had a successful couple of games, we are doing well, we are in a couple of competitions and if we want to maintain that and work well for the coming years we have to get used to a lot of games. Mario Balotelli (right) in action during a training session at Melwood Training Ground on Wednesday . 'It is unfortunate but we will do our best.' Rodgers hopes Henderson will be fit to face City, while Steven Gerrard could also feature as his recovery from a hamstring problem has gone smoothly.' Coutinho - who scored a stunning goal at Southampton last weekend - will certainly play as Rodgers felt this was an appropriate juncture to take the Brazilian out, given he has has just made 19 consecutive appearances. 'I’ve had to bring out young Coutinho,' said Rodgers. 'He hasn’t travelled. He’ s an outstanding young player for us, a key player for us and he’s played a lot of game consecutively for us now. 'This was a game that I’d earmarked to give some recovery in knowing he can stay at home, not travel and prepare and get ready for the weekend.'

"Burnley are set to sign Michael Kightly and Marvin Sordell on Friday as they begin implementing plans for the Premier League. Sordell is ready to complete a £500,000 move from Bolton, while Kightly – who was on loan at Turf Moor during last season’s promotion push – will join from Stoke for £1.5million. It will mark Sean Dyche’s first foray into the transfer market this summer, with the Clarets due back for pre-season training next week. Impact: Kightly imporessed last season in his loan spell with Burnley and is set to complete a £1,500,000 move . Experience: Kightly has played in the Premier League with Stoke but the winger was surplus to requirements . And Sordell, speaking earlier this week, admitted he can’t wait to link-up with his old boss. ‘I worked with him a lot at Watford and he’s a very good coach, a very good mentor for players and I’m not surprised Burnley did so well last season,’ the 23-year-old said. ‘If it comes along it would be a fantastic opportunity and I have been working at St George’s Park already in pre-season to give me the best chance to hit the ground running.’ Sordell spent the whole of last season on loan at Charlton Athletic after falling out of favour with Dougie Freedman at the Reebok Stadium and was part of Team GB’s Olympic side in 2012 after a £3million move from Watford to the Trotters. Excited: Sordell worked with Burnley boss Sean Dyche during his time at Watford . Success: Dyche led Burnley to the Premier League last season and is now building a squad to compete . Kightly was a big hit in the Championship, scoring the goal against Ipswich that confirmed Burnley’s top two spot back in April. Dyche is also reported to be interested in signing Derby County midfielder Craig Bryson.","Kightly was on loan at Turf Moor last season - will join from Stoke .

"Clayton Pettet, 19, said he will have gay sex for the first time in a gallery for a project entitled 'Art School Stole My Virginity' A gay student who sparked outrage after announcing he would lose his virginity in front of a crowd of 100 people in the name of art, has chosen a central London venue for the controversial 'exhibit'. Clayton Pettet, 19, said he will have sex for the first time at the Orange Dot gallery in Bloomsbury for a project entitled 'Art School Stole My Virginity'. He said he hopes his 'performance art project' - followed by a question and answer session -  will challenge the idea of sexuality. Clayton, who has been planning the event for three years, said he and an anonymous partner will have protected sex and then ask the audience what they thought of the performance. He wrote on his tumblr page: 'When all my peers at school were losing their virginity it was incredibly hard for me to ask why I was still a virgin and why it meant so much to the people all around me. 'My piece isn't a statement as much as it is a question. The whole aspect of virginity was incredibly emotional for me and has been ever since.' Clayton has not told his parents about the project, but has informed his tutors at Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design. Speaking about the event last year, he said: 'The key thing about performance art is that it should only be performed once, and this is the ultimate once-in-a-lifetime performance. 'I've held on to my virginity for 19 years, and I'm not throwing it away lightly. 'Basically it's like I am losing the stigma around virginity. 'I want the audience to see if anything has changed between me and my partner.

"The NHS is to spend £250million to clear a massive backlog of knee, cataract and hip replacement operations. Jeremy Hunt will today announce that the injection of cash will help ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment – unless it is clinically necessary. But the plan will also mean longer waiting times for tens of thousands of patients. Surgeons: The NHS is to spend £250million to clear a backlog of knee, cataract and hip replacement operations . The number of people on the NHS waiting list now stands at 3.1million – its highest for six years; with almost 600 having waited for longer than 12 months. The Health Secretary will say the money will pay for up to 100,000 operations over the next few months in a bid to treat some of those who have waited the longest. Officials admit that meeting the backlog will cause a short-term rise in the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks – still the most important target for hospitals – breaching a national pledge that 90 per cent of patients should be treated within this timescale. Ministers say this short-term breach is necessary to clear the huge backlog in elective surgery, which they attribute to higher demand and an ageing society. It means an extra 100,000 people a month are being referred for treatment compared to 2010, with hospitals performing an extra 2,000 operations a day. But Labour will say that the new 12-month treatment pledge is merely a way to deflect attention from a failure to tackle growing waiting lists in the health service over the past four years. Action should be targeted at all those on the waiting list – not just the longest – they say. In May 2010, the month of the last election, some 20,662 patients had waited for 18 weeks or more. By May 2014, this total had soared to 29,847. The situation is so bad in some trusts that patients have been urged to pay privately if they want to be treated more quickly. The clinical commissioning group in Southampton, for example, has imposed tough restrictions on cataract operations – and has been named and shamed by the RNIB. 'We need targets that help patients': Jeremy Hunt will announce that the injection of cash will help ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment . At the same time, the local trust – Southampton University Hospitals – allows people denied NHS treatment to pay for the service that would otherwise be provided free. Its website offers ‘a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS’. Mr Hunt’s response is to target those waiting more than a year. In May 2014, 574 people were in this position – down from 18,458 four years previously. Every person who has waited more than 52 weeks or is on the verge of doing so will have their case reviewed to see whether they should be fast-tracked. On a visit to Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, the Health Secretary will say: ‘No one – except in exceptional circumstances – should have to wait more than a year. ‘[We need] targets that help patients get treatment when they need it – not targets followed blindly with no regard for the impact on individuals. ‘An NHS confident that – in the end – it will continue to meet the huge challenges ahead if it leaves room, amongst many loud, competing pressures, for the quietest but most important voice of all: that of the patient.’ Liz Kendall, a Labour health spokeswoman, said: ‘David Cameron promised to protect patient care, but instead he has lost control of waiting times. ‘The number of people waiting more than 18 weeks for their treatment has increased by 50 per cent since 2010, and the cancer waiting time target has been missed for the first time ever. ‘The Tories have mismanaged the NHS – and it’s patients who are paying the price.’ Funded by the extra £250million, the NHS will in the next few weeks carry out more than 100,000 treatments to people who have been waiting more than 18 weeks, of which 40,000 will be admitted to hospital. It will also conduct an immediate review of every person waiting over or close to 52 weeks. Treating them will be a priority, unless there are strong clinical reasons for the delay or the patient chooses to wait longer. A Department of Health source said: ‘Because operations on longer waiters are often more complex and difficult, they take more time and resources. ‘However, by the end of the year the NHS will start meeting the target again.’","Almost 600 NHS patients have waited more than a year for their operations .

"Steven Finn had the perfect word to describe himself after his mauling by Brendon McCullum when England were last here in the New Zealand capital. Finn, after disappearing for 49 in two overs, said he felt like a 'wally.' Yet the fast bowler who has battled his way back to this World Cup after being described as 'unselectable' just over a year ago got straight back on the horse against Scotland and actually bowled as well as he has done in two years. Now Finn, who was so good on tour in New Zealand two years ago that he was almost unplayable in the one-day internationals, feels he is back to his best after a year in which he could easily have fallen away from international cricket. Steven Finn bowls during a nets session at Karori Park in Wellington as coach Peter Moores (left) watches on . 'Look, in that situation against New Zealand, McCullum was always going to come hard and it seemed that everything I tried didn't quite work,' said Finn. 'It was one of those days but I've bowled well throughout this trip and have taken wickets so I don't feel too downhearted by it. 'When you're bowling and it's disappearing over your head for six it's not a nice feeling. You feel like a wally when you're out there, but it happened and it's in the past. It's never happened to me before like that and I've got him out before. 'Usually if I try something it works but it didn't that day. It was one of those days and I'm very disappointed, gutted and embarrassed by it. Someone will come that hard at us again but we'll have to find a way of dealing with it.' England play a match during an England nets session at Karori Park in Wellington on Thursday . Stuart Broad in discussion with his coach Moores and team-mates during the nets session . England actually deserve credit for sticking with Finn, who can be fragile in adversity, against Scotland because they could easily have replaced him with either Chris Jordan, who has impressed in practice, or James Tredwell. Finn responded by taking three wickets to follow his hat-trick and five-wicket haul against Australia and while that in itself against Scotland was not earth shattering the way he bowled was encouraging. 'I feel normal,' he said. 'The amount of wickets I've taken over here have helped get that confidence back. And just playing international cricket and being in the set-up and round the guys day in and day out helps that confidence too. So I'm just a normal cricketer playing cricket now. That's all it is.' And back to the old Steven Finn, one of most promising fast bowlers in world cricket? 'Yes I'd say so. Everything feels fine. It feels as though everything is going the way it was for me a couple of years ago and that's good.' England captain Eoin Morgan plays a shot as he practices his batting . Not that his hat-trick against Australia was a typical fast bowler's one to be proud of, coming as it did to three catches in the deep off the last three balls of the innings. 'In 10 years time I'll tell people it was a classic hat-trick,' he smiled. 'I'll tell them it was three in-swinging yorkers! I was pleased to get a hat-trick and pleased to do it for England in a World Cup. But I was disappointed to do it off the last three balls of the innings. If it had happened earlier then brilliant I'd have been very happy about it.' England looked relaxed as they returned to work at picturesque Karori Park just outside Wellington on Wednesday, where they engaged in middle practice, recreating match scenarios, rather than the net practice of the Basin Reserve. At one point bowling coach David Saker pulled off a diving catch on the boundary to 'dismiss' Jos Buttler, causing assistant coach Paul Farbrace to shout out 'there's just been a minor earthquake.' The more serious business came when England practiced the death bowling that came in for so much criticism against Australia, notably their apparent inability to think on their feet and repeatedly bowl too short. 'We're always looking at it and trying to improve,' said Finn. 'It's been a running theme that teams 'get met' a little bit over here at the end and we have to buck that trend. We sit down and look at it and build plans and days like today, practicing scenarios in the middle, are good. When we come to the death overs we'll have clear plans and we'll a hundred per cent try to stick to them.' But do they stick too rigidly to them? 'Instinct is one of the most important things in cricket,' insisted Finn. 'I hate it when things are preconceived because it becomes too predictable and too obvious. 'You have to think on your feet, the best bowlers in the world do that, and find a delivery that's working on that wicket against that batsmen. That's a skill in itself and it's something we have to get better at.' England know that a win against Sri Lanka here in a match that starts on Saturday night UK time would all but take them to the quarter-finals. 'Every game is significant for us but especially this game on Sunday because of the manner in which we got beaten in the first two games,' said Finn. 'We were expected to put in a performance against Scotland but we got beat by Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka so it's important we go out there and try to stamp our authority in conditions that should favour us.' A win here at the Westpac Stadium where they were humiliated by New Zealand would certainly put their World Cup back on track.","England were humiliated by New Zealand on their last visit to New Zealand's capital city .

"The boss of a notorious drugs cartel who was arrested by police in Mexico on Monday has filed for legal protection amid claims that he could be at risk of torture. Head of the Zetas cartel, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, who is also known as Z-40, is known for 'stewing' his enemies alive in burning oil barrels and having ordered the regular beheadings, hangings and massacres of rivals. But he has called for protection claiming that he is at risk of harm during his detention as he is held accused of torture and murder. Scroll down for video . Captured: This mug shot released by Mexico's Interior Ministry on shows Zetas drug cartel leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales after his arrest . Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, aka El Z 40 is paraded in front of the cameras following his arrest on Monday . Armed and dangerous: The cartels are armed to the teeth guard their hauls of weapons and ammunition . Sources say that a judge is likely to reject his claim in the coming days with there said to be no grounds for his complaint. Since he was arrested in a pre-daw . operation in northeastern Mexico on Monday, Trevino Morales has filed four . complaints for 'the possible practices of torture, isolation and . mistreatment that may have taken place or may take place,' according to . Yahoo News. If Trevino Morales's claims were upheld by a judge, there is no chance that it would lead to his release. The arrest of Trevino Morales at dawn on . Monday without a shot being fired was seen as a coup for Mexican president . Enrique Pena Nieto. In his first seven months in power he has been . accused of failing to take on the cartels which have claimed as many as . 100,000 lives since 2006. Trevino Morales, 40, was seized on a dirt road . outside Nuevo Laredo, a Zetas stronghold in the north of the country . near the US border. He was in a pick-up laden with eight guns and . $2million in cash. Arrested with him were his bodyguard – and his accountant. He is said to have fled into heavy . brush and fallen at least once scratching his face in a failed attempt . to escape capture, according to a Mexican federal government official. The official, who spoke today on . condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss . the case, said the scrapes didn't result from mistreatment by the . marines who apprehended him. Ruthless: Trevino Morales, left, as a younger man, is believed to have masterminded the massacre in 2010 after which the killers piled the bodies on top of each other and left them to rot, right . Fear-mongering: Los Zetas shot dead five people in Apodaca in 2010, before pinning a message to their chest with an ice pick as a warning to collaborators of a rival drug cartel . Massacre: Three years ago the bodies of 72 people, believed to all be migrants, were found at a rural ranch in northern Mexico. The victims were shot by the members of the Zetas cartel known for exploiting vulnerable people . He said two men travelling with the purported leader of the brutal Zetas cartel dropped to the ground when a navy helicopter positioned itself in front of their truck. But Morales tried to run off into the brush on the side of the dirt road, but was caught, he said. Authorities said they found eight rifles in the truck, but not a single shot was fired. Although Trevino Morales is wanted in the United States on drug-trafficking charges, Mexican federal security spokesman Eduardo Sanchez said that he will first face trial in Mexico on multiple charges including torture, organised crime, murder, money laundering and possession of weapons. He added that as far as he knew, the US has not yet made any formal extradition request. Trevino Morales's arrest has been greeted as a possible turning point in the war against drugs cartels in Mexico. Samuel Gonzalez, former top anti-drug prosecutor, said: 'I think this capture is very important, and could make the difference. 'These people (the Zetas) are the ones who invented the whole process of violence, of decapitations, of hanging people from bridges. 'If, despite all that, you see one of their most violent leaders arrested, it means that even despite those methods, they're being brought to justice.' Slaughter: The bodies of decapitated men with their hands tied behind their back are scattered through a field in Caserio La Bomba, Guatemala in 2007, after the massacre of 27 farmers by the Zetas . Shocking: Innocent women and children and babies have been killed in Mexico's brutal drug wars . Shoot-out: Gang members lie dead in the grounds of the Los Arcos Hotel, Mexico, where at least six gunmen were shot dead after a gun fight between Mexican military and armed men from the Los Zetas . He added that unless a clear . replacement leader emerges for the cartel, that police would be able to . handle groups on a local level. Among the crimes he was wanted for is . the murder of more than 260 migrants who were dumped in mass graves . after being kidnapped in two separate incidents in 2010 and 2011. One technique favoured by Trevino Morales was . the ‘guiso,’ or stew, in which enemies would be placed in 55-gallon oil . drums and burned alive. Others who crossed the commander would be beaten . to death with wooden planks. According to the indictments, Trevino Morales . co-ordinated the shipment of hundreds of pounds of cocaine and marijuana . each week from Mexico to the US, much of which had passed through . Guatemala. Trevino Morales is also suspected of laundering . millions of pounds through US businesses, including a thoroughbred . horseracing operation allegedly run by a brother. He reportedly enjoyed pointing randomly at people from his car and ordering his men to kill them. He rose to the top of the Zetas last . year after the previous leader died in a shootout with Mexican marines . in the northern state of Coahuila. On his orders, 72 Central and South . American migrants were slaughtered by the Zetas in the northern town of . San Fernando in 2010, authorities said. The following year, 193 bodies were . found buried in San Fernando, most belonging to migrants kidnapped off . buses and killed by the Zetas for various reasons, including their . refusal to work as drug mules. Following their arrest, Trevino Morales and his henchmen were flown to Mexico City, where they are expected to be tried in a . closed system that usually takes years to prosecute cases. Indiscriminate: Los Zetas were behind the 2008 Morelia grenade attacks that saw eight were killed and over 100 injured . Gruesome drug war: In September 2011 two trucks were abandoned after one of them spilled 35 bodies of men and women belonging to the Los Zetas gang killed by a rival cartel. Morales and his henchmen set out to exact bitter revenge for the slaughter . Cache: Weapons belonging to the Zetas cartel, controlled by former special forces soldiers, are displayed after they were seized in 2011 . Huge haul: Armed police guard 1.5 tons of cocaine that was seized as it was shipped from Columbia into Los Zetas's vast smuggling network that spans much of South America and the US .","Trevino Morales, known as 'Z-40' was caught in Nuevo Laredo on Monday .

"More than a quarter of Scottish voters believe British spies are working to stop the country voting for independence, a new poll has revealed. Some 26 per cent of Scots think it is ‘probably true’ the security services are working to protect the union ahead of the referendum on 18 September. The findings illustrate the growing divide between Scotland and Westminster which is fuelling the 'Yes'  campaign for independence. Scroll down for video . Scottish voters are increasingly distrustful of Westminster politicians, a new YouGov poll has revealed . Scottish voters trust politicians based in Holyrood, Edinburgh, more than those based in Westminster . Many Scots do not believe warnings from UK politicians that the country would be blocked from using the pound. SNP leader Alex Salmond has dismissed the threat as a bluff. A poll published by YouGov this weekend showed voters overwhelmingly mistrust David Cameron and Ed Miliband. Just under three quarters of Scots said they did not trust what the Prime Minister said about independence. Seven in 10 voters north of the border meanwhile do not trust the Labour leader. Alex Salmond’s trust ratings are much higher. The Scottish First Minister is trusted by four in 10 Scots. The level of distrust is exposed by the latest YouGov poll, published by the website Buzzfeed, asking Scots about underhand tactics by the UK Government to sabotage the referendum. The poll questioned the same 1,084 Scottish individuals from yesterday’s bombshell Sunday Times survey which gave the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign a two point lead. The poll found almost half of Scots believe the British government is hiding new oil reserves found in the North Sea during the referendum campaign. Alex Salmond has claimed that new technology could release an extra £600billion worth of oil, while Better Together says such claims are wildly optimistic. The survey alsol found 19 per cent of Scots believe the referendum will probably be rigged. Andrew Parker, the  Director General of MI5, is believed by a quarter of Scots to be campaigning to keep Scotland in the union . Senior Scottish nationalists have previously suggested British spies could engage in a dirty tricks campaign to stop Scotland breaking away from the rest of the UK. The late Margo MacDonald MSP wrote to the chiefs of Britain’s security services in 2013, urging them not to let their spies interfere in the independence debate. Former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars suggested it is ‘naive’ to imagine MI5 is not taking a role in the independence campaign.","Poll shows 26% think it is 'probably true' that MI5 are working for union .

"A college student threatens to drop out of Dartmouth over the university's refusal to allow her to carry a handgun on its campus in New Hampshire. Taylor Woolrich, 20, says the university refused her request to carry a concealed firearm on campus to defend herself from Richard Bennett, 67, who she claims been stalking her since she was 16. Bennett is currently sitting behind bars in California on charges of violating a restraining order filed by Woolrich. 'Every morning I check the inmate lookup online to see if he has made bail,' Woolrich told Fox News. Scroll down for video . Defenseless: Richard Bennett (right), 67, is accused of using social media to stalk Taylor Woolrich (left), 20, and was arrested for violating an restraining order against him . 'I feel safe for now, but the day he gets out is the day I have to leave Dartmouth.' Bennett was arrested on felony charges in June for breaking the terms of a restraining order Woolrich had filed against him, San Diego County sheriffs records say. When Bennett was pulled over, KGTV reports, cops found what was they described as a 'rape kit,' which included a flashlight, gloves, binoculars and a rope tied in a noose. According to sheriffs records, Bennett was also charged with three counts of violating a court order prohibiting the possession of firearms. The college junior spoke at a conference in D.C. called Students for Concealed Carry and said that university officials told her there was 'no way' she could carry a gun on campus, regardless of whether she obtained a license. 'No appeals process, no supervisor,' added Woolrich. Behind bars: Richard Bennett is currently awaiting trial on charges stemming from his violation of a restraining order, including violation of prohibition against carrying guns . Dartmouth's website states that handguns brought to campus 'must be stored at the Department of Safety and Security.' After being refused her request to carry a weapon, Woolrich says she began contacting campus security to request escorts but started receiving responses such as 'You can't keep calling us all the time' or was told only to call after 9 p.m. As of publication, Dartmouth officials had not responded to requests for comment but university spokesman Justin Anderson told Fox News that, 'We are equipped and committed to providing the best safety possible for all our students.' Bennett met Woolrich when she was 16 at the San Diego-area coffee shop where she worked. She says the older man kept 'staring at her for long periods of time and trying to flirt with her.' Court documents state he also invited her to go camping with him multiple times. Bennett was arrested after he visited Woolrich's home in California offering 'landscaping services' the day after Woolrich had returned home from summer break, according to KGTV. The alleged stalker was stopped on a nearby highway when cops discovered the 'rape kit.'","Taylor Woolrich, 20, says the university denied her request for an exemption to their policy for firearms on campus .

"The website blamed for the death of  Hannah Smith have offered to name the trolls who tormented her . The website linked to a string of teenage suicides including the death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith have offered to name the trolls who tormented her. Hannah was found hanged in her bedroom, in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, last Friday after suffering months of abuse from trolls on Ask.fm who repeatedly urged her to kill herself, cut herself and ‘drink bleach’. Founders Mark and Ilja Terebin, the wealthy sons of a Red Army officer, have promised to hand over details of her abusers after Prime Minister David Cameron urged parents, teenagers and advertisers to boycott the site. In an open letter they wrote: 'Although it is possible to post anonymously to the site, we would like to reassure parents that in almost all cases it is possible for Ask.fm to identify users – through IP technology, everything on the internet is traceable – and in extreme circumstances such as those we’ve experienced this week we work through existing legal frameworks to ensure this information is accessible to the appropriate legal authorities.' Firms such as Vodaphone, Laura Ashley and Specsavers as well as charity Save the Children pulled their adverts yesterday. The open letter came hours after the Prime Minister urged the Terebins, and those running similar sites, to ‘step up to the plate and show some responsibility’. Mr Cameron also urged parents and teenagers to avoid using the ‘vile’ websites. He told Sky News: ‘Just because someone does something online, it doesn’t mean they’re above the law. If you incite someone to do harm, if you incite violence, that is breaking the law, whether that is online or offline. The mother and father of the Soviet-born brothers deny that their sons are in any way culpable over the death of Hannah .

"A monastery in the Czech Republic has a ghoulish secret for those willing to venture underground - two dozen corpses clutching rosaries are on display. The bodies in the Capuchin Crypt of the Holy Cross Church, in Brno, date back hundreds of years, but they were only recently rediscovered and opened to public viewing. The below-ground chamber's unique soil structure and a system of ventilation ducts allowed the corpses to be mummified in the open air, according to a Brno tourism website. Haunting Mummies are shown in the tomb of the Capuchin monastery in Brno, Czech republic on June 5, 2014, clutching their rosaries . Just another day in the office: An employee rakes the earth between mummies . 'Not for the squeamish': Mummies wearing cowls are also seen in the tomb . This allowed for the bodies to be lined up in rows along the crypt's walls to the tune of nearly 200, according to church officials. Only 24 remain, but the visual is haunting. Monks and church members lying on their backs with arms crossed and holding an ancient rosary. The burials started several hundred years ago and only concluded at the end of the 18th century.

"A pro-Palestine group projected the national flag on to the Houses of Parliament in London early this morning calling for an end to the bloodshed in Gaza. The stunt was claimed by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC), which said it projected the flag, complete with slogans including 'Free Palestine', 'Sanctions Now' and 'Stop the massacre', in an attempt to put pressure on the British government to take action. But their protest, which came in the early hours as America and the United Nations jointly announced a 72-hour ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, was condemned by British Jews, who called it 'offensive to the British public' and accused the PSC of being motivated by a 'hatred of Israel'. Meanwhile an east London mayor raised the Palestinian flag above the town hall for the second time after the first one was allegedly stolen. Scroll down for video . Stunt: A Palestinian flag calling for 'Sanctions now' was projected onto the Houses of Parliament today . Tower Hamlets' Muslim mayor Lutfur Rahman sparked a storm of protest on Wednesday when he raised the flag above the town hall to 'show solidarity with Gaza'. Police went to the civic offices yesterday but the flag had gone - the council said it had been 'ripped from the flagpole in an act of perceived vandalism' - so Mr Rahman, who is to face trial over allegations of voting fraud, raised another one. Today a Metropolitan Police spokesman said they had received an allegation of theft in relation to the flag and were investigating. So far the death toll of the latest conflict has reached at least 1,450 Palestinians, many of them civilians according to Gaza health officials, and 61 soldiers and three civilians on the Israeli side. Today Hugh Lanning, chairman of the PSC, said his group had projected the Palestinian flag onto the houses of Parliament because they were 'outraged' that the British government was 'standing by while Israel slaughters Palestinians.' He said: 'David Cameron has failed to listen to the voices of hundreds and thousands of British people who have taken to the streets. He has failed to stand up for an occupied people being ruthlessly murdered by an occupying power. 'The Prime Minister has weakly accepted the US' political position, which is totally out of step with the mood of this country. It is time for firm action consistent with international law.' Controversy: A second Palestinian flag has been raised above Tower Hamlets town hall in East London after the first one (pictured) was ripped down yesterday - its Muslim mayor Lutfur Rahman called for a ceasefire . The PSC wants Mr Cameron to demand an end to the bloodshed in Gaza, and impose an arms embargo and sanctions on Israel. Mr Lanning said: 'People are really angry that this injustice is continuing despite our ability as a nation to pressure Israel to end the attacks. 'The Government must not delay in responding to the moral and public demands it faces.' Board of Deputies Vice President Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said the stunt was 'offensive to the British public'. He told MailOnline: 'We don’t need to import conflicts in the Middle East to this country. We should instead be exporting values and efforts designed to bring about a peaceful resolution to the conflict. 'The PSC has once again shown itself to be an irrelevant and extremist pressure group. It appears to be motivated by nothing more than a hatred of Israel, the only democracy and true ally of the West in the Middle East. 'The PSC is silent on the rockets and tunnels of Hamas, an internationally proscribed terrorist organisation, but extremely vocal against Prime Minister David Cameron whose statements on the Gaza conflict have been measured, and constructive.' Tower Hamlets' Muslim mayor Lutfur Rahman, left, raised a second Palestinian flag above the town hall; while today's Westminster stunt follows the 1999 incident when an image of TV presenter Gail Porter was shown . Questions arose as to how the image came to be projected onto the landmark building. A spokesman for the Houses of Parliament said usual protocol for anyone wishing to project an image onto the building is to apply in advance. 'He said: 'Applications are considered by the Administration Committee, which is made up of MPs, but I am not aware of an advance application having been made in this case.' A spokesman for Lambeth Borough Council, which governs the other side of the river from where the projection probably came, said: 'Lambeth council only issues a licence for projections after a public consultation, the granting of planning permission and approval of the building owners. 'No permission was applied for, or given, in this case.' 'I don't want to see the flag of any foreign belligerent flying over the town hall that residents in Tower Hamlets pay for' - Tower Hamlets resident . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said they had not aware of any complaints or security issues with regards to the flag's projection on Westminster, an incident which had echoes of the 1999 magazine stunt in which the naked image of television presenter, Gail Porter, was projected onto the building. Pressure increased on the government to take action against Israel as local authorities around the country debated whether or not to follow the lead of Mr Rahman in Tower Hamlets. Controversy raged after he raised the first flag in East London, with one critic saying: 'I don't want to see the flag of any foreign belligerent flying over the town hall that residents in Tower Hamlets pay for.' The same flag was raised in Bradford, where the council is run by Labour, in Preston, and in West Dunbartonshire. Birmingham's council decided not to accede to pressure to fly the flag, stating that it only flew a few standards including the Union flag, the city flag and the Royal standard. Today Gaza officials said at least four Palestinians had been killed by Israeli tank fire nearly two hours after Israel and Hamas began observing a three-day ceasefire. Health Ministry official, Ashraf al-Kidra, and Gaza police spokesman, Ayman Batniji, said 15 other Palestinians were wounded in the shelling east of the southern Gaza city of Rafah. An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem said the military was looking into the incident, which came shortly after the 72-hour ceasefire began at 8am local time, 6am BST.","The flag, complete with pro-Palestine slogans, appeared in London today .

"Mauricio Pochettino insisted he had no regrets about starting top scorer Harry Kane on the bench on Thursday night despite watching stand-in striker Roberto Soldado miss a glorious chance as Tottenham crashed out of the Europa League with a 2-0 defeat against Fiorentina. Soldado suffered a horrendous moment of indecision when he went clean after half an hour through with the game in the balance at 0-0. Instead of shooting, Soldado attempted a weak pass to Nacer Chadli which was easily gathered by goalkeeper Norberto Neto and prompted Gary Lineker to tweet: ‘Not sure I've ever seen a player as bereft of confidence as Soldado. Poor b****r!’ Roberto Soldado (centre) passed up the chance to shoot with the goal at his mercy against Fiorentina . Soldado's pass into Chadli was poor and Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto pounced upon the ball . Soldado reacts to the missed chance for Tottenham, on a night where his team went out of Europe . Gary Lineker, a former Tottenham player, took to Twitter to give his views about Soldado's miss . Twenty-four goal striker Kane did not make it off the bench until the 63rd-minute, when Tottenham were already trailing to Mario Gomez’s opener. But Pochettino was adamant he had no reservations about his big call to rest the 21-year-old ahead of Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Chelsea. He said: ‘We analyse always and try to pick the best team for every game. I repeat – I think we played very well. We created chances and needed luck to score. ‘There is no regret about that (decision to not start with Kane). It is my job, it is my decision. Sometimes you need luck and we did not score and so they go to the next round.’ Referring to the £27m Spaniard’s miss, Pochettino added: ‘I think we are disappointed, the player too. This is normal. Harry Kane (left) came off the bench and scored for Tottenham but the goal was disallowed for offside . Kane started on the sidelines, as Mauricio Pochettino kept an eye on the League Cup final . Mauricio Pochettino defended Soldado after the game but said both he and the player were 'disappointed' ‘This was the first final for us. All the players are disappointed. Now we need to look forward because Sunday we have another game.’ Pochettino also defended his decision to make seven changes to the side that drew with West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. He said: ‘Fiorentina made nine changes we made seven changes. It is not about selection it is about performance and we played very well. ‘I think in the first half we played very well and deserved more. We had chances. You need some luck to score if you are to win the games. Second half we made some mistakes and took some risks. We did not score and they did.’ Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella said: ‘I think there is great satisfaction, a reward for the work put in during the last weeks. We are going through to the last 16 and considering we are going through against one of the richest ranked teams, that says a lot.’","Roberto Soldado missed a great chance as Tottenham lost to Fiorentina .

"Memories: Yvette Fielding says Harry Styles propositioned her with a string of 'disgusting texts' Women old enough to be his mother have a certain appeal for Harry Styles. And it seems that even in his school days, the young popstar-to-be was making an impression as a Romeo. Yvette Fielding, the former Blue Peter host, has told how Harry, a childhood friend of her son’s, propositioned her with a string of ‘disgusting’ text messages at 16. The 44-year-old TV presenter also . claimed Styles, 19, had broken her son’s heart by abandoning their . friendship when he found fame with One Direction on The X Factor. Miss . Fielding said she and her husband had taken Harry and his mother Anne . Cox out to dinner at a Chinese restaurant when the cheeky teenager began . sending her messages from across the table. ‘The last time I saw him we went for a Chinese – his mum and her partner, Robin, plus me and my husband, Karl. 'Harry was sending me disgusting texts from across the table. I can’t even repeat the words, they were so rude!’ She refused to reveal what the messages said, but told Woman magazine: ‘He’s a Romeo, he’s very romantic. 'When there’s a love interest, Harry will go all out to get the girl. He’s totally obsessed. I think that’s what Simon Cowell saw in him, the cheeky chappie charm.’ Miss Fielding became the youngest . presenter in Blue Peter’s history when she landed the job in June 1987, . three months before her 19th birthday. She . hosted the show for five years until 1992. She has since gone on to . present programmes investigating the paranormal on Living TV and ITV2. She met Harry when he was 11 and living with his mother in their hometown of Holmes Chapel in Cheshire. He became best friends with her son William, starting a band together called White Eskimo. Harry Styles (left) was friends with Yvette Fielding's son; the presenter pictured in her Blue Peter days (right) ‘The first time I met Harry, he did a sweeping bow and got down on his knees on the road,’ she said. ‘I thought, “what a joker, we’ll get on well”. When he came for tea, he loved pizza and chips and always put on these stupid voices. ‘He called me his second mum and he and Will lived in each other’s pockets, dressing and talking the same. In the car I’d put Elvis or Little Richard on and we’d sing along. ‘Harry confessed that he wanted to be a singer, but thought he couldn’t make it. I told him to follow his dream.’ After finishing as runners up on ITV’s The X Factor in 2010, One Direction became a global success, with Styles said to have earned an estimated £20million in less than three years. He has dated presenter Caroline Flack, 14 years his senior, and 32-year-old radio DJ Lucy Horobin. Miss Fielding said Harry’s newfound wealth must have had an effect on the entire family. Read the full story in Woman magazine, out now . ‘Anne’s life has changed dramatically, it’s like she’s won the lottery.’ she said. ‘One minute she was worrying about a kitchen extension, the next minute her son bought her a gated mansion. The kind that only footballers can afford!' But their sons’ friendship which lasted from the ages of 11 and 17 was also altered by Harry’s fame. ‘Will texted Harry to see if he was coming home,’ Miss Fielding recalled. ‘They’d arrange to meet up but then Harry never showed. There were tears from Will and he said, “I’ve lost my brother, it’s like he’s dead”. ‘William kept trying and was devastated, but had to learn to let go, because Harry was just gone. Harry broke Will’s heart. ‘But I’m gobsmacked at how understanding Will’s been. A lot of lads would be bitter but he just says, “I hope somebody is looking out for Harry,” and I think that’s the mark of a true friend. I’ve helped Will through the whole thing with lots of hugs.’ Last night a spokesman for Styles denied he had ever sent the text messages. He said: ‘Harry has never sent any rude or inappropriate texts to Yvette Fielding.’","Yvette Fielding claims Styles broke her son's heart after he became famous .

"The accusation has come after the alleged Jimmy Savile sex-abuse scandal . A British TV celebrity has been accused of sexually abusing a woman. An alleged victim has come forward after the ITV . documentary that claimed Jimmy Savile molested underage girls to tell producers that she was abused by a . well-known media figure when she was a child. The new allegations concern a TV personality who is still alive, but he has not been named. The woman made the new claims first to the makers of the 'Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile' documentary, who have advised her to contact the police. A member of the ITV production team claimed: 'We have had a name given to us which is so far not in the public domain. 'It relates to a celebrity, a media . personality, who is alive. We are urging everyone who contacts us to go . straight to the police.' When ITV were asked for a comment today about the latest allegation, spokesman Tom Hodson said: 'I will look into this.' The latest claims come after the slew of accusations against Savile, who died aged 84 in October last year. The former Top of the Pops star is alleged to have molested underage girls and assaulted sick children in their hospital beds. New claims allege that Savile groped children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, Leeds General Infirmary and at Broadmoor. A former Broadmoor patient Alison Pink, claimed Savile groped her while she watched TV. A former nurse at the Leeds hospital where Savile worked as a porter, said he molested a brain-damaged hospital patient. Jimmy Savile is accused of preying on patients at Stoke Mandeville hospital which he raised money for . Regular: Jimmy Savile pictured at Stoke Mandeville hospital, Buckinghamshire, in 2003 . June Thornton said she was recovering from an operation at Leeds General Infirmary when she saw Savile abuse the young girl. 'She had brain damage, and Jimmy Savile came in and kissed her,' she said. 'He started kissing her neck, running his hands up and down her arms, and then started to molest her. 'Because I was laid flat on my back, there was nothing I could do.' Leeds General Infirmary said it had received two complaints after the allegations against Savile became public almost two weeks ago. Nurses at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire are understood to have dreaded Savile’s visits because of his behaviour, and would tell children to stay in bed and pretend to be asleep when he arrived. Stoke Mandeville – a spinal injuries specialist centre in aid of  which Savile frequently ran marathons – insisted it had ‘no record’ of complaints about him.

"A player with Serbian top flight club Novi Pazar was threatened by the team's own supporters at gunpoint after missing a penalty, the world players' union FIFPro said on Thursday. Describing the incident as 'a new low in Serbian professional football', FIFPro said that Novi Pazar's Zarko Udovicic sent his penalty over the crossbar in the 85th minute of last Saturday's game against FK Rad. Two days later, several hooligans burst into the dressing-room at the club's training ground, drew a gun and held it in Udovicic's face, FIFPro said. The player has since left the club. Zarko Udovicic has left Serbian club Novi Pazar after  fans threatened him with a gun for missing a penalty . Mirko Poledica, president of the Serbian professional footballers' association Nezavisnost, said neither the Serbian Football Association nor the league had taken any action. 'Must we wait until some hooligan actually kills one of our players', he said. 'What worries me is that there is no reaction from the football association. They remain quiet. 'They must do something to guarantee the safety of the players. But they don't. Next time a player could be murdered. 'The only positive thing from this situation, is that our Deputy Prime Minister (Rasim Ljajic) has spoken out and acknowledged the serious problems we are facing. Udovicic had missed a penalty for Novi Pazar against FK Rad two days before the incident . 'In Serbia, no fan has ever been prosecuted or convicted after violent behaviour against a football player. That's why players are afraid. 'Each day they hope that there will be nobody knocking on their door to beat them up, that there will be no person setting their car on fire, or that there will be no hooligan putting a gun to their head.' FIFPro said: 'Like every professional workman, each professional footballer is entitled to a safe working environment. It is up to the football and national authorities to provide such safe environment.'

"The gambling aspect of Tim Sherwood’s management style has been a major contributing factor to Harry Kane’s ridiculous rise to prominence, and the striker knows it. Kane is set to start for Tottenham against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley on Sunday, but knows his career might have gone down a much different path. That’s down to Sherwood, who the 21-year-old says changed his prospects. Kane wants other players to be given similar opportunities and believes there is a lack of faith in prospects. Harry Kane knows he is indebted to Tim Sherwood for his fast rise at Tottenham Hotspur . Kane scored twice against Chelsea when Spurs beat them 5-3 back in January at White Hart Lane . Sherwood took a leap of faith with Kane, who he had managed in the development squad . Kane was talking to the weekly Sport magazine . The pair had previously worked together before the now Aston Villa boss was handed the first-term reins last season. And, even though Kane had impressed in fits and starts, he hadn’t looked like breaking through permanently. Now, with 24 goals in 37 games this season, Roy Hodgson is certain to call the youngster up to his England squad next month. ‘Tim Sherwood first of all played me [regularly] in the Premier League,’ Kane told Sport magazine. ‘I knew Tim from the development squad, and we had a great relationship. ‘He threw me in when maybe other managers wouldn’t have. Maybe that’s what a few more young strikers coming through need.’ Kane’s rise to prominence has been swift, the plaudits plentiful; some have characterised the front man as a hybrid of Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham. ‘I can see a bit of both in me, which isn’t bad, to be honest,' Kane added. ‘To be compared to someone like Alan Shearer is very special. He’s the all-time Premier League top goalscorer. If I score anywhere near as many as he did, it wouldn’t be a bad career. ‘I feel sometimes I play in both of those roles for Spurs, and I see little bits that they had in my game. Shearer was a great finisher, and I like to think I’m a good finisher. ‘Sheringham brought others into play, so you can definitely say I have some similar attributes. Hopefully I can do well and continue to score goals, and one day people will say that this player is like Harry Kane.’ Kane has scored 24 goals in just 34 appearances for Spurs under Mauricio Pochettino this season . Kane was in the stands to see Tottenham beat Chelsea in the 2008 Capital One Cup final . It matters little to Kane who he resembles on Sunday, so long as it is he who sinks Chelsea. This was the Spurs fan who stood in the stands in 2008 to watch his team beat the Blues and who is now living out his childhood dreams. ‘I was there watching Spurs beat Chelsea on the big stage, and winning trophies,’ Kane said. ‘It was something I grew up dreaming of doing, and now I have the opportunity. ‘To win a trophy for a club like Spurs would be something very special, but we want to try and get into the Champions League too, so we’re focused on doing the best we can in every competition.’ You can read the full interview online here or in print from Friday.","Tottenham play Chelsea in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday .

"Emmanuel Adebayor was drinking from a coconut and Harry Kane was shuffling on the bench. It’s hard to imagine either of them making the kind of mess of the game-changing chance that came Roberto Soldado’s way during the first half. He went through on goal at 0-0 and was caught between thoughts of passing to Nacer Chadli or shooting. In that moment, he forgot his prime function in this team and also forgot how to pass. Such is the lot of a striker without great confidence; such is the frustration for a manager – you make a choice and be damned. Roberto Soldado reacts after missing a golden chance to open the scoring for Tottenham . Soldado showed his fragile confidence by playing a soft pass to Nacer Chadli instead of shooting . Spaniard watches as his tame pass fails to reach Chadli during the Europa League last 32 decider . Soldado knows immediately that he made the wrong decision with the goal at his mercy . Mauricio Pochettino knew people would be wondering about the shooting star on his bench. He also knew that if Kane, fresh and ready, turns up and grinds Chelsea into the Wembley dirt on Sunday then all will be forgotten. Indeed, he would be the ‘genius’ who figured it all out. Pochettino knows better than anyone that such rash judgements have always run always through football. Win and you’re smart; lose and you’re stupid. Win on Sunday and you picked the right team on Thursday, regardless of how you did in Florence. He summed it all up rather neatly on Wednesday afternoon when he was asked to explain the dilemmas of selecting a side to play a hard game in Europe four days before a potentially season-defining cup final. ‘If you make the rotation and on Sunday you win, you are a genius. Sunday you may rest some players and play others and win the final – genius. If you lose in Italy and the final, you are a bad manager and coach. ‘I’m the same coach but when you take a decision sometimes you are right or wrong, but this is football. We take a decision to try to win tomorrow and play better than Fiorentina. After we analyse again and try to put the best team out for the final on Sunday.’ Mauricio Pochettino knows that he will be judged on results during this crucial three day period . Tottenham's leading scorer Harry Kane started on the bench with the Capital One Cup final on Sunday . Emmanuel Adebayor didn't travel to Florence, but posted a picture of him drinking from a coconut at home . It is a black and white view, except here he found a shade of grey. It remains to be seen what kind of a beating he will take. This was neither an excessively strong side nor one you would say was a cop out to rest players for the weekend. Kane was the notable omission and you could also make reasonable predictions that Ryan Mason, Danny Rose and Kyle Walker will start at Wembley. They were all on the bench in Florence, with as many of seven of the starters good bets to line up from the beginning against Chelsea. So the numbers were good. But there is no escaping that the club’s most incisive player was on the bench for a game against a team unbeaten in 10. More to the point, Tottenham needed to score to simply stay alive, the consequence of the away goal they conceded at White Hart Lane last week. Pochettino will point to the subtleties of a decision few can fully understand. They alone will know how tired Kane is after leading this team in his breakthrough season. Kane was eventually introduced but his second half strike was ruled out for offside . The Spurs academy graduate has gone from reserve striker to the club's most valuable player this season . The inquest begins between Tottenham players as their European dream fades away . Football is full of players pushed too hard too soon. And in a team that has played 43 games this season – more than any other Barclays Premier League side – fatigue needs to be managed carefully. But there have been no indications that Kane, in particular, is carrying injuries or struggling with his workload. The only indications are that he is a player who scores goals when they are needed. They were needed on Thursday night as a chance went begging in a competition that rewards its winner with Champions League football. Of course it is the kind of short-term thinking that Pochettino dislikes. If he scores on Sunday, no doubt all will be forgiven.

"British forces successfully dropped a second batch of aid to thousands of trapped refugees in northern Iraq last night – 24 hours after being forced to abandon an attempt because there were too many people crowding on the ground. The RAF was able to deliver ‘essential supplies’ over Mount Sinjar to assist the Yazidis, who have fled rampaging ISIS forces sweeping through the north of the country. On Sunday night, RAF forces aborted an attempt to deliver aid to the location in northern Iraq at the last minute. It meant that Britain had managed just one successful aid drop took before last night. Scroll down for video . An RAF servicemen on last night's crucial aid drop. The MoD has dispatched Tornado fighter jets to the region for better surveillance of the situation on the ground in northern Iraq . An RAF Hercules delivered emergency aid to people in Northern Iraq last night, 24 hours after a previous attempt had to be abandoned . Downing Street has also confirmed that the RAF will send ‘a small number’ of Tornado jets to the region so they can be used to improve the UK’s surveillance capability in the region to help the humanitarian effort. The UK will also look at how it can play a role in getting equipment to Kurdish forces as they are better able to counter the Islamic State (IS), formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis), Number 10 added. President Barack Obama said the US had ‘stepped up’ its support to Iraqi and Kurdish forces engaged in the fight on the ground and was continuing with its daily humanitarian efforts. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who chaired a meeting of the Government’s emergency Cobra committee to discuss the crisis yesterday, said the situation was ‘challenging’ and warned of a ‘potential humanitarian disaster on a huge scale’. The Department for International Development said the UK’s second aid drop included 3,180 reusable water purification containers filled with 15,900 litres of clean water and 816 solar lamps that can also be used to charge mobile phones. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘The humanitarian situation in Iraq area is deeply worrying. ‘Isis terrorists continue to contest towns and villages south of Erbil and in the Sinjar area and the Yazidi community face appalling conditions, cut off on Mount Sinjar. ‘UK aid is already helping the people who desperately need it. Last night the RAF successfully made a second drop of essential supplies, including 3,180 reusable containers filled with clean water.’ An attempt to drop water and safety equipment had to be abandoned on Sunday night because there were too many refugees in the drop zone . Last night's drop is the second round of aid to thousands of people trapped on a mountain as they flee advancing militants in Iraq . The government said the UK’s second aid drop included 3,180 reusable water purification containers filled with 15,900 litres of clean water and 816 solar lamps . British voters narrowly support taking part in air strikes against Islamic State fighters sweeping through northern Iraq slaughtering non-Muslims. The Government has refused to rule out joining a US military assault to protect civilians fleeing the jihadists - but has insisted its focus is on getting aid to refugees. But a YouGov poll for the Sun has revealed support for UK troops to bomb the fanatics. The revelation comes as the RAF geared up to send Tornado jets into Iraq – but only to monitor the humanitarian situation on the ground. Some 37 per cent of Britons approve of the RAF taking part in air strikes – while 36 per cent disapprove and the remaining 27 per cent saying they don’t know. Last August 50 per cent of the country was opposed to missile strikes on Syria – with just 25 per cent in support. One of Britain’s most senior generals accused the ‘commitment-phobic’ Government of being ‘terrified’ of intervening in the Iraq crisis before next year’s general election. General Sir Richard Shirreff told the Times: ‘The longer we sit on our hands and prevaricate, the more dangerous the situation is going to become’. But speaking after the Cobra committee meeting yesterday, Mr Hammond rejected calls for Parliament to be recalled to discuss the crisis and said there were no plans for British military involvement. ‘We don’t envisage a combat role at the present time,’ he said. David Cameron, who is on holiday in Portugal, has been urged to call MPs back from their summer break to discuss the crisis and he has also faced pressure - including from former head of the Army Lord Dannatt - to consider a military intervention. Downing Street said the Prime Minister was ‘very much engaged’ with the situation despite being abroad and a recall of Parliament was ‘not on the cards’. But the Prime Minister is facing increasing pressure to join US military action against ISIS forces. Tory MP Mark Pritchard said it was time for the UK to take direct military action - through air strikes and drone attacks but not ground forces - and predicted a recalled Commons would vote in favour of the escalation. 'The international community can pour as much aid into the region as its likes,' he wrote for the PoliticsHome website. 'But unless Islamic State fighters are killed and removed from the battlefield, they will go on killing and committing further atrocities. 'The UK must not walk by on the other side and that is why overnight news that RAF Tornadoes are once again going to fly in Iraqi airspace is welcome. 'However, this intervention needs to be in an unequivocal combat role, not just in an intelligence, surveillance and targeting role.' Inaction at this stage would be 'a greater risk than positive action', he suggested. Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Islamic State in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border, on the outskirts of Sinjar mountain, near the Syrian border town of Elierbeh yesterday .

He urged the Government to support any effort to secure a United Nations Security Council resolution in support of military action. A proposed French resolution was too weak and 'in danger of being just another UN platitude whilst toddlers choke on their own blood', he said. Mr Pritchard said the different circumstances suggested there would be no repeat of MPs' refusal last year to endorse military intervention in Syria. 'I suspect this time Parliament would vote for decisive, precision, and targeted military action in Iraq, with clearly defined rules of engagement.' Mr Hammond will chair a further Cobra meeting this afternoon, Downing Street said.","British forces delivered 'essential supplies' over Mount Sinjar last night .

"The Russian oligarch who was ordered by a Swiss court this week to pay his ex-wife a $4.8billoin divorce settlement, passed up a much sweeter $1billion deal last year. 'Fertilizer king' Dmitry Rybolovlev had been married to wife Elena Rybolovleva for 24 years when the two started divorce proceedings in 2008. Last year, Elena decided to end the drawn-out battle with Rybolovlev, who is worth an estimated $8.8billion, for a tidy $1billion. Quadrupled: Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev (left) was ordered this month to pay his ex-wife Elena Rybolovlev (right) $4.8million in a divorce settlement. It was revealed however, that he turned down a much-less $1billion deal last year when he refused to pay the sum . But according to Elena's lawyers, her husband refused to make the payment. In a letter dated May 21, 2013, a lawyer for one of his trusts wrote: 'I am afraid my clients have decided against exercising their powers to distribute' the cash. Rybolovlev said it was out of his control, but Elena's lawyer David Newman told the New York Daily News that not true since 'he controls the trust'. A spokesman for Rybolovlev said it was his wife that ended the deal. A lawyer for one of Rybolovlev's trusts wrote his wife last year saying the trust had decided not to pay the divorce settlement and Rybolovlev said it was out of his control. Pictured above at a AS Monaco game with a woman who is not his wife on May 17, 2013 . Despite winning half of her husband's fortune this week, Elena is still going after some of her husbands properties which she calls hidden assets - including a $88million New York apartment on Central Park West. His lawyers say the properties aren't his and that the latest divorce settlement prevents her from going after said properties anyway. 'There's absolutely, positively nothing in the Geneva order that can be used to take the US properties out of play.' Newman  said . Rybolovlev plans to appeal the ruling, and his lawyer Tetiana Bersheda says the battle could take 'at least ten more years'. The Rybolovlev's split has been described as 'the most expensive divorce in history' by another of Ms Rybolovleva's lawyers Marc Bonnant. Dmitry Rybolovlev owns Maison de l'Amitie, a 54,000 sq ft French Regency-style house, sitting on more than seven manicured acres of prime waterfront on the barrier island of Palm Beach, Florida . Dmitry Rybolovlev purchased Donald Trump's Maison de l'Amitie in Palm Beach, Florida, for $100million . Elena Rybolovleva alleged that her husband purchased this three bedroom plantation style property in Kauai in Hawaii from Will Smith for $20 million . Dmitry Rybolovlev bought the Greek island of Skorpios from the Onassis dynasty last year for a reported £100 million, again for his daughter, a socialite show jumper . The . settlement is far higher than the £1.5 billion paid by art heir Alec . Wildenstein to his ex wife, Jocelyne, which until now had been the . largest confirmed public divorce settlement in the world. Rupert . Murdoch, the media mogul, was told to give his former wife, Anna, . £1billion in 1999. He went on to marry his third wife Wendi Deng, from . whom he is now divorced. Ms . Rybolovleva won custody of the couple's 13-year-old daughter Anna, . along with Mr Rybolovlev's half of their former home in Cologny, an . up-market neighbourhood of Geneva. In 2012, . Mrs Rybolovleva claimed a £50 million plus ownership of the New York . penthouse which her ex-husband had bought for Anna. The . purchase of the penthouse from the former head of the Citigroup bank, Sandford . I.Weill and his wife Joan, was at the time the most expensive home ever bought in New York City.

A second occasion: Rybolovlev is pictured with an unidentified woman, who is believed to be the same companion as from the football match, at an event in Monte Carlo on May 17 . In . court papers filed in Manhattan, Ms Rybolovleva had said Mr Rybolovlev . had been using marital property to buy a multitude of other assets . through a variety of trusts and limited liability companies, hoping to . put those assets beyond her reach. Mrs Rybolovleva said these assets . include his majority ownership of French soccer club AS Monaco, a $295 . million stake in the Bank of Cyprus, and a $95million Palm Beach, Florida, home purchased from another tycoon, Donald Trump. Mr . Rybolovlev is one of the small group of Russians who became fabulously . wealthy during the post-Soviet privatization of the economy and became . known as oligarchs. He is the former owner of fertilizer business . Uralkali. Mr Rybolovlev also owns a £12million Hawaii mansion he bought from the Hollywood star, Will Smith, and La Belle Epoque penthouse in Monaco, where he lives, for which he paid £178 million. He bought the Greek island of Skorpios from the Onassis dynasty last year for a reported £100 million, again for his daughter, a socialite show jumper. Beautiful: Dmitri Rybolovlev purchased a $88 million apartment on Central Park West for his daughter Ekaterina Rybolovleva - for her studies while at college in New York . Luxury: The 6,744 sq ft apartment boasts 10 rooms, a wrap-around terrace, library and seven walk-in closets . The island . was made famous as the location of Aristotle Onassis's wedding to the . former US First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, in 1968. Mr Rybolovlev's wealth came from the sale of his stake in Uralkali, a Russian fertiliser business, for $6.5billion in 2010. He went on to buy AS Monaco in December 2011, attempting to make the club as successful as Qatari-owned Paris Saint Germain. Mr . Rybolovlev, who lives in Monaco, also has an estate in the southern . French resort of Saint Tropez and his assets include an art collection . with paintings by Picasso, Van Gogh, Gauguin and Monet. Since splitting from her husband, Mrs Rybolovleva has been followed almost round the clock by private detectives. In February, she was questioned by police in Cyprus on suspicion of stealing a diamond ring reportedly worth £15 million, borrowed from her daughter but not returned, and which belonged to a trust. She was released without charge. The Russian oligarch has a majority ownership in AS Monaco, whose stadium is pictured. It plays in the French league but is actually based in the Principality of Monaco, close to two of its marinas. Mr Rybolovlev met his wife more than 30 years ago when they were students in the Ural mountains. She was by Mr Rybolovlev's side as he rose from a doctor-turned-entrepreneur into a stockbroker and banker, before becoming chairman and majority shareholder of Uralkali. They stayed together during his 11 months in jail - when he was accused of murdering a competitor before the charges were dropped - and when threats on his life led him to wear a bullet-proof vest and move his family to Switzerland. He was said to be stunned when he found out about the divorce petition on New Year's Eve 2008 from his bankers, after his accounts were frozen. In that petition, the then Mrs Rybolovleva said she could no longer take his infidelities, describing parties on yachts where, she said, he had shared some 'young conquests with his friends, and other oligarchs'. The sumptuous Monaco penthouse where Russian oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev lives was once the scene of an arson attack that killed a previous billionaire owner. The 17,500 sq ft flat La Belle Epoque, which was bought by Mr Rybolovlev for £178million, is not only the largest in Monaco, but also offers stunning views over the Mediterranean. It was previously owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum of the Dubai Royal Family who paid some £200million in 2010, then believed to be the most expensive residential property sale ever. The beneficiaries of that transaction were British property developers Nick and Christian Candy, who are thought to have made a profit somewhere in the region of £155million. That was in despite of its macabre history. For the brothers had bought the property in 2006 from the widow of billionaire Lebanese banker Edmond Safra, who was killed inside the flat in an arson attack. Mr Safra, 67, was found dead alongside his nurse in a locked security room after a fire was started by his servant, a former Green Beret special forces soldier who was jailed for 10 years. The servant claimed he started the blaze so he could then save Mr Safra and gain the plaudits. The Candy brothers reportedly paid £10-£15million for the penthouse in 2006 then spent around £30million on an 18-month renovation in their signature Candy & Candy style. According to The Pinnacle List: 'The pioneering confidence and desire to push existing boundaries of décor allowed Candy & Candy to set a new bespoke luxury design standard in elite residential interiors, making the La Belle Epoque Penthouse a kind of modern equivalent of a historical palace fitting a Medici or a Versailles.' But it is not without its modern touches. Each suite in the two-floor flat is believed to come with its own cinema with screens that emerge from the walls, a kitchen and two bathrooms. The property also has its own spa, library and a leisure room with billiard tables and arcade games.","Dmitry Rybolovlev was ordered to pay record amount to Elena Rybolovleva .

"A woman has claimed she may have become pregnant by DJ John Peel during a three-month affair when she was a 15-year-old schoolgirl. The BBC star presenter met Jane Nevin backstage at a Black Sabbath concert in the summer of 1969. Mrs Nevin says she was ‘in awe’ of the Radio 1 DJ, then 30, and that they would go to his London BBC studio or backstage at concerts to make love. Younger days: Jane Nevin (aged 17) says she was 'in awe' of Radio 1 DJ John Peel, then 30, and that they would go to his London BBC studio or backstage at concerts to make love . Peel had unprotected sex with the teenager shortly after boasting on-air that he had been suffering from a venereal disease. They split up when her mother found out about the relationship. But she discovered she was pregnant shortly after, aged 16, and had a ‘traumatic’ abortion at a clinic in Ealing. ‘I was devastated when I found out I was pregnant,’ she said. ‘I didn’t even think about telling John. I just wanted it to be over.’ When Mrs Nevin wrote to Peel out of the blue 30 years later mentioning their ‘brief affair’, he replied expressing his relief that she was not writing to confess she had his secret child. On a postcard sealed in an envelope, Peel, who died in 2004, wrote: ‘Well, you’ve scared the daylights out of me. For years I’ve been expecting a letter starting, “In the 70s we had a brief affair – and your now son/daughter, aged 27, wants to meet you”.’ Mrs Nevin, 59, who lives in Capel, Surrey, decided to break her silence after allegations emerged that fellow BBC DJs abused dozens of teenage girls during this period. The latest revelation will raise questions over the conduct of other celebrities within the corporation during the 1960s and 1970s. She said: ‘He [Peel] must have known I was still at school. But he didn’t ask and I didn’t tell him. ‘At the time I was just so happy to be on his arm. I was young and he was famous. All I cared about was that I could make all my school friends jealous. ‘I was insecure and impressionable. I suppose I used him for his fame and he used me for sex.’ Named after him: The BBC may reconsider renaming a wing at the London headquarters after John Peel following claims of an affair . It echoes Peel’s own admission that he received sexual favours from young fans, once quipping: ‘Well, of course, I didn’t ask for ID.’ The DJ ran a Schoolgirl Of The Year competition on his long-running late-night Radio 1 Show and once complained that American virgins ‘would do anything but s*** you’. Mrs Nevin met Peel when she was invited backstage at a Black Sabbath concert in central London. She was hoping to meet the band, including Ozzy Osbourne, but instead caught the eye of Peel. She said: ‘He came over and started talking to me. I was totally in awe of John. I adored his long hair and beard and he talked so intensely about music. ‘After that night, we would meet up about once a week. If we had sex, we never went to his place. ‘It would always be in his studio or backstage at the Roundhouse in Camden. ‘I loved the status of knocking around with him. He would invite me to gigs and I would follow him around like a lapdog. I don’t know if sex was expected but I went along with it willingly. Looking back, it was terribly wrong and I was perhaps manipulated. But it was a different era.’ She admits it was a difficult period in her life. ‘I was badly bullied at school for being posh. I went to private school in South London until I was 11, but when my father died, my mother couldn’t afford to keep me there so I went to the local comprehensive in Wandsworth. ‘I did horse riding and dance classes at Italia Conti. I didn’t fit in. As a result, I was desperate to be loved.’ At the time, Peel was separated from Shirley Anne Milburn, a fan he had married in 1965 in America when she was only 15. He later claimed she had lied about her age. When Mrs Nevin’s mother, an antiques restorer, found out her daughter was dating the DJ, she was horrified. 'I was totally in awe of John. I adored his long hair and beard and he talked so intensely about music. After that night, we would meet up about once a week. If we had sex, we never went to his place' Jane Nevin . ‘One night he called the house and my mother gave him hell,’ said Mrs Nevin. ‘She knew he had spoken about having VD because it had been in the papers. That put an end to us seeing each other.’ Later, a test confirmed she was pregnant. ‘My mother was very upset. She was worried I had ruined my life. My auntie had to lend her the money and I went to a clinic in Ealing. It was probably the worst day of my life.’ Mrs Nevin went on to become a bunny girl croupier at the Playboy club in Park Lane in the 1970s. She later ran a pub with her husband, from whom she is separated, and had a son, now 24. Peel divorced his teenage Texan bride Shirley in 1973 and married Sheila Gilhooly a year later. They had four children and lived in Great Finborough, Suffolk. It was from this address that he wrote the letter to Mrs Nevin in the late 1990s, after she asked him to appear at the opening of her new bar in Surrey. He rebuffed her invite, ending the postcard: ‘I live near Ipswich so Croydon is pretty inaccessible. I’ll wait to hear from you again, John.’ Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘We are asking that any criminal allegations should be passed either to the BBC investigations unit or directly to the police.’ An insider added: ‘This is another terrible allegation and hopefully she will take this to the police so they can investigate.’","Jane Nevin met legendary DJ backstage at a Black Sabbath concert in 1969 .

"The headmaster of a £28,000-a-year public school has resigned after beginning a relationship with the deputy head's wife, it was reported today. Mark Eagers, 55, is said to have left his post at Box Hill School near Dorking, Surrey, when his relationship with Corydon Lowde's wife, Dinah, 43, was revealed. Mr Lowde, 43, is now acting headmaster at the co-ed boarding school in the village of Mickleham, where his wife worked as a library assistant and Mr Eagers' wife, Jane, teaches business studies. Mark Eagers, 55, reportedly resigned as head of Box Hill School after starting relationship with Dinah Lowde, 43 . Box Hill School is a day and boarding school for girls and boys and fees go up to £28,000 a year for boarders . Parents say he stands at the school gates to welcome day pupils each morning and is working hard to ensure school life continues as normal. Mr Eagers, a father of three who became head of Box Hill in 2003, now lists himself as 'former head of Box Hill School' on his LinkedIn profile, which shows he left the job in December. Parents say Mrs Lowde, who has two children aged 18 and 15 with her husband, has been staying with Mr Eagers in his house yards from both the Lowde family home and the school. Parents at the school are concerned the scandal will affect the reputation of the school.  One told The Sun: 'It is incredibly messy.  All four parties involved worked at the school. 'Dinah sometimes stays at Mark's, which is just metres from both her marital home and the school. 'Mr Lowde has been making a point of standing at the entrance to the school as parents drop their kids off in the morning, as if to say ""I'm OK, I'm in charge.""' This morning a member of staff at the school, which has around 400 pupils aged 11-18, said the bursar, John Pratten, was preparing a statement. Deputy head Corydon Lowde, 43, is now acting head at Box Hill School, where Jane Eagers teaches business . Mr Eagers, who lists 'family' as his top interest on his LinkedIn profile, has sons aged 23 and 20, and a 16-year-old daughter with his wife of 25 years. He studied History at Cambridge University before doing an MA in Education at Bath University, and then worked at private Wycliffe College in Bristol teaching politics and history before spending a decade as head of history at the United World College of South East Asia in Singapore. Mr Eagers was deputy head at Ardingly College in Sussex for four years before taking the top job at Box Hill, where he was a popular and dynamic head. 'Mr Lowde has been making a point of standing at the entrance to the school as parents drop their kids off in the morning, as if to say ""I'm OK, I'm in charge.""' parent of Box Hill School pupil . Mr Lowde studied at both Bath and Exeter universities before spending two and a half years as deputy headmaster of the British School of Boston in America. Today he refused to comment as he left his white stone cottage opposite the school sheltered by a Union Jack umbrella, saying: 'I'm sorry, I'm heading in for a meeting now. 'I have no comment to make at this stage.' He joined Box Hill three years ago, moving his family into the four-bedroom house nearby, which is now said to be on the market. Last September a former history teacher at Box Hill was jailed after admitting a series of sex assaults on a young girl a decade before. Lesley Powell, 57, was jailed for four-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to committing 10 sex offences on a girl who was younger than 13 when the abuse began.

"The teacher who was sent to prison after he eloped to France with his teenage pupil has written a letter from his jail saying he will not leave her and that being without her is 'torture'. Jeremy Forrest, 31, sent the seven-page missive to a newspaper saying that him being banned from contact with the 16-year-old, whom he describes as 'remarkable', is a breach on his human rights. Details of his emotional letter came as it was reported that the girl had written to the maths teacher in prison to say she wants them to be reunited on his release. The 16-year-old is said to have sent Jeremy Forrest ‘warm, caring and supportive’ letters making it clear she wants to restart their relationship when he has served his five-and-a-half-year sentence for abducting her. Jeremy Forrest, pictured as he eloped with the teenage girl, says she is 'the most remarkable person I've ever met' Forrest's handwritten letter was sent to the Daily Express, and is the first time he has made contact with anyone outside his family since he was jailed. It says: 'The reason why contact is so vital to us is because of the support and stability our relationship gives our lives. 'She is the most remarkable person I have ever met and the strength she continues to show is nothing short of amazing. 'I will not abandon her.' Forrest says in the letter that he only agreed to face sex charges on condition that he would be allowed to write to and receive letters from the girl. But the maths teacher, whose wife left him after his betrayal, says he was not allowed to read the letters from her, and has been transferred to tough Dartmoor Prison after making a complaint, it  was reported. The girl’s desire for a reunion would be a change of heart – four months ago it emerged she had found a boyfriend her own age and was said to have ‘moved on’. The girl, who triggered an international hunt when she fled to France with Forrest aged 15 and tried to start a new life with him, is said to have written three ‘love notes’ to him. ‘They are about wanting to be with him,’ a source told The Sun. ‘They are warm messages to him. They’re not dumping letters. She wants to continue a relationship with him.’ Forrest has written to a newspaper vowing never to abandon the teenager he eloped to France with . The paper said Forrest had called for an investigation into whether bosses at Ashfield prison near Bristol had broken rules by refusing to let him read them. He is said to have demanded to know if officials had carried out the risk assessment that is required before prisoners are banned from having contact with their victim. After the row, he was told last month that he would be transferred to the forbidding environment of Dartmoor Prison, it was reported. ‘Jeremy just wants to be in contact with her again – he still cares for her,’ the source told the paper. ‘Jeremy’s family believe he has been moved because he demanded to see personal details held on him, which he thinks will show if the assessment happened.’ They are said to fear that his relocation, more than 200 miles from the girl and his own family, will hamper his rehabilitation, including ending his efforts to retrain as a chef because Dartmoor does not have the facilities. Forrest, who taught at Bishop Bell School in East Sussex, first kissed the girl when she was 14. The pair had sex after she turned 15. When police were alerted they fled to France by ferry, travelling under false names. He was spotted and arrested eight days later. Last June at Lewes Crown Court he was convicted of sex offences and abduction, and jailed. Afterwards the girl said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he’s out, we can marry and have children.’ But social workers have banned her from having contact with him until she turns 18. The Prison Service said it did not comment on individual inmates.

"Despite receiving several luxury cars and a $1.2million dollar home from Donald Sterling, V. Stiviano says their relationship was merely platonic. In an interview on Wednesday with Dr Phil, Stiviano, 31, maintains that she never had sexual relations 'whatsoever' with the racist 80-year-old Clippers owner. Stiviano also speaks about her work with Sterling, why she taped their private conversations and the real reason behind her now-signature visor. Scroll down for video . Purely platonic: V. Stiviano says she never had sex with Donald Sterling in a new interview with Dr Phil . Candid: In the interview which aired Wednesday, Stiviano also talked about the nature of her work with Sterling, why she recorded their private conversations and the real reason behind wearing her visor . Sterling has always contented that his relationship with Stiviano was sexual, and stated in a phone conversation with a friend that the relationship started two months after they met when she showed up at his office asking for a job. Sterling said: ‘I’m paying a very high price for trying to get a girl hot and make it with her. Everybody in the world wants to f*** her. Listen, I’m telling you she was hot. It took me maybe an hour to get there but it was hot. So why did I do it? Because I’m 80-years-old.' But on Dr Phil, Stiviano says she has no idea why Sterling has described her as his girlfriend. 'Only Mr Sterling would know why he said that,' Stiviano said. 'That's not what happened. I've never had any type of sexual contact with Mr Sterling, whatsoever.' In response to Sterling's statement's that she 'loves sex' and has a 'fabulous body', Stiviano smiles, holds out her hands and shows off her figure. Confident: Stiviano shows off her figure, when Dr Phil asks why Sterling says she has a great body and 'loves sex' 'I mean, look at my body,' she says. 'I personally think I have a great, fabulous, body. In regards to why would he say that I like to have sex? I don't know.'

But she says she recorded Sterling with his permission and even played back some of his 'bi-polar moments' to set him straight. 'He would just lash out and say certain things that were absurd, things that were mean, things that were just out of the norm. And I would play those back to him to remind him of how he acted or how offensive he could be towards another person.' Stiviano reportedly released the tapes to TMZ in response to his wife's lawsuit. In the Wednesday interview, she said Shelly Sterling was jealous of her husband's favoritism. 'I don't know why she would even file that lawsuit. What Mr Sterling did was something that he did.

Should I have stayed at home? Should I have been drinking? Should I have used drugs? You tell me. What . would have been better? I used the mask.' Stiviano's latest interview comes a day after the NBA's 30-page report on Sterling was released to the media, as they take their first steps towards trying to force him out of the Clippers. The report accuses Sterling of trying to bride Stiviano into saying publicly that she doctored the tapes, as well as lying to league investigators. In a Monday announcement, the league said they would hold a vote on June 3 to determine whether Sterling will keep his team or not. If three-quarters of team owners agree, Sterling can be forced to sell the Clippers.","V.

"Nigel Farage yesterday stoked the row over his ‘racist’ attack on Romanians by insisting that they were more likely to commit crime than other immigrants. The UKIP leader said it was ‘perfectly legitimate’ to point out ‘where there are differential crime rates between nationalities’. The defiance came 24 hours after an interview in which Mr Farage, whose wife is German, claimed people would rather live next door to Germans than Romanians. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage said people 'have a perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly moved in next door' When asked . what the difference was, in an interview considered so disastrous that . his senior media aide, Patrick O’Flynn, interrupted to try to stop it, . Mr Farage said: ‘You know what the difference is.’ Yesterday, . rather than apologise, the UKIP leader declared: ‘Where there are . differential crime rates between nationalities, it is perfectly . legitimate to point this out and to discuss it in the public sphere.’ He added: ‘Police figures are quite clear that there is a high level of criminality within the Romanian community in Britain. ‘This is not to say for a moment that all or even most Romanian people living in the UK are criminals. ‘But . it is to say that any normal and fair-minded person would have a . perfect right to be concerned if a group of Romanian people suddenly . moved in next door.’ LBC presenter James O'Brien said Farage was 'one of the slickest and most dissembling political leaders in living memory' Mr . Farage emphatically denied UKIP was racist and said his comments about . Romanians moving in were being criticised by media commentators who . lived in ‘million-pound houses and for whom the prospect of such a turn . of events is not a real one’. Meanwhile, . the LBC presenter who conducted the original interview has branded Mr . Farage ‘one of the slickest and most dissembling political leaders in . living memory’. In . an article for The Mail on Sunday, James O’Brien writes today about the . radio interview with Farage, saying that the UKIP leader’s ‘cultivated . “pint and a fag” facade’ had slipped. Mr . O’Brien says: ‘When the man who leads the party lets his mask slip . briefly, it is hardly surprising that people are beginning to ask . questions about his convictions.’ The radio presenter described Mr Farage as a ‘political Pied Piper’ leading blindly dancing followers. To . make matters worse for Mr Farage, the multi-millionaire funding his . party issued a veiled warning that he could walk away unless UKIP won . this week’s European elections. Nigel Farage insisted that UKIP was not a racist political party . Paul . Sykes, who is financing UKIP’s £1.5 million poster campaign, revealed . that he has made no commitments to the party beyond this Thursday. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have told them – I am doing nothing until I see the European results. ‘When . I know the vast majority of people are voting UKIP, have voted to leave . the EU, then I’m going to roll my sleeves up. But we need that first.’ The . frank remarks will send a shiver down the spine of Mr Farage, who will . recall how Mr Sykes spectacularly abandoned the party shortly after the . European election campaign of 2004. The . former member of the Con­servative Party, who is worth an estimated . £650 million, dumped UKIP after it announced it was out to ‘kill’ the . Tories. However, . Mr Sykes also stressed yesterday that the UKIP of 2014 was a far more . impressive operation and made clear he is now a ‘lot more’ committed to . the party. Despite . all of Mr Farage’s problems, a ComRes opinion poll last night forecast . that UKIP was still on course to win the European elections.

"Criminal gangs from Romania are responsible for a boom in cash machine card thefts. Over the past year the number of thefts related to ATMs has trebled and police intelligence suggests more than 90 per cent are linked to Romanian immigrants. There were some 7,572 cash machine card thefts in the first four months of the year, up from 2,553 during the same period in 2012. Be vigilant: Over the past year the number of thefts related to ATMs has trebled and police intelligence suggests more than 90 per cent are linked to Romanian immigrants . Other card payment machines, such as railway station ticket machines, are also being targeted. The techniques involved are crude yet they can generate huge windfalls, with card fraud for 2013 expected to reach £400million. Gang members using distraction techniques have been behind the rise in cashpoint thefts. The thieves will often crowd round ATMs and read PIN numbers before stealing the card. They are then able to drain the victim's account. Often the elderly and the most vulnerable are the targets. As the number of these distraction thefts has soared, thieves have started deploying the scam in shops, railway stations and cafes. Other thieves use more sophisticated ATM scams - and will fit the machine with a 'skimming' device which will make a copy of the card's details. A wide array of scams that have been deployed at cashpoints across the country include: . Spring traps - Once a card has been inserted, these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the ATM from retracting it. Cash traps - Claw-like implements are inserted into cash-dispensing slot to 'capture or skim some of the dispensed bills'. Jammers - An oversized fork-like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal ATM transaction. Skimmers - Thieves lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic strip readers. The data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and used at ATM along with victim’s PIN to withdraw cash. Transaction reversal fraud - Involves 'tricking' ATM into not debiting some of the cash that has been taken or manipulating the ATM to pay more than the balance available. Can be done via clips or fingers or by removing some notes so machine does not realise it has dispensed them. Gang members will crowd customers withdrawing cash to read their four-digit PIN, then distract them to steal the card. In some cases they install a simple metal sleeve in the slot which means the card is not returned to the user. Someone reads the PIN over the victim’s shoulder and then, when they have moved away, retrieves the card. Once the thieves have the card and PIN they can go on a shopping spree or use a hole in the wall machine to empty their victim’s account. Pensioner Jacqueline Fletcher was . watched by two thieves while she withdrew cash from an ATM outside her . local supermarket in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire. When . the 80-year-old emerged from the shop, one of the men asked her for . change and stole her bank card while pretending to help her with her . purse. ‘It frightened me and . it gutted me to think that I’d been stupid enough and that they’d been . attacking vulnerable people, young or old,’ she said. ‘It’s obvious that they’d seen me as an easy mark.’ Last month a woman in Cheltenham had . her cards stolen in a supermarket car park as she was distracted by a . man asking for directions. She believes the criminals, who siphoned . £1,000 from her account, spotted her using her PIN at a store till. Meanwhile, victims are finding it . increasingly difficult to get their stolen cash refunded. A number of . banks have introduced rules which means they can deny a refund if they . believe the customer has failed to protect their PIN and card. The theft figures were revealed by . Financial Fraud Action, which is responsible for tackling plastic card . fraud on behalf of banks. Chip and PIN cards were introduced by the . industry in 2005 with the aim of reducing fraud. The chip means the cards are difficult to copy, while a PIN is considered more secure than a signature. Card skimming: This cash machine has been fitted with a skimming device which covers the whole right hand side of the machine and is very yard to spot. It reads information from the card's magnetic strip enabling thieves to steal. Card skimming is one of the more sophisticated techniques used by thieves . Another card skimming device: Cover which is put over the slot enabling thieves to clone the card details . Initially . there was a dip in card fraud, however this is now rising again. The . total cost of fraud on debit and credit cards leapt 14 per cent last . year, by £47million to £388million, Fraud is expected to top £400million . this year. The City of London Police’s dedicated . cheque and plastic crime unit calculates that 92 per cent of all cash . machine fraud is committed by Romanian nationals. In March, authorities in Europe . arrested 44 members of a global card fraud network in a joint operation . against a criminal gang targeting victims in Britain and 15 other . countries. The operation, dubbed Pandora Storm, shut down illegal . workshops producing card machine theft devices and involved 82 house . searches in Romania and the UK. In 2008 Romanian fraudster Adu Bunu, was . jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more than 2,000 . cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million. Police found photographs that showed his young son rolling around in a mountain of stolen cash. Cash machine thefts: Thieves read customers' four-digit pin when they are at a cash machine before later stealing the card. The crude technique has also been used by thieves at train station ticket machines and in supermarkets (picture posed by models) Jailed: Romanian fruadster Abu Bunu was jailed for five years after he was convicted of cloning more than 2,000 cards, which allowed him to steal up to £1.1million . Speaking last year, Commander Steve Head, of City of London Police, said: ‘We can see quite clearly what they are doing with the money back in Romania. They are spending it on a lavish lifestyle, flash cars, flash houses. ‘What sits behind it all is the greed – the greed of the people who are organising it, the greed of the professionals along the way who are enabling it.’ Another scam used by the gangs see them calling people at home pretending to be from the security department of their bank. They warn their card details have been stolen and run through a series of security questions, including asking their target to volunteer their PIN. They then send an apparently official courier to collect the card. Financial Fraud Action said people need to protect themselves and their cards. The organisation advises standing close to the cash machine and shielding the keypad when entering a PIN. A spokesman said: ‘If someone is crowding or watching you, cancel the transaction and go to another machine.  Do not accept help from seemingly well-meaning strangers and never allow yourself to be distracted. ‘If your card is retained by the machine for any reason, report it to your card company immediately.’ Scam: Leonid Rotaru avoided jail last December despite being involved in a £3m cash machine fraud . A Romanian man involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £3 million and with 9,000 potential victims walked free from court. Leonid Rotaru helped to fit 'skimming' devices on cash dispensers, which downloaded the card details of those who used them. The scam was relatively sophisticated - and can be contrasted with other cash machine thefts where the thieves surreptitiously read the user's pin before stealing their card. Police investigating Rotaru said they discovered 9,000 different card accounts on a computer they seized. Detectives estimated that the network to which Rotaru belonged had access to at least £3 million, based on the average fraud per card for typical skimming offences. But despite that the fraudster, 32, avoided a jail term when he appeared before Taunton Crown Court last December. He was instead given a 18-month prison sentence which was suspended for two years. Speaking outside the court, Avon and Somerset Police civilian investigator Barrie Douglas said: 'The potential in these cases is always for a lot of money to be made. Banks say the average (fraud) per card is around £460.' Rotaru's role in the scam was to fit the discreet skimming device to a cash machine, which was later removed and used to download the card details relevant to each unwitting victim’s account. Those details were then sent on an email to another man. Rotaru, of Bridgwater, Somerset, told police he was 'at the bottom end' of the operation, and that the 'big boys operated out of London'. He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours community service.","Number of thefts carried out by cashpoints has trebled in the past year .

"But Ukip says story is 'more shocking than BBC's headline suggest' The prime minister of Romania has admitted there is a problem with citizens of his country coming to Britain and committing crimes. Victor Ponta said Roma gypsies, in particular, posed a 'huge challenge' to law enforcement by begging and stealing mobile phones. He said he supported Britain's moves to tighten up access to benefits for Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants. Warning: Romania's Prime Minister Victor Ponta has admitted there is a problem . with citizens of his country coming to Britain and committing crimes . Romanian migrants in Park Lane, one of Central London's most prestigious roads. Benefit restrictions are likely to deter Romanian migrants from coming to Britain, a poll has found . Mr Ponta told BBC2's Newsnight: 'I am . very aware that Romanian citizens have committed, not serious crime, but . some of them – Romanians but also representatives of the Roma minority – . they are doing the small criminality, begging, stealing cellular . phones. 'I think that first of all we have to . co-operate. Our police and law enforcement agencies should keep . co-operating very well. On the other hand it is a huge challenge and a . big concern for my government to implement the strategies for . integration of the Roma communities.' Referring to David Cameron's pledge to . tighten benefits legislation to make it harder for migrants to claim, . Mr Ponta said it seemed 'very fair'. He added: 'That would be very fair from the British point of view, I would support this. 'All we ask is not to have . discrimination, all the legislation which applies to a German citizen or . a French citizen should apply also to a Romanian or a Bulgarian.' His comments came as the BBC was . accused of playing down the results of its own immigration survey, which . found evidence that more than 100,000 Romanians and Bulgarians may come . to Britain next year. Seven in ten of the Romanians who are thinking about moving to live in Britain would reconsider in the light of the new system . The Newsnight poll of working-age . migrants in the two Eastern European countries led to headlines across . the BBC's output yesterday declaring there would not be a huge influx . into the UK when EU restrictions end on January 1. But critics said an analysis of the . results showed large numbers were making firm plans to come, and accused . the BBC of concocting 'nothing-to-see-here headlines'. The poll quoted figures of 1 per cent of Romanians and 4 per cent of Bulgarians 'actively considering work in the UK'. 'It looks to me that the BBC is engaging, with its headlining of this story, not in reporting the facts, but in influencing the debate' Ukip leader Nigel Farage . But the MigrationWatchUK think-tank . said the small percentages represented 150,000 Romanians and 200,000 . Bulgarians. A separate question asking who was making 'concrete plans' suggested figures of 61,000 Romanians and 58,000 Bulgarians. Arrivals on that scale would blow a . hole in ministers' efforts to cut net migration to tens of thousands by . the end of the Parliament. Sir Andrew Green, MigrationWatch UK chairman, . said: 'This is a stunning survey, which the BBC has rather desperately . tried to play down.

He was best known for his roles in the drama series Bandit St Petersburg and The Street of Broken Lights. He was also well-known as an outspoken critic of Putin and has taken part in many anti-Kremlin protests. Three years ago, he returned two state honours that had previously been awarded to him by President Putin for acting. He said he handed them back in a protest against corruption and political censorship and said he felt 'ashamed' to have received them. In a later interview he said: 'I am completely fed up with this tzar-statedom with its lies, cover-ups, state sanctioned robbbery, bribery and other virtues.' Mr Dovotchenko handed back two state honours he was awarded by Russian president Vladimir Putin, pictured, saying he felt ashamed of them . Shortly after the interview, he was attacked on the Moscow underground, with reports saying he was 'almost killed.' He was also a member of the United Civil Front and in March he signed a letter along with other Russian actors condemning the country's military intervention in Ukraine. However, other reports have said he was found inside his apartment, with the Russian Interfax news agency quoting a source in law enforcement that Mr Devotchenko could have died from a heart attack. The source added that there were no signs that the actor suffered a violent death and that he may have fell and hit his head when drunk. Russian tabloid LifeNews reported that Devotchenko fell into a a glass cabinet and died of blood loss after sustaining severe cuts to his hands. It added that empty bottles of whiskey and packets of phenazepam, a legal Russian drug prescribed to treat epilepsy, were discovered near his body. Police are investigating but there has not yet been a cause of death established.","Alexei Dovotchenko was discovered dead at his apartment in Moscow .

"A 14-year-old boy who dyed his hair brown in an effort to stop bullies attacking him for being ginger was found hanged by his father, an inquest has heard. Simon Walters - who was a pupil at Heath Park School in Wolverhampton, West Midlands - was discovered dead in his bedroom by his 42-year-old father Nigel, with whom he lived alone. Mr Walters last saw his son alive before leaving for work at 8pm, and said he would always text him during a shift to say he loved him - but on that night he was too busy and never sent the message. Suicide: Simon Walters, 14, of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, who lived alone with his father, dyed his hair brown in an effort to stop bullies attacking him for being ginger, the inquest heard . Speaking at the hearing at Smethwick Council House yesterday, Mr Walters described the moment he found his son dead after returning home from a night shift at 4.15am on a day in October last year. Mr Walters said: ‘Simon’s music was blaring and his lights were still on so I went upstairs to tell him to go to bed. He was hanging. I just ran downstairs screaming - I could not believe it. I was in shock.’ The warehouse worker told the inquest that Simon was also physically attacked by his tormenters and had confronted the school about the abuse, which had been going on for over five months. He said: ‘In May last year I noticed a lump on his head. When I confronted him about it he said a boy at school hit him. 'On another occasion when I called Simon to tell him I would pick him up from school I heard children calling him names in the background. Family: Simon (right) is photographed with his grandmother Joan Walters (left) and uncle Paul Walters (centre) ‘The phone call was really bad, lots . of children were calling him names and shouting swear words. I discussed . the matter with the school and was told there was a zero tolerance . policy towards bullying.’ Tragic: Simon, who died last October, is pictured with his baby cousin Charlotte . Mr Walters said he was reassured the matter would be resolved but the next day Simon begged his father to go to school with him. He . added: ‘He said “Father can you come to school with me?” He was . terrified, he was shaking, he was crying. I asked if everything was okay . afterwards and he said it was sorted. ‘He was very withdrawn towards the end. It actually got me very upset and I would cry in front of him asking him: “What is wrong - I know you have changed?” He used to be a jolly lad, he enjoyed telling jokes, he was a pleasant little boy and was well behaved. ‘I was really concerned, he just used to always speak to me but then he stopped talking to me, he used to shut himself in his room. My own conclusion was that he was being threatened not to say anything.’ Simon’s grandmother Joan Walters also believed the teenager was being bullied and said she had been in touch with some of his friends on Facebook since his death. Giving evidence, she said: ‘They have said he was being bullied because he wouldn’t conform to what they wanted him to do.’ A police investigation also found Simon had been teased because of his ginger hair and had researched how to commit suicide on the internet. But Detective Inspector Richard Scott, . from West Midlands Police, said there was not enough evidence that he . had been bullied by his peers. Education: Simon was a pupil at Heath Park School (pictured) in Wolverhampton. A police investigation found the boy had been teased because of his ginger hair . He . said: ‘His school friends have told us there was teasing because he had . red hair. That was what one of his friends said - that there was . teasing because he had dyed his hair.’ Sad case: Simon had researched how to commit suicide on the internet, the inquest was told . Heath Park School headteacher Georgetta Holloway also told the hearing there was no evidence of bullying at the school. She . said: ‘No one had seen a change, nothing was reported to his friends . other than the incident in May described. He was a popular young man but . very much a young man, he was a joker. He had a wide circle of . friends.’ Recording a verdict of suicide, Black Country Coroner Robin Balmain said: ‘The only positive motive that comes to light is bullying.  However, I have to say there is no clear evidence. ‘The police have carried out a clear investigation and we have heard evidence from Mrs Holloway. ‘Perhaps most importantly the police have been able to read his Facebook record and there is nothing that suggests he was being bullied. This is a tragedy for the family and also for Simon’s friends.’ Following the verdict, Mrs Holloway told MailOnline: ‘Over a year on the school community still feels the loss, the grief and the shock, from the tragic passing of Simon. ‘Simon was many things to many people.  For some he was a quiet unassuming young man, to some of his class mates he was the one they could confide in, to others he was the one with the wicked sense of humour and infectious laugh. ‘To his closest friends however, those with whom he shared his interests, his musical tastes and manga obsession, he was himself - their best friend and confidante. Our thoughts are always with Simon’s family and his friends - he is greatly missed.’","Simon Walters was discovered dead by father Nigel, 42, in the early hours .

"A prankster has fooled a town's residents into believing he is their mayor after setting up a spoof Twitter account. Prankster James Billington has managed to trick locals, politicians and businesses into thinking he is the real Mayor of Stafford. He has uploaded pictures to his Twitter account @mayorofstafford of himself wearing a mayoral chain and even cutting the ribbon at an 'opening' at Alton Towers Theme Park. Duties: One of the pictures from the Twitter account of the hoax Mayor of Stafford. James Billington has fooled residents into thinking he holds the esteemed ceremonial position . 'Mayor Billington' visits a building site in Staffordshire, praising the business for investing in his town. He has even handed out badges saying: 'I'm the Mayor of Stafford' The joker, believed to be in his 30s, has also been cheering on competitors in a half marathon and congratulating elderly residents on their birthday whilst wearing his livery collar. On his bio he states: 'I'm James Billington, the current Mayor of Stafford. Delighted to be representing the town of Stafford & surrounding areas. Views are my own.' James - who has no affiliation with Stafford Borough Council whatsoever- has even made his own badges which proudly state: 'I'm The Mayor Of Stafford'. Bit of fun: But the fake Twitter account has attracted the ire of local politicians . But since his fictional life came to light Stafford Borough Council have now asked Twitter to shut down the bogus account. Their actions were prompted by a complaint from the Mayor of Shrewsbury Jon Tandy who was angry when he was compared to a 'bad guy' from Superman 2. On March 21 James tweeted: 'Sharing a meeting with the mayor of Shrewsbury today. Never liked him. Reminds me of one of the bad guys from Superman 2.'

To which Cllr Tandy replied: 'Never had the pleasure of meeting @mayorofstafford . 'Surprised by his tweet today. Maybe he was hacked or mistaken?"" After it was pointed out the real mayor of Stafford is Labour councillor Angela Loughran, who has held the ceremonial role for ten months, he then complained to the council.' Today Cllr Loughran said: 'Nobody minds a bit of fun on social media. 'But it is unacceptable that this person is purporting to be the Mayor of Stafford and making disparaging remarks about another Mayor. 'This is bringing the mayoralty into disrepute.' A spokesman from Stafford Borough Council confirmed: 'We received an email from Shrewsbury Town Council who were unimpressed with comments made on Twitter which had come from an account with the name James Billington purporting to be the ""mayorofstafford"".' Billington even managed to dupe theme park giants Alton Towers after tweeting them saying: 'Looking forward to opening/attending @altontowers tomorrow! Britain's best theme park in great #Staffordshire.' They responded with: '@mayorofstafford We look forward to seeing you for our £OpeningWeekend! It's going to be great! :-).' Alongside the image of him cutting a ribbon, he tweeted: 'Honoured to open @altontowers for their 2014 season today! #OpeningWeekend #staffordshirehour #Staffordshire.' Posting a picture of his home-made badges he added: 'Looking forward to giving out these badges to the great people of #Stafford over the next few weeks!' The real one: The actual Mayor of Stafford Angela Loughran, pictured at a event held for the Mayor's charity. Right, a young political supporter proudly displays her badge . Another picture shows him at a building site in a high-vis jacket and helmet with the caption: 'Was very pleased to be part of the building process of new businesses in #Stafford area this morning #investment.' Some of the tweets from fooled residents include Jack Hughes who said: 'Any comment on the Boro Council scandal, you Worshipful and esteemed Mayor? Will you all resign now?' Stafford Round Table even invited Billington to one of their fundraising events, adding: 'Fancy joining us on one of our upcoming social events? #makefriends #havefun #dosomegood' Local Stafford Book Club also invited him to promote on of their events, saying: '#mayorofstafford Hi, we're launching a new book club in Stafford soon, any chance of a RT?' Following his tweet regarding the mayor of Shrewsbury, Kevin Tanner (@kevtan1066) tweeted: '@mayorofstafford what the hell? Is this a joke, in very poor taste! If it isn't you should resign now!'

"Ed Miliband today faces the biggest crisis of his leadership, amid rising panic that his personal unpopularity will cost Labour victory at the next election. Analysis of voter satisfaction ratings over four decades reveal Mr Miliband is down to minus 34. It means he is less popular than any Prime Minister or opposition leader at this point ahead of an election, except Michael Foot who led Labour to its worst ever defeat. Jim Callaghan, Neil Kinnock, John Major, William Hague, Michael Howard and Gordon Brown all had higher net satisfaction ratings with IpsosMORI six months before being hammered at the ballot box. Analysis of IpsosMORI polling dating back to 1977 by MailOnline shows how only Michael Foot had worse personal satisfaction ratings than Ed Miliband six months before a general election . Mr Miliband has come under growing pressure from his own party to improve his own image and standing with voters, who do not view him as a future Prime Minister . Since becoming leader four years ago Mr Miliband has seen a collapse in his public satisfaction ratings. A month after he defeated his brother for the leadership, 41 per cent per of voters were satisfied with Mr Miliband with just 19 per cent dissastified, giving a net rating of 19 points. In the latest IpsoMORI survey, published two weeks ago, the figure had slumped to -34, twice as bad as David Cameron's -17. 'It's all just depressing,' a shadow cabinet minister said. 'People tell me they can't vote Labour it means Ed becomes PM. But it's my name on the ballot paper, not his.' A senior backbencher added: 'People normally grow into the role, but he's shrunk.' The Tories have made clear they will present the election campaign as a direct choice between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband as a future Prime Minister, which senior Labour figures fear most. Growing numbers liken the panic gripping the Labour party to the run-up to the 2010 election, when Gordon Brown's personal unpopularity and poor image was repeatedly raised by voters as a concern. But the analysis shows that Mr Brown's satisfaction ratings stood at -25 six months before he led Labour to a thumping defeat in 2010. Every Prime Minister and opposition leader since the late 1970s had better net satisfaction ratings than Mr Miliband, expect for Mr Foot . Mr Miliband started off well, but has seen his net satisfaction rating plummet. A senior Labour MP said: 'People normally grow into the role, but he's shrunk' Only a quarter of voters say they are satisfied with Mr Miliband as Labour leader, with almost two thirds dissatisfied . Tory leaders John Major, William Hague and Michael Howard all had better ratings than Mr Miliband before they were beaten by Tony Blair's New Labour in 1997, 2001 and 2005. Only Michael Foot had worse support six months before his defeat to Margaret Thatcher in 1983, but only just - his net satisfaction of -38. Ben Page, chief executive of IpsosMORI, said: 'Ed Miliband's personal ratings among voters are a serious problem for Labour – no-one has ever become Prime Minister with ratings like these, and without a lead on managing the economy. 'Only Michael Foot's ratings in the run up to the 1983 election were worse. 'On the other hand of course only twice has a government been in power for over two years and increased its share of the vote, and while Cameron is more popular than Miliband, the Conservatives remain much less liked than the Labour Party among voters.' Critics point to Mr Miliband's disastrous party conference speech, which he delivered without notes and forgot to mention the deficit or immigration. After being mocked for his difficulties eating a bacon sandwich, Mr Miliband claimed he was not a photo opportunities politician, contrasting his high-minded approach to David Cameron putting style over substance. In a speech in July he attempted to present himself as serious and principled compared to Mr Cameron’s ‘superficial’ and image-driven approach. The photo opportunity, he said, is ‘not where my talents lie – as you may have noticed’. He said: 'If you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing, then don’t vote for me. Because I don’t. But here’s the thing: I believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo op. And that culture diminishes our politics.’ But since then the Labour leader has posed wearing a pro-feminism t-shirt and gave a handful of change to a beggar while surrounded by photographers. A former Cabinet minister told MailOnline said: 'What p***es me off is he said he would be about content not style, but it's all style and spin... and it's s***. 'The only thing worse than the idea he won't be Prime Minister is the thought that he might.' In July Mr Miliband promised he was not a 'photo opportunity' politician, but has since been pictured wearing a pro-feminism t-shirt (right) and giving a handful of change to a beggar while surrounded by photographers . Last night Mr Miliband reshuffled his frontbench team, appointing Lucy Powell as vice-chairman of the general election campaign. She said she was going to 'unblock' the system to make sure the operation was working effectively. It follows growing unease about the leader's office, and its failure to communicate with voters. One frontbencher said: 'I told them we need to talk in a way that normal people understand. I'm not sure they understood what I meant.' In a fresh blow, the New Statesman, which is traditionally supportive of Labour, warns that Mr Miliband's approach is haemorrhaging support on the Left to the Greens and the Scottish National Party. The magazine says the Labour leader appears a product of his 'narrow background' and demonstrates no understanding of lower middle-class aspiration. Jason Cowley, editor of the New Statesman, one of only two national publications to back Mr Miliband over his brother David for the Labour leadership in 2010, said he appeared 'very much an old-style Hampstead socialist'. 'He doesn't really understand the lower middle-class or material aspiration,' he writes. 'He doesn't understand Essex Man or Woman. Politics for him must seem at times like an extended PPE seminar: elevated talk about political economy and the good society.' He adds: 'Miliband has a deterministic, quasi-Marxist analysis of our present ill. 'The Ukip insurgency, Scottish nationalism, the hollowing out of political parties, Islamist radicalisation, the loathing and distrust of elites: all are manifestations of a failed economic model.' David Miliband. who was defeated by his brother for the Labour leadership in 2010, is now CEO of the International Rescue Committee. Last night he hosted the Annual Freedom Award Benefit Event in New York, attended by rock singer Sting and opera singer Danielle de Niese . Mr Miliband also posed for photographs with ballet dancer and actor Mikhail Baryshnikov (left) and his Louise Shackelton (right)","Pollster says Miliband's -34% net satisfaction rating is a 'serious problem'

"'Tactical': Policies announced by David Cameron have been criticised as ill-thought-out and not up to the task of combating terrorism . David Cameron’s anti-terror plans came under fresh attack yesterday amid claims he proposed the crackdown to shift attention from the embarrassment of a Tory MP defecting to Ukip. In a major Commons statement on Monday, he vowed to introduce measures to bar British fanatics fighting in Iraq and Syria from re-entering the UK, either by stripping them of their passports or stopping them boarding flights back home. But critics suggested Mr Cameron had ratcheted up the rhetoric to try to ‘bury bad news’ after Tory backbencher Douglas Carswell stunned Westminster by defecting to Ukip last week. Labour MP Ian Austin, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘David Cameron used the most apocalyptic language to tell us that we faced a generational struggle against the threat of jihadists to Britain. ‘I agree with him. Tackling extremists and extremism to prevent British people becoming terrorists at home and abroad is a huge priority. ‘But the measures he announced were a damp squib. They did not amount to much more than tough talking. It looks very much like he was playing politics with security to deflect attention from the problems he is having within his own party.’ In a further blow to Downing Street, the independent reviewer of terror laws warned there would be ‘significant difficulties’ in stopping British-born suspects re-entering the country. It also emerged another proposal, to force terror suspects living in the UK to be relocated away from other militants, might be blocked by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader. The criticism increased the sense of disarray surrounding the ‘targeted’ package of proposals unveiled by Mr Cameron. A senior Tory criticised Downing Street for briefing ill-thought out terror policies. He said: ‘They don’t think, “Let’s get a serious set of policies that may solve the problem.” They think, “Let’s brief something that will get rid of this problem for the next 72 hours.” It is tactical media management, nothing else.’ David Anderson QC, the counter-terrorism watchdog, said there were ‘legal difficulties’ with stopping British-born citizens who had been fighting abroad from returning to the UK, as rendering them stateless would breach international law. Don't look at this: Cameron's announcement have been derided as an attempt to deflect attention from the defection of Tory MP Douglass Carswell (pictured left with Nigel Farage) to Ukip . The Prime Minister also wants to force airlines to hand over advanced passenger information to the security services or be banned from landing planes in the UK. Mr Anderson said: ‘The whole concept of citizenship is about the right of abode... if you’re going to suspend that, even on a temporary basis, I think you run into some legal difficulties. ‘Where does the person go? Do they go back to Syria for a bit more jihad? Do they go and find a beach somewhere in Turkey? ‘The trouble with this game of pass the parcel, whether it comes to terrorists or other criminals, is that if other people’s terrorists or criminals find their way to Great Britain, they too could say, “Well we wash our hands of these people, we’re not going to let them back, they’re your problem”.","David Cameron made major statement to the Commons on fighting terror .

"He is the man in charge of making sure the nation’s finances add up. But George Osborne has ducked a simple maths quiz during while being grilled on TV by schoolchildren. The Chancellor refused point blank to say what seven times eight equals, claiming he has ‘a rule in life’ not to answer maths questions. Scroll down for video . The Chancellor was put on the spot by Samuel Reddings, aged 7, as part of a panel of young readers of First News . Sam Raddings of St Hildas' Primary school in Stretford, Manchester showed the Chancellor how it was done . Mr Osborne appeared on Sky News to face questions from a panel of children readers of the First News newspaper. Seven-year-old Samuel Reddings challenged him: ‘What’s seven times eight.’ But the Chancellor responded: 'Look I'm not going to get into a whole string of... I've made it a rule in life not to answer a whole load of maths questions.’ Mr Osborne said he had studied maths at A-Level and often been 'tested at school'. He added: ‘Of course there is a lot of maths in my job but it also about making judgements about where the Government should spend its money.’ With the economy now growing at a faster rate than any major country, Mr Osborne’s reputation has been in the ascendancy. But he admitted that he wishes he had done more to repair the damage caused by the 2007 crash. The Chancellor showed there were no hard feelings as shook Samuel's hand after the grilling . He appeared taken aback when asked what his biggest regret had been from his time in government. He suggested that the scale of the economic challenge Britain faced in 2010 meant he wished he could have doe more to deal to put the country back on track. ‘Wow.... What decision do I regret most? I think what is true is that when you get into office that's your best opportunity to take some really big decisions,’ he said. 'And we did take some big decisions because then you've got a few years to see them played out. 'But actually I look back and think there's even more we could have done to fix some of the economic problems and I want to go on therefore taking decisions that will help create jobs for you and your families and make sure the country is more prosperous. 'If anything, it's like I wish we'd done even more. But that’s aright we are doing more now.' However, he gave no detail of what additional efforts to encourage he wishes he had taken. The Chancellor also revealed he wishes he could have done more to help the economy . One his own family’s finances, he said his children received pocket money without having to help around the house. He revealed he saved his own pocket money for a Scalextric set, adding: ‘I spent it most of the time but I did save up for a Scalextric set. ‘Computers games were only just starting. Scalextric, I think it is still around, this was where you could race cars around an electric track and it was quite expensive. 'I remember I really wanted one and so I asked for money especially for my birthday to get one and saved up some of my pocket money to get this Scalextric set.' The Chancellor, who was this week pictured singing along to the Monty Python live show at the O2, struggled when quizzed about rap music.

"Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri has urged Muslims to launch attacks on 'American soil' to lead up to a 'war on its own land'. In an audio speech released online a day after the twelfth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, al-Zawahiri urged sustained attacks on the U.S. which he said would 'bleed America economically' by forcing the country to spend large amounts on defence. And he encouraged Muslims to seize any opportunity to land 'a large strike' on the U.S. even if this took years of patience, according to a translation on the U.S. SITE monitoring service. Scroll down for video . Leader: Ayman al-Zawahiri - shown here in an Al-Jazeera broadcast in 2006 - is credited by many as having been the brains behind the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. In the excerpts of the 72-minute address that were published by SITE, he said  'one brother or a few of the brothers' should launch smaller strikes on the U.S. wherever possible. Al-Zawahiri, who was Osama Bin Laden's physician and right-hand man and tops America's list of 'most wanted' terrorists released in 2001 with a £15million bounty on his head, is credited by many as having been the brains behind the 9/11 attacks and those on the London transport system in July 2005 that left 52 people dead. Western counter-terrorism chiefs have warned that the broadcast could provide fuel for radicalised 'lone wolves' who might have had no direct contact with al Qaeda as much as operatives like those who carried out complex plots like the September 11 strikes. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the attacks in 2001 when hijacked aeroplanes were flown into New York's World Trade Center, the Pentagon in Washington and a Pennsylvania field. Al-Zawahiri was quoted as saying in the speech: 'We should bleed America economically by provoking it to continue in its massive expenditure on its security, for the weak point of America is its economy, which has already begun to stagger due to the military and security expenditure.' Right-hand man: Al-Zawahili, pictured left with Osama Bin Laden in 2002 . Keeping the U.S. in such a state of tension and anticipation only required a few disparate attacks 'here and there', he said . 'As we defeated it in the gang warfare in Somalia, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan, so we should follow it with ...war on its own land. These disparate strikes can be done by one brother or a few of the brothers.' In his audio speech, al-Zawahiri said Muslims should refuse to buy goods from America and its allies, as such spending only helped to fund U.S. military action in Muslim lands. He added that Muslims should abandon the U.S. dollar and replace it with the currency of nations that did not attack Muslims. Al-Zawahiri spoke approvingly of the bombing of the Boston Marathon in April, in which three people were killed and 264 injured, and which U.S. authorities believe was carried out by two ethnic Chechen Muslim brothers. Dangerous: The Al-Qaeda leader tops the U.S. most wanted list with a £15million bounty on his head . Al-Zawahiri described the bombing as part of al-Qaeda's violent transnational campaign of jihad, or holy war, against U.S. interests. 'The Boston incident confirms to the Americans ... that they are not facing individuals, organizations or groups, but they are facing an uprising Ummah (Muslim community), that rose in jihad to defend its soul, dignity and capabilities,' he said. 'What the American regime refuses to admit is that al-Qaeda is a message before it was an organization.' Al-Zawahiri, suspected by many security specialists to be living in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area, added that al-Qaeda's message to Muslims was that they had to defend their dignity if they wanted to be liberated'.","Ayman al-Zawahiri calls for 'a large strike' on American soil .

"Virgil van Dijk branded Slovakian referee Ivan Kruzliak the worst he had ever encountered after the controversial red card that crushed Celtic’s Europa League dreams. The Dutchman was sent off after just 36 minutes of the 1-0 second-leg defeat to Inter Milan following two bookings in rapid succession. Initially cautioned for a foul on Rodrigo Palacio, Van Dijk earned his marching orders for a second soft-looking offence against Mauro Icardi. Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk was sent off against Inter Milan following two bookings in rapid succession . Van Dijk (third left) looks away as he is dismissed in the first half for Celtic against Inter Milan . Celtic were incensed by a number of other decisions – including the denial of a penalty appeal by Stuart Armstrong – and Kris Commons earned a yellow card after the final whistle for voicing his opinion towards Kruzliak. It was, however, the dismissal of Van Dijk that left Ronny Deila’s men facing a titanic task, with their fate sealed two minutes from time when Fredy Guarin netted a spectacular strike to clinch a 4-3 aggregate victory for Inter. ‘It was a terrible decision,’ Van Dijk insisted. ‘That is the worst referee I have ever experienced in my career. ‘I don’t know why he made this decision but it was shocking. But I watched the whole game and I don’t understand all of the decisions he made. Van Dijk (right) looks dismayed as he leaves the pitch at the San Siro after being shown a red card . Kris Commons (centre) and Celtic will have reason to feel aggrieved with the referee after the game . ‘I got the red card and the second yellow was just a ball in the air we are challenging for – two players. We are shoulder to shoulder and Icardi got up and asked for the referee to book me again. He did that and it was a terrible decision. ‘I would never ask for an opponent to be booked but it happens in football. ‘What disappoints me most is that they weren’t yellow cards and it happened so early in the game. It was a bad decision and that shouldn’t happen. ‘There was also a shout for a penalty and a lot of other things. Like I said, the referee got so many things wrong. ‘He booked Adam (Matthews) and Nir (Bitton) in the second half and they weren’t yellows, either.

"Tragedy: Jennifer Whiteley died of an accidental drug overdose after securing her new NHS job with boyfriend Andrew Tunnah . A psychologist who had secured a job working with drug addicts died after taking a legal high bought from a notorious website. Jennifer Whiteley, 27, took Benzo Fury with her boyfriend, which he had bought on online drugs marketplace The Silk Road. At an inquest into the death of the former A-star pupil’s death yesterday, her parents said they were shocked she had taken drugs as it was completely out  of character. Her mother, Claire Whiteley, condemned those who peddle legal highs. ‘I just want to publicise as much as possible as to how dangerous it is and that people who are selling them don’t give a toss,’ she said. ‘All they want to do is make more money. They’ve made millions out of these. People now think that it’s not going to happen to us. It obviously happens to us.’ The inquest heard Andrew Tunnah, Miss Whiteley’s boyfriend of eight years, bought the drug legally on The Silk Road in January. Web users could purchase any kind of drugs on the website, which was shut down by the FBI last month. Mr Tunnah bought 5APB and 5MAPD – 5APB is also known as Benzo Fury. Miss Whiteley – who was working as a mental health carer and had seen her articles published in the Journal of Health Psychology – received a job offer from the Pennine Trust in Lancashire in July. She spent the weekend at her parents’ house in Sale, Greater Manchester, with Mr Tunnah while her parents were away. Miss Whiteley consumed both 5APB and 5MAPD as well as cocaine and a small amount of alcohol. At about 5am Miss Whiteley started sweating profusely and collapsed after going into the bathroom to cool down. She was unconscious when an ambulance arrived and died the next day. Her father Ted Whiteley said yesterday: ‘It seems ludicrous that she would have taken as many drugs as she has. ‘I find it very hard to believe that she would have done that. She was very knowledgeable.’ Mrs Whiteley said: ‘What we don’t really understand is how she would take something that would increase her heart rate when she had been having panic attacks. I know she was very aware because of her job.’ In her new job, Miss Whiteley would have been working with the early intervention team which helps those in the early stages of drug abuse, among others. Her mother said: ‘She was really, really happy. It was the next stage. She was trying to expand her field of knowledge so that she could get into a course to be a health psychologist.’ Police found more than ten bags of illegal drugs and legal highs at the property. In June, the Home Office put a temporary class drug order on Benzo Fury which makes it illegal to manufacture, import or supply the drug but not to possess it. Coroner Joanne Kearsley recorded a verdict of misadventure and concluded that Miss Whiteley’s death was caused by ‘fatal drug toxicity’. The Silk Road was a trading website which sold everything from heroin to legal highs . The Silk Road was a trading website which sold everything from heroin to legal highs. It was used by thousands of drug dealers and could only be accessed by downloading a special browser intended to grant users anonymity. Users traded drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy and LSD as well as fake utility bills and driving licences. As of March this year, the site had 10,000 products for sale – 70 per cent of which were illegal drugs. After the shopper had selected their purchase and paid for it, the dealer would send the drugs by post. Since its launch in 2011, the site generated sales of more than £750million. It was shut down by the FBI last month. Its alleged mastermind, Ross William Ulbricht, 29, from Texas, was arrested in San Francisco on October 1 and charged with narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering. He faces a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in prison and a maximum of life.","Jennifer Whiteley was hired by the NHS to help drug addicts .

"A time-lapse video of an mysterious optical phenomenon captured by Eric Sterman is certain to leave his fellow photographers green with envy. Sterman was making a video of a Hawaii sunset on the north shore of Oahu about two weeks ago when his Panasonic GH4 camera caught a rare green flash. The time-lapse footage depicts the sun descending from a bank of dark clouds and gradually dipping into the ocean as a pod of whales jump out of the water. Just before the sun entirely vanishes below the horizon, a sliver of the ocean surface and the darkening sky are illuminated green for a brief moment. scroll down for video . The green flash was captured as the sunset on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii, by Eric Sterman . The seldom seen green flash occurs just before the last part of the sun disappears from view at the end of the 15 second clip. According to NASA, the almost-mythic spectacle is caused by the atmospheric bending and scattering of sunlight. Acting like a prism, the atmosphere of the Earth breaks white sunlight into individual colors, bending red colors slightly, and green and blue hues through increasingly larger angles.

"Marcel Kittel won a third Tour de France stage in four attempts and Chris Froome suffered a crash as the 101st edition of the race resumed in northern France on Tuesday.

Vincenzo Nibali (Astana) was 24th to retain the race leader's yellow jersey. Froome finished 42nd on the stage, slipping from fifth to seventh overall ahead of a challenging fifth stage which will commemorate 100 years since the start of World War One. The Team Sky leader was nursing a wrist injury ahead of a stage which could shake up the general classification, the 155.5km route from Ypres to Arenberg Porte du Hinaut, which features nine cobbled sections totalling more than 15km.

The problem occurred when wheels touched in the peloton and Froome tumbled on to the left side he damaged during June's Criterium du Dauphine, suffering torn shorts, a grazed left hip and a sore wrist. He swiftly found his feet and was taken back to the peloton by team-mates Bernhard Eisel and David Lopez following an assessment by the race doctor. A splint for his wrist was also produced from the team car and Froome finished the day safely in the pack, but slipping behind Alberto Contador (Tinkoff-Saxo) and Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) in the overall rankings.

Andy Schleck, the 2010 winner, did not start due to a knee injury suffered in a crash on stage three from Cambridge to London on Monday, when Kittel won. Another sprint stage was expected in Lille, but that did not put off an early two-man breakaway. Thomas Voeckler (Europcar) and Luis Mate (Cofidis) established an advantage of more than three minutes after escaping in the first kilometres, but their lead was cut to 30 seconds with 60km to go. Crosswinds had split the peloton after the surge for the intermediate sprint, but all the main protagonists were safely in the front group. Mate punctured before being gobbled up by the peloton as Voeckler forged on alone, taking his lead over one minute once more.

"David Cameron and Barack Obama will today prepare the ground for multi-national air strikes against Islamic State and for sending troops to form a Nato training force in Iraq. There is intense pressure on Mr Cameron and the US President to use a Nato summit to act decisively against the ‘terrorist state’. In Britain, cross-party support for joining US military action was increasing. Multi-national effort? David Cameron is facing intense pressure to act decisively against ISIS by joining the US in launching air strikes. Meanwhile, as he heads to the Nato summit, Obama is being accused of indecision . With world leaders gathered in Wales, the Prime Minister will argue for a multi-national effort to crush jihadist forces who have already murdered two Americans and are threatening to kill a British hostage. He told the Commons he has no doubt that millions of dollars raised by IS – also called Isil or Isis – from ransom payments is used to promote terrorism affecting the UK. And he said Britain will continue with its policy of not paying ransoms to terrorist kidnappers, adding the UK needed to ensure that other countries were also ‘good to their word’. A video showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff also included IS extremists threatening a UK hostage. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘There’s no doubt that the many tens of millions of dollars that Isil has raised from ransom payments is going into promoting terrorism, including terrorism affecting our own country.’ He said that at last year’s G8 summit he had ‘launched an initiative to try to get other countries to sign-up to a very clear doctrine that in the case of terrorist kidnap, no ransom should be paid. ‘Britain continues with this policy, America continues with his policy but we need to redouble the efforts to make sure other countries are good to their word.’ Pressure: Cameron told the Commons the UK will not cow to terrorists as he races to free a British hostage . Threats: An Islamic State fighter spoke with a British accent as he beheaded US journalist Steven Sotloff . Government sources suggested that as well as backing air attacks, in the longer term Britain was ready to contemplate putting boots back on the ground in Iraq in a potential Nato force to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces – if requested by Baghdad. There is international dismay at the lack of a coherent strategy from America for tackling IS as the Sunni extremists killed thousands and seized large areas of Iraq and Syria. Mr Obama and Mr Cameron are today expected to insist that Western allies stand shoulder to shoulder in the fight against IS – and argue its forces pose a direct threat to British and US families. The Prime Minister said: ‘A country like ours will not be cowed by these barbaric killers. If they think we will weaken in the face of their threats, they are wrong. ‘It will have the opposite effect. We will be more forthright in the defence of the values, liberty under the rule of law, freedom, democracy that we hold dear.’ He told MPs that the fight against Islamic extremism is akin to a new Cold War, and could last for many years. ‘It is not unlike the Cold War, where we did not just pursue those who wanted to do us such harm, we also had to challenge all those who gave them succour. That is what we need to do in a struggle which, as I have said, I think will last for decades.’ Determined: Government sources claim Obama will tell the summit, 'we'll win against the psychopaths' Asked as he arrived for the summit in Newport if people can expect British involvement in air strikes, Mr Cameron said: ‘We must do what is in our national interest.’ However, he insisted that while Britain and the US stood ready to assist, regional powers must take the lead in tackling IS. Government sources at the summit said Mr Cameron and Mr Obama’s message would be ‘we’ll win against the psychopaths’. Former Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw said he believed the UK should join in air strikes, adding: ‘No one is more aware than I am of the legacy of the 2003 Iraq War. Of course we should learn from the past, [but] we should not be paralysed by the past. This is a threat to civilisation.’ He accused Mr Obama of being indecisive on foreign policy – a sentiment being expressed widely in London and Washington. He said: ‘As much as I respect him, he’s very long on analysis, but he’s not quite as fleet of foot on being decisive. This Nato summit provides a clear opportunity for some very clear leadership by the United States.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is understood to have indicated he is ready to back air strikes, and Labour also appears on the point of backing action.","Cross-party support growing for UK support of US military efforts .

"Celtic face yet another UEFA disciplinary hearing after travelling supporters lit flares during Thursday night’s Europa League exit to Inter Milan.

"Chris Froome’s defence of his Tour de France title became much more difficult on Tuesday when he fell heavily and injured his right wrist and left side early on stage four. It was an innocuous-looking crash but the consequences could be devastating before today’s fifth stage over the pave roads of north-eastern France. Froome tumbled after a touch of wheels when he was close to the front. Although he was quickly back on his bike he paused for medical treatment before rejoining the peloton. He had his wrist strapped and, at the finish, did not go through his usual warming-down  ritual. Thumbs up: Froome crashed during stage four of the Tour de France and again the day after . Painful: Froome injured his wrist after falling and he will be tested on the cobbles of the fifth stage . Instead, . Froome was taken to hospital in Lille for an X-ray, although Sky . principal Sir Dave Brailsford insisted this was a precaution. ‘Chris . is all right,’ said Brailsford. ‘He felt fine in the final, good . physically, but we are going to send him for a precautionary X-ray to . check his wrist. He landed on his hand and wrist. ‘We’d . have preferred it if Chris hadn’t crashed but he felt fine in the final . bit. His spirit is fine. We know it’s part of the rough and tumble of . pro bike racing.’ The . stage continued the domination of the big German sprinter Marcel . Kittel, though this was by far the toughest of his three stage wins . after successes in Harrogate and London. Having lost his sprint train he . had to improvise but when  Norway’s Alexander Kristoff took a flier . Kittel was more than a length adrift.

"If you're a fan of Gears of War, then Judgment promises not to disappoint. But for those looking for revolutionary gameplay, emotional storytelling and deep, multifaceted level design, you may want to look elsewhere. Make no mistake, new developer People Can Fly - behind the brilliant Bulletstorm - have honed and perfected everything that makes a Gear of War of game great. Sadly, given how far the third-person genre has come since the Gears' inception in 2006, the welcome changes and modifications can't hide the tired gameplay. All together now: Most of the time, your teammates' AI works well but the same can't be same for the Locust . Set as a prequel and told in flashback after the events of Emergence Day, plot follows the adventures of Kilo squad as they endeavour to save Halvo Bay from a Locust chief called Karn. Familiar faces Cole and Baird are joined by new recruits Sofia Hendrik and Garron Paduk. Unfortunately, although it's interesting seeing the youthful exuberance of Cole and Baird, character development pales in comparison to its predecessors. There are no moments - such as the devastating death of Dom's wife Maria in the second game - that stick with you. Instead, battles are largely forgettable - but that's not to say they're not fun. There are more enemies on screen than ever before and AI is (largely) smart enough to stop you camping and gunning down Locust at ease. Levels are now split up into sections - each one containing a 'Declassifed' optional mission. Here, you can choose to add a variant to the level - for example allowing a toxic gas to impair vision or replace easier enemies with tougher ones. Successful completion of levels and Declassified missions rewards you with medals - which essentially act as bragging rights to other Gears players. This, coupled with levels featuring frequent mini 'hordes' (where you must take on waves of enemies) makes the entire thing feel more 'arcade-like' than ever before - a move that may jar with some hardcore fans. What will be universally appreciated, though, are the visuals. Judgment is easily the prettiest of the bunch. Whether it's watching Baird grimace as he mangles a Locust with his chainsaw Lancer or roadie-running across intricately bump-mapped cobbled streets, Judgment is a visual tour-de-force. Multiplayer, too, is a triumph. Overrun mode - where a team must stop a horde of Locust troops from opening Emergence Holes - is a particular highlight. This coupled with an easy-to-use class and XP system means there's still plenty of life left after the 10-or-so hour campaign draws to a close. Death from above: Enemies come at you thick and fast making firefights exciting. But by the end of the campaign you would have had your fill . There's no denying that Judgment is a good third-person shooter, and, if released a few years back it would be one of the greatest. But gamers' demands have caused the third-person genre to evolve - with many wanting more than just gunning down enemies, walking to another room and doing the same over and over again. The game has changed and Gears are beginning to grind. Gears of War: Judgment is out now in the US and released on March 22 in Europe. WATCH THE LATEST TRAILER HERE: .

Reimagining a 16 year-old gaming icon like Lara Croft really is a once in a lifetime challenge. 2. With the industry evolving, how have demands on writers changed over the years? Rhianna: When I first got into the industry 15 years ago as a games journalist, no one was really talking about games writing. It was still being done behind the scenes, but it wasn't getting much focus or attention, either from the press or developers/publishers themselves. Call for action: Pratchett wants to see more female faces in games and the industry as a whole . Nor was the industry really embracing professional writers as standard. In the years that followed the industry did start to remedy this and get more experienced writers onboard. Unfortunately, it was often very late in the development process, when all they could be was something akin to a narrative paramedic. These days it's got better, but the industry is still trying to work out how to incorporate writers and narrative designers into the development process and establish the best working practices. However, this is a two-way street and therefore more writers need to learn about the unique challenges and limitations that exist in writing for games. They also need to really understand the benefits of utilising the entirety of a game to express the narrative, not just traditional cinematic methods. 3. What is your favourite thing about Lara Croft? Does the industry need more female stars? Rhianna: I like the fact that alongside the bad-a**ery, she's an intelligent, archaeology nerd with a real understanding how our history shapes us. Yes, the industry does need more female protagonists, but it is also in dire need of more protagonists who fall outside the whitey-mcstubbly format. The industry has become far too reliant on male, white, straight, mid-20s, gravelly voiced, short hair and stubble covered heroes. We need to develop much greater diversity across the board when it comes to gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation and ability. 4. What inspired you when writing Tomb Raider? Rhianna: Researching the period and the mythology we draw upon was fascinating. We also looked towards real world tales of survival (such as Aron Ralston's story and the Andes survivors) for inspiration. This really is a story about the enduring nature of the human spirit and will to survive. 5. Any games you’ve been signed up to work on in the future? Rhianna: Yes. But nothing I can talk about yet. Sorry! At what time does your writing come in at the time of game development? Rhianna: This really depends on what kind of game is being developed, how important narrative is to the experience and whether the team behind it are used to working with writers. Writers are not normally involved at the start of the process (which is generally focused on design and gameplay mechanics) but come in later to work on story structure, character development and script. Built from the ground up: Lara is still recognisable however there have been some drastic changes in both her appearance and personality . This can be anywhere from one to two years into a three to four year production cycle. Ideally writers and narrative designers should be included much earlier in the process, where they can be of most benefit. However, although the industry is slowly getting used to fitting narrative professionals into games development, we’re still going through a bit of a ‘square-peg in a round hole’ phase. What was the hardest aspect of re-writing a character as popular as Lara and did you consult with fans at all? Rhianna: I didn’t come into the process until about a year into development, so I’m not sure what happened in the early stages. However, I know that Crystal did feel obligated to innovate and refresh the franchise for their fans, and not just repeat what had been done before. Certainly depicting Lara at a time when she didn’t have the guns, gadgets and knowhow to easily get herself out of every situation, was quite risky. Fans aren’t used to seeing Lara like that. In fact we’re not used to seeing any videogames character express sentiments like fear, uncertainty or remorse. However, when you’re dealing with a character’s origin story, you need to show where they’ve came from and not just where they finished up. We wanted players to experience that evolution for themselves. Were you a massive fan of the early games yourself? Rhianna: I played and enjoyed the first game and a little of the second. The launch of Tomb Raider III was actually my first experience of the games industry. But somewhere down the line I lost interest in the franchise. I felt that the sex-symbol nature of Lara became overplayed by the wider media and that had somewhat obscured the games themselves. What influence did your Dad have on your love of gaming? Rhianna: Dad really kick-started it. He was always into electronics, computers and robotics and introduced me to my first game - Mazogs on the Sinclair ZX81. I was hooked! We would often play games together – he would play the game and I would sit beside him, with a pencil and graph paper, drawing the maps and guiding him. Is there a part of the game you are particularly proud of? Rhianna: I’m glad that we got to show a different side of a character that everyone thought they knew. One of the things that I love about the game, which has absolutely nothing to do with me, is the concept art, including the box art for the game – it’s beautiful, but not sexualised, strong, but also characterful. It really typifies the direction we’re taking Lara. Alone and stranded: Tomb Raider explores Lara Croft's origins and has received wide-spread critical acclaim . 6. How is Little Miss Geek helping girls be inspired to have a career in games design? Rhianna: A lot of young girls don't realise how diverse the career opportunities are in games development. Many think that you need elite math skills and a vast knowledge of all things tech to work in games, and haven't thought about avenues like design, producing, art, writing or composing. Initiatives such as the ones started by Little Miss Geek are essential for getting young girls engaged and excited about games design, narrative design and coding. Giving them hands-on experiences with level editors and watching them create and build levels for themselves is very rewarding. Their faces light up. Suddenly they've discovered a whole new world that's out there for the taking. It's empowering for them. Little Miss Geek wants to inspire the next generation of young girls to become tech pioneers and to cause nationwide change from the ground up. For more information visit: www.littlemissgeek.org.

"A team of exterminators have been called into a school to fumigate classrooms which have been infested by Britain's most venomous spider. Dean Academy in Lydney, Gloucestershire was forced to close its doors after reports of 'rapidly multiplying' false widow spiders in the school. All 905 pupils and the entire staff at school were given the day off as the white-suited team entered the building with the job of killing off the dangerous arachnids. Men for the job: White suited experts were called in to rid the Dean Academy of its false widow infestation . Ready to exterminate: The pest controllers brought with them bottles of solution as they prepared to fumigate sections of the school . They worked through the night and into this morning in a bid to eradicate the outbreak. The spiders, which have a nasty bite, had been found in the computer block and other buildings at the school. Dozens of people have been injured as the spiders spread across the country with symptoms including severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers. School Vice Principal Craig Burns said no pupils had been bitten by the spiders but health and safety officials had recommended the closure for the day. Venomous: The spiders were said to be 'rapidly multiplying' at the Gloucester school . With the building empty, extermination teams fumigated areas of the school where sightings of the spiders had been reported. The decision to close was backed by parents yesterday, although some voice concerns about the chemicals used in the extermination. Carer Julia Mullan, mother of 15 year-old pupil Connor, said: 'I’m happy that they’ve closed the school for the day as it shows that they are looking out for the kids safety. 'One thing I am worried about though is the chemical residue that will be left behind.' Another mother, Trudi Shattock, 40, also voiced concern about the chemical residue that could be left behind. Mrs Shattock, who works at an opticians, said: 'I think it should be closed for the rest of the week because I’m worried about what the left over chemicals might do to the children. 'It’s half term next week so I don’t see why they don’t just call it an early finish and sort the problem out. 'They’ve definitely done the right thing to close the school - I’d be worried about the children’s safety if they left the spiders there. Mr Burns said the decision had been taken in the best interests of the students’ health and safety - and stressed that there had been no reports of anyone being bitten by spiders. In a letter, he wrote: 'We identified an issue with ‘false widow’ spiders in the academy in our ICT block yesterday afternoon and therefore took immediate advice from pest control. 'We therefore made the decision to close the ICT block for the whole of today so that pest control could fumigate the area. Concerned: Vice Principal Craig Burns told parents in a letter that there were more spiders than expected . Deserted: The school playground is empty after the false widow infestation caused staff to close the building . 'Unfortunately, there have been further ‘false widow’ spiders identified in other areas of the academy. 'We have taken advice from the health and safety unit at Gloucestershire Local Authority and C&D Pest Control, Chepstow, and have taken the decision to close the academy all day on October 23. 'This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone’s health and safety. 'The health and safety unit and pest control feel that we have dealt with the matter quickly and efficiently and taken appropriate early action. 'There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the ‘false widow’ spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice. 'Any pre-planned meetings, sports fixtures or extra-curricular activities will not take place. The academy will be open as normal on October 24. 'Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience this may cause you but I’m sure you will understand that this is in the best interest of students’ health and safety.' The false widow is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Mr Catlin, 66, pictured here holding an image . of his injury and a jar containing a spider, was bitten on the toe by . the spider while making a bonfire at his home in Bromley, Kent, last . year . The species was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879. Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them. Nasty wound: Venom can cause severe issue damage can cause death to those allergic to it - although there has not been a recorded UK death . The . false black widow, which is said to be spreading further north due to . warmer weather, has the worst bite of any spider in the UK. There have been a spate of bites reported across the country in the past few weeks. Amateur Devon footballer Steve Harris, for instance, had to undergo emergency surgery after a bite on his leg last week. The spider is a cousin of the black widow and is about the size of a 50p piece. It delivers venom that can kill those who are allergic to it. It first came to the UK more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands. The . Natural History Museum’s Insect Information Service hears of about ten . cases of spider bites each year, although no one in the UK has ever died . as a result of one. The . distribution of the false widow spider is expected to increase . northwards in the UK due, at least partly, to mild summers in recent . years.","Dean Academy in Gloucestershire found venomous spiders in ICT building .

"Stuart Lancaster backed Alex Goode to fill Mike Brown’s shoes in Dublin as England look to take the next step towards a Grand Slam against Ireland. The Saracens full back was named in Lancaster’s starting line-up for Sunday’s clash after Brown pulled out with concussion suffered against Italy while Jack Nowell was also name on the left wing in place of Jonny May. ‘There’s no doubt we’ll miss Mike,’ Lancaster said. ‘He’s been an integral part of the team and his work under the high ball is exceptional. The energy he brings and his defence are excellent and his kicking game has been a big plus for us game in this Six Nations.

It will be the Exeter Chiefs star's (centre) first cap since making his five previous Test appearances during last year's Six Nations . Nowell will be joined in the backs by Saracens full back Alex Goode for the trip to the Aviva Stadium . Goode slots in after Mike Brown was ruled out with the concussion he sustained against Italy . England captain Chris Robshaw runs with the ball during the session at Pennyhill Park . England head coach Stuart Lancaster (centre right) has praised the form of both Nowell and Goode . ‘But Alex Goode is a more than able replacement. He’s been in excellent form for Saracens. He played in this game two years ago and he brings a lot to the party.’ Nowell’s return for his sixth cap has been widely expected after May struggled in England’s opening wins over Wales and Italy. The Gloucester winger scored one of the finest tries seen at Twickenham against New Zealand in November, but he wasted a three-on-one overlap against Italy and his defence has long been a source of concern. ‘Jack rarely makes an error and is good under the high ball,’ Lancaster said. ‘His consistency edged him over Jonny in this game.

'They have nine British Lions in their starting 15, so they're full of high-quality players and obviously well-coached,' Lancaster continued in an interview with Sky Sports. 'You can see that by the way their maul's put together, their defensive system, their attacking threats, their kicking game. 'When you've got that club-country cohesion as well, the Leinster connection that Joe [Schmidt] has,  with Johnny Sexton, I think that's part of it as well. They're a very good team, and playing great rugby at the moment. 'It's a big game for both teams. We've had a great two weeks preparation, it's a settled team, and we've built on the back of the Italy game and the Wales game, and away from home third game in, it's a big challenge. We've got two home games to come, but we'll look forward to this one first.' Brown was immediately treated by the England medical staff before being carried off on a stretcher .

"A failing NHS hospital has won a major health award just two years after it was rescued by a private firm. Hinchingbrooke had been described as a ‘basket case’ for running up debts of £40million while letting standards plummet. But, in an extraordinary turnaround, it has been voted top in the country for patient care. Scroll down for video . Hinchingbrooke had been described as a ¿basket case¿ for running up debts of £40million while letting standards plummet . Areas assessed included mortality levels, readmission rates and speed in dealing with cancer cases. The Cambridgeshire hospital, which is run by Circle, expects to break even this year and produce a small surplus in 2015. Its success is a blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband who last week claimed the NHS was going backwards thanks to private sector involvement. Julie Bailey, the founder of Cure the NHS who helped expose the Mid Staffordshire neglect scandal, said: ‘What this shows is the potential of allowing those on the frontline to lead, as Circle do. ‘The potential is there within the NHS – the majority of people wouldn’t care who provides their services as long as it was safe.’ Hinchingbrooke, which is in Huntingdon and serves 160,000 patients, was described as a ‘financial and clinical basket case’ by then health minister Earl Howe in November 2011. The Cambridgeshire hospital, which is run by Circle, expects to break even this year and produce a small surplus in 2015 . The Royal College of Surgeons branded the 369-bed hospital ‘dysfunctional’. It was among the lowest ranking trusts in the region for patient satisfaction. Waiting time in accident and emergency regularly exceeded four hours and every target for suspected cancer patients to be seen within a fortnight had been missed since June 2010. Circle took over in February 2012 – the first private contract for an NHS hospital – on a ten-year deal and quickly saw results. It topped a ranking of 46 trusts in the Midlands and East Anglia for A&E waiting times, with 98.2 per cent of patients seen within the required window. It was fifth for referrals for cancer tests. Its success is a blow to Labour leader Ed Miliband who last week claimed the NHS was going backwards thanks to private sector involvement . A key to the transformation was loosening the grip of managers and accountants. The majority of the 15 board members are now clinicians. Doctors, nurses and admin staff have also been put into small groups which have representatives who meet senior managers twice a month to flag up problems. Nurses can recommend that consultants adjust the way they work. Patients are asked for feedback and any problems must be dealt with within three weeks. Circle’s John Lewis-style blueprint could be adopted at other failing hospitals, although insiders believe no decision will be taken until after the general election. Circle reduced the annual £10million deficit to £3.5million in its first year – and made up the difference with its own money. This dropped to £1million last year and the trust, whose chief executive Steve Melton is a former Argos supply chain director, expects to break even this year before moving into the black in 2015. A spokesman said: ‘The biggest chunk of the savings was from improving quality. Bad quality care exposes you to lots more litigation for mistakes. Patients also stay longer than necessary or have to come back for further treatment. Locum costs have also dropped. There is a 50 per cent premium for temporary staff and the hospital had problems with recruiting as people didn’t want to work there.’ Private firms already own and run limited units for the NHS. Circle operates day-surgery units in Nottingham where routine operations including hip and knee replacements are carried out – but the wholesale takeover of a hospital had never been approved previously. Huntingdon Conservative MP Jonathan Djanogly said: ‘Before this contract was in place there was an annual deep breath about what was going to happen and whether the hospital was going to survive.‘Now there’s a future for the hospital and we know through the security of the contract that they can operate for a certain period. I don’t know where that leaves Ed Miliband.’ Hinchingbrooke was the only small hospital on a CHKS Group quality care awards shortlist of five on Tuesday. The 12 indicators looked at by an expert panel also included rates of emergency readmission, discharge within 56 days of emergency admission for strokes and discharge within 28 days for hip fractures. Mr Melton said: ‘Two years ago, Hinchingbrooke suffered from a series of problems so severe it faced imminent closure. Now, thanks to the incredible efforts of our leading doctors and nurses, we are the top-ranking hospital for quality of care in the whole of England. ‘It is clear proof the growing number of hospitals in special measures across the NHS can be transformed too, staying open to deliver the critical services their patients need.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Patients should get the best possible care, regardless of who provides it.’ Looked after: Phil Martin at the hospital . Living only a short distance from Hinchingbrooke Hospital, Phil Martin had heard plenty of ‘horror stories’ from other patients. But after seven major operations in the space of a few weeks, his own experience couldn’t be more different. The grandfather-of-two said his treatment had been ‘spectacular’ since he was admitted with septicaemia caused by a cyst. ‘It’s been absolutely first class. I couldn’t have asked for more,’ said the 61-year-old from Eaton Socon, near St Neots. ‘The first time I came in as an emergency walk-in they apologised and said it would be 90 minutes. When I was in intensive care … I had two nurses looking after me full-time. ‘Now I’m on a general ward I am with five other people and we are well looked after. I am always kept in the picture and staff are very reactive.’ The father-of-four, a widower who is chairman of a purchasing consortium, was in acute pain when he was admitted five weeks ago and underwent several procedures to save his life. He spent nine days in an induced coma and was moved to a general ward last week. Speaking from his hospital bed yesterday, he added: ‘I haven’t experienced any of these horror stories. Yesterday I was bored out of my skull so I started drafting a couple of letters about people who deserve to be commended.’ The hospital also received glowing reviews from Lilian Carris. She had ‘hated’ her first stay at the hospital in 1999 and when she was put on to a mixed-sex ward with seven other patients. But the 65-year-old was overwhelmed by the remarkable turnaround at the hospital when she was readmitted earlier this year. Mrs Carris said the exceptional level of care was so good that many older patients ‘did not want to leave’. After being admitted in February following a severe asthma attack, the mother-of-one said she ‘couldn’t believe’ the number of nurses and doctors constantly on hand to provide assistance. ‘They weren’t there just to care. They were investigating all the possibilities of what was wrong with me,’ she said. She said the standards at the hospital are ‘so much better’ than when she had her appendix removed there 15 years ago – and said even the food is ‘excellent’, with patients offered five choices for each course and allowed to order 24 hours in advance. Relatives are not limited to strict visiting times, common at many NHS hospitals, and are allowed to see patients when they wish.","Hinchingbrooke ran up debts of £40million while letting standards plummet .
