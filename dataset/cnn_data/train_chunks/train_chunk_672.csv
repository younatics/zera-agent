A hilarious sky snap of a cloud in the shape of a running man has gone down a storm with enthusiasts. The picture was voted one of Britain's 2013 clouds of the summer after it was spotted making a dash across the sky in May this year. The uncanny cumulus, which only lasted a matter of seconds was captured 'running' over John o'Groats. Linford Misty: The uncanny cloud formation was spotted by photographer Phil Holmes, 64, 'running' across the skies of John o'Groats . The striking formation was spotted by snapper Phil Holmes, who was standing on . top of Duncansby Head, Caithness, Scotland at the time. The . cloud became popular among pareidolia enthusiasts after Phil uploaded . his picture to a website called the Cloud Appreciation Society. It went on to be voted Britain's Cloud of the Summer despite it being the amateur's first sky photo. The 64-year-old had been out walking . with his wife on Duncansby Stacks when he spotted the hilarious . formation and whipped out his camera. Phil, of Newark, Nottinhamshire, said: 'I can't remember ever taking a picture of a cloud before so probably my first. First place: The picture was voted Britain's Cloud of the Summer 2013 by a group of enthusiasts at the Cloud Appreciation Society . 'It looked as if someone had painted the image of the running man onto the sky. 'It was very clear and very striking. I instinctively lifted the camera and with gloves on managed to take two shots before the cloud image then faded from our line of sight. 'It lasted only a few seconds so I was very lucky to be able to capture it. The gloves and being rocked by the wind didn't help. 'Initially, the image resembled Father Christmas, wading through the snow with his sack on his back, this then quickly progressed into the running man before then breaking down. 'With the cloud directly overhead John o' Groats it was as if Mother Nature was signalling her appreciation of all those thousands of runners who had set off on their marathon runs to Lands' End.' When Phil returned home excitedly he uploaded the picture to the Cloud Appreciation Society and shared the image. Uncanny: A cloud shaped like Africa, with the . northern peak of Tunisia, the curve of west Africa and the distinct Horn . of Africa all clearly visible was spotted in Brockwell Park, Lonon, this summer . Cloud atlas: A walker captured this incredible photo of two clouds shaped like the British Isles over the Isle of Man . His lucky snap was hailed by cloud spotters, who affectionately labelled it 'Braveheart'. The cloud runner is the latest in a series of strange sightings in our skies caused by funny shaped clouds. The phenomenon of seeing recogniseable shapes in everyday or inanimate objects is known as 'pareidolia'. It is not just limited to clouds, faces in frying pans, deities on doorhandles and animals made from tree branches all fall into the same category of illusion. Other examples of cloud pareidolia which have been spotted this summer are cumulus clouds which looked like the British Isles and the African continent, and a dolphin like figure which was spotted 'diving' over the M11 in Essex.

Huge 250 metre high ice channels have been found beneath the Antarctic which could be speeding up melting of the ice shelf. The channels are almost as tall as the Eiffel Tower and are thought to stretch hundreds of kilometres along the ice shelf. Scientists believe they have implications for ice-shelf stability around them but added that the long-term implications for the ice sheet are still unknown. Huge 250 metre high ice channels have been found beneath the Antarctic which could be speeding up melting of the ice shelf. The finding was made using the British Antarctic Survey's Twin Otter survey plane (pictured) which collected data about the size of the sub-ice-shelf channel . The British researchers used satellite images and airborne radar measurements to reveal the channels under the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in West Antarctica. The channels can be seen on the surface of the ice shelf, as well as underneath, because the ice floats at a different height depending on its thickness. 'The biggest challenge was the lack of field data that is available to investigate the nature of the channels, we can observe them from above in the satellite imagery, but have little direct observations from radar,' Dr Anne Le Brocq from the University of Exeter, told MailOnline. Using what data they had, the researchers were able to predict the path of meltwater flowing under parts of the ice which were in contact with the land. The ice shelf channel is clearly visible on the MODIS Mosaic of Antarctica image map. The predicted flow route of water beneath the grounded ice sheet aligns with the initiation of the ice shelf channel. The dashed line marks the point at which the ice starts to float . They discovered that these channels . lined up with areas where similar flows of water are thought to exist . under the ice shelf at the point where the ice starts to float. According to the researchers, the match-up indicates that the water flow beneath the grounded ice sheet is responsible for the formation of the channels beneath the floating ice shelf. 'It was a bit of a “Eureka moment” when I found the predicted water flow routes lined up with the channels,' said Dr Le Brocq. 'They provide us with a very useful way of investigating an otherwise fairly inaccessible environment.' When the meltwater flowing under the ice sheet enters the ocean beneath, it causes a plume of ocean water to form, which then melts out the vast channels under the ice shelf. Previously, it was thought that water flowed in a thin layer beneath the ice sheet, but the evidence from this study suggests it flows in a more focused manner, much like rivers. The way in which water flows beneath the ice sheet strongly influences the speed of ice flow. Schematic diagram shows the approximate scale of one of the ice shelf channels, similar in height to the Eiffel Tower, and Tower Bridge in width. Scientists believe the channels are weakening areas of ice immediately around them . Vast channels such as this have been . observed elsewhere, but their formation has been credited to purely . oceanic processes rather than meltwater flowing out of the grounded ice . sheet. 'Unlike in Greenland where meltwater is produced at the surface, this meltwater is generated beneath the ice sheet so there isn’t a direct link to climate change,' said Dr Le Brocq. 'However, in order to make predictions about how the ice sheet will respond to environmental change in the future, we need to understand the mechanisms by which ice flows and how it interacts with the ocean.' Dr Le Brocq said she now hopes to carry out more field investigations into the channels using radar measurements, and will further investigate the formation of the plumes using a computer model. The project, which was reported in the . journal Nature GeoScience, involved the University of Exeter, Newcastle . University, the University of Bristol, the University of Edinburgh, the . British Antarctic Survey and the University of York.","Satellite and radar data found the streams beneath Filchner-Ronne ice shelf .

The Masterson sisters know what it is to have a fight on their hands - six of the seven women have been diagnosed with breast cancer in their early fifties with one sibling dying from the disease last year. But the tragic circumstances have rallied the close group to live life to the fullest and focus on fundraising for others battling the disease. The Mastersons, who were raised in southern California, were diagnosed with breast cancer in their early fifties. Only the youngest sister Marianne, 49, has not been diagnosed with the disease. (From left) Sisters Nancy Usher, Marianne Masterson, Sue Kerby, Fran Dyer, Sheila Presto, Kathy Dunham and Linda Barron. All have suffered breast cancer except Ms Masterson . However rather than wait for a potentially devastating diagnosis, Marianne has been the driving force behind a fundraising team for breast cancer research. For the past four years, the family and their supportive friends have taken part in the Susan G. Komen three-day walk, raising more than $90,000 for breast cancer research. This year's 60-mile hike will take place in San Diego from November 15 - 17. Ms Masterson told U-T San Diego: 'The walk is tough. But it’s way better than chemo.' The seven sisters are among 11 children, all born within 16 years of each other. The family have no history of breast cancer in the older generations with mothers and grandmothers living into their nineties. The first to be diagnosed was . second-eldest sister Kathy Dunham who was told 14 years ago that she was . suffering from early-stage carcinoma at the age of 52. Marianne Masterson is leading the three-day walk to raise funds for breast cancer research. The family's efforts have already topped $90,000 in donations . Two years later, her sister Fran Dyer was diagnosed when she was 54 years old. Sisters Nancy Usher, Sheila Presto, Linda Barron and Sue Kerby were all diagnosed between the ages of 52 and 54 over the next ten years. Ms Masterson said the multiple diagnoses had the family 'freaking out'. The terrible health news did have a small silver lining - it led to each sister taking charge of her life and living exactly how she wanted immediately, now that the future was so uncertain. Fran Dyer and her husband moved to the beach where they had wanted to retire sooner than planned. Linda Barron retired eight years early and moved to Oregon. Ms Masterson was told by a doctor at a gene-testing clinic several years ago that it was not a matter of if she would get cancer but 'when'. The sisters have taken part in the fundraising walk for the past four years and this year will walk in honor of their sister Sheila who died just before Christmas last year . She now takes a cancer-reducing drug called Tamoxifin, lost weight and overhauled her diet. She is yet to take the step of a double mastectomy but is considering the option. Ms Masterson decided to pour her energy into fundraising when her sister Sheila's cancer returned in 2009 after she was given the all-clear seven years before. This time, the disease spread and after fighting for almost four years, Sheila passed away just before Christmas last year on December 18. Ms Masterson and her partner of 17 years Cathy Orchard launched Team Stride in 2010. Each year, there is always someone walking to represent each Masterson sister with cancer. Sheila's daughter and son-in-law will be walking in her honor this year. Ms Masterson said that the fundraising experience has been life-changing for the sisters. Despite all that they have endured, she told U-T San Diego: 'Three-Day is not a sad day, it’s a . celebration.'

Plastic pollution is not just confined to the world’s oceans, it is threatening life some of the world’s most beautiful lakes too, scientists warn. Although many lakes in the Alps might look pristine, beneath the surface there are billions of tiny particles which have broken down from plastic bottles, wrappings and other rubbish that are slowly entering the food chain. Researchers have found Italy’s Lake Garda - a popular holiday destination for families and those keen on water sports such as windsurfing - is contaminated with potentially hazardous tiny microplastics. Many sub-alpine lakes might look pristine, but new evidence suggests they may also be contaminated with potentially hazardous plastics. Pictured are some samples of plastic waste and microplastics found in Lake Garda in Italy . Scientists from the University of Bayreuth in Germany believe the microplastics could be getting into food chain through a wide range of freshwater invertebrates. Over the past 60 years plastic has become central to everyday life but the planet has been subjected to a huge quality of non-biodegradable waste, much of which ends up floating in the world’s oceans. Scientists expected the sub-alpine lakes to be free from plastic pollution but the findings suggest all inland waterways could be contaminated. Past research has shown fish, birds . and mammals are ingesting plastic particles which are retained within . their digestive system, slowly releasing chemicals into their bodies. Other . research showed the plastic surface of these particles is adsorbing . chemicals from the surrounding water an concentrating them - making them . even more harmful. Scientists expected the sub-alpine lakes to be free from plastic pollution but the findings suggest all inland waterways could be contaminated. Popular holiday destination, Lake Garda is pictured . The persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have been linked with numerous health conditions such as low sperm count, infant development, weakened immune systems and genetic defects. The plastics also allow alien species to invade other environments threatening biodiversity. Christian Laforsch of the University of Bayreuth in Germany said: 'Next to mechanical impairments of swallowed plastics mistaken as food, many plastic-associated chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic, endocrine-disrupting, or acutely toxic. Past research has shown fish, birds and mammals are ingesting plastic particles which are retained within their digestive system, slowly releasing chemicals into their bodies. The study showed freshwater invertebrates (a crustacean is pictured)will ingest artificially ground fluorescent microplastics in the lab . 'Moreover, the polymers can adsorb toxic hydrophobic organic pollutants and transport these compounds to otherwise less polluted habitats.' 'Along this line, plastic debris can act as vector for alien species and diseases.' The researchers chose Lake Garda as a starting point for investigating freshwater contamination with micro plastics and normal plastic waste, because they expected it to be less polluted given its sub-alpine location. What they found surprised them because the numbers of microplastic particles in sediment samples from Lake Garda were similar to those found in studies of marine beach sediments. The size ranges of microplastics found suggested that they might find their way into organisms living in the lake. Christian Laforsch said many plastic-associated chemicals have been shown to be carcinogenic or acutely toxic. Pictured are scanning electron microscope images of degraded plastic particles showing examples of surface textures on sampled plastic particles . The study, published in Current Biology, showed that freshwater invertebrates from worms to water fleas will ingest artificially ground fluorescent microplastics in the lab. And the findings in Lake Garda come as bad news for lakes generally, with uncertain ecological and economic consequences. Dr Laforsch said: 'The mere existence of microplastic particles in a sub-alpine headwater suggests an even higher relevance of plastic particles in lowland waters.' While he admitted that more research is needed, he called for standardised surveillance guidelines to control microplastic contamination in freshwater ecosystems, which are already required for marine systems.","Scientists from the University of Bayreuth in Germany believe the microplastics could be getting into food chain via freshwater invertebrates .

Several Tory MPs are planning to run on ‘joint tickets’ with the UK Independence Party at the next general election, it emerged last night. A handful of MPs were said to be considering a ‘Unite the Right’ campaign to prevent Labour capitalising on a split vote following a surge in support for Nigel Farage’s party. The sitting Tory MP would stand as a Tory-Ukip candidate. In return for its support, Ukip would expect to be able to influence Conservative Party policy. Banned: UKIP leader Nigel Farage to due to appear at three events at the Tory party conference, but has been erased from the official guide . Nadine Dorries MP was the first to . float the idea earlier this year, saying she would be ‘having that kind . of conversation’ with activists in her constituency and that many . Conservatives have ‘huge empathy’ with Ukip. Eight . Tory-held seats are said to be at high risk of being lost because of . Ukip splitting the traditional Tory vote and letting in either Labour or . the Lib Dems. The proposal . comes as the latest YouGov poll shows that Labour has surged ahead, . mainly at the expense of the Conservatives who are losing voters to . Ukip. The poll puts Labour on 42 per cent, the Tories on 31 per cent, . Ukip on 13 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent. Rejection: Foreign Secretary William Hague ruled out the idea of a pact with UKIP to prevent the loss of Tory votes . David Cameron pledged yesterday to remove all commitments to ‘ever-closer union’ from EU treaties. In a hardening of his stance, the Prime Minister said he wanted to go as far as erasing the EU’s original mission statement, which commits nations to closer integration. He said: ‘Others can sign up to an ever-closer union, but Britain should not. I’m determined to make sure we get out of that.’ Speaking at the Tory Party conference, Foreign Secretary William Hague also told delegates that more countries were coming round to Britain’s view that powers should be returned to individual countries. Miss . Dorries said yesterday: ‘I know other MPs in marginal constituencies . are in talks about entering into agreements. It’s going to be very . difficult in the general election when you’ve got two candidates . espousing the same sort of values. ‘We’ll . have a Conservative candidate calling for a referendum, being strong on . crime, immigration and grammar schools, and the Ukip candidate saying . much the same sort of things. So there’s a case for running on a joint . ticket.’ Conservative . Central Office yesterday stamped on the claims, saying joint tickets . would not be allowed and any MP who tried would not have their . nomination papers signed. But . it comes as a hard-hitting report out yesterday by The Bow Group, a . Right-wing think tank, warned that Tory Party membership is ‘dying’ and . could be overtaken by Ukip in just five years’ time. Among . its recommendations to reverse the trend are a pact with Ukip, . initiatives to attract younger members online, and for candidates to be . selected without interference from the party’s central command. Yesterday, a Cabinet minister said that core Tory voters ‘must be made aware that if they vote Ukip they could get Miliband’. And . Mark Garnier, Tory MP for Wyre Forest, a marginal seat which could be . lost to Ukip, said: ‘The right thing for an honest politician to do is . stand on a manifesto he or she truly believes in. The wrong thing to do . is run scared and sign up to a set of someone else’s beliefs just for . personal, short-term electoral gain.’ Banned: David Cameron has revealed women could be prohibited from wearing Muslim veils in courts . The Muslim veil could be banned in courts, schools and immigration centres, David Cameron signalled yesterday. The Prime Minister said he was ‘happy’ to look at whether the Government should issue national guidelines to limit the use of full-face veils. He insisted there was no question of legislation to prevent Muslim women wearing the niqab veil completely, but voiced strong support for the right of judges, juries, teachers and immigration officers who demand that they are removed. Mr Cameron also suggested patients being treated in hospitals should have a right to see the face of any doctor or nurse treating them. The Prime Minister told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: ‘We are a free country and people should be free to wear whatever clothes they like in public or in private. But we should support those institutions that need to put in place rules so that those institutions can work properly. ‘So for instance in a school, if they want that particular dress code, I believe the Government should back them. The same for courts, the same for immigration. ‘We should back those institutions that want to have sensible policies that actually have a particular purpose.’ Earlier this month a judge in London ordered a Muslim defendant to remove her veil to give evidence. Judge Peter Murphy said it was crucial for the jury to see the woman’s face so they could assess her demeanour and expression. But, in a case that made legal history, he said she could retain the veil for all other parts of her trial. And he asked politicians for clearer instructions on veils in court. Asked if he would support calls for national guidelines on the wearing of the niqab in court, Mr . Cameron said: ‘I’m very happy to look at that. ‘Obviously, in court the jury needs to be able to look at someone’s face. I’ve sat on a jury, that’s part of what you do. ‘When someone is coming into the country, an immigration officer needs to see someone’s face. ‘In a school, it’s very difficult to teach unless you can look your pupils in the eye.’ The issue of veils in schools erupted earlier this month when students, staff and visitors to . Birmingham Metropolitan College were told they must have their faces visible at all times so they are ‘easily identifiable’. Following an outcry, the college reversed the decision.","One in five Tory councillors want an electoral pact with UKIP .

Support: A team of U.S. soldiers in Kuwait show their support by holding a sign reading: 'Kali's crew' Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their noses. The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years. Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by keeping their heads above water; using nose clips or holding the nose shut when the head is submerged; avoid stirring up sediment in shallow areas. It can then travel to the brain, causing a devastating infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM. That's what Kali has been battling. Initial symptoms usually start within one to seven days and may include headache, fever, nausea and vomiting. The disease progresses rapidly, and other symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations. Moreover, the infection destroys brain tissue and can cause brain swelling and death. Doctors say Kali's success is due in large part to experimental treatment and early detection and diagnosis. Traci Hardig brought Kali to Arkansas Children's Hospital with a nasty fever on July 19 - and doctors have credited this fast thinking with her daughter's miraculous recovery. Doctors cooled Kali's body down to try to reduce the swelling, and they won clearance to treat her with a breast-cancer drug. Now, tests show no sign of the parasite in her system. 'It's . still a concern that she could certainly have some deficits long-term . and not function entirely as she would have if this had never happened,' one of her doctors, Dr. Vikki Stefans, said.

It the fourth time an American Airlines flight has been forced into an unscheduled landing in three weeks . The plane was then taken away for maintenance. The close call comes just five days after a second AA plane from O'Hare had to make an emergency landing when a pilot became ill. It had been in the air for about an hour en route to Dallas, Texas, when it was forced to land at St Louis airport. The first officer was taken to hospital, Fox Chicago reported, and the plane continued with a new cockpit crew. Last month, a Boeing 757 carrying 172 people made an emergency landing after smoke was reported in the cockpit. The plane was flying from San Jose, Costa Rica, to Miami, Florida, when it was forced to stop at Colombia's San Andres Island. Three days earlier, on September 17, engine trouble also grounded an AA flight at Indianapolis International Airport. None of the 142 passengers on board were reported injured and later continued on their journey to Dallas, Texas. The four emergency landings are not believed to be related.

The family of a Rhode Island seventh-grader who was suspended for three days for having a small toy gun keychain at school are appealing the suspension. The family of 12-year-old Joseph Lyssikatos is asking the superintendent in the town of Coventry to reconsider the penalty. Joseph was suspended last month after bringing a 2-inch keychain he won at an arcade to Alan Shawn Feinstein Middle School. The school has a zero tolerance policy for guns and replicas . Scroll down for video... Joseph Lyssikatos: The seventh grader is hoping his school record will be expunged in order to maintain 100% attendance for this year . Suspended: A seventh-grader from Rhode Island was suspended after bringing this gun-shaped key chain to school . Another student found the toy after it fell out of Joseph's backpack and began showing it off to classmates. Joseph was immediately suspended. Although he has already served the suspension, his parents hope to get the black mark expunged from his record so Joseph can try for a perfect attendance this year. The boy's stepmother Bonnie Bonanno wasn't happy: 'I think it’s extremely excessive,' she said. 'He’s a 12-year-old child, being a 12-year-old child. He’s a boy! It was not meant to cause any problems. It was a keychain that he had in his backpack and it fell out of his backpack on accident.' 'I think it’s way to excessive,' she continued. 'Especially for being a one-and-a-half inch keychain.' Reconsider: The family plans to appeal a suspension given to the 12-year-old boy and hope the incident will be expunged from his record so he can keep his perfect attendance streak intact . Their meeting with the superintendent will take place this lunchtime. 'I told him last year that perfect attendance and non-lateness is a great character trait,' Keith Bonanno, Joseph's father said. 'And everyone's looking for that and he was upset to not have that.''It means a lot because my perfect attendance will help me in the future for my job and for my colleges,' said Joseph. Even if the family succeed in getting Joseph's record wiped clean, he has been told that he is banned from  attending a field trip to Salem with his classmates later this month.","Gun keychain fell out the student’s backpack at a Rhode Island middle school .

A drug squad uncovered an underground cannabis cave when they raided a remote ten acre farm run by a retired company director. Trevor Winterbottom, 68, had been secretly growing the drug at his luxury £500,000 suburban home. But when his crop grew so large he ran out of room and dug a giant hole underneath an outbuilding at an isolated farm he owned three miles away to house his plants. Quite a crop: Trevor Winterbottom cultivated cannabis in an underground home-made basement hidden within his 10 acre property . The ceiling was held up with crude building supports and officers discovered 200 mature plants being grown . Police found the underground farm during Britain’s big freeze last January after being tipped off. They spotted a trail of footprints in the snow leading to the outbuilding, to find the basement had been excavated beneath the building and was only accessible by a homemade hatch using of ladders that were nailed to hardboard. The ceiling was held up with building supports and officers discovered 200 mature plants being grown. Electricity that was being used to power lights above the plants was being abstracted from elsewhere. A number of other cannabis plants were also recovered from inside the address.

Winterbottom snr, who used to run a property company, and his businessman son, Trevor jnr, 31, were both caught in one of the outbuildings in Hyde, Greater Manchester. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Winterbottom snr of Stalybridge, admitted producing cannabis and also admitted abstracting electricity. He was jailed for 45 months at Manchester Crown Court. Winterbottom jnr was given a community order for 12 months and ordered to do 240 hours unpaid work after admitting producing cannabis.

A neolithic bow and arrows that could have been used to hunt reindeer thousands of years ago, have been discovered in a patch of melting snow, archaeologists said. The ancient artefacts, the oldest of which is approximately 5,400-years-old, were found in the mountains of Norway. The scientists who came across them, believe the discovery demonstrates the worrying effects of climate change, as precious finds are being exposed. A neolithic bow and arrows that could have been used to hunt reindeer have been discovered in a patch of melting snow. The oldest of the arrows (pictured) is 5,400-years-old. The bow and arrow design is strikingly similar to those found in other frigid locales, such as the Yukon, the archaeologists said . The bow (pictured) made of elm, was about 3,800 years old, the archaeologists said . Martin Callanan, an archaeologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, told LiveScience: 'It's actually a little bit unnerving that they're so old and that they're coming out right now. It tells us there's something changing.' Dr Callanan and his team have spent recent summers hiking the Trollheim and Dovre mountains to study the rate of snow melt and trawl the area, south of Trondheim, for artefacts left behind by ancient hunters. They said the mountains tower some 6,200 feet above sea level and at their peaks, only rocks and snow are seen. Over the summers of 2010 and 2011 the team stumbled across a patch of melting snow that gave up an ancient bow and several arrows that had been buried in the hard snow-ice for centuries. Upon closer inspection they found the bow was made from elm wood, which grows at lower altitudes in the mountain range and near the coast, while the arrow tips were made from slate. However, they said in a study, published in the journal Antiquity, that after dating the finds they now believe the bow is 3,800-years-old, while the oldest arrow dates back an incredible 5,400-years. Dr Callanan and his team think the hunting tools were used by Stone Age men to kill reindeer, which keep cool in the summer by staying on the higher parts of the mountain range. The scientists suggest that the animals' cool retreat gave them a break from annoying insects and the heat, but their predictable patterns probably made them a relatively easy target for hunters. While there is no evidence of who the arrows and bows belonged to, but they are similar in design to some found thousands of miles away in similarly chilly environments. Dr Callanan (centre) and his team have spent recent summers hiking the Trollheim and Dovre mountains (pictured) to study the rate of snow melt and trawl the area, south of Trondheim, for artefacts left behind by ancient hunters . In 2010 and 2011, the team noticed that a snow patch that had been there for centuries had melted, revealing an ancient bow and arrows. Callanan and his team think the hunting tools (pictured) were used by Stone Age men to kill reindeer . Dr Callanan said: 'The people in Norway, they didn't have any contact with people in the Yukon, but they have the same type of adaptation.' However, he said that different cultures living in similar environments acted in the same way. While the find is no doubt a valuable insight into how stone age man lived thousands of years ago, another archaeologist who was not involved in the study, E. James Dixon, director of the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology at the University of New Mexico, said that if climate chnage is causing the ancient snow to melt, it is bad for archaeology, . Artifacts can be preserved for thousands of years in the ice, but when it melts they can quickly decompose, he warned. 'For every artifact we find, there are probably hundreds, maybe thousands, that are lost and just destroyed forever,' Dr Dixon said. Other scientists believe global warming is leading to an increasing number of archaeological discoveries in cold and icy regions. Melting . snow has recently revealed a remarkably intact woolly jumper likely . worn by a fashion-conscious reindeer hunter some 1,700 years ago. The . find, which sheds more light on the life of people living in the Iron . Age, was found two years ago in Norway, but has recently been examined . by scientists. Marianne . Vedeler, from the University of Oslo and Lise Bender Jørgensen, from the . Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, told . Discovery News: 'Due to global warming, rapid melting of snow patches . and glaciers is taking place in the mountains of Norway as in other . parts of the world, and hundreds of archaeological finds emerge from the . ice each year.' The tunic was crafted from wool woven in diamond twill, which was apparently fashionable at the time and was made between 230 and 390 AD. It was worn by someone living in the hunting area of the Norwegian Lendbreen glacier, at around 6,560 feet above sea level, where it was found.","The ancient artefacts were found in the Trollheim and Dovre mountains a few hours south of Trondheim in Norway .

WiFi and mobile phone coverage at the Games will be the best of any Olympic event, with full broadband access and a 4G network.

Game on: Russian President Vladimir Putin lights an Olympic torch during a ceremony to mark the start of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympic torch relay in Moscow on October 6 .

Under SORM-2 Russian Internet service . providers (ISPs) must install a special device - at their own considerable expense - on their servers to allow . the FSB to track all credit card transactions, e-mail messages and internet use. Then in 2000, Russia's Minister of Information Technology and Communications Leonid Reiman issued order 130 that concerned 'the introduction of technical means ensuring investigative activity (SORM) in phone, mobile and wireless communication and radio paging networks'. The order allowed security services to bug the communications of anyone they liked . without having to show providers court orders allowing them to do so.

Games, spending more than $50 billion (37 billion euros) in state and . corporate money on infrastructure improvements. Soldatov, after studying an ‘information security concept’ document for the event, told The Telegraph: ‘There is an element of meta-data gathering, but Russian security services are not so interested in meta-data. This is about content. ‘The idea seems to be to make communications in Sochi totally transparent for the Russian authorities.’ It’s thought that the primary reason for this is to help safeguard against terrorist attacks, as Sochi borders the North Caucasus – a hotbed of Islamic extremism. Separatist fighters from that region have been battling Russian forces for years. The authorities will be monitoring cyber space for words and phrases that could suggest an imminent attack.

The roles played by imprisoned Bernie Madoff's long-time secretary and subordinate staff during his decades-long fraudulent deals and alleged office affairs will soon be revealed in court. The trial of the Ponzi king's associates - including one of the government's prize witnesses, Frank DiPascali, Madoff's former finance chief - is expected to last up to five months and begins tomorrow in federal court in Manhattan, New York City. The government will for the first time show a jury what it has collected in its five-year probe of one of history's biggest frauds, which saw Madoff jailed for 150 years for duping thousands of investors out of nearly $20billion since the 1970s. Office affairs: Details of alleged sexual relationships in Madoff's office are expected to be revealed during the decades-long Ponzi fraud that saw him jailed for 150 years . Details yet to be revealed are of alleged sexual and romantic activities that seemed to permeate Madoff's offices when he was perceived as a high flying Wall Street guru - so smart that he could ensure double-digit returns to his investors even when the economy was flat or in decline. Pretrial maneuvers included an effort by prosecutors to exclude from evidence any mention of such affairs, but as yet, no decision has been made to block these details. Prosecutors said in court papers: 'Suffice it to say that the government's investigation has revealed that, over the course of the multi-decade fraud alleged in the indictment, a number of Madoff Securities employees and customers - including expected witnesses, defendants, and others - were engaged in romantic or sexual relationships.' The government said Madoff himself was engaged in a love triangle with one of the defendants. There are only two female defendants appearing in the trial - staffer Joann Crupi and Madoff's longtime secretary Annette Bongiorno. One of the two: Court documents claim that one of the female defendants- either staffer Joann Crupi (left) or his longtime secretary Annette Bongiorno (right)- were involved in the love triangle . The lawyer for the four employees (including Ms Bongiorno, pictured) tried to get 'inflammatory' evidence barred from the courtroom . U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, a calm, thoughtful presence on the bench, has not yet said for sure whether the salacious allegations can be aired in the courtroom. The government is counting on DiPascali to explain to jurors the roles played by each defendant. Prosecutors say fictitious trades and phantom accounts were created with help from Madoff's secretary, Annette Bongiorno, a supervisor in his private investment business; Daniel Bonventre, his director of operations for investments; JoAnn Crupi, an account manager; and computer programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez. All have pleaded not guilty. Six others have pleaded guilty in the case, including DiPascali. Amid a collapsing economy, Madoff was forced to reveal his fraud in December 2008, acknowledging that accounts he had told investors were worth nearly $68 billion only days earlier actually held only a few hundred million dollars. Trial begins: The trial against the former Madoff staffers, including Daniel Bonventre (left) and George Perez (right), will begin tomorrow and is expected to last five months . He had lied to thousands of investors, including retirees, charities, school trusts and even Holocaust survivors. He pleaded guilty to fraud charges a few months later and was sentenced to a 150-year prison term in Butner, N.C. Much of the money has since been recovered by a court-appointed trustee. Madoff, 75, claimed during his guilty plea that he acted alone, but the government says that was not true and will use the trial to try to prove it. Details of the lavish lifestyles of Madoff's associates will not be revealed, however, as Judge Swain has excluded much of this evidence, such as Madoff allegedly splashing them with tens of millions of dollars even as the Ponzi scheme grew closer to its abrupt culmination. From his cell: Madoff is currently serving a 150-year sentence in North Carolina's Butner Prison (pictured) Jurors won't hear about Bongiorno's Mercedes or her vacation home or her shopping forays to pricey department stores. As her lawyers wrote in persuading the judge to exclude personal expenses: 'The government seeks to tap into the public's generalized anger at `Wall Street Greed,' which has the potential to result in an unjust verdict `fabricated' from the jury's emotional response to proof that is not tethered to any element of the charges against Ms. Bongiorno.' Crupi's lawyers made a similar argument, saying 'whether she purchased a beach house or not, went on vacation or not, bought a deluxe refrigerator or not, proves nothing about what happened ... or what Ms. Crupi knew.' Assets: After his downfall Madoff had to sell several homes, including his Manhattan penthouse . For sale: The convicted fraudster had to give up his beach house in Montauk, Long Island . Still, the judge is allowing into evidence information about the beach house and a Caribbean vacation for another defendant because Madoff's firm directly helped fund them. And the first trial may not be the last. Just days ago, prosecutors charged a 77-year-old accounting executive, saying he directed others since at least the early 1990s to falsify records and help conceal Madoff's fraud. He, too, has pleaded not guilty. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Trial of Madoff's staffers including his secretary and finance chief begins .

The Civil War was a series of battles from 1642 to 1651 between Royalists and Parliamentarians. When King Charles I took the throne in 1625, his reign was met with almost immediate murmurs of discontent. His was a style of governance defined by religious dogma and a stubborn opposition to parliamentary rule. This bred feelings of alienation and deep mistrust in pockets of England, while in Scotland tensions with the English boiled over into bloody conflict. The embattled king was forced to form a parliament in 1640, and within this a vocal and highly critical Puritan faction began to grow. When a violent Catholic rebellion broke out in Ireland, disagreements over how to respond split England in two, and in 1642 the English Civil War broke out. The Royalists, based largely in the north and west, fought for the king, while the Roundheads, also known as Parliamentarians, came mainly from the south and east. They took their nickname from their preference for closely cropped hair, which set them apart from the ringlets of courtly Royalists. The battles that followed saw Charles's forces, bolstered by the Welsh and Cornish, clash with a Roundhead army swollen with Londoners. The Royalists looked to be on the brink of victory in 1643, until their enemies joined forces with the Scots. In 1644, the king's men suffered a crushing defeat at Marston Moor, North Yorkshire, effectively conceding the north. A further loss at Naseby, Northamptonshire, was the final nail in the coffin. The king gave himself up to the Scots and they promptly passed him on to their Roundhead allies, who were in the early stages of establishing a republican regime. He was executed in 1649, but not before inciting further clashes known as the Second Civil War.","Cromwell and his right-hand man General Sir Thomas Fairfax met at Wickham Court in Bristol on eve of attack .

The 34-year-old, who lost a costly legal battle with her former employer Lord Alan Sugar, was spotted walking into a Job Centre . Dressed in a bright red dress and high-heeled shoes, the former winner looked glum as she clutched paper forms as she left the building. Last week said she was trying to claim benefits as she fought off a claim by Lord Sugar, who was trying to win £35,000 in legal costs and damages. At the original employment tribunal, Lord Sugar claimed Miss English knowingly lied when she said the £100,000-a-year job at his firm, which she won through the BBC programme in 2010, was a sham. At a hearing it was revealed the businesswoman and mother-of-two is attempting to claim housing benefit and jobseeker's allowance . Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) hands out least £56.80 a week to the unemployed while they look for work - the amount of benefits they receive after that depends on their circumstances; such as National Insurance Payments and their age. To claim JSA, Miss English would have to be immediately able to work and actively seeking a new position. She would also have to attend a JSA interview to discuss her circumstances. JSA could be stopped as a penalty if they don't go to a Jobcentre Plus office when asked, reject a job or training, fail to apply for any jobs and don't go to any training booked for them. Recently, she claimed she was making double that amount from new business ventures, including a fashion label and an events company. But at the hearing this week it emerged that Miss English has not worked since July and is attempting to claim housing benefit and jobseeker’s allowance. She said that she worked at Citigroup until July, earning £500 a day, but her contract with the banking giant had ended. She is also facing the prospect of having one of her homes repossessed and has seen her marriage collapse as a result of the stress of the original case. Miss English told the tribunal that she now only has around £200 in her bank account and was unable to even afford a birthday present for her son. But it was revealed shortly afterwards that the businesswoman has a property portfolio worth £1million and pays a firm up to £1,000 a week to manage her public relations. Following that, and a tearful interview on ITV's Daybreak, she was seen at Harrods' luxury tea counter and browsing Stella McCartney bags. Her spokesman told the Mirror that she only bought tea bags and added: 'They were a present for her mother costing just £3.95.' Her representative was unavailable to comment when the Mail Online contacted them.

"By . Ted Thornhill . PUBLISHED: . 09:33 EST, 7 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:46 EST, 7 October 2013 . An elderly British couple have been knocked down and killed in America whilst trying to cross a five lane freeway in America to reach a roadside diner. Edward McElroy, 76, and his 70-year old wife Brenda were thought to have been walking hand-in-hand when they were hit by a pick-up truck - just 24 hours after they arrived in the US for a last-minute 'fly drive' holiday. A nurse attempted to give first aid to the couple, but both were pronounced dead at the scene having been killed instantly. Tragedy: Brenda and Edward McElroy from Blackpool, Lancashire, who have been killed in a horror crash while on holiday in America . Retired loss adjuster Mr McElroy, known as Ted, and his wife, a former customer services advisor, had travelled to West Virginia where ‘leaf peepers’ were visiting to marvel at the changing colours of the tree-filled landscapes in Autumn. The couple, from Blackpool, Lancashire, who have three children and three grandchildren, booked into a Best Western hotel in Barboursville and tragedy struck as they were crossing the road to get to a restaurant which had been recommended to them. Their eldest daughter Gillian, 49, has now flown to the US to arrange for the bodies to be repatriated back to England. On Monday Mrs McElroy's sister Eileen Dobson, 65, said: ‘We're all devastated and so sad especially after we saw them only last week for Ted's birthday. ‘They were so excited and were telling us about the trip. I asked if they were looking forward to it and they said they couldn't wait. It's heart-breaking - they were so full of life.’ She added: ‘Ted and Brenda had initially booked a holiday to go and stay with a friend in Kentucky but they couldn't go because the friend had a stroke and wasn't well enough to put them up. ‘When they came to try and change the flight it was going to cost them a lot of money so they booked a fly/drive holiday. It was a last-minute decision. They were planning to go all the way across West Virginia. Heart-breaking: The couple were described as being 'so full of life' ‘I didn't want them to go at all. Instead of rebooking those flights where you don't know where you're going I thought they should have gone to Cornwall and I just felt it was jinxed from the start. ‘But they loved America and were determined to go. They did everything together.’ ‘Personally I can't believe they've essentially crossed a motorway in the dark. Normally they're sensible people who are always so aware of their surroundings so I just can't understand what's happened. ‘It was a five-lane freeway. Apparently it is a notoriously dangerous place to cross and local residents were campaigning to get lights put there. ‘You just wouldn't cross a motorway here so why do it in America.’Mr and Mrs McElroy were seasoned travellers, visiting several parts of the world. The couple originally met at a yacht club and later married in Canada. He worked across the world as a loss adjuster in locations as diverse as London, Nigeria and Canada. Later in his career, Mr McElroy, a model railway enthusiast, was employed as a civil servant for the Department of Work and Pensions. The couple were members of a crown green bowling club and were involved in amateur dramatics. Mrs Dobson added: ‘Brenda and Ted used to like doing different things and liked visiting friends and making friends. They were very outgoing. Keen travellers: The couple had arrived in Barboursville on a last-minute fly-drive holiday . ‘They loved socialising and entertaining and they always had two holidays a year. They had done the Great Wall of China and went on a cruise round Norway this Spring. ‘They had only just got to Barboursville when it happened. They set off at 6am from Manchester to West Virginia so I would think that they didn't get there until late at night, so they couldn't have done much because they would have just got there and picked up a car. They would have been very tired and they may have had a glass of wine. ‘Their advanced ages were on my mind when they said they were going there. I know how tiring a long-haul journey like that is. ‘I said it's such a long way and I asked if they were sure about it. I wanted them to stay in this country but they were so used to going out on these exotic holidays. ‘She said this would be the last holiday and it just shows you have to be careful what you say because it was their last one. The crash happened at 8.15pm local time on Tuesday of last week. The manager of the Best Western motel, where the couple were staying, was reported to have said the McElroys had gone to the front desk minutes before the accident to ask where they could go for dinner. The eastbound lanes of the road - known as Route 60 - were closed for several hours while police and ambulance crews attended the scene. The driver of the pick-up truck - a 56-year-old woman - was treated for shock in hospital after the incident. Police said there were no charges pending against the driver. The mayor of Barboursville, Paul Turman, said he would talk to the department of highways to see if any lessons could be learned from the tragedy. He said: ‘One thing that has come up that would be helpful is to try and help with the lighting in the area. It's unfortunate and we are saddened by it.’ A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are aware of the deaths of Edward and Brenda McElroy in the US. We are in contact and are providing consular assistance.’ West Virginia is a popular tourist destination in September and October for ‘leaf peepers’, who visit to marvel at the changing colours of the tree-filled landscapes in Autumn. Nearly 80 per cent of West Virginia is covered in trees and ‘fall driving tours’ are a popular tourist attraction. The trips are so popular that the West Virginia Division of Forestry provides weekly ‘fall foliage reports’, which includes maps of autumn colour by county and a ‘foliage colouration guide’ by tree species.","Edward McElroy, 76, and his wife, Brenda, were killed in West Virginia .

Teenage activist Malala Yousafzai today revealed her struggle to adjust to British culture, admitting she was ‘embarrassed and worried’ about starting at a UK school after leaving Pakistan. The 16-year-old was shot by a gunman who boarded her school bus a year ago in Swat valley after angering the Taliban with her public, outspoken and courageous pleas for girls to be educated. Malala, who attends Edgbaston High School for Girls in Birmingham, said she is having to get used to seeing women go outside without a man - and was never taught drama or PE in her home country.

It was difficult to adjust to this . new culture and society, especially for my mother. ‘We . have never seen that women would be that much free, that they would go . to any market. They will be going alone with no men and with no brothers . and fathers. ‘In our . country, if you want to go outside, you must go with a man - if even . your five-year-old brother goes with you it's fine, but you must have . someone else.

Malala . also admitted: ‘It's important for me to complete my own education and . empower myself with knowledge as knowledge is the real power. I need to . complete my homework on time. The Taliban warned today that it plans to attempt to kill Malala Yousafzai again. Shahidullah Shahid, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said the group stood by its decision to shoot her after she ‘targeted and criticised Islam’, reported Sky News. ‘She accepted that she attacked Islam so we tried to kill her, and if we get another chance we will definitely kill her and that will make us feel proud. ‘Islam prohibits killing women, but except those that support the infidels in their war against our religion.’ ‘I’m . still following my own culture - I think this Western society accepts . other cultures, so it's a good thing. I am a campaigner for education, . children's rights activist and women's activist.’ The . girl, who survived the shooting after the bullet went into her left eye . socket but missed her brain, also told the BBC's Panorama that UK teenagers . do not realise how 'precious' a proper education is. When . asked whether British girls take their education for granted, she said: . 'Yes, I believe that, I want to tell the students of UK to think that . it is very precious, it's very prestigious, go to school. 'Reading . a book, having a pen in our hands, studying, sitting in a classroom is . something very special for us because once we were deprived from it and . because what we have seen in Swat.' Her . comments come as she received a Pride of Britain Award from David . Beckham after being nominated by thousands of members of the public for . standing up to terrorists. Courage: Malala, pictured on Panorama, miraculously survived being shot in the head in Pakistan a year ago . Malala . told the Panorama special, Malala: Shot For Going To School, that being . born into a society that did not value girls made early life tough for . her. In January 2008 the Taliban, who controlled the Swat region, declared girls would no longer be allowed to go to school. Acid attacks, abuse and even killing were used as punishment. With her father Ziauddin's backing, Malala Yousafzai kept an online diary and did interviews with journalists to encourage girls to seek education - but it also made her a target. She does not remember being shot on a schoolbus in October 2012 - but her horrified friends recall that the Taliban asked for Malala by name before shooting straight at her head. Everything, from schoolbooks to clothes, were soaked in blood and Malala was near death. She travelled to Britain for treatment but her injuries were so bad that her father asked relatives to start arranging her funeral. However, Malala slowly pulled through after being transferred to an army cardiology hospital with better intensive care. She now lives in Birmingham with her family and started at Edgbaston High School for Girls in March 2013. She has been invited to a reception for Youth, Education and the Commonwealth, being hosted by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, at Buckingham Palace this month. It is thought the Queen was impressed by her bravery. It has also made her a hot tip for the Nobel Peace Prize. She said: 'When I was . born, some of our relatives came to our house and told my mother, don't . worry, next time you will have a son.' 'For my brothers it was . easy to think about the future, they can be anything they want. But for . me it was hard and for that reason, I wanted to become educated and I . wanted to empower myself with knowledge.' She . also called for talks with the Taliban in order to achieve peace. Malala told the BBC: 'The best way to solve problems and to fight . against war is through dialogue. 'That's . not an issue for me, that's the job of the Government... and that's . also the job of America.' She added that terrorists are 'misusing' the . name of Islam. In . January 2008 the Taliban, who controlled the region where Malala lived, . declared that girls would no longer be allowed to go to school. Girls who continued to attend class were subjected to acid attacks and abuse and some were even killed as a punishment. Malala told the programme that continuing to attend school made her 'afraid of my future'. The . schoolgirl has described how she told her friend not to worry before . she was shot because the Taliban 'have never come for a small girl'. Her autobiography, I Am Malala, describes how the gunman fired three shots at her. In excerpts from her autobiography, published in Parade magazine, she wrote: 'Some of the girls screamed. [Best friend] Moniba tells me I squeezed her hand. 'My friends say he fired three shots. The first went through my left eye socket and out under my left shoulder. Pulling through: Malala - who now attends Edgbaston High School for Girls - was treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after the bullet went through her left eye . 'I . slumped forward onto Moniba, blood coming from my left ear, so the . other two bullets hit the girls next to me... My friends later told me . the gunman's hand was shaking as he fired.' Recovery: Malala was shot in Swat, Pakistan, last October. She is pictured with her father Ziauddin . She . travelled to Britain for treatment but her injuries were so bad that . her father Ziauddin asked relatives to start arranging her funeral. Despite being an anti-Taliban activist, he never believed they would target a child. He . said: 'They flogged adult girls but they never killed children. We . really didn't expect because we thought that they might have some . values, terrorists might have some code of conduct.' Malala slowly pulled through after being transferred to an army cardiology hospital with better intensive care. She . now lives in Birmingham with her family and started at Edgbaston High . School for Girls back in March. She is determined to keep in touch with . her Pashtun culture, believing that it teaches patience, peace and . religious tolerance. As . well as the Panorama special, Malala will also be seen collecting the . Teenager of Courage Award as part of the Pride of Britain Awards on ITV . tonight. After she was presented with the award by . former England captain Beckham, she said: 'It is such an honour to . receive this award. It will help me continue my campaign.' Her courage has won her many admirers around the world and she even delivered a speech to the UN on her 16th birthday. Support: She and her family, including father Ziauddin and her two younger brothers now live in Birmingham . She . has been invited to a reception for Youth, Education and the .

'It's important for me to complete my own education and empower myself with knowledge as knowledge is the real power. I need to complete my homework on time' Malala Yousafzai .

Malala told Panorama: 'If I win Nobel Peace Prize, it would be a great opportunity for me, but if I don't get it, it's not important because my goal is not to get Nobel Peace Prize, my goal is to get peace and my goal is to see education of every child.' Telling the BBC that she would like to go into politics when she is older, she said: 'I will be a politician in my future. I want to change the future of my country and I want to make education compulsory,"" she said.

Bad role models: Three of America's biggest sports stars - Peyton Manning, LeBron James, pictured, and Serena Williams - have been named and shamed as the worst at marketing unhealthy food to kids . But the worst culprits were the most famous athletes, a fact that saddened health experts. Denver Broncos signal caller, Peyton Manning, has endorsement deals with Papa John's pizza and Oreo cookies, adding to the $12 million he makes annually from lending his face, voice and persuasive powers brands. According to Forbes, he even owns 21 Papa John's stores in the Denver area. Meanwhile, Miami Heat champion LeBron James earns $42 million per year by endorsing McDonald's, Coca-Cola and other products and number 3 on the researchers' list of stars who plug unhealthy products is tennis powerhouse Serena Williams, who in the past has done ads for McDonald's and Oreo cookies. Pizza: Denver Broncos star Peyton Manning, left, stars in ads for Papa John's pizza and even owns a number of stores . Many of those food-and-beverage sales campaigns are aimed at young consumers, the study, which was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, found. 'When taking into account the nutrient quality of the products endorsed and the amount of advertising for each product, Peyton Manning, LeBron James, and Serena Williams are the highest contributors to the marketing of unhealthy foods,' the paper concluded. The authors said it 'ironic' that 'some of the world's most physically fit and well-known athletes' were promoting the unhealthy food and drinks and said it sends 'mixed messages about diet and health.' Unhealthy: Serena Williams, pictured, appears in an ad for Oreos licking the cream center . The study compared the modern day junk food flogging to the cigarette ads of sports stars like Babe Ruth and Ted Williams appeared in. The authors are urging the mega stars to re-think their decisions to push sugar-rich drinks or high-calorie foods. 'Our ultimate hope would be that athletes reject the unhealthy endorsements or, at the very least, promote healthy foods,' Yale University clinical psychology doctoral student and lead author in the study Marie Bragg told NBC News.

Mention the name Rudyard Kipling, and images of tropical forests, mongooses and cobras come to mind — not the snowy vistas of Vermont. But that's exactly where many of the British writer's best-known tales, including 'The Jungle Book,' took shape. In honor of his connections to Vermont, a group of scholars known as the Kipling Society is holding its symposium outside the United Kingdom for the first time — and touring a home the author built in the shape of a ship, high on a hill overlooking the Connecticut River. During the four years he lived there, one of the greatest chroniclers of 19th-century British imperialism snowshoed in winter, went to barn dances and made friends with his neighbors. Famous writer: This late 1800's photo from a collection in the Library of Congress shows author Rudyard Kipling in the library of the home he named Naulakha in Dummerston, Vermont . Home: Author Rudyard Kipling's Vermont home, pictured, which he named Naulakha, is framed by foliage in Dummerston. Kipling scholars from the United Kingdom and the U.S. will be at Vermont's Marlboro College Monday and Tuesday, October 7 and 8, 2013, for the first-ever meeting of the Kipling Society outside the U.K. 'I found the neighbors were flattered . to have Kipling among them. They were keenly interested in his work, . that they respected rather than resented his apparent, and only . apparent, wish to keep to himself,' said Thomas Pinney, a retired . professor from California's Pomona College who gave the keynote address . Monday at the two-day symposium, 'Kipling in America,' at Vermont's . Marlboro College in Marlboro, not far from Kipling's home in Dummerston. Kipling . lived in Dummerston from 1892 to 1896 when he wrote 'Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,' the story of a mongoose that battled two vicious cobras in India while . protecting his human family from harm. While . in Vermont, he also wrote the other stories in his collection 'The . Jungle Book'; 'Captains Courageous'; the poems of 'The Seven Seas'; and . many of the stories in 'The Day's Work' and 'Many Inventions.' Artifacts: Marlboro College Librarian Emily Alling holds Rudyard and Caroline Kipling's marriage license . Books: Some of The Guernsey Collection, works by author Rudyard Kipling, are shown at Marlboro College's Library in Marlboro, Vermont . He was drawn to Vermont because of . his wife, who was from Brattleboro. Part of the draw for the 60 scholars . visiting this week from the United Kingdom and the U.S. will be a tour . on Tuesday of Naulakha, the home he built in the shape of a ship. They . are also viewing some of the college's Kipling holdings, such as the . contents of a safe deposit box that was discovered untouched in the . early 1990s after almost a century in a bank in Brattleboro. Among the items in it were a copy of his marriage license. Organizers . hope the meeting will serve to revive Kipling's reputation, which among . scholars declined through the middle years of the 20th century as the . British imperial era declined in esteem. Belongings: A box belonging to author Rudyard Kipling, which was discovered in a Vermont bank vault and is now part of Marlboro College's Rudyard Kipling Collection in Marlboro. The box contained an unpublished poem among other documents . Poem: An unpublished poem titled 'In The Keddah,' by the author Rudyard Kipling is at Marlboro College's Library . 'We will hear something about Kipling the ideologist of imperialism, because he was that, as a spokesman; he saw the British empire as the great force for spreading law and progression,' said Professor Janet Montefiore, the editor of the Kipling Journal and director of the symposium. 'But also he was this wonderful tale teller and also, the thing that is so nice about Kipling, he is so interested in people.' Kaori Nogai, a Japanese scholar who has studied Kipling while earning her doctorate at the University of Kent, said many of the topics Kipling wrote about a century ago remain relevant today, in the age of globalization. 'He talked about empire, how different people from different continents and different races have to live together. I think he will become even more relevant now,' Nogai said. 'It's not just that he's a brilliant writer; he has a vision for the future.'","The Kipling Society is holding its symposium outside the United Kingdom for the first time .

The sisters of the woman fatally shot in Washington DC last week after she went on a high-speed chase through the capital, insist she did nothing wrong. Speaking on NBC's Today Show, Miriam Carey's sisters Amy Carey-Jones and Valarie Carey, wanted to make it clear that their sister was not under the delusion that President Barack Obama was 'communicating' with her, as one of her ex-boyfriends has said. 'She was not walking around delusional. which is what we really want the public to understand,' sister Valarie, a retired New York Police Department officer, said. Scroll down for video . Valarie Carey, left, and Amy Carey-Jones, right, defended their sister Miriam on NBC's Today Show this morning, saying she wasn't delusional when she tried to drive through a White House barrier on Thursday, which lead police to fatally shoot her . The sisters continue to question the police officers handling of their sister, since she was unarmed. Mother lost: Miriam Carey was fatally shot last Thursday trying to flee from police in Washington DC. Her two-year-old daughter was in the car with her, and survived . 'I feel that things could have been handled a lot differently,' Amy said. 'We still fell that there was maybe another story than what we're being told.' When asked by Matt Lauer if they believe their sister was responsible for her death in any way, the sisters said no. 'What I do see is that perhaps maybe my sister was a little afraid being surrounded by officers with their guns drawn,' Valarie said. 'My sister was fleeing. She was trying to figure out how to get out of there.' Miriam was killed on Thursday after she . slammed into a Capitol Hill barricade following a police chase and it . was only after the officers approached the vehicle did they realize she . had her young daughter in the backseat. Witnesses say Miriam plowed . through a temporary barrier and hit a Secret Service agent who was . trying to wave her off - sending him flying onto the hood of her car. The Secret Service opened fire on her car as she turned and fled. Police pursued her through the streets of Capitol Hill during a frantic chase that hit speeds up to 80pmh. Video . footage shows the Capitol Police officers - who have not been paid . since Tuesday because of the government shutdown - surrounded Miriam's . car - guns drawn. At one point an officer even sticks his weapon inside . her open passenger-side window. Not responsible: Valarie, left, doesn't believe her sister was responsible for her own death, and thinks she fled because she was trying to protect her daughter . Visit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy . But even being blocked in by cops didn't stop her, she wheels the car . around, hitting a police cruiser and nearly striking several officers, . and flees. Officers can be heard shooting at her car as it drives off. Moments later, Miriam was shot and killed - within sight of the Capitol Building, and just behind the U.S. Supreme Court. She was not armed. Since . the shooting, police have revealed that Miriam suffered from post-partum . depression following the birth of her now-18-month-old daughter, whose . name has not been released. Surrounded: Police officers surround the car with their weapons drawn after the female driver rammed a barricade close to the White House on Thursday . Luxury Car: Police swarm around the Nissan Infiniti car on grass near the U.S. Capitol October 3, 2013 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC . Investigation: A federal agent removes evidence from the apartment complex where Miriam Carey is believed to have lived in Stamford, Connecticut, this morning . After . searching Miriam's Stamford, Connecticut home, police found files . confirming her former mental diagnosis, though the clearest reports come . from an interview with her sisters. 'My sister was not a bipolar schizophrenic individual. I can’t say as to why she was in DC. Regardless as to why, she was in dc her life should not have ended there,' Valarie said. Amy . described the medical issues as something that was carefully monitored . by her doctors, who felt that she only needed to be on the medication . for a year following the initial diagnosis given her lack of any prior . issues. 'I just know that my sister did experience post-partum depression along with psychosis,' Amy said. 'She worked very closely with her doctor to taper her off the medication. 'It wasn’t something that was displayed- it was a momentary breakdown… She didn’t appear to be unstable. And while security officials in Washington have so far supported the . actions of officers in the incident, it was announced yesterday that . they would be investigating the use of force against Miriam. Investigators . will study the car chase and shooting and look into whether police . officers took the right steps in stopping Miriam's rampage, which briefly . put the U.S. Capitol on lock down. So far, Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer believes that the officers 'did the best they could under the situation.' Sgt Gainer says officers working at high-target buildings must make quick decisions to confront threats. 'This . is not a routine highway or city traffic stop. It is simply not that,' Gainer said yesterday. 'The milieu under which we're operating at the . United States Capitol and I suspect at the White House and at icons up . in New York is an anti-terrorism approach, and that is a difference with . a huge, huge distinction.' Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine was . also happy with the way his officers acted under pressure, saying they . were 'heroic' defending the Capitol. The biggest question- why . she did it- will be one that remains with family members for the rest of . their lives as Valerie said that 'she was a law-abiding citizen. She had no political agenda'. 'We will never know what Miriam was thinking in those last hours before she died. We can only speculate,' sister Amy said. Searching for answers: The sisters have said that they are awaiting the results of the investigation into the use of deadly force, saying that there should have been another way to stop Miriam during her car chase . Heartbreaking: Amy said that they spoke regularly and she knew that Miriam had been working closely with her doctors about tapering off the medication the prescribed for her post-partum depression .","Miriam Carey, 34, was fatally shot last week after going on a driving rampage through the nation's capital .

Missed: Reese Martin died after being given a drug that had been recalled, according to a lawsuit . The parents of a five-year-old who passed away after battling cancer have sued a drugs company, claiming he died after taking one of their products which had been linked to a nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak. Barry and Regennia Martin, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, have claimed that drugs from the New England Compounding Center played a key role in the July 2012 death of their son Reese. The drug, a muscle relaxant called Methocarbamol, had been recalled after inspectors discovered fungal and bacterial contamination in some of the NECC's products. 'Reese Martin, a minor, died as a result . of - in whole or in part - having a recalled product put into his . body,' alleges the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Knoxville, The Tennessean reported. In their complaint, they say that the drugs were given to Reese shortly before his death but that they only learned his death might be linked to the product in October. The nationwide fungal meningitis outbreak last year, believed to be linked to NECC drugs, led to the death of 64 patients. But the suit does not name NECC as a defendant as it has since filed for bankruptcy. Its owners and affiliated companies, Ameridose LLC and Medical Sales Management, have instead been named. Lawsuit: Barry and Regennia Martin, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, have claimed that drugs from the New England Compounding Center played a key role in the July 2012 death of their son Reese . Tragedy: Reese was at Children's Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga at the time of his death . There are several other lawsuits that have been filed against the NECC in this case; claims need to be filed within one year of the 'victims' becoming aware of possible liability. Reese Martin was a patient at Children’s Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga when he died. 'Risk': Methocarbamol was recalled after inspectors found fungal and bacterial contamination . His cancer had been discovered after he apparently struggled to get over a cold and developed mouth ulcers. When it failed to clear up, he was sent for an ultrasound and the nurse found a tumor the size of a football on his liver, and he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma. Reese was declared more than 95 per cent diseased and given a very low survival rate but in July the following year, he had just five per cent after chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. But at the beginning of 2012, doctors learned he had a brain tumor and gave him a zero per cent chance of survival, WRCBTV reported. He told the Make-A-Wish Foundation that . he loved trains and wanted to play in the snow, and numerous people and . businesses from the area made his wish come true in April 2012. But he lost his battle on July 5, 2012. 'He played hard, laughed often and loved completely,' his family said in his obituary.

American Indian tribes have been caught misappropriating tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, according to internal tribal audits and other documents. But federal authorities do little about it, due to a lack of oversight, resources or political will, causing poor tribes like the Northern Arapaho of Wyoming to suffer. One Arapaho manager pocketed money meant to buy meals for tribal elders. Another used funds from the reservation's diabetes program to subsidize personal shopping trips. Scroll down for video . A member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe who lives on the Wind River Indian Reservation is photographed in Wyoming . Other members plundered the tribal welfare fund, then gambled the money away at one of the tribe's casinos. Altogether, employees drained at least a half-million dollars from the coffers of a tribe whose members have a median household income of about $16,000 a year. Federal agencies questioned millions more dollars the Northern Arapaho government spent, but decided not to recover any of the money — and even increased funding to the tribe. The Wyoming tribe is hardly unique. An Associated Press review of summaries of audits shows that serious concerns were consistently raised about 124 of 551 tribal governments, schools or housing authorities that received at least 10 years of substantial federal funds since 1997. Fraud and theft occur across the range of nonprofits and local governments that get federal money. But tribes are five times as likely as other recipients of federal funds to have 'material weaknesses' that create an opportunity for abuses, according to the review. Northern Arapaho Tribal Liaison Gary Collins speaks with a colleague during a break of an inter-tribal meeting in Wyoming . Overall, one in four audits concluded that tribal governments, schools or housing authorities had a material weakness in their federally funded programs; the rate was one in 20 for nontribal programs. Thousands of pages of audits and dozens of reports by federal investigators, obtained by the AP under the Freedom of Information Act, show evidence of embezzlement, paychecks for do-nothing jobs, and employees who over-billed hours and expenses. The audits, conducted by private firms, are required of tribes that spend more than $500,000 in federal funds annually. Agencies often cannot legally cut funding because of treaties, Supreme Court decisions and acts of Congress, and frequently refuse to take control of failing programs. 'It's basically a reluctance to take on tribes. The Department of the Interior bends over backwards to be their friends,' said Earl Devaney, the former inspector general at the department that houses the bureaus of Indian Affairs and Indian Education. 'It's 'make nice,' and what you don't know, you don't know.' Many amounts were relatively small. But there are so many instances of abuses that the total was substantial. Tribal council members in Northern California used federal grants to pay their utility bills and mortgages. A Nebraska tribe spent health clinic money on horses and ATVs. An environmental supervisor with a Washington tribe received $16,000 for mileage and other charges he either exaggerated or never incurred. Among grant programs with a significant track record in a government database of audits, tribes ran 16 of the 20 with the highest rates of rule-breaking. Auditors flagged welfare grants to tribes, for example, 39 per cent of the time. Sergio Maldonado, a Northern Arapaho member and diversity cooridantor at Central Wyoming College listens during the inter-tribal meeting in Riverton, Wyoming . Most prominent were programs funded by Interior's bureaus of Indian Affairs and Indian Education and the Indian Health Service, under the Department of Health and Human Services. Many findings by auditors suggest mismanagement, not theft or fraud. One barrier to proper administration of tribal programs is turnover among staff and leaders — entire governments can be voted out of office every two years. Attracting qualified administrators to often-remote reservations in the first place is another challenge. 'So they hire maybe the chairman's nephew who had some accounting classes,' said Pete Magee, a longtime auditor of tribal books. Sergio Maldonado, a Northern Arapaho member who is diversity coordinator at Central Wyoming College in Riverton, said tribes generally are just finding their self-governance footing after years of being under federal control. He said there are four goals for a successful tribal government — 'academic preparation, professional experience, a collective consensus for the benefit of the tribe and an ethical set of guidelines.' Maldonado, who also teaches a class about the tribe on the reservation, said it is relatively easy to address each point individually. But all four must be done together, and that's not easy, he added. 'It's not just our reservation; this is commonplace with a lot of tribes.' This photo shows Ethete, Wyoming, government seat of the Northern Arapaho tribe on the Wind River Reservation - the tribe received one of the worst possible ratings on audits . There are about 10,000 enrolled members of the Northern Arapaho, which shares a large reservation southeast of Grand Teton National Park. For the most part, they live in trailers, lapped siding homes and farm houses scratched into the high plains at the foot of the Wind River Mountain Range. Officials at the Northern Arapaho Business Council, which governs the tribe, contended in a statement that numerous negative audits the tribe received were 'primarily a result of inadequate documentation and record-keeping.' The statement added that the management issues 'were many years in the making and will take time and considerable financial resources to fix.' The business council has ordered a 'top to bottom review of all programs, both tribal and federal, to determine if improper spending is taking place and if personnel changes are required.' Gary Collins, a former chairman of the business council who serves as the Northern Arapaho liaison with the state, said the tribe participates in more than 60 federal programs, a number that presents challenges for auditing and accountability. 'There's nothing really intentional,' he said of any shortcomings. Since the early 1970s, federal policy has favored letting tribes manage housing, health, welfare, law enforcement and other programs as they see fit. As this 'self-determination' approach took hold, many tribes developed the financial savvy and governmental infrastructure to handle millions in federal money without major incident. But others, like the Northern Arapaho, have not. Federal officials try to coach tribes to self-correct rather than punish them, both in deference to tribal 'self-determination' and because there aren't enough staff to closely monitor the thousands of service contracts between tribes and the government. Even when auditors raise concerns, there is no guarantee that tribal leaders will be investigated or prosecuted. Several auditors said their contracts were not renewed after they uncovered self-enrichment by tribal leaders. Indeed, agencies recoup a small fraction of what they conclude tribes owe. Since fiscal year 2008, the BIA and the Bureau of Indian Education have collected only $2.3 million of nearly $69 million in questionable expenditures, according to financial records. In several cases, the bureaus were legally barred from recouping money because they waited too long. Since 2003, auditors concluded that 79 tribes or Indian organizations couldn't justify $33 million of Environmental Protection Agency money they spent. EPA said it had recouped 'approximately $3 million' since October 2007. Indian Affairs and Indian Education can't legally reduce funding even to corrupt governments. Funding levels are set by federal law, regardless of how well a tribe is managed. Thomas Thompson, a senior budget official at Indian Affairs, said reducing funding based on past practices would penalize tribal members rather than address management issues. The standard punishment is requiring tribes to submit invoices for reimbursement, rather than giving full funding at the start of each year. Agencies can in theory wrest programs back from tribes, but almost never do. In 2012, for example, Indian Affairs had taken back the programs of three of 566 federally recognized tribes. 'They don't want to take the program back;' said Brian Pogue, a BIA employee for 30 years who retired as its director. 'They want the tribe to succeed.'","One Arapaho manager in Wyoming pocketed money meant to buy meals for tribal elders .

Silvio Berlusconi is under investigation by Italian prosecutors for allegedly paying a series of huge lump sums to a call girl in return for her silence over prostitutes attending his parties. The revelation comes as the embattled former prime minister faces being stripped of his Senate seat following his tax fraud conviction and four-year prison sentence. It's alleged that Mr Berlusconi paid German-born ex-model Sabina Began - said to be the 'Queen Bee' of his female following - 1.5 million euros (£1.26m) over a period of months for keeping quiet about sending call girls to his parties. Investigation: Italian prosecutors are trying to establish whether Silvio Berlusconi (left) rewarded Sabina Began (right) for keeping quite about prostitutes attending his parties . It's alleged that she recruited call girls for parties at Mr Berlusconi's Rome residence - Palazzo Grazioli, the Daily Telegraph reports. Ms Began, who has previously declared her love for the former prime minister and has 'S.B' tattooed on her ankle as a show of adoration for him, says that the money was a gift and she refutes hiring call girls on his behalf. The Italian press has unearthed bank records that apparently show that several payments amounting to 1.5 million euros were sent to her by Mr Berlusconi between 2011 and 2012. Prosecutors are also looking into Mr Berlusconi's dealings with businessman Gianpaolo Taratini, from southern Italy, as there are suspicions that he provided Mr Berlusconi with prostitutes and has been paid 500,000 euros in return for his silence over the matter. Prosecutors tapped a phone call between the pair in 2011 in which, The Daily Telegraph reports, Mr Berlusconi said: 'Listen Gianpaolo, we need at most two each. Then we can trade. After all, the pussy needs to go around.' The probe follows Mr Berlusconi being defeated in his attempts to bring down the Italian government after his party voted to support the coalition of premier Enrico Letta, in a major U-turn. Mr Letta easily won the confidence vote in the Italian Senate, allowing him to keep his five-month old coalition alive. The actual voting was anticlimactic after former premier Berlusconi acknowledged defeat and said he would support Mr Letta after defections in his party robbed him of the backing he needed to bring down the government. Silvio Berlusconi, right, has been defeated in his attempts to bring down the Italian government after his party voted to support the coalition of premier Enrico Letta, left, in a major U-turn .

He is incensed at a vote planned for . Friday that could strip him of his Senate seat following his tax fraud . conviction and four-year prison sentence. Mr .

Blow: It was a huge setback for Berlusconi. He had demanded his five cabinet ministers quit the government and bring it down . Win: Mr Letta easily won the confidence vote in the Italian Senate, allowing him to keep his five-month old coalition alive .

Give us your confidence . for all that has been accomplished,' he said to applause. 'A confidence . vote that isn't against anyone, but a confidence vote for Italy and . Italians.' Berlusconi's .

Mr Alfano has . served as Mr Letta's deputy in the hybrid government and clearly thinks . it has accomplished a good deal of the Berlusconi party agenda. Mr . Letta appealed to MPs' sense of duty to not create any more upheaval, . which has caused Italy untold financial loss in recent years. He . compared it to Italy's great post-Second World War economic boom that . was accompanied by comparative political stability. 'The . majority of Italians are telling us - I should say they are yelling at . us - that they can't take any more of these scenes of bloodshed in the . political arena, and (politicians) who fight over everything but nothing . ever changes,' he said.

Thumbs up: David Cameron said he hoped a raft of new mortgage approvals would make the dream of home ownership a reality . Tens of thousands of people who ‘haven’t got rich parents’ will have the chance to get on the property ladder from today, David Cameron declared. The Prime Minister said he wanted to make the ‘dream of home ownership a reality’ as lenders braced themselves for a flood of interest in the £12 billion Help to Buy scheme. But as the doors opened for homebuyers to get 95 per cent mortgages, there were fresh warnings that it risked causing an uncontrollable housing bubble. State-backed banks Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest have announced plans to open 740 of its branches for extended hours for two weeks to cope with expected demand. In a major boost to the government, HSBC today became the latest lender to sign up to the scheme. Halifax and Bank of Scotland, owned by the state-backed Lloyds Banking Group, will start offering loans under the scheme on Friday. Virgin Money and the start-up Aldermore Bank will take part from January, with some estimates suggesting 180,000 loans could eventually be taken out. Under the scheme the house buyer must find five per cent of the property value as a deposit, the bank will provide a mortgage worth 80 per cent and the government will guarantee the remaining 15 per cent. New or old properties worth up to £600,000 are eligible, with both first-time buyers and people looking to move up the property ladder able to apply. Mr Cameron said: ‘Too many hardworking people are finding it impossible to buy their own home - people who can afford the monthly mortgage payments but haven’t got rich parents and can’t pay the deposit up front. ‘There is a need for Government to act. Buying your first home is about far more than four walls to sleep at night. ‘It’s somewhere to put down roots and raise a family. It’s an investment for the future. Above all, it’s a sign that everything you’ve put in has been worth it. ‘Help to Buy is going to make the dream of home ownership a reality for many who would otherwise have been shut out. This goes right to the heart of my vision for Britain - a country where everyone who works hard can get on in life.’ First time buyers have struggled to find a deposit of at least 20 per cent . More than 25,000 people bought their first home in July this year, the highest level since November 2007 . Ministers hope the scheme will trigger a new wave of housebuilding. An . earlier phase of the scheme, offering 20 per cent loans on new-build . properties, has already helped more than 15,000 people buy a new home . since it was launched six months ago. HSBC said is planning to offer Help to Buy mortgages between 90 per cent and 95 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) later this year through its branch network. Antonio Simoes, head of HSBC UK, said it promises to beat or match rates from high street competitors at 90 per cent LTV. 'By participating in Help to Buy, we will go further and offer mortgages up to 95 per cent LTV,' he said. Latest figures show on average first time buyers are offered only 80 per cent mortgages, requiring a deposit of more than £30,000. But as the new scheme went live, the Treasury select committee issued a fresh warning about the impact on the housing market. Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns NatWest, unveils details of its new Help to Buy mortgages today, although it expects to help only 8,500 a year for the next three years . Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie warned ministers had failed to ‘allay our concerns’ about the scheme. The Tory MP added: ‘Given the chequered . history of Government interventions in residential property, great care . will need to be taken in both the construction and running of this . scheme. ‘Mistakes could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability.’ Criticism: Treasury select committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said Help to Buy could distort the housing market or carry threats to financial stability' The committee's report concludes: . ‘The primary effect of the guarantee scheme, at least in the short to medium-term, could be to raise house prices rather than stimulate new supply. ‘Furthermore, we continue to believe that the government of the day will face strong incentives to extend the scheme, with the attendant risk that the mortgage guarantee scheme becomes a permanent feature of the UK mortgage market.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted he did not think the scheme would worsen the problem of the 'overheated' property market in the capital. But he suggested the scheme could be 'turned off' if problems emerged. Speaking at an event in east London, he said: 'I don't believe that this second part of the Help to Buy scheme is suddenly going to make that escalation in London prices qualitatively worse, that's already happening. 'But - a big but - of course we need to be vigilant, of course we need to moderate it, even turn it off if we think that it is not appropriate and is providing inappropriate stimulation to the housing market' The guarantees will be available for both new and existing homes worth up to £600,000, and the Treasury said there would be tough checks to ensure people could afford repayments. Customers can get information from NatWest and RBS from today and start applying at those banks from tomorrow. They are offering two- and five-year fixed rate deals at 4.99 per cent and 5.49 per cent interest rates with no fee. The brands together expect to sign up 25,500 first and next time buyers over three years. Chris Leslie, Labour’s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘If ministers are serious about helping first-time buyers, they should bring forward investment to build more affordable homes. ‘Rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply, but under this Government house-building is at its lowest level since the 1920s.’","Prime Minister says he wants to make 'dream of home ownership a reality'

The mother of a young girl left severely disabled by hospital failings has won a pay out of nearly £4 million. Maryellen McDowall’s eight-year-old daughter Hollie was born with a significant brain injury due to medical errors during her birth at University Hospital Coventry. The compensation was approved by the High Court sitting in Coventry yesterday morning. The money will fund the care needed for . the rest of Hollie’s life as, due to the trauma suffered at birth, she . is unable to sit independently and is doubly incontinent. Hollie McDowall, eight, suffered a severe brain injury when she was deprived of oxygen during her birth at University Hospital Coventry in 2005. As a result, she can't sit up independently, has limited vision, cannot communicate and is doubly incontinent. She also suffers seizures and will never be able to walk . The little girl is also unable to communicate and has limited vision. She suffers from seizures and will never be able to walk. Ms McDowall, who is from Coventry, brought a claim against University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (UHCW). At the hearing, she said: ‘Although I’m relieved this process is finally over, I remain concerned that the hospital has still not learnt from its mistakes and I think the public deserve to be reassured and to be provided with evidence that steps have been taken to ensure incidents like this are not allowed to happen.’ The court was told that following an uneventful and normal pregnancy, Ms McDowall arrived at the hospital at 2pm on April 18, 2005, with contractions. The baby’s heart rate was monitored and, although there were some initial dips in the heart rate, was reported as normal. Contractions continued through the night but by 11am the next day Ms McDowall was becoming very anxious as she had not felt the baby move since the previous evening. Hollie's mother, Maryellen (right), has received almost £4m to help her pay for Hollie's care. She has been given a £1.7m lump sum and will receive annual payments to help with the cost of carers. Ms McDowall is pictured with her lawyer, Ally Taft . By 2.35pm, Ms McDowall was in excruciating pain and very distressed, and further drops in the heart rate were noted. As a result, doctors were called but they did not arrive. A ventouse delivery finally took place at 8.33pm when the baby's heart rate dropped dangerously low. Baby Hollie was born floppy, pale and not breathing. She was resuscitated and transferred to the neonatal unit. However, she was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy as a result of a significant brain injury, due to a lack of oxygen during the delivery. The hospital has admitted negligence in failing to deliver Hollie sooner and admitted she would not have suffered any injury if she had been delivered. The NHS Litigation Authority has agreed to pay a lump sum of £1.7 million plus annual payments for life to cover the costs of carers. Meghana Pandit, Chief Medical Officer at University Hospital, said: ‘We are sincerely sorry for the indescribable distress Hollie and her family will have experienced. ‘We have taken steps to learn from what happened to Hollie and have 96 hours per week consultant presence on Labour Ward. Ms McDowall says the compensation brings much-needed financial security for her disabled youngster . ‘Furthermore, all women admitted to the Labour Ward with a complicated pregnancy are now reviewed by an obstetrician and a labour management plan is agreed and documented. ‘All staff now attend mandatory training sessions on electronic foetal monitoring and the use of foetal blood sampling. ‘The Trust has also implemented the use of a “Fresh Eyes” sticker, which prompts staff to double check a review of a foetal heart trace carried out by another colleague. ‘No amount of money can ever compensate for distress and suffering but I trust the family will take comfort knowing the financial settlement will go some way towards helping Hollie.’ Ms McDowall says the compensation brings much-needed financial security for her disabled youngster. Speaking after yesterday’s High Court hearing in Coventry - in which the sum of £3,990,825 compensation was approved – she said the seven-figure pay out has brought peace of mind at last. The 29-year-old told the Coventry . Telegraph of her relief that the day had finally arrived, saying: ‘It’s . good to know Hollie will always be cared for whatever happens to me or . my partner in future, to know she will always have everything she . needs.’ The mother-of-four admits at times it was a struggle to provide Hollie with the equipment and level of care she needed, especially with three younger children to look after - a two-and-three-quarter-year-old son, and 18-month-old twin daughters. University Hospital Coventry has admitted negligence in failing to deliver Hollie sooner and admitted that she would not have suffered any injury if she had been delivered earlier . She said: ‘Hollie basically had what we could afford when we could afford it, but she never went without. ‘She always had everything she needed. I would rather go without myself. ‘It meant I didn’t do a lot of things that people my age would do, going out and things like that.’ The money will be looked after by the courts to ensure every penny will be spent on improving Hollie’s quality of life. Immediate plans for the pay out include spending some of the money on a sensory room for Hollie in the family home. The family get some help from night-time carers, but Ms McDowall says she will continue to devote the same amount of time herself to caring for her daughter, with the help of her partner Dean Frankton, aged 37. She launched her legal fight when Hollie was six-months-old. Speaking of her long battle for compensation, she added: ‘I’m just glad it’s all over now. ‘It’s been going on for such a long time - I never thought this day would come.’ The family’s solicitor, Ally Taft, head of clinical negligence at Alsters Kelley LLP, said: ‘Although the settlement sounds substantial, every penny will be required to look after Hollie properly and to provide her with the best care and equipment possible to try and improve her quality of life. ‘No amount of money can take back the severe injuries that Hollie suffered, although, hopefully it will make her and her family’s life more tolerable.’","Hollie McDowall, 8, is unable to sit independently, cannot communicate, is doubly incontinent, has limited vision and suffers from seizures .

An Auschwitz survivor who played in goal for the Welsh team in the Nazi death camp's football league has returned to its site to bury the ghosts of his past. Ron Jones, 96, was held in E715 - a prisoner of war camp alongside the main Auschwitz extermination camp in Poland - after being captured by German troops during World War II. He said the soldiers were terrified. 'We did not know what would happen to us. We thought at one time they would stick us in the gas chamber,' said Ron. 'It was not just Jews going in, it was Polish, political prisoners, gypsies, homosexuals.' During the week prisoners were employed at forced labour camps, but on their rest day they were allowed to play football on a field just outside the camp - with armed German guards watching from the sidelines. Father-of-one Ron said: “We didn’t work on a Sunday so we used to play football.' The Red Cross heard about it and brought the teams four sets of shirts - English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh. Ron, a widower, of Newport, South Wales, played in goal for the Welsh team at the camp, which is situated near the Polish town of Oswiecim. 'When you’re under those conditions it was a real pleasure to play football on a Sunday,' he said. 'But we could only play in the summer, of course, because in the winter it was deep with snow.'

'If the wind was in your direction the smell was terrible.' 'We were always frightened we would be next.'

Torchbearer and former swimming champion Savarsh Karapetyan indicates that his flame has blown out . Fire starter: A security guard was forced to light the Olympic flame with a lighter after it went out . A man standing along the route, most likely part of the presidential security service, pulled out a lighter and re-lit the flame. Dmitry Chernyshenko, president of the Sochi organising committee, said on Twitter that the problem was due to valve on the torch which had not been opened fully. The torchbearer, Shavarsh Karapetyan, 60, was a champion swimmer for the Soviet Union who once saved 20 passengers from a bus that had fallen into a reservoir. He used his legs to break the back window of the bus as it lay in 10 meters (30 feet) of water, and pulled out 20 of the 92 passengers .

The relay will stay in Moscow for the next three days and hundreds of athletes and public figures including Prince Albert II of Monaco are to take part.

For most of the 65,000 kilometer (39,000-mile) trip, the flame will travel by plane, train, car and even reindeer sleigh, safely encased inside a lantern.

Britain would commit ‘economic suicide’ if it left the European Union, Nick Clegg warned today as he issued a rallying cry to voters, companies, charities and even the policy to defeat eurosceptics. The Deputy Prime Minister pleaded with pro-Europeans to speak out in favour of the EU before it is too late and Britain finds it has ‘stumbled out’ of Brussels. He urged people drop pro-EU views into conversation and flood Twitter and Facebook with messages, arguing ‘anyone and everyone who can see that there is strength in numbers in today’s world’. Rallying cry: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged pro-Europeans to speak out . Warning: Mr Clegg used a speech at the Buhler Sortex factory to concede that a referendum on Europe was now inevitable . David Cameron has promised to renegotiate links with Brussels and put it to a public vote by the end of 2017 if he is in power after the next election. In a major speech today, Mr Clegg claimed the Prime Minister’s timetable was ‘chosen for internal party management’ and says it would be better for a referendum to be in response to the next change to EU rules. However, he now accepted a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was inevitable. Mr Clegg has written to more than 100 organisations, including business and trade groups and charities, pleading with them to speak out in support of the EU. Timing: The Lib Dem leader said it would be better for a referendum to be in response to the next change to EU rules . I am writing to you ahead of a speech I will be giving tomorrow arguing the case for Britain’s continued membership of the European Union. Every day British businesses, families, charities and organisations of all kinds benefit from Britain being in the EU - whether through trade, jobs or our influence in tackling the big global issues that matter. Yet as the debate on this issue intensifies, the pro-European case is increasingly being drowned out. I want to use my speech as a rallying cry to ask people like you, who believe that Britain is stronger in than out, to speak up about what we gain from the EU and what we risk losing  if we leave. This is not a party political issue. I am not urging you to support the Liberal Democrats. Yes, Europe needs reform. But we need to lead from the front and work at that from within Europe. If we want Europe to deliver for Britain we need to stay in the room and win the argument. If you believe the European Union offers the best future for Britain – join in the debate. Let people know how much this matters to your work. You can also tweet to let people know why you think we are better off IN at #whyiamIN. Together let’s stand up for a proud Britain leading in a better EU. Best wishes . Nick Clegg . Speaking in Docklands, East London, Mr Clegg said: ‘I am not asking you to get involved in the party politics. I’m not asking you to support the Lib Dems. ‘But I am asking you to be part of a coalition for the national interest – standing up for Britain remaining in Europe; for a Britain that is richer, safer, greener and stronger in the world.’ He said every company that buys or sells ‘across the channel’, groups representing business interests, big banks and small family firms all had an interest in staying in the EU. He said he was also calling on ‘the hundreds and thousands of Brits who’ve relocated to France, Spain, Greece’ to speak out. In a surprise move he also called on ‘the police;  the charities who pick up the pieces when men, women and children are trafficked across our borders; the human rights organisations that want to make sure British citizens stay signed up to the protections in EU law… . ‘The green groups who want a UK that can lead the way on climate change; the farmers and fisherman who need a level playing field in Europe; the millions of British consumers who get better, cheaper products because we’re a member of the EU; and anyone and everyone who can see that there is strength in numbers in today’s world.’ He urged them all to tweet using the hashtag #whyIamIN, post messages on Facebook and personal websites, write to the Government, write to the newspapers and drop it in to conversations with family and friends. Mr Clegg said Mr Cameron’s strategy for a renegotiation of the relationship with Brussels was doomed because it would not be accepted by his party. Characterising the plan, with its 2017 deadline, as a political fix to end internal Tory divisions in the run-up to the 2015 general election, Mr Clegg said the Prime Minister was ‘playing with fire’ and ‘it is Britain that will get burned’. He added: ‘I don't think it's very complicated to imagine circumstances in which you could reform here, have a little smidgen of repatriation there, a treaty wording change there. ‘That's not really the issue. The issue is I don't believe that will ever meet the test which is actually being set by the vast part of the Conservative Party, which is that they don't just want another treaty change with a bit of reform, they want a complete semi-detachment or indeed total exit of the European Union. ‘That's why I think the whole strategy is flawed, because it is raising expectations, certainly among the ranks of the Conservative party, which will not be met by that process.’ Taking sides: Mr Clegg called for a 'fundamental and visceral debate about what side are you on in this basic divide' Mr Clegg believes next year's European elections will be fought as a proxy for the choice between remaining in or leaving the 28-member block. Most European elections have been a ‘mid-term plebiscite on the performance of the government of the day’ but this contest would be more ‘fundamental’. He said: ‘Now is the time to have a much more fundamental and visceral debate about what side are you on in this basic divide - are you basically for leading the reform of the European Union by being committed to it, or are you half out the door, or do you advocate exit altogether.’ Mr Clegg said among the reforms he would like to see would be an end to the ‘bonkers’ situation where the European Parliament alternates between Brussels and Strasbourg. ‘Some of its working practices, not least its second seat in Strasbourg, are totally bonkers and should be changed,’ he said. However, Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Eurosceptic campaign group Business for Britain, said: 'Nick Clegg has shown today that he is out of touch with how the majority of the British people, including thousands of British business people, feel about the European Union. 'If he thinks that the EU Parliament alternating between Brussels and Strasbourg is the only 'bonkers' aspect that needs changing, he should go and speak to the bosses at companies across Britain, drowning in a sea of absurd EU directives and regulations.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady praised Mr Clegg for highlighting some of the workplace rights that are enshrined in EU law. 'His views are in stark contrast with the Prime Minister who wants to offer the dismal choice between leaving the EU or staying in a Europe stripped of rights at work,' she added.","Lib Dem leader suggests people drop pro-EU views into conversation .

Reconstruction expert Asim Shahmalak, from Cheadle, is spending £50,000 of his own money to rebuild the lives of seven women who were disfigured - often for doing nothing more than spurning a man's advances. He is taking a team from the hair transplant clinic he runs near to Manchester Airport for the mercy mission in January. Asim, 52, visited his home city of Karachi earlier this year where he met the women who needed hair, eyebrow and eyelash transplants. Among those he will help are beauty salon worker Kanwal Ashar, 24, who had acid thrown over her by a man who had been stalking her after she turned down his proposal. Fellow victim Rizwana Mustafa, 23, was also attacked when she spurned a man's advances. And teenager Sakina Abdul Karim, 19, was horrifically scarred by accident when playing with some other girls. One of the acid attack victims Asim is helping is beautician Tahira, 24, who was attacked when she was just 13 for spurning a man's advances when she was on her way to work on a bus. She said: ‘He asked me to marry him. When I said no, he grabbed my hair and threw acid in my face. It was so painful.’ The hero medic is one of only nine surgeons in the world qualified to do the kind of intricate eyelash and eyebrow transplants the women need. The dad-of-two said: ‘It was heart-breaking meeting these women - their lives have been wrecked.

A paedophile who walked free from court after his 13-year-old victim was branded 'predatory' has been ordered to serve a two-year jail sentence. Three judges at the Court of Appeal in London ruled that the non-custodial term originally handed out in the case of Neil Wilson, 40, was 'plainly and without doubt unduly lenient'. Wilson was spared jail in August after Judge Nigel Peters QC handed him a sentence of 12 months, suspended for two years, at Snaresbrook Crown Court. Neil Wilson, pictured, appearing at court via videolink, with Judge Nigel Peters, has been ordered to serve a two-year jail sentence after his original suspended sentence was ruled to be 'unduly lenient' Attorney General Dominic Grieve, left, made the . decision after barrister Robert Colover, right, sparked an outcry by . describing the man's victim as 'predatory' Wilson admitted engaging in sexual . activity with the child, as well as offences of making indecent images . of a child and offences of possession of an extreme pornographic image. A row broke out shortly after the case was heard at London's Snaresbrook Crown Court when it emerged that prosecuting barrister Robert Colover had labelled the young girl 'predatory' and 'sexually experienced'. Sentencing Wilson, Judge Peters told him: 'On these facts, the girl was predatory and was egging you on.' The case prompted a national outcry before the Attorney General Dominic Grieve referred the sentence given to Wilson, formerly of Romford, Essex, and now living in York, to appeal judges to decide if it should be increased. Prime Minister David Cameron even intervened in the row, saying, 'We need a criminal justice system that stands up properly for victims. 'The victims of crime should always be at the centre of our thinking.' Judge Nigel Peters leaving Snaresbrook Crown Court. The judge originally handed the paedophile a suspended sentence, but Wilson has now been ordered to serve a two-year sentence . The Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and two other judges have now quashed the suspended sentence and ordered Wilson, who was not present in court, to surrender to police in York by 6pm. Following the case, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that Mr Colover had agreed to resign from the CPS Rape Panel of advocates, admitting his description of the girl as 'predatory' and 'sexually experienced' was inappropriate. The CPS said he 'will remain on our general advocate panel and will still be instructed in other criminal cases'. 'I asked the Court of Appeal to examine . whether the sentence was appropriate, given the seriousness of the . offences, and I am pleased that they have found that this sentence was . unduly lenient and have imposed an immediate sentence of imprisonment' - Attorney General Dominic Grieve . A number of complaints about remarks made during sentencing by Judge Nigel Peters, who said he was taking into account how the girl looked and behaved, are being 'considered' by the Judicial Conduct and Investigations Office (formerly the Office for Judicial Complaints). At the Court of Appeal today, Lord Thomas said how prosecuting counsel 'came to make the remarks he did is not a matter, as he is not present, we can investigate ourselves'. He added: 'But in any event it is the duty of the court to sentence on the facts before it. Counsel is there to assist. 'The fact that counsel makes a fundamental error in introducing a factor that is thought to be relevant cannot in any way affect the power of this court in determining what is the correct sentence.' Lord Thomas went on: 'This is a case where there is no dispute as to what actually happened. It is simply a case where the judge and counsel were in error that it was relevant, as a mitigating factor, that the sexual activity had been initiated by the victim. That was wrong.' Judges at the Court of Appeal (pictured) have ruled the non-custodial term handed to Neil Wilson was 'plainly and without doubt unduly lenient' He stressed that the law was there to protect those under 16 from sexual abuse and agreed with the Attorney General that children who encouraged sexual activity needed 'more protection, not less'. Speaking after the hearing, the Attorney General said: 'Neil Wilson exploited a young and vulnerable girl. 'He pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a child, making indecent photographs of a child 'nd possessing extreme pornography. 'I asked the Court of Appeal to examine whether the sentence was appropriate, given the seriousness of the offences, and I am pleased that they have found that this sentence was unduly lenient and have imposed an immediate sentence of imprisonment.' Neil Wilson spotted his victim amid the bustle of Romford town centre at the start of March last year. The 13-year-old girl was playing truant from school and wandering the streets asking strangers for cigarettes. Wilson obliged when she asked him – offering her an entire packet. He then took her back to his flat near the town centre for coffee. The girl allegedly looked around 14 or 15 and acted as if she was older than her years. However, she was clearly underage – and nearly three decades younger than Wilson who was 39 at the time. Over the next two weeks the pair enjoyed a brief ‘fling’, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. The girl was described by the prosecutor and judge as a ‘sexual predator’. But during this time it was Wilson who bombarded her with phone calls and text messages as she continued to visit his home, the court heard. On March 20, exactly two weeks after her first visit, the girl went back to Wilson’s flat after they agreed to meet. They sat in his lounge and talked about their relationship. Wilson claims at this point he told her they had to stop seeing each other because they would get in trouble. The girl, who was dressed in her school uniform, asked if she could change out of it and Wilson left the room. When he returned she had undressed and was sat wearing a T-shirt. Wilson claims he asked her to put her clothes on, but she started kissing him before touching his genitals. He said he pushed her away and told her he did not want to see her any more. At no point did they have sex. Robert Colover, prosecuting, told the court that the sexual activity was ‘not of Mr Wilson’s doing’. He added: ‘You might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her.’ The abuse came to light only when the girl told a friend what happened and the police were called.When officers went to Wilson’s home, they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer. Four of the images were surreptitiously taken photographs of children in play areas or other safe environments showing either underwear or varying degrees of nakedness. There were also 11 sexually explicit images involving horses and dogs. Wilson told police that he watched hardcore pornography but that he had deleted it from his computer.","Neil Wilson was originally jailed for 12 months, suspended for two years .

"By . Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:55 EST, 7 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:50 EST, 8 October 2013 . North Korea said on Tuesday its military would be put on high alert and be ready to launch operations, stepping up tension after weeks of rhetoric directed against the United States and South Korea, who it accuses of instigating hostility. Reclusive North Korea has often issued threats to attack the South and the United States but has rarely turned them into action. Such hostile rhetoric is widely seen as a means to perpetuate its domestic and international political agenda. In the latest outburst, a spokesman for the North's military warned the United States of ""disastrous consequences"" for moving a group of ships, including an aircraft carrier, into a South Korean port. Stern rhetoric: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un waves during a recent military parade . 'In this connection, the units of all . services and army corps level of the KPA received an emergency order . from its supreme command to reexamine the operation plans already . ratified by it and keep themselves fully ready to promptly launch . operations any time,' the spokesman said, referring to the Korean . People's Army (KPA). 'The U.S. will be wholly accountable for the unexpected horrible disaster to be met by its imperialist aggression forces' nuclear strike means,' the spokesman said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. In March, the North declared it was no longer bound by the armistice that ended fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War signed with the United States and China, threatening to use nuclear weapons to attack U.S. and South Korean territories. On alert: North Korea's army has been placed on alert after DPRK's leadership made threats against the United States . The North has defied international warnings not to build nuclear and long-range missiles and is believed to have enough fissile material to build up to 10 nuclear bombs. Most intelligence analysis says it has yet to master the technology to deploy such weapons. The United States, which has 28,500 troops stationed in the South, regularly engages in drills with its ally, and has said the aircraft carrier USS George Washington was leading a group of ships to visit South Korea in a routine port call. Not capable: Though North Korea has launched test missiles in the past, it is not believed the country has the technology to fire warheads very far . South Korea's Defense Ministry said on Monday the ships were taking part in a routine maritime search and rescue exercise and said any criticism by North Korea was 'wrong.' The impoverished North's large but ageing conventional military is considered unfit to fight an extended modern battle but it staged surprise attacks against the South in 2010 that killed 50 people in aggression unprecedented since the war. An attempt at dialogue in August led to the reopening of a jointly run factory park that was shut amid high tensions in April. However, talks have since hit a stalemate.","The rhetoric is seen more as bluster than foreshadowing .
Most analysts doubt the reclusive nation has the technology to threaten US interests ."

From colourful TV adverts and shiny pictures in magazines, to rambunctious cider tents at music festivals and clinky bottles of wine on restaurant tables: it is impossible to shield your children from alcohol completely. Whether or not you choose to drink in front of them, however, is up to you. But by doing so could you be setting a dangerous example, and setting them up for a troublesome relationship with the sauce as adults? Two mothers appeared today on ITV's This Morning to debate the issue, with journalist Shona Sibary maintaining that enjoying a glass of wine over dinner with her husband sets her children a beneficial example, while writer Liz Fraser stressed that children who see everyday drinking as normal will use that as their life model. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . To drink or not to drink: Shona Sibary, left, says drinking in moderation is fine in front of your kids, while Liz Fraser, right, says witnessing their parents drink alcohol every day is damaging to children . It's fine if it's with food: Does drinking alcohol every night with dinner teach children that everyday drinking is acceptable? A recent investigation discovered that last year there were 293 cases of children aged 11 or under attending A&E with alcohol-related conditions, anf 6,500 under-18s. This has lead to prominent alcohol education charity Drinkaware beseeching parents to have the 'alcohol chat' with their children before it's too late. Speaking to Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield, mother-of-four Sibary said: 'My children - the eldest of whom is almost 15 - see me drinking a glass of wine in the evening - with my husband, with food - to relax. 'They see it in moderation. They don't see me drunk or staggering. 'It's naive to think children aren't going to come across alcohol when they leave home, and it's safer for them to learn about it here with me rather than by binge drinking at university.' Big debate: Philip and Holly watch Shona and Liz discussing the issue on ITV's This Morning today . Fraser said: 'It's hard to disagree with this, but we're talking about the more extreme things. Of course it's a good idea for children to see parents having a good relationship with alcohol, the problem is when it's every day, when wine is on the table every night at dinner. 'Health professionals say we should stop daily drinking and make that clear to children from the ages of 0 to 10. Instead of ""When Mummy's tired she has a drink"". 'You see it on Twitter - ""5 o'clock: wine o'clock"" - 5 o'clock shouldn't be wine o'clock! It should be make the kids tea o'clock, or go for a walk o'clock, or go to the gym o'clock. 'Drinking alcohol should not be an everyday thing.' Heated: Shona, left, said she didn't want to feel guilty for enjoying wine with dinner, but Liz, right, said children learn by example . Learning young: Liz Fraser suggested that children aged 0-10 should be shielded from alcohol to learn that you don't need to drink it . Sibary counteracted the argument explaining daily drinking is part of European culture and also done in the Mediterranean. She reiterated that she'd rather alcohol wasn't a hidden topic, but discussed openly within her family so her children were less likely to rebel later on. 'I will give my kids a drink before they go to university - half a beer or a glasss of wine - so hey can understand the effect alcohol has on their bodies. 'I have alcoholism in my family and so my . kids have seen the negative effects it can have. Seeimg me . drinking one glass of wine in the evening is not the same. I object to the guilt trip mothers are when they have a glass of wine at the end of a stressful day.' Fraser, who admitted having bought her 15-year-old a bottle of beer when she took her to the Edinburgh Festival, said it was precisely that language that caused the problem, leading children to believe that the solution to feeling stressed, tired or even hungry is at the bottom of a bottle.","Two mothers, Shona Sibary and Liz Fraser, debated issue on This Morning .

A young couple who are still recovering from the devastating injuries they suffered in the Boston Marathon bombings have gotten engaged. Pete DiMartino, 28, proposed to Rebekah Gregory, 26, on Friday by kneeling beside her wheelchair at her home in Richmond, Texas and presenting her with a ring he had custom-made following the April 15 attack. She said yes. 'I said, ""You're my best friend and I . love you"",' he told NBC News. 'I couldn't get anything else out, I was shaking.' The couple, who met on a work trip, have been together for a year and said they knew before the attacks that they had found the perfect match - but agreed the experience brought them even closer. Celebration: Pete DiMartino, 28, and Rebekah Gregory, 26, are engaged - six months after they both suffered serious injuries in the Boston Marathon bombings. Rebekah is still unable to use one of her legs . Support: They are pictured before DiMartino threw out the first pitch before a Red Sox game in May . They were near the marathon finish line with Gregory's six-year-old son Noah when the two homemade bombs exploded in April, killing three and injuring more than 270. Noah suffered injuries to his lungs and scrapes and bruises, but DiMartino and Gregory both required multiple surgeries and both continue to undergo rehabilitation. As well as a ruptured eardrum, DiMartino lost 90 per cent of his right Achilles' tendon and suffered broken bones in his ankles and it has taken him months of physical therapy to learn to walk again. Gregory has had a staggering 14 surgeries on her left leg, which she cannot put weight on and which she continues to fight to keep. Amputation is still an option if there is no luck with a new device that was drilled into the bone and which will hopefully turn the foot so she can walk on it again. Together: The couple, who have been together a year, were standing near the finish line when the bombs exploded on April 15. Rebekah has undergone 14 surgeries since and could still lose her left leg . She has undergone skin grafts along her leg to cover where she lost soft tissue. Shrapnel marks also cover her leg. 'Going through an experience like the . marathon makes you realize how short life really is and how we don't . really know how much time we have left,' Gregory said. 'And I know that with my time . there is nobody else I would want to spend it with. It made me . realize how much I cared about him and how much he was the only person . for me.' DiMartino said watching his girlfriend fight through the multiple surgeries was inspiring and he joked that he 'had to jump on it before somebody else did'. Strong: The couple are pictured with Gregory's son before the blats on the day of the bombings. The six-year-old boy only suffered scrapes and bruises but the couple has needed multiple surgeries . Devastation: An image shows seconds after bombs went off in Boston on April 15, killing 15 and injuring 270 . The couple are now building a home in Richmond, and DiMartino will move there from his home in Rochester, New York. They have designed the house, which includes a master bedroom on the ground floor to make it easier for Gregory. DiMartino is even working towards taking part in an upcoming 5K race. They hope to marry within a year but said that they have had so much stress in recent months that they don't plan on having a large event. 'We're marrying each other, that's all that matters,' Gregory said.","Pete DiMartino, 28, and Rebekah Gregory, 26, were at the finish line on April 15 with Gregory's 6-year-old son when the bombs detonated .

A new malaria vaccine has the potential to prevent up to 100 million cases of the disease each year and save 200,000 lives, British experts have said. Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the RTS,S malaria vaccine could have an ‘enormous’ public health impact, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Results released today by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) showed the jab continued to protect young children and babies from malaria for up to 18 months after vaccination. A new malaria vaccine has the potential to prevent up to 100 million cases of the disease each year and save 200,000 lives, British experts have said . The firm now plans to submit an application to European regulators with the hope of getting the vaccine approved - meaning its introduction could be less than two years away. Over 18 months, the RTS,S vaccine was shown to almost halve the number of malaria cases in children aged five to 17-months. The study of more than 15,000 babies and young children found the vaccine reduced, by around a quarter, malaria cases in babies aged six to 12-weeks at first vaccination. The youngsters received the jab in three separate doses one month apart. During follow-up, their immunity to malaria declined and a sample of the children were given a booster jab. Experts are now awaiting results of the booster to see if it offered extended protection. Professor Riley said the initial three doses had been shown to deliver between 30 per cent and 50 per cent protection. Results released today by British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline showed the jab continued to protect young children and babies from malaria for up to 18 months after vaccination . ‘In public health terms, if you could vaccinate every child at risk of malaria you could reduce cases by a third to a half and you could reduce deaths by a third to a half,’ she said. ‘It would have an enormous impact in terms of public health.’ Professor Riley said 200,000 lives a year could be saved worldwide if every at risk child was vaccinated. And some 100 million cases a year worldwide could be prevented, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. While it is too early to talk about . eradicating the disease entirely, Professor Riley said combining the . malaria vaccine with other measures such as spraying homes with . insecticides, using insecticide bed nets and improving drugs for . treatment would have a huge impact on the numbers affected. Over 18 months, the RTS,S vaccine was shown to almost halve the number of malaria cases in children aged five to 17-months (image shows the micro-organisms that cause malaria) The RTS,S vaccine works by triggering . the immune system to defend against the malaria parasite when it first . enters the bloodstream and/or when the parasite infects liver cells. It is designed to prevent the parasite from infecting, maturing and multiplying in the liver. Professor Riley said the jab prevented 90 per cent to 95 per cent of malaria parasites getting into the bloodstream. But the remaining 5 per cent to 10 per cent of parasites were still enough to make people sick, which is why the jab does not offer complete protection. Professor Sir Brian Greenwood, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is an investigator on the trial, said: ‘Results show that the malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 continues to protect vaccinated children during an 18 month follow-up period, preventing many cases of malaria. ‘Protection declined during the follow up period. However, one third of the children in the trial have now received a booster dose of vaccine. We will learn next year if this protects these children for a further period.’ Eleven research centres in seven African countries are conducting the trial, together with GSK and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), with grant funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to MVI. Sir Andrew Witty, chief executive of GSK, said: ‘We're very encouraged by these latest results, which show that RTS,S continued to provide meaningful protection over 18 months to babies and young children across different regions of Africa. ‘While we have seen some decline in vaccine efficacy over time, the sheer number of children affected by malaria means that the number of cases of the disease the vaccine can help prevent is impressive. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has provided funding for the vaccine trial which took place in seven African countries . ‘These data support our decision to . submit a regulatory application for the vaccine candidate which, if . successful, would bring us a step closer to having an additional tool to . fight this deadly disease. We are grateful to the scientists across . Africa and GSK and to our partners who have worked tirelessly for almost . 30 years to bring us to this point.’ Dr David Kaslow, vice president of product development at PATH, said: ‘Given the huge disease burden of malaria among African children, we cannot ignore what these latest results tell us about the potential for RTS,S to have a measurable and significant impact on the health of millions of young children in Africa. ‘While we want to be careful about not getting ahead of the data, this trial continues to show that a malaria vaccine could potentially bring an important additional benefit beyond that provided by the tools already in use.’ The results of the trial were published in Durban, South Africa. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has indicated a policy recommendation for the RTS,S vaccine could be possible as early as 2015 if it is approved by European regulators.","The GlaxoSmithKline jab protects young children for up to 18 months .

Hamid Karzai has blasted NATO’s military actions in Afghanistan, claiming that his country has not seen anything but suffering and loss of lives. The departing president also said the alliance’s airstrikes were a ‘violation against our sovereignty’, which has provoked angry responses from several camps. The war on terror in Afghanistan, which entered its 12th year yesterday, has claimed the lives of more than 2,270 US soldiers and 440 British troops. Attack: President Hamid Karzai has said the NATO exercise in Afghanistan has caused 'a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains' Responding to Saturday’s airstrike in Nangarhar province, where the Karzai government claim five civilians were killed, he attacked the military coalition’s actions in Afghanistan. ‘They commit their violations against our sovereignty and conduct raids against our people, air raids and other attacks in the name of the fight on terrorism and in the name of the resolutions of the United Nations. This is against our wishes,’ Karzai said. His critique of NATO continued as he branded the organisations 12 years in Afghanistan a failure in an interview with the BBC. ‘On the security front the entire NATO exercise was one that caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering, a lot of loss of life, and no gains because the country is not secure,’ he told Newsnight in an appearance marking the six-month countdown until he leaves office. In the interview he accused NATO on focusing their war against terrorism on Afghan villages instead of Taliban and al-Qaeda bases in neighbouring Pakistan. Hitting back: Former Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, seen here with Karzai during a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, has branded the president's attack on NATO 'unfair' Ongoing war: The War in Afghanistan entered its 12th year on Monday October 7, but the withdrawal of troops continue . Following his attack on the organisation, NATO’s former Secretary-General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, hit back at Karzai's critique, calling it 'unfair' to the soldiers who have lost their lives to protect a country not their own. 'It's unfair to all those NATO soldiers who lost their lives. It's unfair to Great Britain, responsible for one of the most - if not the most - complicated part of Afghanistan, Helmand, where I've been many times and where I've seen them and learned to appreciate very much what they've done. 'So now, at the end of the day, to say this was all a failure is unfair and I very much disagree with the statement he's making,’ Mr de Hoop Scheffer, who headed the organisation for five years until 2009, said. Michael Semple, former deputy to the . European Union special representative for Afghanistan said Karzai’s . comments show that he is 'out of touch with many of the people in . Afghanistan'. 'Perhaps he . believes it, but when I talk to Afghans, they tend to be polite, they're . well aware of the sacrifices that have been involved in the . international mission in Afghanistan - they prefer to say thank you and . they feel rather appalled at the prospect of somebody saying: ""No, that . didn't work at all, terrible disaster.""' Positive thinking: President Barack Obama is 'optimistic' about securing a deal for future actions in Afghanistan . Afghan civil society activist Orzala Ashraf Nemat branded Karzai 'very weak' when he opened up to the possibility of Taliban taking positions in the Afghan government. The president rubbished claims that involving the Taliban in decision making would have a negative effect on advances in women's rights. 'I am confident that things are not going to return, but I am not confident about President Karzai's assurances,' she said. 'My confidence comes from the dedication and determination of Afghan women, who will probably continue to struggle regardless of what situation we face in the future.' Meanwhile, the US is ‘optimistic’ that an agreement between the two countries over the future of NATO troops in the country will be finalised within the next few weeks. The US government has said it wants as many as 10,000 troops to remain after 2014 in order to eradicate the remnants of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. However, as talks resumed yesterday after a four month hiatus, it is still possible the two sides will not agree. There currently are an estimated 87,000 international troops in Afghanistan, including about 52,000 Americans. On Friday, President Barack Obama said he would consider keeping some American forces on the ground after the conflict formally ends next year, but acknowledged that doing so would require an agreement. He suggested that if no agreement can be reached, he would be comfortable with a full pullout of U.S. troops.","Afghan president Karzai hits out at NATO, branding its work futile .

Republican Michele Bachmann has accused President Obama of plunging the world into the biblical End Times. The House Tea Party Caucus founder and right-wing luminary accused Obama of giving aid to terrorists, citing this as proof that we have entered the Last Days. The four-term House member, who represented Minnesota's 6th Congressional District since 2007 made the comments in an interview on Saturday on the Christian radio program Understanding the Times. Scroll down to listen . Michele Bachmann has blamed President Obama for plunging the world into the biblical End Times . 'President Obama waived a ban on arming terrorists in order to allow weapons to go to the Syrian opposition,' Bachmann said. ' Your listeners, U.S. taxpayers, are now paying to give arms to terrorists including al Qaeda.' She continued: 'This happened, and as of today, the United States is willingly, knowingly, intentionally sending arms to terrorists, now what this says to me, I’m a believer in Jesus Christ, as I look at the End Times scripture, this says to me that the leaf is on the fig tree and we are to understand the signs of the times, which is your ministry, we are to understand where we are in God’s end time history.' A Free Syrian Army fighter helps a civilian carry his belongings in Deir. 'President Obama waived a ban on arming terrorists in order to allow weapons to go to the Syrian opposition,' Bachmann said . Bachmann has become infamous for her . outlandish statements and made an earlier End Times predicition about the world ending in 2006. At the weekend teen star-turned-bad girl Miley Cyrus appeared in the form of a twerking Michele Bachmann, mocking the federal government shutdown on Saturday Night Live. Miley's skit featured the 20-year-old pop singer dancing in skimpy clothing in parody of her new song, 'We Can't Stop' - portraying the conservative Tea Party politician for a video titled 'We Did Stop The Government.'

Bachmann has become known for her wild statements, which have included: . An earlier End Times prediction that had the world ending in 2006. In 2011, she said the HPV vaccine causes 'retardation' and has 'very dangerous consequences.'Also in 2011 Bachmann offered a 'happy birthday' message to the late singer Elvis Presley  even though August 16 was the anniversary of his death in 1977. In an interview with the conservative website Pajamas Media she said:  'I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the . swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president, Jimmy Carter. And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an . interesting coincidence.' The president was in fact Republican Gerald . Ford. In 2008 she said Barack Obama’s associations raise the possibility that he has 'anti-American views.' The former presidential candidate . Bachmann was involved in a scandal earlier this week when Iowa state . Senator Kent Sorenson resigned after a special investigator found it . likely he violated ethics rules by taking money from political entities . connected her, and then denying he'd done so. Democrats say Speaker Boehner and his . Republican colleagues in the House forced government shutdown in an . attempt to defund ObamaCare, the health care law passed almost entirely . by Democrats in 2009. Earlier this year Bachmann announced that her career in Congress will end after the 2014 elections. Bachmann has been dogged by allegations that she improperly spent money from a Congress-related political action committee to help with her 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Former campaign aides first leveled that accusation, and both the Office of Congressional Ethics and the federal Election Commission are investigating. The FBI has also made inquiries into charges that Bachmann's presidential campaign made secret payments to Iowa Republican state Senator Kent Sorenson for help in the run-up to the 2012 Iowa Caucuses. Former Bachmann chief of staff Andy Parrish said in a sworn statement that the congresswoman 'knew and approved' of unethical payments to Sorenson. But Bachmann insisted in her YouTube announcement video that her presidential campaign did nothing wrong. Bachmann narrowly won re-election last year, beating Democrat Jim Graves by just 4,200 votes, a margin of 1.1 per cent.","The House Tea Party Caucus founder made comments in radio interview .

A baby who was dying of rabies has infected his father and brother with the disease by biting them. The infant in the Democratic Republic of the Congo infected his seven-year-old brother and 27-year-old father during an outbreak which affected 154 people. Both the father and brother recovered after being treated by medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) which says at least ten people have died during the outbreak. A baby who was dying of rabies in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (pictured) has infected his father and brother with the disease by biting them (image is a stock photo) It is very rare for rabies to be transmitted between people - most people who become infected do so by being bitten by an infected dog. Dr Jantina Mandelkow, who leads MSF's team in Lemera which is in the DRC's South Kivu region, said: ‘I held my breath when I heard that a child dying of rabies had bitten and infected his father and brother - it was horrific. ‘It's an impossible situation. Family members would obviously want to be with those who are ill, but when a person has rabies they can be a danger to people around them. ‘I've only seen one other case of rabies in my career as a doctor and it was one of the worst things I have ever seen. ‘Rabies leads to death without treatment, and people in Lemera were incredibly scared - many walked for days to get to the hospital for treatment. ‘With vaccinations unavailable elsewhere, they had nowhere else to turn.’ During the outbreak, 154 people were infected and at least ten died. Image shows rabies virus . Another Lemera-resident explained his experience of the outbreak. Segemba Soya, 23, said: ‘My kid was playing with his friends when a dog came and bit him. ‘One month after, his health deteriorated. He became constantly thirsty. We thought he was possessed by evil spirits. Then we brought him to the church for prayer. ‘While praying for him he jumped on me and bit me as I was laying my hands upon his head. ‘I didn’t feel any change in my body. People advised us to take him to the hospital. ‘When we arrived at the Bushushu Health Centre, they told us that it’s not evil spirits that he suffers from but rabies disease from the dog that had bitten him. ‘Some days after, he died. In my case, I went to the hospital in Lemera to look for medicine. Now my prayer has been answered because I’ve just been vaccinated against rabies.’ Rabies is a very serious viral infection that attacks the brain and nervous system - you can catch rabies if you are bitten by an infected animal. It is almost always fatal unless treated very early. Symptoms include tingling and itchiness at the site of the infection, fever, an irrational fear of water and aggressive behaviour. Treatment usually involves cleaning the site of contamination and administering a course of the rabies vaccine in an attempt to prevent the infection spreading to the brain and nervous system.

It is almost always fatal unless treated very early. Early symptoms include a fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, headaches, irritability, anxiety and vomiting. There are two types of advanced rabies - furious rabies, which accounts for four out of five cases, and paralytic rabies. The symptoms of furious rabies include aggression, hallucinations, excessive sweating and a fear of water and bright light. A few days after these symptoms develop, the patient will fall into a coma and die. The symptoms of paralytic rabies  are muscle weakness, loss of sensation and paralysis.

Eyewitnesses said the 24-year-old's 'face caught fire' in the 'freak accident' in Lola's cocktail lounge in Manchester city centre which actively promote their fiery drinks. She sustained burns to her cheeks, forehead and chest and was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital's burns unit after being treated with morphine. Flaming Sambuca: The young woman, 24, suffered severe burns when the drink 'exploded' in her face in Lola's cocktail bar, Manchester. This picture is taken from the bar's promotional material . Probe: The bar, in Manchester's Northern Quarter, have launched a review of health and safety policy following the 'freak accident' Drinkers around the world have been accidentally set on fire by flaming cocktails in bars. The 24-year-old woman in Manchester is still in hospital recovering today after being set alight by sambuca. The case comes after a Russian man suffered severe burns in May after a barman set fire to his head while trying to pour a glass of flaming absinthe into his mouth. Alexey Ponamarev, 28, was rushed to hospital with burns to his face after the incident in a bar in Novosibirsk, south-west Siberia. Four years ago British tourist Stuart Feltham (pictured) was turned into a human fireball when his genitals were apparently set alight by a woman in Malia, Greece.

Sambuca shots are made by pouring the spirit into a glass over two of . three coffee beans. They are set alight and the alcohol burns with a . pale blue flame . The flames should then be extinguished and drinkers inhale the fumes from the glass before downing it.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:33 EST, 8 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:57 EST, 8 October 2013 . Senate Democrats thought they had a winning plan they could set out today that would pass a long-term increase of the federal government's borrowing limit and force House Republicans to accept no concessions. But then White House National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling let the cat out of the bag. Asked during a Monday morning breakfast event whether the White House might embrace a two-to three-week extension on the nation's credit card if Congress passed it, instead of a longer deal, Sperling replied that 'longer is better for economic certainty and jobs, but it is ultimately up to them.' That sent Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and his cohorts scrambling, reports Politico, the northern Virginia newspaper that hosted the event. A short-term deal would free Republicans to renegotiate terms in a few weeks' time, a scenario that Washington Democrats fear would open them up to a new budget stalemate, and to demands for changes to the Affordable Care Act, the president's signature health insurance overhaul. White House National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said Monday that it's up to Congress whether a debt limit fix would be a long-term or a short-term proposition, a message Senate Democrats didn't want to hear . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid hopes to force a long-term debt limit increase through the Senate and drop it on House Republicans, forcing them to take a stand on extending the reach of America's credit card . Democrats had hoped that the White . House would walk that assertion back later in the day, but spokesman Jay . Carney didn't. 'How . Congress fulfills it, as long as they fulfill it without drama or delay, . without brinksmanship, without threatening default, is up to them,' Carney said Monday afternoon, 'and the duration that they attach to it, . again, is up to them.' 'What our position has always been,' he added, 'has not been, raise it for a certain amount of time.  It has been, raise the debt ceiling without drama and delay. So whatever the duration, our position will not change.' He said what? Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (R) was taken aback by Sperling's candid comments, and by day's end the White House didn't do much to clear things up . The new position, which seemed to represent the first chink in the Obama administration's high-stakes armor, came as Reid and other Senate Democrats were preparing to force the issue and pass their own long-term increase on the government's borrowing limit. Uncle Sam is expected to hit the current ceiling on October 17, and could default on the nation's $16.7 trillion debt if new authority isn't granted to rack up more obligations. The Senate will likely be the next to act, with Reid expected to offer a bill Tuesday or Wednesday that would authorize a new debt ceiling increase with no strings attached – and for a prolonged period of time. Republicans there could filibuster that measure, however. But that has never been done on a budget measure such as this. Reid would need to find at least six GOP senators willing to support 'cloture,' a measure that ends debate and forces a formal vote. With just 52 Democrats on his side, plus two independents who are Democrats in all but name, the GOP has enough power to block him if they remain unified. Without significant concessions, a senior Republican Senate aide told MailOnline, that scenario is increasingly likely. Republicans are demanding deep budget cuts to ensure that annual deficits, currently in excess of $750 billion, slow down their cumulative effect on the larger debt number over time. 'Really, Mr. President!': Boehner said a White House official told him the president would rather default on America's debts than negotiate with Republicans . President Obama has kept the pressure on, seemingly dismissing any thought that he might concede ground to Republicans in exchange for a debt-ceiling hike . And House Republicans, led by Boehner, are still holding out for concessions on Obamacare. Republican House Speaker John Boehner ratcheted up the pressure on Monday, saying on the House floor that 'a senior White House official' told him 'the president would rather default than to sit down and negotiate.' 'Really?' Boehner asked. 'The president – I will say this again – a senior White House staffer this morning said that the president would rather default on our debt than to sit down and negotiate. Now the American people expect when their leaders have differences, we're in a time of crisis, that we'll sit down and at least have a conversation.' 'Really, Mr. President, it's time to have that conversation before our economy is put further at risk.' Earlier in the day, the president told employees of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that he wouldn't be pressured to negotiate with Boehner over the nation's debt limit while a default was looming. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) signaled that she might bolt from the Republican leadership and side with Democrats, saying, 'We shouldn't be dismissing anything out of hand' Any port in a storm: White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president just wants the authority to borrow more money, 'whatever the duration' Congress might approve . 'We're not going to establish that pattern,' Obama said, adding that 'we're not going to negotiate under the threat of ... economic catastrophe.' Chinese Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said Monday that the U.S. must act quickly to ensure the security of more than $1 trillion in Chinese investments in America. 'The clock is ticking,' Zhu warned. The White House and its Senate allies are hoping a long-term debt limit hike proposal would force the GOP's hand if it lands on Boehner's desk. There are signs that some Senate Republicans are more eager to resolve the stalemate than to see a permanent winner declared. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska moderate, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that 'we shouldn't be dismissing anything out of hand, whether it's the debt ceiling or what we're going to do with this government shutdown.' 'We've got a situation where you've got a calendar running, you've got people who are frustrated and upset, so let's figure it out.'","Senate Democrats blanched when a top White House economist said it's up to Congress whether a debt limit hike would be short-term or long-term .

Retired: Catherine Woodall has quit as headteacher of Revoe Community Primary School in Blackpool . A primary school headteacher has quit months after she was suspended for sending pupils to a tiny box room dubbed 'the naughty cupboard'. Catherine Woodall, 62, stood down from her job at Revoe Community Primary School in Blackpool seven months after she and six colleagues were the subject of a police investigation. Staff were suspended and sent home following allegations children were ordered to sit in the small isolation room as punishment for being disruptive in class. A police inquiry was launched after one boy was sent to the room at the Lancashire school when he falsely claimed he had a knife and threatened to stab himself and others. Officers dropped the case after 10 days but seven months on, Blackpool council are still continuing their investigation into the incident. They said there were concerns over the 'professional judgement' of staff when isolating pupils for challenging behaviour - but confirmed there was no reason to suspect any child had come to any harm. Mrs Woodall - who was not in work on the day of the incident - today revealed she has retired from her role. She has claimed education chiefs previously ignored her pleas for help in dealing with unruly children. She said: 'Several emails were sent to the . authority seeking support and advice but they were ignored. We always . asked for help and ideas. 'I never received a response to my communications. The . school improvement officer never indicated they had any concerns with . safeguarding in the school. So this investigation came as a real shock.' Blackpool council launched their investigation into the use of what parents called the 'naughty cupboard' following the February half-term, after receiving a tip-off. Defending the use of the 'time out room', Mrs Woodall told her local newspaper: 'It was considered to be a time out room. It was for extreme behaviour and for children to cool down on their own. 'Often a child wanted to have a sleep. When anybody gets so worked up, they get tired. 'We . had a large room and a small one and children were given the choice of . which they wanted to go in. That would be supervised.' Scroll down for video . Investigation: Mrs Woodall along with six members of staff were suspended from Revoe Community Primary School, following allegations that a child was locked in a 'time out' room, for children with behavioral issues . She said a lock had been fitted on the outside of one of the rooms to stop children from getting into it by themselves. 'The lock was only installed as a . temporary measure because the door had been badly damaged just a few . weeks prior to the incident. It was to stop children from getting into . the room,' she added. 'I did not . envisage a lock on a damaged door for health and safety reasons could . negatively affect the welfare of children and result in the unpleasant . repercussions of the incident. 'The door would have been replaced in the new financial year and the replacement would not have had a lock on it.' Mrs Woodall resigned in August . after 32 years in the profession, the last six at Revoe. She claims she . had already handed in her notice before she was suspended. She . added: 'You hope that nothing will happen when you’re off and when it . does and you’re suspended as a result and ultimately potentially blamed . and it’s your name given out, it’s disappointing to say the least. 'A . lot of public money has been spent on an investigation - something the . police sorted out in 10 days and is taking the authority more than six . months to sort out. 'My . biggest disappointment was I retired still under suspension, that was . never lifted. 'I’m disappointed I didn’t get to see the children again . because the one thing my career was all about was the children. It’s . just sad to finish your career in that way. 'I . don’t hold anything against anybody personally but I would have liked . some closure, with the authority to acknowledge that I’d retired. 'I . had always intended to hand in my resignation when I returned to work . following the February half term break, it is simply coincidence that my . resignation was handed in around the time of the suspension.' It is understood some of the suspended staff will be returning to their posts, pending the outcome of individual disciplinary hearings. The school is now in the process of recruiting a new headteacher. Blackpool Council said: 'We can confirm Catherine Woodall has resigned from her post of headteacher at Revoe Primary School with effect from August 31, 2013. 'As the disciplinary process is still ongoing with several members of staff it would be inappropriate to comment on the statements made by Mrs Woodall in relation to the incident in February. 'The March 2013 Ofsted inspection, that deemed the school to be in special measures, identified the leadership to be inadequate. 'An inspection that took place in July states the interim leadership team have already had ""an immediate and positive impact"" which should give parents and pupils confidence that the school is now improving and moving forward.' Ros Homer, Blackpool branch secretary for the National Union of Teachers, said: 'I just find it very, very sad that it’s all happened. They were doing a good job, it was a very challenging school and staff were very highly qualified. 'Hopefully when the investigation comes to an end the school can draw a line under it.'","Catherine Woodall claimed education chiefs ignored her pleas for help in dealing with unruly children .

Libyan militants have vowed to kidnap Westerners and attack gas pipelines in revenge for the capture of Al Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Liby by U.S. special forces. Extremists took to Facebook to urge fellow Libyans to target ships and planes as well as taking U.S. citizens hostage in order to exchange them for imprisoned jihadists. Deborah Jones, the American ambassador to Libya, was yesterday summoned to speak to the country's justice minister to explain the U.S. government's actions. Al-Liby was kidnapped on the streets of Tripoli by a team of Navy Seals on Saturday, and is now apparently being held on a ship in the Mediterranean Sea. The 49-year-old, whose real name is Nazih al-Ruqaie, is suspected of involvement in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 which killed 224 civilians. In the wake of his capture, Libyan jihadists used a Facebook page called 'Benghazi is Protected by its People' to issue a chilling call to arms. It told Libyans to shut off access to the capital and kidnap citizens of the U.S. and its allies in order to use them to bargain for the release of imprisoned militants. The message also urged them to damage pipelines exporting gas to Europe, and target ships and planes. It said: 'Libya today is still a place of disbelief that is ruled by something other than the Shariah of Allah; thus, there is no security for disbelievers there.' Protest: Libyans set U.S. flags on fire as they demonstrated in Benghazi after al-Liby's capture . Opposition: Militants have vowed to strike back against Western citizens as well as infrastructure projects . In another message posted on forums and social media, a group called 'the Revolutionaries of Benghazi - al-Bayda, Derna' condemned al-Liby's capture. It accused Libya's leaders of having prior knowledge of the operation, although prime minister Ali Zeidan said at the weekend that the government had asked the United States to explain the raid. The group vowed to fight 'everyone who betrayed his country and involved himself in this conspiracy. We say that this shameful act will cost the Libyan government a lot and it will be as you will see and not as you hear.' Al-Liby has long been wanted by the FBI, and had a $5million bounty on his head at the time of his capture. Detained: Al-Liby is apparently being held on board USS San Antonio, pictured, in the Mediterranean . Since the fall of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Islamist militants have used Libya to smuggle out weapons and as a base for fighters. In September last year, a band of terrorists stormed the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and killed ambassador Chris Stevens along with three other Americans. North Africa is home to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as other Islamist affiliates who either co-operate with the network or sympathise with its ideology.","Jihadists call for Libyans to kidnap U.S. citizens and bomb ships or planes .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:51 EST, 8 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:38 EST, 8 October 2013 . More than £250,000 has been paid out to four civil servants accused of harassment, breaking safety laws, gross misconduct and not finishing work on time, it emerged today. The spending watchdog uncovered an extra 84 cases where controversial ‘compromise agreements’ where officials were paid off in a reward for failure, on top of 1,000 revealed in June this year. It included pay-offs for staff who had fallen out with colleagues, a bungled investigation into allegations of harassment and an attempt to sack an NHS manager who raised concerns about fraud and patient safety. Spending: Secret payout deals for civil servants risk being seen to 'reward failure', the National Audit Office said (file picture) The National Audit Office launched a probe into spending at the departments of health, culture and defence after revealing earlier this year that 1,053 gagging orders had been signed by government departments and the NHS since the general election, costing taxpayers £28million. It found that the government had approved some severance pay-outs in cases involving ‘failure or inappropriate behaviour’. Official Treasury guidance states that payments that ‘reward failure, inappropriate behaviour or dishonesty should not be approved’. But today the NAO said: ‘We found business cases referring to elements of alleged gross misconduct or staff harassment. ‘These alleged behaviours do not meet the standards of the Civil Service Code.’ The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, now run by Maria Miller, was singled out for particular criticism . In some cases pay-outs were agreed because government departments and agencies feared they would lose an industrial tribunal if the employee went to court. The NAO stressed that official Whitehall rules make clear that severance payments ‘should not be treated as a soft option, e.g. to avoid management action, disciplinary processes, unwelcome publicity or reputational damage’. The Treasury must also not approve ‘special severance payments that reward, or will be seen to reward failure, dishonesty or inappropriate behaviour’. But among 19 pay-outs agreed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, it found four which included examples of alleged failure or inappropriate behaviour. It included payments to three staff accused of ‘failure’, including breaching health and safety rules, ‘not producing work when requested’ and not demonstrating the ‘behaviours, values and full commitment’ expected from a senior manager. In a fourth case a member of staff was suspended pending an investigation into allegations of harassment towards colleagues. All four payments, valued at a combined total of £251,000, were approved by the Treasury. The allegations were upheld but due process was not followed, and as a result the punishment was reduced to a final written warning. The NAO added: ‘However, the hearing caused a breakdown in trust and confidence between the individual and a number of senior colleagues, and the arm’s-length body decided to terminate the individual’s employment. ‘Legal advice set out that the arm’s-length body had a slightly less than even chance of winning a claim for unfair dismissal even though the arm’s-length body believed that it had acted reasonably throughout. ‘Legal advice estimated potential compensation and legal costs of some £80,000 due to the nature of claims made, the witnesses required and the likely length of any hearing. ‘The Treasury approved a special severance payment of £16,000 for this case.’ Some payments were signed off because managers had failed to follow internal policies and procedures. Threes pay-outs were agreed by the Ministry of Defence because employment rules had not been followed and the government risked having to pay compensation. The NAO looked at 95 cases across five ministries totalling £3.4million. It found the Department of Health had 23 cases, including payouts worth more than £250,000. The Department for Education agreed deals worth up to £220,000, Ministry of Defence £120,000, Communities and Local Government £40,000 and Culture, Media and Sport almost £150,000. Of the 95 cases, 84 contained compromise agreements, and 74 included a confidentiality clause which stops the employee from revealing even the existence of the deal. Two contained what the NAO called a ‘gagging clause’ which stopped health workers from pursuing further complaints with a number of organisations, including the Care Quality Commission and the Department of Health. Procedures: The Ministry of Defence was criticised for making payouts to staff after failing to follow its own employment rules . The NAO said: ‘There is a risk that clauses like these might discourage the employee raising genuine concerns about service failure with the appropriate oversight bodies.’ In one case a manager who raised concerns about fraud and patient safety was later fired over  concerns about their own behaviour, but later restored after an employment tribunal. In the meantime their job had been made redundant, so they were paid off, with a confidentiality agreement stopping them from speaking out again. It also found examples where severance payments were agreed in response to failure to comply with internal policies and procedures. In three cases in the defence sector, managers had not followed the internal policy in relation to the employment of staff. As a result, severance payments were approved to avoid claims for compensation. It included the Ministry of Defence making a payment to a practice nurse working as a contractor for the forces after official guidance was not followed. The NAO has urged the government to issue guidance to departments on the use of compromise agreements and publish data on their use to pinpoint bodies with ‘unusually high numbers of agreements’.","National Audit Office unearths another 84 compromise agreements .

Savvy customer: Solicitor Andrew Myers, who has successfully sued First Capital Connect after discovering he was paying £700 more than the cheapest available ticket on his route . A commuter who learned he could have saved £700 a year by using a loophole to buy his train season ticket from a different station has fought a gagging order and won a landmark legal battle. City lawyer Andrew Myers sued First Capital Connect (FCC) when he discovered he was not sold the cheapest available fare for . his route into London. Mr Myers, who lives in St Albans, found he could buy a £3,068-a-year season ticket from Watford North, which is closer to London, but it could still be used from his home station, saving him £700. FCC initially stood up to him and tried to hit him with a 'gagging order' and settle out of court once he made his money-saving discovery. But he pursued them for the cash and after winning he is urging others to take advantage of his ruling and do the same if they are being 'ripped off'. 'Anyone who has bought a ticket in the past seven months should ask the . company why they have been charged £700 more when they realised back in . March a cheaper fare was available,' he said. 'It is . outrageous that FCC have been selling season tickets for £700 more. I . did not think it right that they could buy my silence.' Passenger groups and unions today praised the commuter for his legal fight. Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'The most . worrying part of this case is that FCC tried to buy Mr Myers' silence. 'They were worried that thousands of other passengers would follow his example and buy season tickets £700 cheaper as well. 'This is another example of First Group treating its passengers as cash cows.' Big win: Andrew Myers sued First Capital Connect after he discovered he could buy a season ticket for £700 cheaper thanks to a legal loophole . David Sidebottom, head of Passenger Focus, the rail travellers' pressure group, said: 'Passengers often say that they feel ""ripped-off"" and don't trust the railway industry to sell them the best-value ticket. 'If the industry is to rebuild passenger confidence, then it must act to tackle the complex and illogical fares system. 'This must include making terms attached to tickets much easier to work out.' He added: 'We are disappointed to see that, in this case, the company continued to resist making a speedy apology and provide recompense to the passenger, when internally it had already accepted it was wrong.' Mr Myers won the case at St Albans County Court, where a judge ruled the firm's behaviour was unreasonable. The firm was also ordered to pay his costs of £2,193. Bold: Litigator Mr Myers took the train firm to St Albans County Court (pictured) where a judge agreed that First Capital Connect had acted unreasonably . First Capital Connect said yesterday that Mr Myers had uncovered a 'previously unknown historic routing guide error', dating back to the days of British Rail. The firm said the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) was now taking steps to close the loophole. The rail company's spokesman said : 'The Association of Train Operating Companies is closing this loophole on our behalf. We are not aware of any other anomaly and believe that this was an isolated case. ' A Department for Transport spokesman said it was still considering ATOC's request. An ATOC spokesman said: 'This is an example of a very obscure error in a system that offers millions of tickets for travel between more than 2,500 stations. 'If other such errors are found, we will look to correct them to ensure that all passengers are treated fairly.'","Andrew Myers sued First Capital Connect (FCC) for not selling cheapest fare .

Angry: Victoria Hislop blasted the terms 'chick-lit' and 'women's fiction' for needlessly categorising texts . It has become one of the publishing world’s most popular genres. But don’t label Victoria Hislop’s books as ‘chick lit’ - it makes her ‘really angry’. The author, 54, also criticised the use of the label “women’s fiction” by publishers - and said having fiction prizes for women was ‘an anachronism’. She said women are ‘proving themselves as writers’ and there it was no longer necessary to have a ‘special place’ to celebrate their efforts. ‘There isn’t a need,’ she said. ‘Maybe it’s going too much the other way, maybe there should be men’s prize.’ She said the label “women’s fiction” was championed by marketing teams at publishing houses but that she disagreed with her work being put into that category. ‘I don’t see myself like that,’ she said. ‘My books are full of civil wars and disease and people dying - it’s not really “women’s fiction”.’ Mrs Hislop, who is married to Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, said she believed the term came ‘partly from a desire to somehow make bookshops more manageable’. ‘We have crime, we have erotica - there’s always a desire to split and categorise and give titles. But “women’s” is 50 per cent of us.... We don’t have “men’s” fiction,’ she said. Speaking to an audience at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she said: ‘I personally really get angry when somebody describes my work as “chicklit”. ‘It can be very annoying for a writer to be described as something when they just want to be a writer.’ She blamed publishers’ marketing departments for spreading the term. ‘We don’t really have control at the marketing end of things. As writers we don’t necessarily have a choice,’ she said. ‘It’s the people who want to sell our books.’ But she added she did not imagine the situation changing in the future. ‘I don’t think women are going to rise up and say “take our names off the cover, we don't want to be seen as women”,’ she said. Mrs Hislop also explained that she did not consider audience when she sat down to write a novel. ‘When I’m writing I don’t think I’m writing for women at all, I don’t think about who I’m writing for. ‘I think it’s something that happens a little bit down the line.’ Victoria with husband, Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, who attended her talk, and children, William and Emily . She revealed her literary heroine was Emily Bronte, the author of Wuthering Heights, because she treated ‘place as a character’. But she added: ‘The writers I would love to write like but wouldn’t dream of emulating are men.’ She listed Ian McEwen, Julian Barnes and Spanish author Javier Marias as her favourites. She appeared at the festival alongside author Penelope Lively, who agreed ‘it was not essential’ to have special prizes and categories for women writers. One of Miss Lively’s works features in Mrs Hislop’s new collection of 100 short stories by women, The Story. The collection focuses on ‘love, loss and lives of women’. Mrs Hislop said she preferred short stories written by women because they ‘go straight to the heart of emotion more easily’. But she added her decision to compile the collection was ‘partly pragmatic’ and she hoped a collection of men’s short stories would follow. 'When I'm writing I don't think I'm writing for women at all, I don't think about who I'm writing for,' she said . She added: ‘There’s no doubt women and men write differently. I don’t think either necessarily write better, but they do write differently.’ Mrs Hislop added it had ‘never even crossed her mind’ to include her own work in the collection. She is best known for her bestselling first novel, The Island, which is set in Crete. The book sold over a million copies and was the Richard and Judy Summer Read 2006. Mrs Hislop worked in publishing and journalism before becoming an author. She has two children with husband Ian, who is a panellist on the long-running BBC show Have I Got News For You. Mr Hislop was in the audience at the festival to support his wife.","Author said no longer necessary to have 'special place' to celebrate women .

A little girl died in agony in her parents' arms after doctors repeatedly failed to discuss the findings of a crucial MRI scan, which showed she had water on the brain, an inquest has today heard. Alice Mason survived successful surgery to treat a brain tumour and was responding well to chemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea in February 2011. However, her condition deteriorated after she returned home a month later and she was taken to hospital feeling dizzy, lethargic and unable to walk or sit without help. Alice Mason, two, died after doctors repeatedly failed to discuss the findings of an MRI scan. She had suffered irreversible brain damage following treatment for a brain tumour . Alice's parents, Rosalind and Gareth Mason, spent eight days pleading with doctors to treat their daughter, but crucial tests were repeatedly delayed. By the time the tests were carried out at Kingston Hospital in south west London, Alice had suffered irreversible brain damage caused by water on the brain and emergency surgery could not save her. Mr and Mrs Mason first contacted the Royal Marsden Hospital and their local hospital in Kingston raising their concerns about Alice's deterioration on March 18, 2011. However, doctors said the symptoms were . likely to be linked to the chemotherapy drugs and told Alice's parents . to wait for a routine MRI scan, due some days later. Alice's parents Gareth and Rosalind Mason, pictured outside West London Coroners' Court, claim nine chances to treat their daughter's symptoms were missed by doctors . The scan showed signs of hydrocephalus - water on the brain - but Mr and Mrs Mason were told by the Royal Marsden to take their daughter home. But Stergios Zacharoulis, a specialist oncologist at the hospital who was in charge of Alice’s care, admitted he failed to discuss the results of her MRI scan for three days - between March 21 and 23 - because doctors weren’t in. He said he discussed Alice’s condition with doctors at Kingston Hospital, who were also involved in her care, and urged them to give her a CT scan if her condition got worse. He told West London Coroner’s Court: 'I did see Alice and informed Kingston Hospital about the concerns. 'We . discussed numerous times with Kingston Hospital that we were very . concerned. If the patient shows any other signs of deterioration we must . get a CT scan.' And he . said he 'regretted' not immediately referring Alice to St George’s . Hospital in south London, where she could have been operated on. But he said her rising temperature suggested she might have an infection and so he didn’t refer her. He said: 'There was a rising temperature that was concerning. It was 38C at that time. 'I . wish I had done that straight away, the reason I didn’t do it was . because we have discussed with neurosurgeons those processes and the . first thing they say is to make sure the infection is under control . before they operate.' An inquest heard staff at Kingston Hospital in south London failed to act on the advice of a specialist oncologist at the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, to give Alice a CT scan if her condition worsened . Assistant Coroner Sean Cummings said he was concerned that a lack of communication led to crucial delays in Alice’s care. He said: 'I’m concerned there seems to have been a sequence of issues in terms of communication. 'When Alice was seen on March 21 it was noted that she had some issues of unsteadiness. 'I’m finding it difficult to see why, if you went to the MRI department to discuss it on March 23 you were concerned enough to go and discuss it, but because there wasn’t anyone there you left it until the next day. 'Then nothing happened on the next day you left it again until the MDT (multi-disciplinary team) meeting, but it was cancelled. 'You say there was assistance requesting the CT scan, but that seems rather vague to me. 'I’m not sure there was a sufficient grasp on this.' Within hours of leaving hospital in Chelsea her condition had worsened and she was admitted to Kingston Hospital, vomiting repeatedly. But despite Dr Zacharoulis's instructions, staff at the hospital failed to order a CT scan. And Dr Zacharoulis failed to call a consultant at Kingston to discuss the case, the inquest heard. In total, her parents claim that nine opportunities to act on the symptoms were missed. A few days later marked hydrocephalus - water on the brain - was eventually found, and urgent surgery ordered to drain the fluid to relieve pressure inside the skull. But there were further delays before Alice was operated on at St George’s Hospital in south London. Alice never regained consciousness. Further scans found that the water on the brain had caused irreversible brain damage, and she died in her parents’ arms on March 30, 2011. The inquest continues.","Alice Mason died after suffering irreversible brain damage .

'Deputies stayed on scene and were very vigilant looking around the property and approximately 30 minutes later, they found the baby in the back shed area,' said Joaquin Enriquez of Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. The infant was awake and alert but was taken to hospital with life-threatening injuries, including a possible skull fracture. On Monday, she was in stable condition and officials said she was expected to survive. The mother was also rushed to hospital. The teen could face charges because she could have dropped the infant off at a nearby hospital or fire station under Arizona's 'Safe Haven' law but didn't. The 2001 law allows anyone to anonymously drop off unharmed infants within 72 hours of their birth, no questions asked. Hospital: Both mother and baby were rushed to hospital but they are believed to be in stable condition . The home is located around the corner from a fire station and about a mile from a hospital. The teenage mother is under observation at the hospital. She has not been arrested, but detectives are treating this as a potential criminal investigation. Child Protective Services has been contacted and is working with deputies to determine exactly what happened. Raising awareness of the 12-year-old law has proved a challenge, Phoenix Fire Deputy Chief Chris Ketterer told Azcentral.com. 'It breaks my heart to hear that sometimes they simply don't know what to do and they choose to discard the child as if they were trash,' he said. 'This is not a birth control or right-to-life issue.

Three men and a woman found shot dead in a car in Alabama last week had each written suicide notes proclaiming their innocence of child pornography allegations and outlining how they wanted their funerals to go, police said on Monday. Kristie Hunt Campbell Hamrick, 39; her ex-husband, Samuel Hamrick, 30; her brother, Robert Andy Keith Hunt, 38; and Kevin Carey, 30, a family friend were discovered Wednesday night by the side of a logging road in William B.

Hunt is believed to have been the gunman, killing the three others with a 12-gauge shotgun inside the vehicle before taking his own life, Harris said. The Hamricks had been scheduled to appear in court in Tennessee in an FBI child-pornography investigation the day their bodies were found. Harris said he couldn't discuss the case on Monday but said it was likely all four were caught up in the inquiry. 'Something was a bond for them together, and it may be it was as simple as criminality was their bond,' he told WBRC TV of Birmingham.

He told The Birmingham News: 'If you have the FBI coming in to investigate, it's pretty serious.' All four had left statements in the car, written on legal paper, that proclaimed their innocence, listed family contacts and outlined their funeral wishes. Harris told The News that it was one of the most bizarre cases he has ever handled in his police career. 'If someone was an aspiring writer, they might have an episode out of this,' he said.

Kerri, Julie and Mike Kasem say they are concerned for Kasem's well-being because their step-mother Jean Kasem, 59, has blocked access to the ailing broadcast legend for the three of them - as well as for many longtime friends. On Monday they filed a petition for conservatorship in Los Angeles County court, asking a judge to award them control of their father's treatment.

She says that she hasn’t even been allowed in the house for 10 years. ‘Jean has never, once  in the 30 years called us up and said, 'Let's hang out, let's do something.' It just doesn't happen. Not your typical wicked step-mother: Casey Kasem's children say they know they have already been cut out from their fathers' will but do not regard Jean Kasem (pictured) as evil because there is 'no communication' She's . never wanted a relationship with any of us.

In fact, she and her siblings - from Casey's first marriage to Linda Myers - just want to see their father. 'Your children are here for you,' Kerri told the website. 'We have not abandoned you."" The group held signs up with various messages imploring Jean to relent. One of his daughters held up a neon placard with the words: 'Jean, why won't you let me see my Dad.'

At the surface Michele Ballarin may look like a thoroughbred socialite, but according to a new interview, she holds so much influence in Somalia that many of the country’s notorious pirates refer to her as ‘amira’, or ‘princess’ in Arabic. In the latest Washington Post magazine, Ballarin, a 58-year-old hailing from Virginia, says that her humanitarian efforts to eradicate piracy in Somalia have earned her a large fan base in the country. A senior U.S. government official once even went on-the-record to say that Ballarin ‘has more sway in Somalia than the whole U.S. Government.’ Somali princess: Michelle Ballarin (pictured above) is said to have 'more sway in Somalia than the whole U.S. government' She has now embarked on a new . humanitarian venture with Somalia’s former president Sheikh Sharif . Sheikh Ahmed to help provide housing for the country’s large population . of refugees. Ballarin says . that she is known to negotiate with Somalia’s notorious pirates, and . that she has had a ‘behind the scenes’ hand in organizing the release of . pirate hostages. She also . says that she has carried out peaceful conversations with all walks of . Somali life as part of her work, including pirates and members of the Al-Shabab group, the terrorist organization responsible for last month’s . brutal attacks on a Nairobi mall. 'When I was in the . north...there was close to 80,000 people trying to get to . me. They call me the “Mother of Somalia""' She . says she is not afraid of these more feared sects of Somali society. ‘They would have a tsunami on their hands,’ Ballarin said of what would . happen if she were injured by a Somali fringe group. ‘When I was in the . north at one point, there was close to 80,000 people trying to get to . me. They call me the “Mother of Somalia”…there would be terrible . repercussions.’ But despite her pull within Somali society, Ballarin has apparently never worked for the U.S. Government. In . 2007, she sent an ‘unsolicited letter’ to the CIA offering her services . in tracking down Al Qaeda networks in Africa. The bureau sent her a . letter back saying that they were ‘not interested’ in her services and . did not authorize her to carry out her terrorist-finding mission on its . behalf. Friends in high places: Michelle Ballarin sits with business partner and former Somali president Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed . But Ballarin was . undeterred. According to the paper, she sought solace at the Pentagon . the following year—an effort that was rewarded with a classified . contract for an undisclosed amount of money. Within a year, the . contract was reportedly terminated for ‘nonperformance.’ Esther . Hebert, who has worked with Ballarin, told The Washington Post: ‘She has an . amazing ability to attract very powerful people. Then it all falls . apart.’ ‘I was known as the Coco Chanel in the children’s industry’ Ballarin had many careers before focusing her . attentions on Somalia, the paper says. In 1986 she ran for Congress and lost, a defeat . that prompted her to design children’s clothes, which she says were sold in . Macy’s. ‘I was known as the Coco Chanel in the children’s industry,’ she . said of her design career. (Ballarin is also a fashion plate who is . cited as wearing Armani and Ferragamo clothing in the piece) Ballarin’s . childrenswear business closed following her first marriage (to a man 35 . years her senior). She then took up work as an executive assistant to an . orthodontist to try and keep her and her son financially afloat. Her . luck changed with her second marriage to Gino Ballarin, a longtime . maître d’ at New York’s famous 21 Club. The couple . relocated to the Washington D.C. metro area after their wedding, where Gino worked in a . similar capacity at the Georgetown Club, while Michele dabbled in . investment banking. Coastal storm: Ballarin says that she has had a hand in negotiating the release of Somali pirate hostages . Her . foray into finance gave Michele access to a vast array of wealthy . people. By enlisting what seems to be an acute knack for sociability, she quickly cemented her status as a gala circuit-ing businesswoman . on the D.C. scene. That . positioning gave her access to an encounter with an ‘elder Sufi sheik’ from Somalia’s prevailing religion. Ballarin became fascinated with the . Sufi religion, as well as Somali culture as a whole. She soon began . making goodwill trips to the country and amassed a following of Somali . constituents who nicknamed her their princess. Her . sage Somali influence spread, and in 2009 then-President Ahmed named . her his ‘presidential advisor for Reconstruction and Humanitarian . Assistance.’ The appointment came at the heat of Somalia’s pirating . crisis. In fact, Ballarin . has already been involved in several Somalia development programs that . did not work out. Her nation-building program, dubbed the ‘organic . solution’, included plans for everything from banks to commercial . airlines. The project dissolved after nine months, with many of its . investors failing to recoup tens of thousands of dollars, The Washington Post reports. Another Ballarin company titled Archangel similarly never got off the ground. Brick and mortar: Ballarin has now embarked on a new project with President Ahmed, building tiny modular homes (in the foreground, above) for Somali refugees . But . Ballarin--who provided multiple photo albums to The Washington Post . writer as proof of her popularity in Somalia in which she was seen . ‘posing with Somali politicians, warlords, clan leaders, and Sufis,’--has . now teamed up with former President Ahmed again.

They . have begun work on a housing project for Somali refugees called the . ‘Oasis Foundation for Hope’. Ballarin and Ahmed have already created a . modular demo with the help of pro-bono contractors, as was the case with . many of her former business ventures. She . unveiled the modular home to investors and government compatriots in . August, admitting to The Washington Post that Ahmed had already ‘identified’ $300 . million in project funding. Geoff .

"By . Joshua Gardner and Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:27 EST, 7 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:19 EST, 7 October 2013 . A $35 million experimental military airship was damaged Monday when part of the World War II era blimp hangar in which it is stored collapsed, causing the dirigible to spew helium. The roof collapse was reported early this morning at the Marine Corps Air Station, a former military base in Orange County, California and a hazardous material crew rushed in to stop the leak. The accident is a blow to the hopeful collaboration between the Department of Defense and NASA, who’ve invested heavily in the futuristic vessel because of its potential to one day carry more cargo than any other aircraft to disaster zones and military bases. Missing: Following the roof collapse, a walkway and small tower appeared to be missing form atop the hangar (pictured) Deflating: The innovative prototype next generation dirigible could be seen deflating in photographs after the collapse . Accident: The Aeroscraft has the military and shipping industry eager for production on the breakthrough dirigible to start, but Monday's accident will likely dampen that enthusiasm, at least temporarily . ‘There's a giant hole in the roof,’ Captain Steve Concialdi of the Orange County Fire Authority said after the 7:45am collapse. Big: After the collapse, which was reported around 7:30am Monday, a 25-foot hole could be seen in the ceiling of the 70-year-old hangar . The cause of the collapse was not known, but the partial collapse left a 25-foot by 25-foot hole in the hangar and part of the debris crashed through the 200 foot dirigible. The dirigible is being developed by Worldwide Aeros, which says it will be capable of carrying 66 tons of cargo. Marine Corps Air Station's Tustin Hangars were originally built in 1942 and became an historical landmark in 1978 after their role in World War II. The hangars were also a base of operations for helicopters during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The military closed the station in 1999. The groundbreaking airship, dubbed . Aeroscraft, has had government officials and aerospace enthusiasts . waiting anxiously for the first delivery in what has been envisioned as a . fleet of the craft—slated for as early as 2015. The extent of damage to the vessel is . not known, but photos taken by the Orange County Register show the ship . deflating noticeably. Worldwide . Aeros says the cargo airship's potential to carry more cargo more . efficiently than ever before would provide the U.S. military with an . advantage on the battlefield and greater capacity to save more lives . during natural disasters. Collapse: A section of a walkway on the top of the North Tustin blimp hangar appears to have collapsed damaging a 200-foot experimental zeppelin inside and causing a helium leak on Monday . Crash: A partial roof collapse on Monday left a 25-foot by 25-foot hole in the roof of the hangar and some of the debris caused a helium leak in the dirigible . Bummer: The mishap likely dampened the spirits of the Department of Defense and NASA, who've invested $35 million in the next generation zepellin for military use . The ship’s potential for super long range flights would also be a boon for the shipping industry. There . are two versions envisioned for the ship. One model would be able to . fly 3,567 miles on one tank of diesel and with a full cargo payload of . 66 tons. Another could carry 250 tons across 7,000 miles. It requires only a third as much fuel . as an airplane carrying cargo, and it can take off and land anywhere . even without a formal airstrip - including on water - making it well . suited to war zones and disaster areas. Worldwide . Aeros predicts that it will change the way goods are moved around the . world by providing a mode of transport which is cheaper than planes but . faster than ships. Revolutionary: The $35 million airship prototype is being developed by Worldwide Aeros, a company that hopes to revolutionize how cargo is shipped around the world . New: The biggest breakthrough in the Aeroscraft is its ability to compress helium and make the ship heavier or lighter as necessary . The key technological breakthrough . came when the firm's founder Igor Pasternak came up with a way to . compress helium, which allows the airship to control its weight. The Aeroscraft can take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, so it can visit destinations which do not have an airport. Ukrainian-born founder of Worldwide Aeros, Igor Pasternak, has turned his method for compressing helium into an aerospace breakthrough. By giving an airship the ability to become heavier and lighter when necessary, Pasternak's method allows it to stay in place while unloading cargo. The Aeroscraft will be able to fly directly to where goods are made and transport them directly to where they need to be delivered. The ship can take off and land vertically and without runways. On a single tank of helium, the dirigible can travel 3,567 miles along with a full cargo load of 66 tons. The soft, Mylar skin of the craft holds in smaller balloons of helium. The Aeroscraft is built to military specifications, so bullets cannot pierce its shell. Unlike balloons, though, the ship will no deflate from just one hole. Shown here on a test flight, the Aeroscraft was slated to soon make its maiden voyage when the roof collapsed, damaging its prototype. Worldwied Aeros says its hopes to put the ships into production by 2015 . The Aeroscraft was stored in a hangar at Tustin, California's Marine Corps Station when a huge chunk of the roof collapsed, damaging the dirigible. The hangars were originally built in 1942. They housed blimps during World War II. During the Korean and Vietnam Wars, the hangars and station were a base for helicopters. The station became an historic landmark in 1978. It was closed in 1999. This . means that even though its 115mph average speed is much slower than a . jet at 500mph-plus, the overall travel time could be lower because it . can travel directly from where goods are produced to where they are . needed. Worldwide Aeros . hopes that this will make it useful to the military and aid charities . operating in parts of the world with poorly developed infrastructure on . the ground. The lighter-than-air vehicle is not a blimp because it has a rigid structure made out of ultra-light carbon fiber and aluminum underneath its high-tech Mylar skin. Inside, balloons hold the helium that gives the vehicle lift. Unlike hydrogen, the gas used in the Hindenburg airship that crashed in 1937, helium is not flammable. The airship can take off vertically, like a helicopter, then change its buoyancy to become heavier than air for landing and unloading. The ship’s ballast can be controlled by the captain during drop off of cargo, which keeps the ship from tipping over. A call to a spokesperson for Worldwide Aeros was not immediately returned.","The Aeroscraft is a prototype helium dirigible that developers hope will change the way the world ships its goods .

Only around ten per cent of people who are struck by lightning die, usually because the bolt of electricity causes their heart and breathing to stop. Those who survive tend to wake up from the shock within a few seconds but have little recollection of what happened before the injury. They could suffer minor burns and stroke-like symptoms. A doctor may later point to lightning strikes as the cause of injury.

A Kenyan Intelligence report leaked yesterday revealed the target of this weekend’s CIA raid in Somalia - and confirmed that the British terrorist known as the 'White Widow' helped to plot a series of planned attacks in the region. Navy SEAL Team Six was seeking for Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir when it targeted a beach home near Mogadishu, according to the report. The attack was initially believed to have targeted  al-Shabaab strongman Ahmed Abdi Godane or a Chechen terrorist known as Abu Ciyad. An imminent threat: al-Shabaab terrorists, seen here, are believed to pose a worldwide security threat . Abdulkadir, a Kenyan militant who has planned multiple attacks against his home country, somehow escaped the pre-dawn raid. Known as Ikrima, he has been previously labelled as the lead planner of al-Qaeda linked plots to bomb the Kenyan Parliament building and the United Nations offices in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. Al-Shabaab has bragged that it knew SEALS planned to storm the beach house, which may have contributed to them being in a position to fight the elite commandos off. The intelligence report fails to . directly link Abdulkadir to the Westgate Mall attacks that saw over 60 . people executed – but, in a note dated one year to the day before the . siege began, claims the extremist was planning an attack against either the shopping center or Holy Family Basilica. Close proximity: The Navy SEAL raid in the coastal town of Baraawe was about 130 miles south of Mogadishu . The Navy SEALs operation in Somalia underscores the threat posed by the convergence of insurgent groups, particularly al-Shabab and the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to an intelligence analyst. Ikrima is ‘someone who is truly a go-between between al-Shabab, AQAP and probably al-Qaeda central,’ said Frank Cilluffo, director of George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute. ‘What you're seeing is some of the pooling of these various entities and between various organizations,’ Mr Cilluffo continued. ‘And you are starting to see convergence of individual actors and of even planning and operations.’ The U.S. is going after top-level . terrorists who are targeting foreign and Western interests, rather than . internal Somali targets, Mr Cillufo noted. Wanted: Samantha Lewthwaite, known as the 'White Widow,' is one of the world's most hunted terrorists . The report also shed more light on the terror links of Samantha Lewthwaite, who was named as a 'key actor' in an planned attack on Kenya's parliament and UN buildings. The so-called ‘White . Widow’ - the world’s most wanted woman - is also said to have been part . of a terrorist cell targeting Kenyan Defence Force camps, Western . embassies and the assassination of the country’s top politicians. It is the first time the mother-of-four has been named in connection with the plots . which were foiled by the Kenyan authorities, underlining her importance . to Somali-based, Al Qaeda-inspired terror groups. She gained her fearsome reputation after her husband, Germaine Lindsay, helped bomb the London transport network in the 7/7 attacks of 2005.","Navy SEAL Team Six was after senior al-Shabaab operative Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir .

An eight-year-old cancer sufferer, who became an internet sensation after millions viewed a video of his touchdown run at a Nebraska spring football game, is in remission, his father revealed today. Jack Hoffman, who has an inoperable brain tumor, captured the hearts of Nebraska football fans when, with the players' help, he ran 69 yards to score during April's intrasquad game. His determined run was viewed nearly 8.4 million times on YouTube and replayed on national television - and even earned him a visit to the White House to meet President Obama. Jack's father, Andy Hoffman, said the good news about the brain tumor came after an MRI test. Fighter: Cancer sufferer Jack Hoffman, who became an internet sensation after his touchdown run with Nebraska, is in remission. Doctors have learned his brain tumor has stopped growing . 'Doctors came in and said this tumor is rock-solid stable,' Hoffman said, noting doctors compared Wednesday's MRI to a baseline MRI done in June and saw the malignancy had stopped growing. The encouraging news was tempered by warnings from the doctors: More than half of all kids in Jack's situation have relapses. 'We pray like crazy and hope Jack isn't in that segment,' Hoffman said. But it's a long journey, he continued, 'and the doctors have done a good job of preparing us'. Jack's tumor grew back after two surgeries in 2011, and it occupies a spot near his brain stem. The location is considered inoperable now, Hoffman said, but that could change. Winner: Jack, who was 7 when he appeared on the pitch in April, won an ESPY award for his video . Support: Nebraska's Taylor Martinez guides Jack Hoffman down the field for his touchdown play during a special segment dedicated to Hoffman during the Red-White spring NCAA college football game . Making friends: After the video went viral, he even went to the White House to meet President Obama . The boy's future is filled with MRI scans: one every three months for the next year, every six months for the year following, and then once a year. Jack is a second-grader at a school near the family's home in Atkinson, a city of about 1,240 people in north-central Nebraska. The brave cancer patient's chance to join the Huskers came through his family's friendship with the team's former star running back Rex Burkhead. Burkhead befriended Jack shortly after the brain cancer was diagnosed in April 2011. Their friendship grew into the Team Jack campaign that has raised awareness and funds for research. 'Jack is a fighter, a strong kid,' Burkhead said. 'To see him run around and enjoy the Husker experience, it's a dream come true, especially for kids in the state of Nebraska.' Friends: Jack stands with former Nebraska football player Rex Burkhead after meeting with President Obama in Washington in April. The team has continued to support the family throughout its battle . His video also won an ESPY award as the 'Best Moment' of the year in July. Jack and his dad met with President . Obama in the Oval Office in April. Republican Senator Deb Fischer from . Nebraska helped arrange the Washington visit for the Hoffmans. Andy Hoffman said the president presented his son with a new football and told him he was proud of him. The rest of his family will continue to raise money for cancer research through the Team Jack Foundation. 'We're not living life in fear,' Hoffman said. 'We're busy living.'","Jack Hoffman's father revealed that MRI scans showed that the boy's inoperable brain tumor has stopped growing .

Comedienne and writer Jennifer Saunders has hit out at the BBC claiming that the corporation has become 'an executive-run place for idiots.' The Absolutely Fabulous star said that it is no longer fun to work at the BBC and that it has become 'unrecognisable' from what it once was, in an interview to promote her autobiography, Bonkers: My Life In Laughs. Miss Saunders described how the BBC has changed since her and comedy partner Dawn French first arrived at Television Centre at the beginning of their career. She told Glamour magazine: 'It's become top-heavy in such an ugly way. They went corporate instead of being what they should be, which is a national resource, a place which trains people and curates the best programmes, and encourages talent and does great news and journalism.' 'They just became a corporate, executive-run place for idiots. 'It's just so weird that they could put people off coming into the building.' The 55-year-old star told the magazine how she wanted to shout at one unnamed former director general for preferring to spend money on lavish lunches at the Ivy than on commissioning programmes. Ms Saunders said that in the old days, the BBC was full of people who were happy to be working there despite getting paid little. She said that now too much focus is placed on holding 'workshops' to help executives to make decisions. The Bafta winner questioned the wisdom of appointing people who cannot make decisions already to management roles. Change for the worse: Saunders, pictured here with Dawn French, has told Glamour magazine that the BBC is 'unrecognisable' from when she and her comedy partner first arrived at Television Centre . New home: The comedienne described the BBC's new northern base as 'soulless' Jennifer also criticised the BBC's move to its new 'soulless' northern centre at Salford Quays in Greater Manchester. During her 30-year career Miss Saunders has won three Baftas and an International Emmy in 1994 for Absolutely Fabulous, the series she wrote and appeared in as Bollinger-swilling PR Edina Monsoon, alongside co-star Joanna Lumley. The once highly successful French and Saunders, which ran for 20 years on the BBC until 2007, eventually fell victim to budget cuts at the corporation . Jennifer married Ade Edmondson in 1985, and they have three grown-up daughters, Ella, Beattie and Freya, plus grandson Freddie. Despite her huge success as Edina alongside Joanna Lumley in Absolutely Fabulous, which was reprised last year for a series of 20th anniversary shows, she told Glamour that the show will not be turned into a film. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009 following a routine mammogram. Tests revealed it to be several malignant lumps. Miss Saunders underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Following the treatment she was given Tamoxifen which she has revealed plunged her straight into menopause and depression.","The Absolutely Fabulous writer spoke out in a Glamour magazine interview .

There are no ants in Angela Goodwin's pants... because she keeps a pair of anteaters in her washing machine. The 37-year-old bought Pua seven years ago and Aurora in 2011 to keep her company. And now the nocturnal pair are never happier than when they're curled up in her washer during the day or when they're roaming the house at night - keeping it free from pesky ants. Scroll down for video . Anteaters in her pants: Pua and Aurora Now curl up in her washer during the day and roam the house at night - keeping her house free from pesky ants . High five! Pua stands on a washing machine at Angela's home in Oakridge, Oregon. She bought one of the unusual pets seven years ago and a second in 2011 . Angela, an online administrator from Oakridge, Oregon, USA, says her besnouted pets are very intelligent and can open doors, drawers and windows. And they can even break into her fridge to raid their favourite snack - chilled ants. She said: 'I have to keep everything locked and bolted when they are not being supervised just to prevent problems. Sleepy time: Angela, who lives alone with the furry pets, says she managed to house-train her first anteater, Pua (pictured), by using a litter tray and now lets her sleep in her bed . Ant licker: Anteaters have long tongues so they can lick up as many ants or termites as possible in the wild. Their tongues are covered with thousands of tiny hooks called filiform papillae which are used to hold the insects together with large amounts of saliva . Angela, an online administrator from Oakridge, Oregon, says her pets are very intelligent and can open doors (left), drawers and windows and love nothing more than dressing up (right) Creatures of the night: Pua and Aurora are of the tamandua subspecies and largely nocturnal, although occasionally go for walks with Angela during the day . 'They can't be taught as easily as a dog but they will learn to do things if there's something in it for them.' Angela, who lives alone with the furry pets, says she managed to house-train her first anteater, Pua, by using a litter tray and now lets her sleep in her bed. And the long-clawed creatures - native to the forests of South America - also like swinging from her shelves in her living room. She said: 'One of the best things about having anteaters is they are entertaining - even when they are getting into trouble and raiding the refrigerator. An anteater's life: To accommodate her pets Angela puts tree branches around her house for them to clamber on, and logs for them to scratch... as well as a cosy hammock to rest in . Curious creatures: And they like to go for trips with Angela in the car where they usually spent the entire journey with their snouts pressed against the window, looking out . 'You can't really be mad at them because they are not being bad, it's just in their nature. Anteaters are most commonly found in the wild throughout South and Central America, although smaller numbers can now be found in parts of the U.S. They have long snouts, tongues and claws to help eat their preferred meal of ants or termites. Their method of eating involves flitting between ant hills or termite nests very quickly, licking up as many ants as they can before they get bitten. Giant anteaters are known to get through up to 200 nests in one sitting to sate their huge appetites. Their tongues are covered with thousands of tiny hooks - called filiform papillae - which trap the insects in their huge amounts of sticky saliva. The anteater's stomach, like a bird's gizzard, has hard folds which contract and relax to grind the insects down - a digestive process helped by small amounts of ingested sand and dirt. The tongue is attached all the way down to the sternum and can flick 150 times per minute. 'Pua will get into the fridge because I keep ants in there for her.' And she found that their favourite spot to curl up is the washing machine. Angela said: 'Pua used to sleep in my bed, but then she found the washing machine and loves being in there. 'She's learned to open the door just enough that it closes behind her when she gets in. 'Aurora often leaves the door open which really irritates Pua.' Pua and Aurora are of the tamandua subspecies and largely nocturnal, although occasionally go for walks with Angela during the day. In the wild anteaters live on a diet of ants, terminates and bees - but Angela says her pets have developed a taste for blue cheese. To accommodate her pets Angela puts tree branches around her house for them to clamber on, and logs for them to scratch. She said: 'They can be quite destructive when they get bored. I came home once to find they had burrowed through the dry wall.' And for potential owners there are more downsides. Angela said: 'Anteaters are quite smelly - people say they smell like skunks. 'They are also very messy and their food gets spread around from sticking to their claws. I'm constantly clearing up after them. 'Sometimes the dogs will follow them around hoping for food to fall off their claws. Creature comforts: In the wild anteaters live on a diet of ants, terminates and bees - but Angela says her pets have developed a taste for blue cheese .

Messy: Angela says anteaters are smelly and very messy and 'their food gets spread around from sticking to their claws' Cute: Anteater Pua sits in a carrybag as it wears a jean jacket . 'I wasn't able to house-train Aurora so she's happy wetting the bed where she's sleeping.' However, Angela is undeterred and says her anteaters make great pets. She said: 'Pua loves to spending time with me - she'll sniff my breath and play with me. 'We've spent hours running up and down the hallways and wrestling. 'She spends a lot more time with Aurora now but she still really enjoys spending some time with me.'","Angela Goodwin keeps Pua and Aurora in her home in Oakridge, Oregon .

Long-finned pilot whales or globicephala melas are very sociable and family-orientated animals and are even known to socialise with bottle nosed-dolphins. Authorities have not yet revealed why they think the whales beached on such a huge scale today. But a theory among some biologists is that if a dominant or leader whale is sick and beaches, other whales in the group will follow because of the way their social structure works, and also run aground.

A two-year-old girl with a rare nerve disorder is unable to take a potentially life-changing drug because the government shutdown means her clinical trial has been put on hold. Heidi and Greg MacCurtain, from Plymouth, Massachusetts, expressed their anger that their daughter Abby is being barred from a better quality of life simply because the government is 'not getting along'. The little girl, who is unable to sit or walk and relies on a feeding tube for seven hours a day, suffers from Leigh's disease, a rare incurable disease that affects the central nervous system and causes seizures and the loss of motor skills. Scroll down for video . Victim: Abby MacCurtain (pictured with her mother Heidi), who suffers from a rare nerve disorder, is unable to take part in a clinical trial because it has been halted by the government shutdown . She was scheduled to begin a new clinical trial last week of the EPI-743 drug at the National Institute. The trial has already been carried out on Italian patients and improvement in function was noted. But nearly three-quarters of workers at the NIH have been furloughed due to the government shutdown, which began at midnight last Monday, and new trials have been put on hold. 'We were angry,' her father Greg told NBC Nightly News. 'Angry for my daughter. And how can they not get along to make this work?' Her mother Heidi added: 'I want to give her the best, and having the EPI-743 so close to our hands and ripped away is unimaginable.' Hope on hold: Abby's parents said the drug would greatly improve the quality of her life. The condition, Leigh's Disease, means the two-year-old is unable to sit up or walk and is prone to seizures . Fears: Greg and Heidi MacCurtain said they are exasperated that the government is unable to get on . Concerns: All they can do is search for privately-funded trials that may help their daughter . The NIH enrolls around 200 patients a . week for new trials, including 30 children - but all must now wait until . the government opens again. For now, all the MacCurtain family can do is wait for privately-funded clinical trials. 'We won't stop at anything until we get her on the treatment that she needs and deserves,' her father said. There have been other stories across the country of crucial clinical trials being put on hold due to the shutdown. Eight-year-old Maddie Major, a leukemia patient from Baltimore, is also in limbo because the clinial trial she needs cannot be approved by the FDA, as it has also been shut down. Closed: Only essential employees can work during the shutdown, and around 75% of National Institute of Health workers have been furlough. Here, the World War Veterans Park in Staten Island, New York . Her mother, Robyn, told CBS: 'I am completely blown away by how callous and how carelessly they’ve just kind of used us as their pawns to push their own agenda.' Of the 200 patients beginning trials, around 10 are cancer patients. Those already enrolled in clinical trials will still receive care. A partial shut down of the government began for the first time in 17 years on October 1, after a partisan stalemate over health insurance reform in Congress blocked the budgeting process.

The website wrote about the footage: 'We have all no doubt seen the Range Rover episode that we posted a few days back...What the bikers DIDN'T want you to see, is that they make a habit of these deliberate intimidation techniques year after year.' The footage emerged two days after the New York Police Department released pictures of a third man wanted in connection with the Lien road rage assault. Reginald Chance, 38, who police say is the biker seen in a video smashing his helmet against Lien’s SUV and yanking him out of the vehicle, came forward Friday night along with 35-year-old Robert Sims - who was shown in the video stomping on the driver's head. Do you know this man: He is wanted by the NYPD for questioning . Reginald Chance, 38 surrendered himself to police in connection to the Sunday attack on an SUV driver . Both Mr Chance and Mr Sims have been charged . with attempted assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a . weapon, according to the New York Post. The video shows a biker stamping on Lien's head, as well as punching and kicking him in front of his terrified wife and two-year-old daughter. Mr Lien suffered two black eyes, as well as cuts on his face requiring stitches, according to a criminal complaint. 'The defendant is clearly seen stomping on [Lien’s] head,' assistant district attorney Joshua Steinglass told Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Diana Boyar during Saturday arraignment. A $100,000 cash bail was set. It has been reported this week that at . least five off-duty cops witnessed the beating of Mr Lien, who was driving an SUV on the Henry Hudson Parkway last Sunday . with his family inside. The incident left Lien needing stitches and motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr possibly paralyzed. Among the officers reportedly riding in the biker rally were at least two detectives and three other officers who did little to stop the attack. One of the detectives, the undercover narcotics agent, watched as the . violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his . cover. Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve . Mr Lien's Range Rover tapped the back tire of this motorcycle after he appears to dramatically slow down . This shows the moment the Range Rover driver panicked and hit some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and child. It is believed he hit Jeremiah Mieses here . When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet . Dayana Mejia, the partner of Edwin Mieses Jr, said: 'He is the best father I know. 'To learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again- that is all still sinking in. 'It tears me up that anyone could think that Edwin in anyway deserves what happened to him.' Mr Mieses was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black Range Rover on Manhattan's West Side Highway last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped, police said. Video captured at the scene shows the SUV surrounded by helmeted riders. The broken window on the passenger side of the vehicle shows that the male driver was not the only target . In the video, one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver's side window. Police said others tried to damage the SUV before the driver, Mr Lien, took off and plowed over Mieses. The . bikers then chased after Mr Lien and smashed his car window with their . helmets, then pulled him from the SUV and beat him to the point where he . required stitches. Rosalyn Ng, Mr Lien's wife, said in a prepared statement that . her family's sympathies go out to Mr Mieses, but that they had to flee a . dangerous situation. Mr Ng said her husband was trying to protect her and their two-year-old child, who was also in the car at the time. Mr Mieses, from Lawrence, Massachusetts, suffered a broken spine, fractured . ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve, according to Ms . Allred, who said during a press conference that his injuries may have left him paralyzed. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia, Mieses' longtime partner, said at a Friday press conference . 'He told everyone to move on and go back to riding, and turned his back to the SUV to start walking back to his own bike,' Allred said. 'It was then, with his back to the SUV, and as he was in front of it, that he was run over and crushed,' the attorney added. A difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a 'perception' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on Sunday, said Ms Mejia . 'They are not gang members. They are not thugs,' Mr Mejia said. 'They are FedEx drivers, plumbers, military reservists, musicians. They are fathers and brothers and sons, and sisters and mothers.' She also said Mr Mieses, the father of her children, didn't know any of the people he was riding with on Sunday aside from one friend who traveled to New York with him. The potentially paralyzed biker was recently arrested in Andover, Mass., for driving with a revoked license. He also never applied for a motorcycle license. Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York on Sunday as he tried to protect his wife and child. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him .","Footage shows bikers attacking car driver in separate video .

Two Canadians released from an Egyptian prison after being held without charges since mid-August were barred from flying out of the country on Sunday, Cairo airport officials said. John Greyson, a Toronto filmmaker and York University professor, and Tarek Loubani, a physician from London, Ontario, had checked in for a flight to Frankfurt, Germany, but were prevented from boarding the plane after their names appeared on a ‘stop-list’ issued by prosecutors, the airport officials said. The pair retrieved their luggage and were free to leave the airport, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief reporters. Free from bars but not from country: Canadians John Greyson (left) and Tarek Loubani (right) have been released from an Egyptian prison after being held without charge since mid-August but were barred from flying out to Frankfurt yesterday . The Canadian Foreign Affairs department said Greyson and Loubani were released from an Egyptian prison on Sunday morning. Greyson's sister, Cecilia Greyson, said that Canadian consular officials were dealing with what she called ‘red tape’ so they could begin their trip back to Canada. She said: ‘Until they are safely back in Canada we are just going to be a little bit on edge. ‘We've had contact with them throughout the day today. We're relieved they are out of prison. We're immensely encouraged by that.’ She said the two are in a safe and secure location waiting patiently to get out. They have been in regular contact via phone and email, she said. She said the pair were surprised when a guard swung open their cell door and led them to freedom because they had no clue that they were being released. Barred: People rallied in Victoria Park in London for the pair's release in September (pictured). On Sunday they were released and are now waiting patiently to be removed from the 'stop-list' issued by prosecutors, preventing them from leaving the country . Still on edge: Greyson's sister Cecilia said that consular officials were dealing with the 'red tape' and that the families will remain 'on edge' until the men are safely back in Canada . Celeste said: ‘They just got a knock on the cell door and they were just sort of shuffled out of the cell. ‘He actually thought they were changing cells or going to a different prison.’ Adria Minsky, a spokeswoman for Lynne Yelich, a junior minister responsible for consular affairs, said in an emailed statement that they were ‘aware of these reports’ that the Canadians were not allowed on their flight and said ‘Canadian embassy officials continue to provide consular assistance to facilitate their departure from Egypt.’ ‘We look forward to seeing these two Canadians return home shortly,’ Minsky said. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper welcomed the news of their release, issuing a statement from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur where he's continuing a visit aimed at strengthening ties with that Southeast Asian nation. He said: ‘The government of Canada has obviously been pushing for that and welcomes this decision by the government of Egypt and we look forward to seeing these two Canadian citizens return home in the not too distant future.’ Loubani and Greyson got caught up in the unrest surrounding the ouster of Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in a coup. They had been planning to travel to Palestinian-ruled Gaza, where Loubani was to teach emergency room medicine and Greyson was considering producing a documentary. Caught up in unrest: Greyson and Loubani were arrested while observing a violent pro-Morsi demonstration in Cairo. Unrest continued in the country with clashes between protesters and riot police in Cairo yesterday (pictured) The pair had been held without charges since August 16 when they were arrested while observing a pro-Morsi demonstration in Cairo in which the Canadians said they saw at least 50 protesters killed. The two Canadians said Loubani heeded a call for a doctor and began treating wounded demonstrators while Greyson recorded the unrest on video. They said they were arrested and beaten after leaving the scene of the protests. The pair released a statement from prison last month saying they were beaten and subjected to degrading treatment in the Egyptian prison. They said they spent most of the time crammed with other inmates in a filthy, cockroach-infested prison cell. Appalling conditions: After they were arrested at a protest in August (pictured), the pair said they were beaten and subjected to degrading treatment in the Egyptian prison . Threatening relations: Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper (right) welcomed the news of the pair's release while Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird (left) warned Egypt that their detention posed a serious threat to relations between the two countries . The pair staged a 16-day hunger strike to try to pressure Egyptian officials to release them but started eating food again last week. Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird had warned Egypt that their detention was a significant threat to relations between the two countries. Lynne Yelich, the Minister of State (Foreign Affairs and Consular) said in her statement: ‘Minister Baird and I were in contact with senior Egyptian officials on numerous occasions concerning this case, and the Embassy of Canada to Egypt worked tirelessly to secure their release.’ Cecilia Greyson said she thinks the stepped up pressure and the threat that it would harm relations helped win their release.","John Greyson and Tarek Loubani were arrested while observing a violent protest in Cairo .

Americans James Rothman and Randy Schekman and German-born researcher Thomas Suedhof have won the 2013 Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries on how hormones, enzymes and other key substances are transported within cells. This traffic control system keeps activities inside cells from descending into chaos and has helped researchers gain a better understanding of a range of diseases including diabetes and disorders affecting the immune system. The discoveries have helped doctors diagnose a severe form of epilepsy and immune deficiency diseases in children, Nobel committee secretary Goran Hansson said. Americans James Rothman and Randy Schekman and German-born researcher Thomas Suedhof won the 2013 Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries on how hormones, enzymes and other key substances are transported within cells . In the future, scientists hope the research could lead to the development of medicines to treat more common types of epilepsy, diabetes and other metabolism deficiencies, he said. Professor Rothman, 62, is a professor at Yale University while Professor Schekman, 64, is at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr Suedhof, 57, joined Stanford University in 2008. Professor Schekman said he was woken up at 1am at his home in California by the chairman of the prize committee and was still suffering from jetlag after returning from a trip to Germany the night before. ‘I wasn't thinking too straight. I didn't have anything elegant to say,’ he told The Associated Press. ‘All I could say was “oh my God”, and that was that.’ He called the prize a wonderful acknowledgement of the work he and his students had done and said he knew it would change his life. The discoveries have helped doctors diagnose a severe form of epilepsy and immune deficiency diseases in children, Nobel committee secretary Goran Hansson said. Image shows the winners being announced . ‘I called my lab manager and I told him to go buy a couple bottles of Champagne and expect to have a celebration with my lab,’ he said. The Nobel committee said the three researchers’ work on ‘vesicle traffic’ - the transport system of our cells - helped scientists understand how ‘cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time’ inside cells. Vesicles are tiny bubbles that act as cargo carriers. ‘Imagine hundreds of thousands of people who are travelling around hundreds of miles of streets - how are they going to find the right way? Where will the bus stop and open its doors so that people can get out?’ said Professor Hansson, the committee's secretary. ‘There are similar problems in the cell, . to find the right way between the different organelles and out to the . surface of the cell.’ Professor Schekman said he was woken up at 1am by the chairman of the prize committee and was still suffering from jetlag. 'I wasn't thinking too straight. I didn't have anything elegant to say,' he said . In the 1970s, Professor Schekman discovered a set of genes that were required for vesicle transport, while Professor Rothman revealed in the 1980s and 1990s how proteins dock with their target membranes like two sides of a zip. Also in the 1990s, Dr Suedhof found out how vesicles release their cargo with precision. ‘This is not an overnight thing. Most of it has been accomplished and developed over many years, if not decades,’ Professor Rothman told the AP. Asked if the Nobel might change his work or funding, he said: ‘I honestly don't know. It's a new experience.’ Professor Rothman said he lost grant money for the work recognised by the Nobel committee, but he will now reapply, hoping the Nobel Prize will make a difference in receiving funding. The medicine prize kicked off this year's Nobel announcements. The awards in physics, chemistry, literature, peace and economics will be announced by other prize juries this week and next. Each prize is worth 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.2 million). ‘These discoveries have had a major impact on our understanding of how cargo is delivered with timing and precision within and outside the cell,’ the committee said. Professor Rothman and Professor Schekman won the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award for their research in 2002 - an award often seen as a precursor of a Nobel Prize. Established by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prizes have been handed out by award committees in Stockholm and Oslo since 1901. The winners always receive their awards on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death in 1896. Last year's medicine award went to Britain's John Gurdon and Japan's Shinya Yamanaka for their contributions to stem cell science.","Americans James Rothman and Randy Schekman and German-born Thomas Suedhof won the 2013 Nobel Prize in medicine .

Enchanted: An perfectly, or terribly, placed animated promo turned Sunday's Once Upon a Time into something not to family friendly . Sunday night’s episode of Once Upon a Time gave an unexpected viral advertising boost after an animated promo jumped right into a star’s crotch. As Ginnifer Goodwin’s character Snow White appeared onscreen, an animated rabbit jumps out to advertise ABC’s upcoming Once Upon A Time In Wonderland. ‘You're searching for something powerful enough to vanquish the queen,’ Snow White said, just as the enchanted promo created a perfectly placed magic rabbit hole and disappeared into her pelvis. Instagram user russfrushtick posted a short video of the hilarious moment and the perfectly timed accident has gone viral. While inadvertent, the marketing boost comes at a welcome time for the new show, which debuts Thursday at 8pm. The creators of both Once Upon a Time and its spin off responded to the hilarious gaffe with fitting humor. ‘I never thought I would have so many emails about Ginny’s vagina,’ showrunner Edward Kitsis told Entertainment Weekly. ‘It’s embarrassing, but at the same time, it’s so silly it’s hard to . take serious. It’s so obvious that somebody didn’t realize what they . were doing.’ Bad timing?

Kitsis’s partner Adam Horowitz agreed. ‘We’re grateful ABC is spending so much time promoting both shows, but it was an interesting cross-promotion,’ Horowitz joked. Even the woman at the center of the newly dubbed ‘magic crotch’ promo was able to have fun with it. ‘Dear @EW, it's just a @OnceABC + @WonderlandOUAT crotchover!’ tweeted Goodwin, ‘And I'm not viral.’","As Ginnifer Goodwin's character appeared onscreen, an enchanted white rabbit advertising the show's new spin-off jumped into a magic rabbit hole in her pelvis ."

The mistress whose affair brought down former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick claims men are forgiven after political sex scandals while women are negatively labelled. Christine Beatty, his former chief of staff, had a six-year relationship with Kilpatrick during his time in office that would eventually land them both in jail. They each pleaded guilty to two felony obstruction of justice charges in 2008 after intimate text messages were published that showed they had lied under oath about their affair during a police whistle-blower trial. Scandal: Disgraced Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick (right) reacts during his arraignment on felony obstruction of justice charges in 2008 with his ex-mistress Christine Beatty (left) and her attorney Mayer Morganroth (centre). They were both jailed for four months for lying about their relationship in a previous trial . Shunned: Beatty (left) tells how she was professionally sidelined, while Kilpatrick landed a six-figure job when he left jail after the scandal . Kilpatrick resigned from office and both were sentenced to four months in prison in one of the biggest scandals the city has ever known. Writing in the November issue of Essence Magazine, as cited by the Detroit Free Press, Beatty tells how she was professionally sidelined after the scandal, while Kilpatrick landed a six-figure job when he left jail. She . says she has been holding down temporary consulting positions, but is struggling to . get her career on track, claiming that women are shunned far more than men after sex scandals. Beatty says she has been on a 'journey of self-forgiveness' in subsequent years. She said: 'I know that no matter how unhappy you are, you can't look for happiness in someone else. 'I've also come to understand that while you can't help how you feel, you are in control of your actions.' A return to jail: Kilpatrick was convicted of a raft of corruption charges earlier this year after being accused of running a 'private profit machine' out of Detroit's City Hall. He is due to be sentenced this week . Beatty tells how she met Kilpatrick in 1984 when they were 14 and dated him briefly at Cass Technical High School in Detroit. For years, she remembered their first kiss, one that was 'passionate yet gentle... the sweetest thing I had ever experienced.' In 2002, the pair became intimate for the first time when her marriage was on the rocks and two years later, when she had separated from her husband, she was 'totally consumed' by the affair. In the article, called A Real-Life . Scandal, she writes: 'We would find any spare time we could to be . together, at the office or at my home when my children weren’t there. 'He . made me laugh, he made me angry, he propelled me to ecstasy and reduced . me to tears, but most important, I felt he loved me unconditionally.' She says they both knew what they were doing was wrong, but couldn't stop. When told that their intimate text messages were about to be made public, she said she 'fell to my knees, sobbing'. Low: The government said Kilpatrick, pictured right while he was mayor, abused the Civic Fund, a nonprofit fund he created to help distressed Detroit residents . In 2010, Kilpatrick . was sent back to state prison for 18 months to five years for violating . probation in the text message scandal by hiding assets to avoid paying . down a $1 million in restitution he agreed to give to the City. He was freed in August 2011, but very soon found himself at the centre of another scandal. He was convicted of corruption charges in March this year, ensuring a return to . prison for a man once among the nation's youngest big-city leaders. Jurors found Kilpatrick guilty of a raft of crimes, including a racketeering conspiracy charge. Christine Beatty . He . was portrayed during a five-month trial as an unscrupulous politician . who took bribes, rigged contracts and lived far beyond his means while . in office until fall 2008. Prosecutors said Kilpatrick ran a 'private profit machine' out of Detroit's City Hall. The . government presented evidence to show he got a share of the spoils . after ensuring that Ferguson's excavating company was awarded millions . in work from the water department. Business owners said they were forced to hire Ferguson as a subcontractor or risk losing city contracts. Internal Revenue Service agents said Kilpatrick spent $840,000 beyond his mayoral salary.Kilpatrick, who now lives near Dallas, declined to testify. He has long denied any wrongdoing, and defense attorney James Thomas told jurors that Kilpatrick often was showered with cash gifts from city workers and political supporters during holidays and birthdays. The government said Kilpatrick abused the Civic Fund, a nonprofit fund he created to help distressed Detroit residents. There was evidence that it was used for yoga lessons, camps for his kids, golf clubs and travel. He is due to be sentenced on Thursday.","Christine Beatty had six-year affair with disgraced mayor Kwame Kilpatrick .

A Nigerian prince ran a huge illegal immigration racket in the UK, a court was told yesterday. Dr Yilkyes Bala, 54, was accused of using a complex web of security companies to mask a ‘systematic attack’ on Britain’s borders over eight years. The African royal allegedly used dozens of refugee passports passed to him by a corrupt Home Office official to give fellow Nigerians new identities. He then employed them and gave them references so they could ‘hit the jackpot’ and obtain a National Insurance number, giving them full rights of citizenship. Bala even conspired with others to give his second wife and his brother false identities so they could join him at his home in South-East London, the jury heard. He is on trial with six others – including his wife and ex-wife. Simon Farrell QC, prosecuting, told Canterbury Crown Court the case was a ‘systematic attack against our immigration laws which took place over many years’. ‘In various ways all these defendants were involved in assisting individuals who had no right to be in the UK to live and work here,’ he added. ‘A corrupt Home Office official, since convicted of misconduct in a public office, assisted by providing hundreds of improperly issued refugee passports.’ Bala referred to himself as ‘His Royal Highness Prince Yilkyes Bala Tonglele PhD State Crown Prince’, the jury heard. The court was told he runs the Armour Group of companies, which supplies private security guards. It is linked to other firms including ABC Guarding Ltd, which became Mayfair and Knightsbridge Guarding Ltd in 2006. Other defendants had senior roles, such as heads of finance and operations. The African royal is on trial with six others - including his wife and ex-wife - at Canterbury Crown Court (above) Mr . Farrell said they ‘must have known that these people [illegal . immigrants] were changing their identities’, adding: ‘Armour Group wrote . references so they could get National Insurance numbers … This is quite . sophisticated. ‘What happens is you get one of these passports and then you get a National Insurance number, then you really hit the jackpot … because you can live and work and be here at will.’ The headquarters of Armour Group, in Woolwich, south-east London, received 81 illicit refugee passports, the court heard. After Bala was arrested, he attempted to blame the property’s receptionist for orchestrating the scam, Mr Farrell said. 'Systematic attack': The Nigerian prince allegedly used dozens of refugee passports passed to him by a corrupt Home Office official to give fellow Nigerians new identities . The documents are meant for those claiming asylum in Britain, often fleeing religious or political persecution. But the Home Office worker was illicitly applying for them in the name of non-existent relatives of real refugees. She then passed them to Bala and other defendants who are accused of using them to help illegal immigrants stay in the UK. All seven defendants deny conspiracy to breach immigration law between February 2003 and June 2011 and other immigration offences.

The driver of an out-of-control monster truck that shot into a helpless crowd of spectators at a Mexican air show Saturday killing eight people and injuring 79 may have been drunk. Authorities say alcohol was detected on the breath of Francico Velazquez, who was performing stunts a the event on the outskirts of Chihuahua. Velazquez was detained Sunday on suspicion of manslaughter and investigators are also looking into possible safety violations in the setup of the show. Out of bounds: At the Extreme Aeroshow in Chihuahua, Mexico Saturday, a monster truck driver lost control of his vehicle and drove into a crowd of spectators . Body count: At least 8 are dead after the tragic accident. Twelve remained in intensive care Sunday . Lost control: Witnesses say they saw the driver bang his head and lose his helmet before driving into the crowd . Carlos Gonzalez, spokesman for the Chihuahua state prosecutors' office, said Velazquez appeared to lose control of the truck after leaping over cars it was crushing during a demonstration at the Extreme Aeroshow. Video taken from the stands by spectator Krizthall Martinez shows the truck making an initial pass over two cars. It then makes a second pass at higher speed, coming down sharply nose first and bouncing violently before piling straight into the crowd, which stood directly in the path of the monster truck unprotected by any wall or barrier. Spectator Daniel Dominguez, 18, said he . was happily watching the show with a group of relatives when the truck . came down hard in the middle of the cars. Chaos: Injured people are treated during the panic that ensued following Saturday's horrific tragedy . Aftermath: Horrified family and friends of victims search the crowd for their loved ones. On Sunday, 12 people remained in intensive care with four in critical condition . ‘The driver hit his head and his helmet flew off,’ Dominguez said. ‘The truck came directly at where we were.’ Dominguez's 11-year-old sister was taken into surgery for injuries to her legs, and his mother was also treated for minor contusions. The governor of the Mexican state declared three days of mourning to honor victims. The three-day show, which included performances by airplanes, the monster truck acts and other events, was canceled after the accident on its second day in a park on the outskirts of Chihuahua, the capital of Chihuahua state. On Sunday, two armed men threw a . firebomb at monster trucks and other vehicles parked at a hotel that . were part of an unrelated monster truck production at the air show. Chihuahua . Gov. Cesar Duarte Juarez said his administration, which was listed as a . sponsor of the air show, was investigating whether Civil Protection . authorities had correctly enforced safety regulations. He and other officials didn't say if those regulations required any protective barrier for spectators. Path of destruction: Initially, the mayor of Chihuahua announced that 47 people had been injured in the accident, but that number has now grown to more than 70 . Locked in: Authorities are also investigating whether a mechanical error might have happened with the truck, causing the gas pedal to remain engaged . Some . witnesses said the driver appeared to have hit his head on the interior . of the truck, which is nicknamed ‘Big Show,’ as he drove over the old . cars. At least two reporting seeing the driver's helmet come off before . the huge vehicle drove into the crowd of terrified spectators, who tried . to flee. ‘I fell over, and . when I turned around I saw the tire very close. It hit me and threw me . to the other side,’ Jesus Manuel Ibarra, 41, said as he was treated for . injuries to his arm and hip. Six people were killed at the scene of . the truck show Saturday, and another three people died receiving medical . attention. Later, four more bodies were found under the monster truck's . wheels. Chihuahua Mayor . Marco Quezada said 79 people had been hurt. Twelve remained in intensive . care, with four in critical condition, he said.

"PUBLISHED: . 11:50 EST, 8 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:55 EST, 8 October 2013 . Joel Mitchell pleaded guilty to possession of a dangerous dog. His Japanese Akita, which was off its leash, killed a little terrier called Daisy . The owner of a dog which mauled a tiny Yorkshire Terrier to death in front of its owner and horrified bank holiday shoppers said it may have mistaken the smaller animal for a squirrel. Nightclub promotions manager Joel Mitchell, 30, was jogging through Manchester's popular Spinningfields area with his large Akita-type dog Juice, which wasn’t on a lead, when it pounced on 18-month-old terrier Daisy. Privately-educated Mitchell immediately ‘rugby-tackled’ Juice and wrestled her to the ground but Daisy's horrific injuries meant she had to be put down by vets soon afterwards. Mitchell left the scene but not before Daisy’s owner Stephanie Hopwood, 24, had taken a photo of him on her mobile phone. At Manchester City Magistrates’ Court yesterday Mitchell, who had pleaded guilty to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control, expressed extreme remorse at what had happened. The court heard how he had adopted the two-year-old dog after he discovered he was being kept in a muddy cage in a neighbour’s garden in Salford, Greater Manchester. Mitchell, whose family own great Danes and Labradors as well as horses, was trying to integrate the dog back into society when it suddenly grabbed little Daisy in its jaws - despite Juice having no history of aggression. District Judge James Clarke acknowledged the defence’s argument that Juice could have been following her ‘natural animal instincts’ to pounce on a smaller animal, when ordering Mitchell to pay Daisy’s owner Miss Hopwood £1,700 compensation. Daisy before she was attacked and killed. Owner Stephanie Hopwood, from Sandbach, Cheshire, was devastated by the loss . He was also ordered to carry out 60 hours of unpaid work and must ensure that Juice always wears a muzzle in public and is kept on a lead. Sentencing, Mr Clarke said: 'You considered the convenience of yourself and the animal instead of the safety of others when you let it run free alongside you. 'It led to significant injury to the owners of the dog and of course the dog, which lost its life. The owners are victims because they lost a pet which they treat as a member of their family.' Daisy's owners quickly took this picture of Joel Mitchell immediately after the attack . Mitchell fled the scene of the attack on Bank Holiday Monday, May 6, at about 4.45pm. His solicitor Damian Zelazowski claimed that Juice was becoming agitated as horrified shoppers began shouting when they saw Daisy’s bloodied body emerge from the jaws of the larger dog. However, Mitchell handed himself in to police when a picture of him with the dog taken by Miss Hopwood was circulated by the media. A statement from Miss Hopwood read out by prosecutor Subhanur Chowdhury, said: 'Daisy was on a lead which was attached to a harness around her back. She was so small that we put her in the harness so we could pick her up if we needed to. 'As I approached The Oast House pub I was aware of something brushing past me. As I looked around I could see that a much bigger dog was attacking Daisy. 'I started to scream then I saw the owner of the other dog tackle her to the floor. I could tell Daisy was alive but I could see a lot of blood.' Miss Hopwood asked Mitchell for a phone number and described him as ‘cagey’ when he handed it over - she said it later turned out to be false. But Mr Zelazowski said Mitchelll had given her his personal mobile number which he was unaware had been terminated because he usually used his work handset. Mitchell, who has no previous convictions and a first class degree in design from the University of Leeds after studying at Ackworth Quaker school in Yorkshire, now lives in Huddersfield with his parents. Mr Mitchell said his dog Juice may have mistaken the smaller animal for a squirrel . Miss Hopwood said: 'I started to scream then I saw the owner of the other dog tackle her to the floor. I could tell Daisy was alive but I could see a lot of blood' Mr Zalazowski added: 'It’s very important to emphasise the fact he as a dog owner is deeply upset. 'When he was told about the dog’s death he was very upset. 'The history of his own dog Juice is that he took the dog on after having adopted it from people who neighboured him. It was kept outside in muddy conditions so he took it on 18 months ago. His family have Labradors and Great Danes and he is used to having big dogs. 'The dogs all socialise together and Juice plays with the family’s children, it’s a family pet. He takes the dog out when he goes jogging. 'The reason the dog was off its lead is that normally the dog jogs alongside him. The difficulty when he runs through town is that the dog sometimes runs around lampposts and it can become tricky. 'After the attack he couldn’t have done a great deal more than he did. He has taken every step he could to intervene. 'As soon as he knew the police wanted to speak to him he made himself available.'","Nightclub promoter Joel Mitchell's dog Juice savaged tiny Daisy .

Actor Jude Law and musician Damon Albarn have joined around 800 people protesting outside the Russian Embassy in London over the arrest of 30 Greenpeace activists. The pair, along with Paul Simonon from The Clash, have called the arrests a disgrace and described them as a personal blow as their friend Frank Hewetson is among those being held. Relatives of the activists have also organised several protests across the country for the six Britons who are in custody, and a further 47 demonstrations are being held around the world.

The activists are now in custody in the northern city of Murmansk charged with piracy, which carries a maximum 15 year sentence. Law, whose children went to school with Mr Hewetson's, said: 'I am just adding my face and body to the mass of support. 'Of course I am worried about Frank because I care about his family and I . care about him but I know that he is incredibly durable.'

Hewetson, Philip Ball, Alexandra Harris, Anthony Perrett and Iain Rogers . have been charged over the protest. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and described the charge as 'absurd and outrageous'. Around 800 people are protesting outside the Russian Embassy in London over the decision to charge the activists with piracy . Six Britons are among the 30 Greenpeace protesters now being held in the northern Russian city of Murmansk . Albarn said: 'It does seem to be a slightly different idea in Russia's collective head about what activism actually represents. 'Nine times out of 10 people who protest peacefully, whether it is . through music or through trying to scale oil rigs, are doing it because . they believe they are saying something that will ultimately benefit . society as a whole. 'We put people in power to look after us presumably, but . unfortunately rarely do they.' Vivienne Westwood also attended the Greenpeace demonstration outside the Russian Embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens . He went on: 'I want to express my support for Frank, his family and all . the other families because at the end of the day this is a very human . thing. 'There are people who are terribly worried about their loved ones. 'Everyone is concerned because it is Russia and they have a very bad record of bowing to international pressure.' The families of Mr Bryan and Ms Harris travelled from their homes in Devon for the vigil. Mr Bryan's mother, Ann, said: 'I am sick with worry; at least a protest like this makes me feel like we are not alone. 'None of the 30 should be facing that charge. Kieron was just doing his job.' Mr Bryan's father, Andy, said: 'We do not want this attention to go away. We are coping with this day by day.' Jim Carter, 65, who plays butler Carson in the hit TV series, said: ‘I am here to support the people who are ludicrously in jail in Russia on trumped-up charges. ‘They were not attempting to steal anything. They went armed only with their principles and a banner. It was a peaceful protest. ‘When an international organisation is accused of piracy, it is sick.’ Ms Harris's sister, Georgina, said she had received an email from her . sibling saying she was safe and warm and urging her not to worry.

Death: Dawn Liddell, 42, of Foxwood, North Yorkshire, had to wait almost 20 hours for a CT scan in 2008 . A mother died despite a string of opportunities for doctors to diagnose a brain haemorrhage and her brother’s warnings that she would leave hospital ‘in a body bag’, an inquest has heard. Dawn Liddell, 42, of Foxwood, North Yorkshire, was sent home from her GP and local hospital twice and had to wait almost 20 hours for a CT scan, York Coroner’s Court was told. She had already seen her doctor in August 2008 believing her severe headache was caused by an insect bite - but attended hospital the next month when her condition did not improve. Ms Liddell was given painkillers and told to contact her GP if her symptoms continued. But after collapsing and having a seizure four days later, she arrived at York Hospital at 8.25pm. But the shop assistant was not booked in for a CT scan until 19 hours after arriving - despite repeated requests and her family history of haemorrhages. The CT scan had actually been cancelled while she waited for an MRI scan. But her condition worsened and she died of a brain haemorrhage caused by the rupture of an artery aneurysm. By the time a scan showed the brain haemorrhage, it was too late to save her. Her brother Phill Liddell said he could not understand the delays in diagnosis when there was a family history of brain haemorrhages. He told the court: ‘I said to the doctor “she is having a brain haemorrhage”. I said “she will leave here in a body bag”.’ Faults: In 2011, York Hospital accepted that with the right care she was unlikely to have died and paid a 'significant' sum of compensation to her 21-year-old son . In 2011, York Hospital accepted that . with the right care she was unlikely to have died and paid a . ‘significant’ sum of compensation to her 21-year-old son, Jordan Hattee. The Trust admitted in its apologetic letter that she should have been referred for a CT scan on her visit to hospital. It . said: ‘This would have shown the presence of a haemorrhage and she . would then have been transferred to the Neurological Centre at Hull. Evidence: Her brother Phill Liddell said he could not understand the delays in diagnosis when there was a family history of brain haemorrhages . ‘An . angiogram would then have identified the aneurysm and subsequent . treatment would have given her a survival rate of 80 to 85 per cent.’ The inquest yesterday heard there were four occasions when an opportunity was missed to give her a CT scan. This . would have meant she could have had an operation giving her the ‘best . chance’ of survival, a serious untoward incident report by the hospital . found. Chances were missed when she visited her GP, in A&E on September 4, when she went back to hospital on September 8 and on the morning of September 9 - the day she later died. Recording that she died of natural causes, coroner Donald Coverdale said: ‘It’s not clear why the scan took so many hours to carry out. ‘It has been suggested there may have been problems with the equipment. One hopes the lessons learned - and indeed lessons must be learned - have been followed up.’ Speaking after the inquest, Mr Liddell said: ‘I know the doctors involved didn’t leave the house in the morning and intend for this to happen, but a mistake has caused the death of my sister. ‘It’s as if no-one has got any responsibility for what they are doing.’ A York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation . Trust spokesman said: ‘We are sorry for the circumstances surrounding . Dawn’s death, and once again extend our condolences to her family. 'I said to the doctor, ""she is having a brain haemorrhage"". I said ""She will leave here in a body bag""' Phill Liddell, brother . ‘This was investigated by the Trust and we accept that there are things we should have done differently. ‘As a result of our investigation, recommendations were made and measures have been put in place to try to prevent this being repeated.’ After the hospital’s apology in 2011, her mother Beryl revealed she suffered a brain haemorrhage at the age of 21 and said doctors should have been more aware that her daughter may have had a heightened risk of a similar attack. 'We accept that there are things we should have done differently' York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust spokesman . She said: ‘I collapsed in 1967 and a doctor came out immediately. He knew it was serious and I was rushed to hospital. There were no scans in those days so they gave me a lumbar puncture and found I had a brain haemorrhage. ‘But they missed so many chances to save Dawn. They should have sent her for a scan regardless, it’s because of that she’s not here today. ‘It seems to me the treatment I got in the 60s was better than the care she got and that’s why she’s no longer with us.’ Performing arts student Mr Hattee said: ‘She was in hospital for hours until she had a fit without having a brain scan. Throughout the night she kept complaining of head pains, I told the doctors and nurses this throughout the night.’","Shop assistant Dawn Liddell had to wait almost 20 hours for a CT scan .

Student Ariana Gonzales, 21, who is from the town the hit series is set in, has visited many of the places that feature in the programme and taken a real-time snap shot of some of the iconic scenes. So as viewers mourn the end of the hit show, Ariana's project provides a glimpse into the world of the successful drama.

You've got to hand it to the photographer: The RV where Walter and Jesse cook their crystal meth pulled into Albuquerque bus station . Ariana, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, said: ‘What you see in this set of pictures is a screen shot from Breaking Bad placed in the environment it was filmed in. ‘I wanted to capture the reality of the show by taking memorable or iconic scenes and places throughout seasons one to five. I wanted to breathe more life into the show by presenting the actual setting of the scenes. The project features familiar sights from the AMC drama, including the pizza on the roof scene and the lawyer's office. Good call: The exact spot where Walter White talks on the phone near a footbridge . Hungry for drama: Walter White strolling outside fast-food joint Denny's . Legal eagle: The real-life office of Walt's lawyer, Saul Goodman .

Women inspired by Angelina Jolie are demanding breast removal surgery – even if they don’t need it - a leading doctor has warned. After Miss Jolie, 38, who is in a high-risk cancer category, announced this year she had had a double mastectomy, a surge of women in the UK have sought to follow suit. A quarter of women who develop cancer in one breast are now asking for both to be removed, according to figures from the London Breast Institute. But Professor Kefah Mokbel of the London Breast Institute has said surgery would be pointless for women who are not in the same category as Jolie. Popular: Angelina Jolie's decision to have both breasts removed and surgically re-enhanced has prompted many women to get tested and ask for the procedure, according to Professor Kefah Mokel (right) Dr Mokbel said: ‘It’s obviously a great step forward that Angelina Jolie has increased awareness of breast cancer. ‘But we’re seeing a large number of women requesting a preventative mastectomy for peace of mind, women who’ve been diagnosed but don’t have a genetic predisposition so wouldn’t benefit. ‘These are patients who say, “Can you do for me what Angelina Jolie had done?” They’re on the increase. ‘Doctors and patients need to avoid overestimating the benefits.’ As a carrier of the mutation in the BRCA1 gene Miss Jolie’s risk of developing breast cancer was increased by more than 80 per cent, and ovarian cancer by 50 per cent. Surge: Double mastectomies have quadrupled as patients ask their doctors for 'what Angelina Jolie had' Preventative: American singer Anastacia had the procedure when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . Studies show that the occurrence of breast cancer may be reduced by 90 per cent or more after preventive mastectomy in women with a high risk of this disease. Miss Jolie received praise after announcing her decision to have both breasts removed following the deaths of her aunt from breast cancer and her mother from ovarian cancer. London Breast Institute figures showed genetic testing for BRCA mutations at their clinic had risen by 67 per cent since Jolie went public, and preventative mastectomies have risen fourfold. Professor Mokbel said the ‘fear factor’ had led some patients to ask for preventative surgery and that there was a danger of over-treatment. Fewer than one per cent of women carry the faulty BRCA1 gene - like Miss Jolie - or BRCA2 gene, which is very similar. Professor Mokbel warned patients can suffer psychological harm after having radical surgery. Too much? Experts are now warning there is a danger of 'over treatment' as many women don't need it . Publicity: The cause to fight breast cancer is now well publicised but experts are calling for sensible treatment . He urged women to have counselling and proper screening before they consider preventative breast removal. The cost of a test for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations is £1,500. Not all NHS hospitals offer it because of the expense. The procedure involves the removal of both breasts and provides the greatest protection for women at high risk of developing cancer in breast tissue. Breast reconstruction can be done at the time of the preventive mastectomy. When this happens it is called an immediate reconstruction. Women with a family history of breast cancer are advised to undergo genetic screening which is done via a blood test. They can also take drugs to lessen the risk including Tamoxifen which works by suppressing oestrogen, a hormone that triggers tumour growth, or by undergoing very regular checks. As part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month 45-year-old singer Anastacia revealed she had also chosen to have a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with cancer for the second time.","Tests for high-risk cancer gene have risen by 67% since Jolie's operation .

Four-year-old Morgan Taylor has adrenal insufficiency which means he cannot naturally deal with physical or emotional setbacks. The youngster’s body does not produce the stress hormone cortisol, and so his body will begin to shut down if he is not administered a life-saving injection within 30 minutes of any stressful event. Morgan Taylor, four, has adrenal insufficiency which means his body doesn't produce the stress hormone cortisol. As a result, without a life-saving cortisol injection after stressful events, his body would shut down .

Morgan (pictured with his mother, Susan) was born at 28 weeks weighing just 1lb 8oz. When he was a week old he developed an infection and his parents were told he would not survive . Morgan (pictured with his mother, Susan, father, Neil, sister Abbey, 14, and brother, Ollie, 18-months) also has growth problems, chronic lung disease, a heart defect and behavioural problems . When he was a week old, he contracted . an infection in his bowel and Susan, and his father Neil, were told to . expect the worse by doctors who said he was not strong enough to . survive. The adrenal glands, which are found at the top of the kidneys, produce steroid hormones that are essential for life - cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol mobilises nutrients, enables the body to fight inflammation, stimulates the liver to produce blood sugar and helps control the amount of water in the body. Adrenal insufficiency is caused by the failure of the adrenal glands to produce sufficient (or any) cortisol. A prolonged lack of the hormone causes severe fatigue, depression, loss of appetite and weight loss. Cortisol is particularly important when the body is subjected to stress, such as surgery, trauma or a serious infection. If the adrenal glands do not produce cortisol, the body might not be able to cope with this kind of major stress. This causes a life-threatening condition called adrenal crisis which causes symptoms including low blood pressure, stomach pain, nausea and fever. There are a number of potential causes for adrenal insufficiency including an infection, an autoimmune disease and pituitary gland tumours. Ms Murwald, a . mother-of-five, said: ‘We knew we were having a small baby, but we . didn’t know there was anything medically wrong with Morgan until he was . born. ‘They sent us home for the night to be with our other children and said they would call as soon as he started to deteriorate. ‘It was so upsetting to be told our baby wasn’t going to last the night. ‘We had only had him a week and I hadn’t even been able to give him a cuddle.’ But amazingly, the call never came and the couple returned to the hospital the following morning to learn that their little boy was pulling through. ‘It was a massive turning point for Morgan,’ Ms Murwald said. However, Morgan has be left with adrenal insufficiency which makes him vulnerable to physical and mental stress. Other symptoms of the condition include fatigue and muscle weakness, dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite and stomach ache. Mr . Taylor, a 37-year-old engineer, said: ‘If you or I fall over, our body . will deal with the stress of that situation, but Morgan’s body can’t do . that. ‘Even if he had an argument with someone, he wouldn’t be able to sit down and calm himself down. He’s just not capable. ‘Any . kind of shock to the system, physically or emotionally, means he needs a . cortisol injection as his body won’t naturally release it. Morgan has just started school but because of his condition is cannot play with the other children in the playground in case he becomes stressed . Morgan (pictured at school with Grace Naylor, four) is still small for his age and his parents do not know what the future holds for him . ‘If he doesn’t get the injection, his . body will start to shut down and he becomes clammy, lethargic and run . down and he would eventually die. ‘We have to take his kit wherever we go as just a trip to the park or the shops can be dangerous.’ Ms . Murwald has stayed at home to look after Morgan, who also has growth . problems, chronic lung disease, a heart defect and behavioural problems. Ms Murwald said: 'We knew we were having a small baby, but we didn't know there was anything medically wrong with Morgan until he was born.' Morgan is pictured in hospital shortly after his birth . All of the staff at Morgan's school are trained to administer his cortisol injections if he needs them . She said: ‘I worry about him and he’s in a class with other children who are much bigger than him. He has to really think about what he’s doing. ‘He knows all about his condition and he knows what the injections are for. ‘He’s aware that he has to be cautious and knows he’s not allowed to play contact sports. We have had to drill it into him.’ Ms Murwald said: 'I worry about him and he's in a class with other children who are much bigger than him. He has to really think about what he's doing' All of the staff on the school premises are trained to administer cortisol injections to Morgan if he needs them. ‘I feel more comfortable because of that,’ said Ms Murwald. ‘All the staff came forward to be trained which is nice because they didn’t have to. ‘But I can’t help but worry that everything will be OK as he has complex medical needs, just like any parent would. Ms Murwald said: 'He's very happy and incredibly cheeky, and although he's got this illness we just have to deal with it. It's heart breaking really because he's always got a smile on his face no matter what. We don't know what the future holds for him but while he's happy that's all we can ask for' ‘He’s very happy and incredibly cheeky, and although he’s got this illness we just have to deal with it. ‘It’s heart breaking really because he’s always got a smile on his face no matter what. ‘We don’t know what the future holds for him but while he’s happy that’s all we can ask for.’","Morgan Taylor, 4, has adrenal insufficiency which means his body doesn't produce the hormone cortisol, so he cannot deal with stress .

Ford has developed a ‘crash-proof’ car in a bid to help drivers avoid collisions with pedestrians or other vehicles. It’ll even park itself. The new ‘obstacle avoidance’ technology means that if a pedestrian steps out, or if a slow moving vehicle looms into view, the car will take avoiding action if the driver  fails to do so in time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The new 'obstacle avoidance' technology means that if a pedestrian steps out, or if a slow moving vehicle looms into view, the car will take avoiding action if the driver fails to do so in time . The on-board computer simply wrests control of the steering wheel and brakes to help avoid the impending bump. The technology is being tested on a Ford Focus and is expected to be on showroom models within five years. It has been tested at speeds of more than 38 mph following  research which reveals that fewer than a third of drivers about to hit the car in front attempt to steer out of the way ahead of impact. The technology was demonstrated for the first time at the company’s proving grounds at Lommel in Belgium. The system uses three radars, ultrasonic sensors and a camera to ‘scan’ the road up to 200 yards ahead. A Ford spokesman said: ‘If the system detects a slow-moving or stationary object in the lane ahead it first displays a warning and then sounds a chime. ‘Then,  if the driver does not steer or brake then the car will apply the brakes automatically whilst scanning for gaps either side of the hazard – effectively taking control of the electronic power steering to avoid any near-fatal collisions. ‘ . The automatic steering and braking enables the car to move away from objects that the driver may not have seen or that have slowed down ahead of them . The car is also fitted with the next-generation parking technology which, at the push of a button, operates steering, gear selection and forward and reverse motion .

Barb Samardzich, Ford of Europe’s vice president of product development said: ‘There are many instances – such as unexpectedly queuing traffic ahead – when this technology could benefit both the driver whose car is equipped with the technology and others on the road. ‘The Obstacle Avoidance research project offers an exciting glimpse of a safer future where the risk of some types of accidents could be greatly reduced.’ The technology is being tested on a Ford Focus and is expected to be on showroom models within five years . She added: ’Ford Motor Company has always been one of the world’s leading pioneers and forward-thinkers. ‘From the introduction of a whole new way of mass producing cars 100 years ago to the advanced safety and convenience features unveiled today, we continue to set the template and define the future for drivers.’ Ford is leading a consortium of 29 partners in a research project called ‘interactIVe’  - Accident Avoidance by Active Intervention of Intelligent Vehicles – designed to make cars intervene in the event of an imminent collision.","The new ‘obstacle avoidance’ technology has been tested on a Ford Focus .

A mission that will scan Mars' atmosphere to better understand what happened to its water will be launched by Nasa next month. The space agency has given the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (Maven) an emergency exemption from the U.S. government shutdown which is now entering its second week. The bus-sized spacecraft, which is due to launch on the 18 of November, will dip to an altitude of 80 miles above the planet’s surface to sample Mars' entire upper atmosphere. Scroll down for video... The Maven spacecraft will scan the atmosphere of Mars to better understand what happened to its water. Mars is thought to have once had huge amounts of water flowing on its surface. Features such as dry channels and minerals that typically form in water remain to provide a record of its watery past . Maven, which measures 37 feet long when its solar panels are open, will take about 10 months to reach Mars after launch and will then enter orbit at around 12,500 miles an hour. The spacecraft’s aim is to take samples of the gases in the Martian atmosphere in the hope of measuring the levels of water vapour and the rate at which it is being lost. Mars is thought to have once had huge amounts of water flowing on its surface.  Features such as dry channels and minerals that typically form in water remain as evidence of its watery past. Maven, which measures 37 feet long with its solar panels are open, will take about 10 months to reach Mars after launch and will then enter orbit at around 12,500 miles an hour . Maven is due to launch at 1:28 pm EST (5.28 pm GMT) on November 18, 2013, for arrival at Mars on September 22, 2014. The first fuel burn will insert the spacecraft into a capture orbit with a period of 35 hours- the time it will take to make one complete orbit around Mars. Shortly after Mars orbit insertion, a second fuel burn will place the spacecraft into its 4.5-hour period requirement for acquiring data. Three smaller burns will reduce the closest distance of the spacecraft to around150 kilometers. Maven will let scientists test theories that the sun's energy slowly eroded nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water from the Martian atmosphere to leave it the dry, desolate world seen today. Understanding where this water went will provide key clues as to whether life could have survived on the planet. ‘Maven will help us understand the climate history, which is the history of habitability,’ said Bruce Jakosky, planetary scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder and MAVEN's principal investigator. ‘Although Maven is not going to detect life, it's trying to understand the environment that might have been able to support life.’ A major reason Nasa has granted exemption for Maven is because the spacecraft will provide communications link support for future landers and rovers on the Martian surface, including Curiosity. The Curiosity currently sends back data using two older satellites - Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Maven is currently undergoing final preparation and testing before its launch on November 18th. Nasa is continuing to keep workers at Mission Control in Houston and elsewhere during the government shutdown to support the International Space station, where two Americans and four others are deployed.

A celebrated architect whose estranged wife froze to death said yesterday he still did not know why she was left alone in a car after a drinking session. Jonathan Falkingham, the chief executive of a multi-million pound property firm, spoke out after an inquest into his wife Nicole’s ‘avoidable’ death. He said: ‘What we still cannot understand is how she came to be left outside in sub-zero temperatures for over 12 hours.’ Nicole Falkingham, 41, died from hypothermia and acute alcohol poisoning after a night out with friends in an upmarket wine bar. Hypothermia: Nicole Falkingham was seeking a divorce from Jonathan Falkingham, the chief executive of a major property developer . She fell asleep in a car on a friend’s driveway in sub-zero temperatures and was found dead on the back seat the next morning, the inquest heard. Her death came after she told friends she was fighting a divorce battle with her 51-year-old husband – the boss of Manchester-based development company Urban Splash. Mr Falkingham met his wife when she began working as his personal assistant more than a decade ago. They began dating in 2003 after he separated from his first wife and the couple bought an abandoned 17th century farmhouse which they transformed into a £1million home. The pair were known as ‘property royalty’ and had a glamorous lifestyle. But Mrs Falkingham and her husband separated in June last year. The couple were known as 'property royalty' and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, but they separated last year . On the evening of January 24 Mrs Falkingham had gone out and had been drinking in a bar in Allerton, Liverpool, with four friends. An employee at the Vinci wine bar said the group had drunk a ‘couple of bottles of wine’ when Mrs Falkingham changed dramatically and suddenly became ‘comatose’. Bar staff alerted the emergency services but before they arrived she was picked up by  two friends, who gave her a lift  back to their home in nearby Otterspool. She was found dead in the back of her friends’ black Vauxhall Insignia on the drive the following morning  after temperatures had fallen to -2C. Police questioned the pair who had collected her from the bar that night on suspicion of manslaughter – but they were never charged. The coroner said: 'It was a particularly cold and inclement night. Alcohol affects the body¿s ability to tolerate temperature' The inquest heard Mrs Falkingham had been more than four times over the legal drink drive limit and had a blood toxicity level of 333 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Coroner Andre Rebello recorded a narrative verdict into her death. He said: ‘She had been placed into the vehicle where she remained overnight. It was a particularly cold and inclement night. Alcohol affects the body’s ability to tolerate temperature.’ But her estranged husband said the inquest had not managed to explain why his wife had been left out in sub-zero temperatures with only her quilted jacket to keep her warm. After the verdict Mr Falkingham said: ‘We remain concerned that her tragic death was completely avoidable. But we, Nicole’s family, hope that we can now get on with the process of rebuilding our lives. ‘We would like to give our thanks to all those who have helped us throughout this difficult period.’","Nicole Falkingham died from hypothermia after a night drinking .

Lady Carnarvon said she would 'prefer to watch nice things on a Sunday night' Downton Abbey was accused yesterday of using a sickening rape as a gratuitous plot device to liven up the ITV drama’s script. A controversial scene on Sunday night in which a housemaid was subjected to a brutal assault by a valet sparked nearly 100 complaints from disgusted viewers. Domestic violence campaigners said the show’s creator Julian Fellowes had depicted rape in an obscene and irresponsible manner. Any victims of a real-life sexual assault who happened to be watching could have been traumatised, they said. Even the Countess of Carnarvon, the owner of Highclere Castle where Downton is filmed, joined the criticism, saying she preferred ‘to look at nice things on a Sunday night’. A message before the episode – the third in the current series – warned it contained ‘violent scenes that some viewers may find upsetting’. But many of 8.8million viewers who watched were unprepared for what followed. Katie Russell from the charity Rape Crisis said ITV should have made it clear the episode contained sexual violence so rape victims could switch off. She said: ‘They had a warning about violence before the programme but it wasn’t an explicit warning about sexual violence. 'The scene was clearly an implied rape, and that can trigger terrible memories in rape survivors. Content like that can be very traumatic.’ Author and anti-rape campaigner Bidisha ShonarKoli Mamata claimed the show’s author Julian Fellowes had added the attack simply to enliven a ‘dull’ storyline. ‘You can’t just insert a scene like this into a cosy drama. You have to treat rape sensitively, rather than use it as a plot device,’ she said. The Mail's later edition yesterday: Downton fans said they had been left disgusted by the violent rape scene . ‘Instead of focusing on the impact of the violence on Mrs Bates, it repeated basic rape myths, such as the idea rapists are always creepy guys. In fact, they are normal people and are often related to the victim. ‘If you are going to portray rape on TV, you have to do it responsibly. It was gratuitous, obscene and irresponsible. It made me want to switch off.’ In the controversial scene, which Downton’s makers insisted yesterday had been ‘acted and directed with great sensitivity’, servant Anna Bates, played by Joanne Froggatt, was beaten and raped. The horrific assault took place downstairs as opera singer Dame Nellie Melba – played by soprano Kiri Te Kanawa – entertained Downton’s aristocratic residents upstairs. Green, a house guest’s valet, played by former EastEnders actor Nigel Harman, pushed the maid – who is married to Lord Grantham’s valet – against the wall and attempted to kiss her. When his advances were spurned, he flew into a rage and raped her. Forceful: Anna Bates played by Joanne Froggatt is raped by Mr Green, played by newcomer Nigel Harman . In shock: The ITV1 audience was warned about the violent scenes ahead of the show, but Downton Abbey fans have complained they were still not prepared for what happened . Distressing: Viewers have criticised the rape scene in episode three of Downton Abbey . Although the episode was shown after the 9pm watershed, many viewers felt the scene was inappropriate for a family drama. Sabine Edwards tweeted that she felt ‘sick’, adding: ‘Rape & violence against women are not entertainment tactics. ’ Vivienne Adams added: ‘I am v uncomfortable with plot turn by Julian F – rape as entertainment.’ Another said: ‘I realise that Downton Abbey is essentially just a big soap opera, but I absolutely hate when rape is used as a plot device.’ Offensive: Many watching said that the decision to feature violence against women as a key plotline was 'morally reprehensible' Complaint: One viewer said they were so shocked by the scene that they planned to make an official complaint to the broadcast regulator Ofcom . Lady Carnarvon said her research had uncovered no incidents of sexual abuse among the domestic staff. ‘I didn’t watch [Sunday’s episode] but I gather it was less pleasant,’ she said. ‘I imagine that Julian [Fellowes] is exploring with different storylines and darker themes. ‘He will also have watched the reaction to see where he will take the stories in the future, I’d imagine.’ Ofcom said it had received 30 complaints yesterday and was assessing whether to hold a full investigation. Another 60 complained directly to ITV. A Downton Abbey spokesman said: ‘The events in episode three were, we believe, acted and directed with great sensitivity. 'Viewers will see in the forthcoming episodes how Anna and Bates struggle to come to terms with what has happened.’","Domestic violence campaigners accused show of being irresponsible .

It is home to landmarks such as Buckingham Palace, St Paul’s Cathedral and Hampstead Heath - but London has been named the worst place to live in Britain. The capital was labelled the UK’s most hated area in a book identifying the country’s 50 least desirable locations, entitled ‘Crap Towns Returns’. David Cameron’s hometown of Chipping Norton, where the average house price is £229,000, was dubbed third worst, being described as the home to ‘rank corruption, lurking evil and spouting on about cheese.’ 'Worst place to live': London has been labelled the UK's most hated area in a book identifying the country's 50 least desirable locations . The Cotswolds town, whose residents include Rebekah Brooks and Jeremy Clarkson, was blasted as being the ‘spiritual home of the malaise gripping the UK.’ A contributor said: ‘If there are other crap towns in the country, a good deal of the blame must lie with Chipping Norton. It is the cause and karmic repository for their faults too.’ 1. London . 2. Bradford . 3. Chipping Norton . 4. Southampton . 5. York . 6. Gibraltar . 7. Coventry . 8. Nuneaton . 9. High Wycombe . 10.

Authors Sam Jordison and Dan Kieran took online contributions from British people who nominated the worst places to live based on factors such as poverty, snobbery and transport links. Croydon, and Tottenham were highlighted for their ‘violence, malaise and despair’, and Mayfair and the City were described as ‘rubbish’ and full of ‘self-important’ people. The book, a self-styled ‘genuine rough guide’ to the UK, states: ‘London claims to be a world city – a modern, 24-hour metropolis – but this is mostly just a pretence put on for visitors. ‘Spend an extended time in the place and you’ll realise that it doesn’t stand up.’ The capital was criticised for its costs, queues, binge drinking and lack of community spirit, among other things. Co-author Sam Jordison said: ‘Nominations can be based on anything and everything. It’s a strength of the book that it’s really hard to define what makes something crap.’ National treasures: The capital is home to landmarks such as Buckingham Palace, St Paul¿s Cathedral and Hampstead Heath . He added: ‘London’s got it from two directions. Lots of Londoners are fed up of the city because of queuing, rocketing house prices, the chore of commuting, the dangers and pure exhaustion of living there. ‘But in contrast there is a lot of snobbery there too, which makes London hated. Contributors complained about gold iPad cases on sale in Mayfair, and about the fact that Londoners have no idea what’s going on elsewhere in the UK.’ Bradford, Chipping Norton, Southampton and York were also slated and made the top five, with Bradford being described as ‘a city with a giant hole in its heart – literally and metaphorically’. A spokesman said: ‘The reasons behind the nominations for the towns include everything from grinding poverty to unbearable snobbery, but are united by the common feeling that these attributes have a very real impact on quality of life – and enjoyment of life. Runner-up: Bradford has been described as ¿a city with a giant hole in its heart ¿ literally and metaphorically¿ . ‘The survey is proudly unscientific, and based on emotion, as much as all the usual crime statistics, house prices, local facilities, transport and schools.’ The book’s predecessor, Crap Towns, named Hull as Britain’s least desirable area in 2003, but the town was listed as ‘not so crap’ in the latest edition. Other towns which won praise for having improved since 2003 were Bedford, Liverpool, Morecambe and Hackney.","The capital has been labelled the UK's most hated area in a new book .

An apparent Bigfoot sighting in Pennsylvania has been labelled a scam after the mythical creature turned out to a huge tree stump. Hiker John Stoneman claimed he spotted not one but two of the seven-foot-tall ape-like beasts three weeks ago through the trees, just yards from a main road in Kinzua State Park near Bradford. But a tipster told HuffPost Weird News either Stoneman was lying or he didn't know he was actually staring at a chunk of a tree that had been uprooted by well drillers. Is it Bigfoot? John Stoneman's close up photo, pictured, apparently shows one of the 'beasts' spotted just yards from a main road through trees in Kinzua State Park . Stumped: A tipster sent this photo of the same apparent Bigfoot to HuffPost Weird News on Thursday . The anonymous debunker sent the website a photograph of what appeared to be the same figure . Stoneman saw, but from a different angle, to prove his theory. 'It was a scam,' the tipster said. Stoneman's pictures went viral after he posted them online. The 57-year-old explained he had been returning . from the Kinzua Bridge Fall Festival with his girlfriend when the pair . saw the mysterious shape moving in the forest. He quickly grabbed his camera and snapped a few shots as they slowed the car down and edged along the road. Traffic . backing-up behind his vehicle forced Stoneman to move on but not before he . got what he believes is some of the best evidence yet of the existence . of the legendary North American creature. Stoneman, from Bradford, said at the time: 'I'm a skeptic myself, I'm not a believer, but this was not a bear and you can see fur on it. 'It's . wider at the shoulders and tapers down whereas a bear is bigger in the . middle and stands differently with its paws out, this was standing like a . man, like a Bigfoot. Two beasts: Stoneman claimed this image, taken just two weeks ago near Bradford, Pennsylvania, showed two of the mysterious creatures known as Bigfoot wandering through the woods . Lurking: The photographs were taken by keen hiker John Stoneman who was on his way home with his girlfriend from a festival with his girlfriend when the pair spotted the mysterious shape moving in the forest . Debate: Stoneman's photographs fueled the debate on whether the legendary creature actually exists . 'At first some people have . discredited it and said it's just a root ball at the bottom of a fallen . tree, but I've been back to the exact spot and there is no root ball . there. 'We do have black bears, but they are considerably smaller than this, it was standing about seven-foot tall.' The day before the sighting Stoneman said there had been a 'Bigfoot calling contest' organised as part of the bridge festival - an event held annually in the area to commemorate an old viaduct destroyed by a tornado. He said: 'This was 200 yards from the road, it was too narrow for me to be able to pull over without stopping traffic but I got as many pictures as I could. 'I actually dropped the camera casing . so I couldn't see what I had got until I got home and put them on my . computer, I was surprised at what I saw. 'I looks more like a bigfoot than anything else, I've already had organisations asking me to send them copies for verification.' Stoneman . - who is a member of the local outdoor pursuits group Allegheny Outdoor . Adventures - said he had never seen anything like it in the woods . before. He said: 'This area is known for . Bigfoot sightings but this is the first time I have seen anything like . this, I am in the woods every week, I hunt and go hiking. 'I went back to the exact spot where it had been and there was nothing there, just years and years of leaves on the floor.' It . came as researchers told a new conference in Texas that they have . proof Bigfoot is real and have even collected DNA samples. Location: Outdoorsman John Stoneman, pictured, said he was previously a skeptic but the strange 'creature' convinced him . The Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years. Bigfoot, also known as sasquatch, is the name given to an ape-like creature that some people believe inhabits forests, mainly in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid. In 1951 American Eric Shipton photographed what he described as a Yeti footprint beginning a spate of 'sightings' and print finds throughout the 20th and 21st century.","Tipster claims latest Bigfoot sighting was actually a tree stump .

Little wonder, then, that Philip recoiled in horror today when showed the latest form of transport for the fashionable pensioner about town. The Queen’s husband, who has spent the summer recuperating in Scotland after abdominal surgery back in June, made clear on a visit to an old peoples’ home in Norfolk that he is not ready to take up a zimmer frame just yet. What's this? The sprightly Prince Philip, who visited the St Michael's Care Complex in Aylsham, Norfolk, today, looks curiously at the walking frame . Not for him: The Prince - clearly not a fan of the walking frame - recoils in horror . Walking aids aside, Philip was clearly in high spirits as he toured the St Michael’s Care Complex in the market town of Aylsham, Norfolk. At 92, he was older than many of its elderly residents, but still managed to show off his infamously sharp sense of humour when he joked about a toddler being knocked off an inflatable toy. Philip made the aside as he was taken to an activity class and watched as a group of elderly women, sitting in a semi-circle, kicked large inflatable balls around the room at breakneck speed. Meet and greet: Philip meets a resident - most of whom were younger than the 92-year-old Prince . All smiles: Philip showed off his quirky sense of humour during the trip - one of his first since taking two months leave following surgery . Standing in the doorway, the prince remarked: ‘This is dangerous’. He then spotted 22-month-old Ella, whose great-grandmother Florence Crisp, 93, was taking part in the class, sitting on an inflatable ball and asked: ‘Do you get bonus points if you knock her off?’ Afterwards the prince turned to Elaine Stamp, manager of the residential block where the class was held and enquired: ‘Health and safety people?’. ‘Health and safety goes out the window,’ she joked. Fortunately, . said staff, all of those present took Philip’s remarks in their stride. ‘Everyone thought it was very funny and no-one was offended in the . slightest. It was really quite funny,’ said one. Activities assistant Bobbie Sauerzapf, . who was leading the class, added: ‘This is gentle exercise to stimulate . parts of the body that are not used too often, they really enjoy it.’ ‘I think the Duke wanted to join in, to be honest. He looks brilliant for his age.’ During . his tour of the £4 million centre, which opened last November, the . prince also watched residents playing indoor bowls and a performance by a . troupe of eye-catching young performers from the Broadland School of . Dance. Fun and games: The Prince watched residents as they exercise by kicking inflatable balls around the room . Having a ball: Philip observed the football-like game and joked that participants would get bonus points for knocking this little girl off her ball . Viewed by some as 'refreshingly open' but by others as somewhat politically incorrect, Prince Philip, pictured waving to the cameras today right, has always possessed a propensity to shock. In 1986 he told British students in Peking: 'If you stay here much longer you'll all be slitty-eyed.' Seven years later, he told a Briton living in Hungary: 'You can't have been here long. You've not got a pot belly.' His remarks apparently alluded to the Hungarians' love of food and drink. Closer to home, he caused a storm while touring a factory in Edinburgh in August 1999 when he remarked that a fuse box 'looked as though it had been put in by an Indian'. Again in Scotland, he outraged locals when he asked a driving instructor he met on a walkabout in Oban in 1995: ‘How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them past the test?'.His other foot-in-mouth remarks include telling a group of teenagers from the British Deaf Association in Cardiff who were standing near a loud Caribbean steel band: 'If you're near that music it's no wonder you're deaf.' Some of his off-the-cuff remarks have proved more amusing, however. When asked if he knew the Scilly Isles, off the coast of Cornwall, he joked: ‘Yes, my son owns them.’ And of his daughter, Princess Anne, he jested: ‘If it doesn't fart or eat hay, she is not interested.' But last year when Philip, pictured above signing portraits today, caused a bit of a stir on a Diamond Jubilee visit to Bromley in Kent with the Queen when he spotted pretty Hannah Jackson, 25, in an eye-catching peplum-style red dress which had a zip running the length of its front. ‘I would get arrested if I unzipped that dress!’ he exclaimed. While Hannah, an LSE graduate who works for Bromley Council as a schools and transport co-ordinator, retained her composure, an unnamed policeman just fell about in a heap of giggles as the prince moved on. Senior royal sources insist that the prince doesn’t mean to shock but has a mischievous sense of humour - which he likes to use to put people who might be nervous at meeting royalty at ease. Before leaving, Philip officially opened the Green Lane View accommodation centre where the activities session was held. And to mark the occasion, the . residents had produced a printed cotton quilt of advice and sayings for . the Duke to take for Prince George - wisdom from 2,399 accumulated years . of life. A message to the . royal baby from one resident, identified only by his first name Arthur, . was ‘keep your nose clean’, while Pamela wrote ‘Find your own Way in . life.’ The heartfelt words were accompanied . by pictures the contributors liked, from countryside images to Second . World War aircraft, reflecting the military service of some of the . residents. As Philip made . his way to his car, he met residents from a nursing accommodation block . who had been patiently waiting to greet him. They were wrapped up in blankets as they sat in their wheelchairs and waved Union flags and red, white and blue balloons. Young and old: The Duke of Edinburgh met pupils of the Broadland School of Dance during his 45-minute tour . Present: Philip was given a quilt containing advice for Prince George from one of the female pensioners . Ted Sewell, 88, a former butcher, said . he supplied meat to Althorp House, the ancestral home of the Spencer . family where Diana, Princess of Wales grew up. He . said: ‘Philip looks just like he does on the telly. When I was butcher I . met William and Harry - they were always fighting each other.’ Philip was admitted to The London Clinic in early June – his fourth hospitalisation in just 18 months – where he underwent what Buckingham Palace described as an ‘exploratory operation following abdominal investigations’. He was released 10 days later and although staff have refused to discuss the result of the tests citing medical confidentiality, they made clear he would require at least two months recuperation. After retiring to recover at the Queen’s residences at Windsor Castle and Sandringham, Philip flew up to Scotland but now plans to embark on a full programme of public engagements of up to 300 engagements a year. On the mend: Philip was taken to the London clinic in early June - his fourth hospitalisation in 18 months - for the procedure and was released 10 days later .","Sprightly Prince recoiled in horror at site of a walking frame on visit today .

'It's going to be so magical to be out there,' she said in an interview yesterday with The Associated Press. 'It's going to be a spectacle right in the middle of New York City.' Last month, the native New Yorker became the first person to have swum from Havana to Key West, Florida, without a shark cage. She said that one of her Manhattan swimming companions will be a dog named Roscoe that survived Sandy floodwaters.

They have travelled more than 800 miles from the northern Indian town of Vrindavan to spend a week on a striking decorative ship on the River Hooghli to celebrate Kolkata's Hindu festival considered to be the 'Rio Carnival of the Eastern Hemisphere'. It is the biggest festival of the year in West Bengal and for a week, people celebrate and worship the Hindu goddess Durga, with a dizzying array of colourful 'pandals' - ceremonial decorative structures - music, art and dancing.

In Scotland temperatures in some areas will dip as low as two degrees while much of the country will see the mercury dip below five. The plummeting temperatures, which in some areas will be colder than Russia's St Petersburg, bring the risk of widespread frost on Thursday night.

Visitors to Cambridge Botanical Gardens enjoyed strolls under the trees, with their autumnal hues of red, orange and yellow, as temperatures hit 21C in the South and East today . As recently as Sunday, sun worshippers were making the most of the weather by relaxing in local parks. The Met Office said the shift in weather will be caused by southern European breezes meeting gales in the north, causing temperatures to plummet. Met Office spokesperson Nicky Maxey said: 'The warm air moving up from the continent that has been keeping temperatures high will turn around to come from the cold north. 'It is not an extreme switch in the other direction but you will feel it more in exposed areas. 'We are going to see temperatures falling, so by Thursday it will be 12 or 13 degrees in the South, which is a good six or seven degrees below what we had on Monday. 'There is a risk of frost on Thursday night going into Friday across the country. We are looking at a minimum of three or four degrees, even in the South, but more likely on the western side, so it's going to be feeling rather chilly.' The Autumnal weather will bring wind and rain in from the north tonight, to  Scotland and parts of the North East. Ms Maxey said: 'Heavy showers and rain will be moving south eastwards across the Northern Isles and north east Scotland tomorrow. Today's autumnal colours on display at Burnby Hall Gardens, Pocklington, East Yorkshire, are a far cry away from the wintry conditions expected this weekend . 'We could be seeing winds of up to 50 knots, or 57 miles per hour, with wintry showers in Scotland, with a risk of blizzards on higher ground above 500 metres in the Highlands and you may see sleet on the Grampians. 'Scotland and the East Coast will have the risk of gales buffeting many in Scotland tomorrow, but these will move further afield on Thursday. The temperatures in Britain could soon reach the lows of snowy St Petersburg, according to weather forecasters . 'It will be showery and windy to the east but the further west you go the better it will be on Thursday.' A Met Office spokesman said: 'We have had some unseasonably warm weather and it's going to be getting back to what it should be for this time of year with cooler temperatures, rain and wind. 'There's going to be a big difference . and people are going to feel it, but the weather is going to be more . like it should be for this time of year.

Royal Mail executives have applied for around £500,000 of additional shares in the controversial flotation of the state-owned giant, it emerged last night. The applications – which include one from chief executive Moya Greene – will receive ‘priority’ over other small investors clamouring to buy shares in the controversial privatisation. Last night campaigners said it would be wrong if Royal Mail’s executives and the City were to make ‘fat profits’ if the demand for shares by small shareholders is scaled back. Leading the charge: Chief executive Moya Greene will get a chunk of free shares like all other Royal Mail workers despite having a pay package of £1.5million . Like all Royal Mail workers, Miss Greene will get a chunk of free shares, estimated to be worth around £2,000 for each worker. They could make an instant profit of more than £700 as the shares are set to rise sharply when conditional trading begins on the stock market on Friday, possibly jumping from £3 to £4. But Miss Greene and her ten fellow directors also want to buy shares in the flotation, according to the company’s prospectus. Buried on page 214, it states: ‘The directors have indicated to the company that they intend to make applications in the offer for an amount equal to, at least, approximately £500,000, in aggregate.’ The executives will benefit from the same ‘priority’ given to Royal Mail’s workers when applying for shares and can apply for as many shares as they wish within the tranche that has been set aside for staff. If that part of the offer is oversubscribed then they will be subjected to a £10,000 limit. But the executives will be hoping that many of their lower paid staff will simply not have the financial resources to apply for more shares. The average postman working full-time earns a pay package of nearly £25,000, while Miss Greene enjoys a pay package of around £1.5million a year. Dr Tim May, of the Wealth Management Association, which campaigns for the rights of small shareholders, warned he would be ‘very disappointed’ if they were over-looked. Only 368 postmen out of a total of 150,000 plan to refuse free stocks . He said: ‘Given this is the first positive sign of smaller investors getting a share in our economic growth, we would be very disappointed if their allocation were reduced significantly, or at all.’ Business minister Michael Fallon has insisted small investors who want to buy shares in the privatisation will ‘get their fair share’. The Government decided to set up an ‘employee priority offer’, open to all workers, to encourage loyalty among its staff and to give them ‘a share in the group’s success.’ Under the deal, they will pay the same price as other retail investors – between £2.60 and £3.30 per share – but will ‘receive priority on up to the first £10,000-worth of shares applied for’. Instant profits: Royal Mail employers could stand to make more than £700 as sales are expected to rise sharply when trading begins on the stock market on Friday . The ‘employee priority offer’ will be . capped at 10 per cent of the total number of shares allocated in the . retail offer, which is 30 per cent of the total number. Justin Modray, of the personal finance website Candid Money, said: ‘While the Royal Mail flotation could stand to make the City and Royal Mail executives a fat profit, it is important that small investors do not get over-looked and end up having their share allocation scaled back. ‘The danger is that Joe Bloggs gets scaled back, but the City and the executives do not suffer in the same way.’ Royal Mail’s eight non-executive directors, including the chairman Donald Brydon, have opted out of receiving free shares, deciding it was ‘inappropriate’ to accept them. But both the non-executive directors and the executive directors have subscribed for a total of £500,000 of shares in the company. The exact number of shares which they end up getting is expected to be published on Friday when the share price is announced. The Royal Mail prospectus states: ‘The directors will not receive any priority application beyond that applicable to all eligible employees.’ To be eligible, a worker must have been employed by the company on July 10 and still be working for the firm at the time of the flotation. After five years, they can be sold tax-free.","Employees could make as much as £700 as stocks are expected to rise sharply when trading begins on Friday .

It's a job that's meant to take just four minutes a day, but even that can feel like a drag. Now, one company has made a 3D printed toothbrush tailored to an individual's teeth that promises a thorough clean in just six seconds. The Blizzident doesn't look like a conventional toothbrush - in fact, it resembles a mouth guard. Instead of brushing, the device is placed on the surface of the teeth and the user bites on the device. Scroll down for video . The Blizzident (pictured) does not look like a mouthguard with bristles. It is placed on the surface of a person's teeth and allows the user to bite on the device and grind their teeth to clean them. Some of the 400 bristles are visible . They then grind their teeth to clean them, instead of using a motion associated with conventional brushes. The company uses a 3D model of an individual's teeth created using an impression or scan made by a dentist to print the device, which costs around £122. The device itself is made of plastic and contains 400 soft bristles as well as slits for dental floss. The bristles are soft and tapered as well as being tailored to teeth to brush along the gumline at a 45 degree angle so that users brush their teeth by biting and grinding for around six seconds. By biting the brush using what dentists call the 'modified bass' technique, users clean the gingival sulcus - the space underneath the gum line - particularly well as well as 'cleaning all other surfaces perfectly,' according to the company. The unusual brush has 400 bristles set at a 45 degree angle to clean below the gum line - and every tooth surface - when a user grinds their teeth and bites on the device in quick succession. The handle of the brush is a floss dispenser and there are small slots so floss so that the device cleans in-between teeth too . To clean teeth throughly, a user must bite and release the device quickly 10 to 15 times, which creates a 'vibrating, jiggling upwards, downwards and slightly circling movements', according to the firm. The resulting 'sub gingival bass technique' is easy to achieve using the tailor-made device but is difficult to master using a conventional handheld brush. Users of the Blizzident should also grind their teeth with their mouths closed to brush according to the 'fones' technique to clean the top surface of their molars, the company said. To clean teeth throughly, a user must bite and release the device quickly 10 to 15 times, which creates a 'vibrating, jiggling upwards, downwards and slightly circling movements'. It also has a little brush in the centre (pictured in the circle) to clean a user's tongue . The website says: 'Because you are brushing all your teeth . at the same time, you are brushing extremely quickly. You brush all the . difficult-to-reach and inter-dental regions without even having to think . about it.' There are slits for dental floss that users can route through the innovative brush so they are 'perfectly positioned for an individual's inter-dental regions' so that when they bite and grind, they are flossing at the same time. The handle of the brush also doubles as a floss dispenser, while there is also an in-built tongue cleaner, that scrapes bacteria off the tongue while the brush is in use.

Cosmetic surgery clinics are still offering perks - such as chauffeurs and package deals - despite Government recommendations they should be banned. More than half of the top 50 aesthetic plastic surgery providers still advertise promotional deals often tied in with freebies, photo shoots, competitions or holiday destinations. The research, published at the annual meeting of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) in London, found that many deals were also time-linked, with statements such as ‘book by Friday’. Cosmetic surgery clinics are still offering perks, such as chauffeurs and package deals, despite Government recommendations they should be banned . Not one provider gave patients the recommended two-stage written consent cooling-off period. A separate study looking into non-surgical treatments such as wrinkle-relaxing injections and dermal fillers, found 58 per cent of the top 50 providers were offering incentives. Some 32 per cent did not say who actually administered the treatments and more than a quarter made no mention of qualifications. Sites where these facial procedures could take place included shopping centres, gyms and parties at home. Some 32 per cent of non-surgical treatment providers do not say who administers the treatments and more than a quarter make no mention of qualifications . Only 22 per cent of the procedures were offered in facilities registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). In April, a report from NHS medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, following the PIP breast implant scandal, warned that advertising practices in the industry were highly misleading. It said time-limited deals, financial inducements, package deals, and reduced prices for referring a friend were ‘socially irresponsible’ and should be banned by professional codes of practice. BAAPS president Rajiv Grover said: ‘This new, yet sadly unsurprising, evidence shows that despite the recommendations of Sir Bruce Keogh's review, the most popular providers continue to advertise financial inducements and “luxury” incentives, clearly reinforcing the preposterous notion that surgery is part of a celebrity-style status symbol involving photo shoots and chauffeur services. ‘There is nothing glamorous about surgery and these serious (and irreversible) procedures should not be sold alongside aspirational perks as if they were part of a jet-setting lifestyle.’ A new Government-endorsed National Institute of Aesthetic Research (NIAR) has been set up by BAAPS and the Healing Foundation to establish scientific evidence on aesthetic procedures.

Satellite images of the mysterious island that rose up from the sea last week reveal that it is round, with cracks and remarkably flat, similar to a 'mud pie'. The island, named Zalzala Koh, emerged after a devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck 145 miles southeast of Dalbandin in . Pakistan's quake-prone province of Baluchistan. It has become an attraction for tourists and locals who have visited the area despite toxic, flammable gas being emitted from its cracks. The surface is covered in sea creatures such as dead fish and is a mixture of mud, sand and rock. Scroll down for videos... An aerial photo of the island suggests the grey-coloured mound is about 15 to 20 meters tall. The surface is covered in sea creatures such as dead fish and is a mixture of mud, sand and rock. It is solid enough for people to walk on . The latest images were taken by Nasa's  Earth Observing-1 and Landsat 8 satellites just days after the island emerged. The lighter shades of green and tan in the water reveal shallow seafloor or suspended sediment. The water depth around the new island is roughly 15 to 20 meters, according to marine geologist Asif Inam of Pakistan’s National Institute of Oceanography. 'The floor in that area is generally flat, but the gradient in this area changes quite abruptly,' said Mr Inam. The aerial photograph above provides a close-up of the landform, . estimated to stretch 75 to 90 meters across and standing 15 to 20 meters . (60 to 70 feet) above the water line. The below image is also clear enough to show the parallel ripples of waves marching toward the shore. The island rose from the seafloor near Gwadar on September 24, shortly after the earthquake struck about 380 kilometers (230 miles) inland. This image was captured by Nasa's Advanced Land Imager on the Earth Observing-1 satellite . Scientists . believe the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which struck 145 miles southeast . of Dalbandin in Baluchistan, triggered what is known as 'mud volcano'. They occur where there is a reservoir of . loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder, denser rock and a . path is made to the surface. The . seismic waves caused a movement of gases locked in the earth under the . sea, pushing mud and earth up to the surface along with gas. These sudden islands are usually only . spotted after strong earthquakes, at least 7- or 8-magnitude events. 'The island is really just a big pile of mud from the seafloor that got pushed up,' said Bill Barnhart, a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey who studies earthquakes in Pakistan and Iran. 'This area of the world seems to see so many of these features because the geology is correct for their formation. 'You need a shallow, buried layer of pressurised gas—methane, carbon dioxide, or something else—and fluids. 'When that layer becomes disturbed by seismic waves (like an earthquake), the gases and fluids become buoyant and rush to the surface, bringing the rock and mud with them.' Dead fish have been spotted floating on the surface of the waters surrounding the island and visitors have heard hissing noises from the escaping toxic gas.

Such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea, pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano . Waves, storms, and tidal action from the Arabian Sea will wash away the loose sand, soft clay, and mud on the island . ‘It is known that mud volcanoes can be . triggered by large nearby earthquakes – in fact the same thing happened . in this area in 2001. ‘The . exact mechanism for this triggering is poorly understood but the fact . that mud volcanoes often occur without a triggering earthquake suggests . that little extra impetus is required.’ The life of this island is likely to be short, according to Nasa.

Dozens of people had already visited the island despite concerns over toxic gas . Such land masses have appeared before off Pakistan's Makran coast, said Muhammed Arshad, a hydrographer with the navy. After quakes in 1999 and 2010, new land masses rose up along a different part of the coast about 282 kilometers (175 miles) east of Gwadar, he said. He said each of those disappeared back into the sea within a year during the monsoon season, a period of heavy rain and wind that sweeps Pakistan every summer. He said that in the area where the island was created on Tuesday, the sea is only about six to seven meters (23 feet) deep. Older residents of the coastal town recalled an earthquake in 1968 produced an island that stayed for one year and then vanished.","Images show island to be remarkably flat and round, with huge fissures .

The International  Monetary Fund yesterday doubled Britain’s growth forecasts for the year in the biggest upgrade for any major economy. In a huge boost for the Government, the IMF said UK output will increase by 1.4 per cent this year – twice the rate predicted in April when it warned Chancellor George Osborne was ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead with his austerity programme. The forecast was also higher than the 0.9 per cent predicted in July and the IMF expects growth to accelerate to 1.9 per cent in 2014. Boost: George Osborne will feel vindicated at the IMF upgrading its forecast for UK growth by more than any other developed economy . Its chief economist Olivier Blanchard, who was behind the ‘playing with fire’ claim,  conceded that he was ‘pleasantly surprised’. Britain’s economy is now the fastest growing among the European members of the G7 group of the world’s richest nations, including France and Germany. Germany will grow by 0.5 per cent this year and 1.4 per cent next year, and France by just 0.2 per cent in 2013 and one per cent in 2014. Mr Blanchard said: ‘Six months ago we were worried about growth in the UK coming back. We’ve been pleasantly surprised.’ But in a note of scepticism, he said Britain’s improved performance ‘does not tell us whether fiscal consolidation [austerity] was right or not’. ‘It doesn’t tell us whether growth would have come back earlier with a different fiscal framework. When we see risks, we warn. And if the risks are avoided, all the better,’ he said. In its World Economic Output report, the IMF noted signs of an improving economy consistent ‘with increasing consumer and business confidence’. However, it said ‘output remains well below its pre- crisis peak’. Recent figures  suggest Britain’s gross domestic product is still about 3 per cent shy of the peak in 2007. Meanwhile a poll of members of the Institute of Directors found 75 per cent believe the outlook is now ‘brighter’ than at any time since 2008. The improved outlook will, however, take some time to be reflected in the jobs market. The IMF says the unemployment rate will fall from 7.7 per cent this year to 7.5 per cent in 2014. This measure is important because the Bank of England will not consider raising interest rates until it falls to 7 per cent. The main cloud on the horizon for the British and world economy is the ‘shutdown’ in Washington, the IMF’s chief economist said, while failure to lift the US debt ceiling could lead to ‘potentially major disruptions’ in financial markets. The Treasury said: ‘The IMF has confirmed the UK economy is turning a corner.’ But it acknowledged ‘the recovery cannot be taken for granted’. Mr Osborne said: ‘I think the overwhelming majority of people now realise Britain was right to tackle its debts. We can see jobs being created in our economy, but, of course, we’ve still got a long way to go.’ Reverse: Only six months ago the International Monetary Fund's chief economist Olivier Blanchard accused Mr Osborne of 'playing with fire'","International Monetary Fund boosts UK by more than any developed nation .

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has said that his government will never develop nuclear weapons and that he has full authority to negotiate a nuclear deal with the West. Rouhani also said that the tone of a letter he received recently from President Obama, in an exchange of messages between the two leaders, was 'positive and constructive.' 'It could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future,' he said. President Rouhani said that a recent exchange of messages with President Obama could prove to be 'subtle and tiny steps' towards better relations in the future . The exchange between the two leaders could set the stage for the first meeting between a U.S. and Iranian leader since Iran's 1979 revolution. The recently elected leader was speaking to NBC News anchor-at-large Ann Curry in Tehran on Wednesday. Through an interpreter, Rouhani told Curry that his administration will never develop nuclear weapons and that he has full authority to make a deal with the West on the disputed atomic program. 'In its nuclear program, this government enters with full power and has complete authority,' he said. Asked whether Iran would ever build a nuclear weapon, Rouhani noted that the country has repeatedly pledged that 'under no circumstances would we seek any weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, nor will we ever.' 'We have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb, and we are not going to do so,' he said. 'We solely are looking for peaceful nuclear technology.' Rouhani told NBC News' Ann Curry that his administration will never develop nuclear weapons and that he has full authority to make a deal with the West on the disputed atomic program . Rouhani will make his first appearance . on the world stage as president next week at the United Nations General . Assembly in New York. U.S. officials are hoping for more signs that he will defrost relations with the West and take a more moderate line in the next negotiations on Iran's nuclear program. The U.S. and its allies suspect Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability. Tehran says its nuclear program is purely for peaceful purposes, but Israel regards it as a threat to its existence and refuses to rule out military action. With the election of an apparently more pragmatic president in the British-educated moderate Rouhani, it has been hoped Western countries might see a better chance for diplomacy and strike a deal to curb Iran’s uranium enrichment program and avoid any conflict. The last meeting between an American and Iranian leader was in 1977 when President Carter met Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. White House spokesman Jay Carney said there were no current plans for Obama to meet Rouhani at the General Assembly. White House spokesman Jay Carney said there were no current plans for Obama to meet Rouhani at the General Assembly next week in New York . ‘I think it's fair to say that the president believes there is an opportunity for diplomacy when it comes to the issues that have presented challenges to the United States and our allies with regards to Iran,’ he said. ‘And we hope that the Iranian government takes advantage of this opportunity.’ Carney said the U.S. will test Rouhani's assertions that he wants to improve relations with the international community. He also noted that Obama too had confirmed the exchange of letters with Rouhani. In his letter, Obama indicated that the U.S. was ready to resolve the nuclear issue in a way that would allow Iran to demonstrate that its program was exclusively for peaceful purposes, Carney said. ‘The letter also conveyed the need to act with a sense of urgency to address this issue because as we have long said, the window of opportunity for resolving this diplomatically is open, but it will not remain open indefinitely,’ Carney said. Rouhani said the letter from Obama raised some issues the U.S. president was concerned about and that he had responded to the points Obama raised. ‘From my point of view, the tone of the letter was positive and constructive,’ Rouhani said, adding that world leaders should not be under the influence of pressure groups.

The fire that ravaged a Tesla Model S electric car earlier this week began in the vehicle's battery compartment, it has been revealed, after the driver hit a large piece of metal debris. When pictures of the blaze first surfaced on the internet, the California-based car maker's stock dropped. By the end of trading, it had fallen a total of six per cent, closing at $180.95 (£111.55) - down by $12.05 (£7.43). In an incident report, released under . Washington state's public records law, officials wrote they . thought the fire had started in the car's battery compartment. Scroll down for video . Shares of Tesla Motors fell more than six per cent on Wednesday after an online video showed one of the firm's electric Model S vehicles on fire in Seattle, pictured. Despite appearing to have the fire under control, firefighters wrote in an official report the flames reignite meaning they had to use a dry chemical extinguisher . In August this year, the Tesla Model S was awarded a five-star safety rating by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) - not just overall, but in every subcategory. Approximately one percent of all cars tested by the federal government achieve five stars across the board. NHTSA does not publish a star rating above five, however safety levels better than five stars are captured in the overall Vehicle Safety Score (VSS) provided to manufacturers. In this guide, the Model S was shown as having a combined score of 5.4 stars - one of the highest ever recorded. It also set a new record for the 'lowest likelihood of injury to occupants.' However, it was actually caused by the driver hitting a large piece of metal debris, which damaged the battery part of the car - and was not due to a fault. The Model S has previously been touted as . the safest car in America and it received among the highest scores ever . recorded from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in August. Despite appearing to have the fire under control, firefighters wrote in the report that the flames reignited and water intensified the burning, meaning they had to use a dry chemical extinguisher. The liquid-cooled 85 kilowatt-hour . battery in the Tesla Model S is fitted below the car on the passenger side of the vehicle. It uses lithium-ion similar to the batteries in laptops and phones. Investors and companies have previously voiced concerns about the fire risk of such batteries after issues were reported in recent years involving the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car . and Boeing's 787 plane. Company spokeswoman Liz Jarvis-Shean said the fire Tuesday was caused by the crash after a large metallic object was thought to have hit one of the battery pack's modules in the Model S. 'A Model S collided with a large metallic object in the middle of the road, causing significant damage to the vehicle,' the company said in a statement. 'The car’s alert system signalled a problem and instructed the driver to pull over safely, which he did. No-one was injured, and the sole occupant had sufficient time to exit the vehicle safely and call the authorities. Shares of Tesla have risen more than 400 per cent this year, but they fell $12.05 (£7.43) to $180.95 (£111.55) on Wednesday, chart pictured. R.W. Baird analyst Ben Kallo also cut his rating on the motoring firm's stock from 'Outperform' to 'Neutral', which may have affected its price . In an incident report, officials wrote they thought the fire, pictured, started in the car's battery compartment . 'Subsequently, a fire caused by the substantial damage sustained during the collision was contained to the front of the vehicle thanks to the design and construction of the vehicle and battery pack. 'All indications are that the fire never entered the interior cabin of the car. It was extinguished on-site by the fire department.' After dismantling the front end of the vehicle and puncturing holes in the battery pack, the fire crew used a circular saw to cut an access hole in the front section to apply water to the battery, according to documents. The incident happened as the Tesla's driver was traveling southbound on state Route 167 through the Seattle suburb of Kent, said Trooper Chris Webb of the Washington State Patrol. The driver believed he had struck some metal debris on the freeway so exited the highway, where the vehicle broke down. The driver told authorities he began to smell something burning and then the vehicle caught fire. Firefighters arrived within three minutes of the first call, and although it's not clear from the records how long the fire lasted, crews were said to have remained on scene for two and a half hours. Tesla's battery system and the Model S, pictured, have received rave reviews including a top crash-test score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It also achieved one of the highest auto ratings ever recorded by Consumer Reports magazine . Tesla said the flames were contained to the front of the $70,000 vehicle due to its design and construction. 'This was not a spontaneous event,' Jarvis-Shean said. 'Every indication we have at this point is that the fire was a result of the collision and the damage sustained through that.' There was too much damage from the fire to see what damage debris may have caused, Webb added. The motoring website Jalopnik posted photos of the blaze claiming they were taken by a reader, along with a video. Shares of Tesla have risen more than 400 per cent this year, but it is thought some investors may have been alarmed by the fire. Tesla shares fell $12.05 (£7.43) to $180.95 (£111.55) on Wednesday. Also contributing to the stock's . decline was an analyst downgrade; R.W. Baird analyst Ben Kallo cut . his rating on the stock from 'Outperform' to 'Neutral'. He is reported to have told investors that while he's still 'bullish' on Tesla's long-term prospects, . the company has 'significant milestones' during the next 18 months that . come with risk. Tesla said the flames in the Seattle fire were contained to the front of the vehicle, a press shot of the car is pictured, due to its 'design and construction.' 'This was not a spontaneous event,' spokeswoman Jarvis-Shean said. 'Every indication is that the fire was a result of the collision' The . company's battery system and the Model S have received rave . reviews, including a top crash-test score from the National Highway . Traffic Safety Administration. It also received one of the highest auto ratings ever . recorded by Consumer Reports magazine. Yet lithium-ion batteries have raised concerns in other vehicles. Two years ago, battery fires broke out in three Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid cars after crash-testing, but NHTSA investigators determined that the Volt was no more risky than vehicles with conventional gasoline engines. Officials from General Motors, and the government, believed the fires were caused by coolant leaking from damaged plastic casing around the batteries after side-impact test crashes. At the time, they said there were no real-world fires in any Volts. Earlier this year, Boeing's worldwide fleet of 787s was grounded because lithium-ion batteries overheated or caught fire. Flights resumed four months later after a revamped battery system was installed.","Tesla shares fell twice, by a total of 6%, after a Model S car caught fire .

A thin 5ft 6in woman of eastern European or Asian descent was captured by CCTV distracting pensioner Leslie Parsonage by asking him for the time. While the obliging man looked at his watch, she swiped his wallet which contained his £450 of his pension from his jacket pocket before walking off and putting on a white hat. Polite enquiry: The thief asks Mr Parsonage for the time posing to be a friendly stranger . Wicked: She walks away with then elderly man's wallet in her hand. It contained £450 of his pension in cash . A possible male accomplice is also seen near the scene of the crime on Fryern Arcade in Chandler’s Ford, Hampshire.

'He was obviously frail and vulnerable, he had his white stick with him, and yet she still struck. This has really knocked him and changed his life. It may have even shortened it. Fear: Mr Parsonage insists that he will no longer venture to the shopping arcade despite it being his only trip out of the house . 'We just hope that if anyone recognises her from the images that they will come forward and help stop her from doing it again.'

The new $100 bill, with an array of high-tech features designed to thwart counterfeiters, will get its coming out party today after being plagued by printing problems. Benjamin Franklin remains as the face of the bill, but he is joined by a new changing colour ink well and bell and a 3D security ribbon. The new design bills were previously scheduled to be launched in the U.S. in February 2011, but the Bureau of Engraving and Printing first hit has been set back with printing and quality control issues since 2010. Scroll down for video . New design bills: Its production has been plagued with printing issues, but finally - two-and-a-half years later than planned - the new design $100 is being issued to federal banks . The government ran into troubles when 1 billion of the first bills were found in 2010 to have unwanted creases. There was later a problem with ink smearing that further delayed introduction of the new notes. Then earlier this year, a 'mashing' issue - when too much ink is applied making it impossible to create crisp lines - resulted in at least 30 million $100 bills being destroyed. The problem occurred at one of three printing factories and set back issuance of the new design by several more months. But officials say the problems have now been fixed. Michael Lambert, Deputy Associate Director at Board of Governors Federal Reserve System, said in a video statement that 'issuance was delayed until the Bureau of Engraving and Printing resolved some unexpected production challenges.' Larry Felix, the director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing said the bureau is now confident it has resolved the various production issues. Today, the Federal Reserve will transport the highest value American currency in armored trucks from its regional banks around the country headed to banks, savings and loans and other financial institutions with the new notes. Being rolled out: Americans could get their hands on a new bill as early as tomorrow. The government reminds people their existing $100 notes will remain usable . Some bank customers could start seeing . the new bills, which took a decade to redesign, by Tuesday afternoon . depending on how close their bank is to a regional Federal facility. 'We . have 3.5 billion of these notes which we think will be more than ample . to meet domestic and international demands,' said Sonja Danburg, program . manager for U.S. currency education at the Fed. The . bill redesign, the first for the $100 bill since March 1996, will still . have Benjamin Franklin on the front and Philadelphia's Independence . Hall on the back. In . addition, there is a disappearing Liberty Bell in an ink well and a . bright blue three-dimensional security ribbon with images that move in . the opposite direction from the way the bill is being tilted. The number . 100 also shifts from copper to green. 'The 3-D security ribbon is magic. It is made up of hundreds of thousands of micro-lenses in each note,' said Mr Felix, the director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. 'This is the most complex note the United States has ever produced.' Improvements: Compared with the existing $100 bills, there is an additional blue ribbon, a changing colour Liberty Bell, and tiny inscriptions along Franklin's collar . The $100 bill is the last bill to get a make-over in a process that began in 2003 with the $20 bill. The government redesigned the greenbacks with subtle colours and other security features to make it harder for counterfeiters. The $100 bill, which is the most commonly counterfeited note outside of the United States, was redesigned with even more complex security features. Officials stressed that the $900 billion worth of $100 bills currently in circulation will remain good and will only be gradually phased out as worn-out bills are returned to Federal facilities. The $100 bill is the largest U.S. denomination in circulation and has the longest life at 15 years. The $1 bill lasts 5.9 years. The new $100 bills will have one old feature. The signature on the bills will be that of former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The signature of current Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who has been teased by President Barack Obama for his loopy handwriting, will start appearing once the current supply of new bills has been put into circulation.","New design $100 plagued by creasing, ink and printing issues since 2010 .

The frantic family of a schoolgirl who vanished after telling friends she was going to a party yesterday pleaded with her to get in touch. Detectives are growing increasingly concerned for the safety of 14-year-old Esme Smith, who disappeared more than a week ago. Instead of going to a party near her home in Surrey, she boarded a train to London and was last seen shortly after arriving at Waterloo station – approximately 40 miles from where she lives. Scroll down for video . Missing: Esme Smith, 14, who has not been seen since getting the train to London to go to a party a week ago . She has not made contact with her friends or family since. CCTV images of the teenager at Waterloo show she had changed out of her school uniform and into a white flowery dress. She was also wearing a blue denim jacket and was carrying a black school bag and black floral bag with chain straps. Police say the longer Esme is missing the more anxious they are about her safety. Last night her 19-year-old  sister, Sian, made an emotional appeal to the missing girl, describing her as ‘extrovert, vivacious, normal’. She said: ‘Esme, if you are reading this, I just want to say please come home or at least get in touch so that we know that you are safe. Last sighting: Esme Smith is seen walking through a door at Waterloo train station, central London, last Thursday after getting changed into a dress . Missing teenager: Esme's sister Sian, 19, today pleaded for her to get in touch . ‘We are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are OK. ‘You are not in any trouble so please just get in touch.’ Last night Esme’s mother, Dinah Smith, 39, was too upset to talk at the family’s detached home in Farnham, Surrey – which she shares with the schoolgirl’s father, 50-year-old Mark Smith. Detective Sergeant Antony Preston from Surrey Police Missing Persons Unit said: ‘We are following up a number of lines of enquiry and we have had a number of calls as to Esme’s whereabouts, but as time goes on our concerns about her welfare remain. ‘Anyone who has seen a girl matching her description or who knows her and has any information about her whereabouts is urged to contact us as soon as possible. Similarly, if Esme sees this appeal, please get in touch to confirm that you are safe and well.’ Esme was last seen by her friends when she left All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham at around 3.15pm last Thursday. She told them that she was travelling to Woking and would then be going on to a party. But the brunette boarded a train at Aldershot station just after 4pm and was then filmed on CCTV getting off a train at London Waterloo around 5pm. Police have issued several photographs of the teenager and a spokesman for the Surrey force said: ‘Esme is described  as white, 5ft 3in tall, slim to medium build, with shoulder-length brown hair that may be tied in a bun. ‘She has brown eyes and a tanned complexion and wears size six shoes.’ Officers have launched a ‘Twitter reconstruction’, using the social networking site to post details of the teenager’s last known movements along with pictures of her in the hope of jogging people’s memories. Police said that although she may be in London they are also considering the possibility that she may have moved on to somewhere outside the capital. Anyone with information should call Surrey Police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Esme Smith was last seen at London Waterloo last Thursday .

Private spaceflight company, SpaceX, has successfully launched the first of its newly-improved Falcon 9 rockets. The 22-story rocket soared off a launch pad at Vandenberg Air Force Station at 4pm GMT on Sunday . Currently, after delivering their payloads into orbit, booster rockets tumble back toward Earth and essentially explode mid-air before crashing into the sea. This is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £280 million. Space X, however, is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so that they can be recovered and recycled. The Falcon 9 blazed through clear blue skies out over the Pacific Ocean, its water vapour trail visible even as the rocket left the atmosphere. Falcon . 9 topped with SpaceX fairing is 224.4 feet (68.4 meters) tall and 12 . feet in diameter (the fairing is 17 feet in diameter). Its . nine first-stage Merlin engines generate 1.3 million pounds of thrust . at sea level, rising to 1.5 million pounds of thrust as Falcon 9 climbs . out of the Earth’s atmosphere. Falcon . 9 is named after the Millennium Falcon starship in the Star Wars movies. The . number 9 refers to the nine Merlin engines that power Falcon 9’s first . stage; one Merlin vacuum engine powers the second stage. During Sunday's launch, three first-stage engines were reignited, to see if they could bring the first-stage of the rocket segment down through the atmosphere intact. Another engine was then used to try to slow the stage still further just before it touched the water. ‘It went better than expected. It was incredibly smooth,’ SpaceX founder Elon Musk told Reuters. Nestled inside the rocket's new 17-foot (5-meter) diameter nose cone was a small Canadian science satellite called Cassiope that initially was to fly on SpaceX's now-discontinued Falcon 1. ‘It's certainly a huge relief to have successfully delivered Cassiope to orbit. It's been weighing on me quite heavily,’ Musk said. Space X is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so that they can be recovered and recycled. Pictured is the Falcon 9 rocket . ‘The most revolutionary thing about the new Falcon 9 is the potential ability to recover the boost phase, which is almost three-quarters of the cost of the rocket,’ Musk added. Neither engine restart test went perfectly, but engineers were able to get enough data to plan on a demonstration flight next year. ‘The most important thing is we now believe we have all the pieces of the puzzle,’ Musk said. The upgraded Falcon 9 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions, longer fuel tanks, new avionics and software intended to boost lift capacity and simplify operations for commercial service. Privately-owned SpaceX has contracts for more than 50 launches of its new Falcon 9 and planned Falcon Heavy rockets. Ten of those missions are to fly cargo to the International Space Station for Nasa. Falcon 9's next mission is to put a communications satellite into orbit for SES World Skies. The launch is targeted for next month from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.","Launch allowed SpaceX to test technology to make launch vehicles reusable .

A team of engineers from Daejon, South Korea, have produced gasoline formed from E. coli for the first time . Few people who have eaten food contaminated with E. coli and have suffered food poisoning as a result could imagine that there might be a good use for the bacteria. But Korean engineers have discovered a method of producing gasoline from the germ, which adds to the increasing number of biofuels. The scientists said that the chemical composition of gasoline is quite simple as is is made up almost exclusively of hydrocarbons (or alkanes) with some additives and blending agents. Increasing concerns about the environment and limited fossil fuels have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from a range of sustainable resources. Although scientists have successfully produced diesel using microbial methods, they have not had much luck in making gasoline, which is equally in demand as a fuel for various modes of transport. Researchers have previously made long chain alkanes to create diesel, but have struggled to replicate short-chain hydrocarbons that can be used to create a substance similar to gasoline. However, the team of engineers from Daejon, South Korea, have cracked the problem to produce gasoline formed from E. coli for the first time, dvice reported. Korean engineers' discovery of making gasoline from E. coli (pictured) could add to an increasing array of sustainable biofuels as well as potentially leading to people deliberately cooking with an E. coli-derived product, in the form of vegetable oil, and even wearing it in the form of make-up . They did this by using metabolic engineering to make short fatty acid derivatives that allow biosynthesis of short-chain alkanes. which yielded the gasoline as well as fatty esters and alcohols, simply by adding extra enzymes. Their discovery could lead to people deliberately cooking with an E. coli-derived product - vegetable oil, and even wearing in in the form of make-up. However, the technique is still in its infancy and on a small scale. It has only produced 580mg of gasoline per litre. But with refinements in performance, productivity and concentration, it could one day prove a viable and flexible substance.","Korean engineers used metabolic engineering to make short fatty acid derivatives that allow biosynthesis of short-chain alkanes .

A postal worker said he stole the 'odd fiver' from greeting cards because he was being bullied at work, a court has heard. Barrie Whitehead helped himself in full view of CCTV cameras because he wanted to be caught and sacked from his job of 20 years. Manchester Crown Court was told that the 53-year-old was subjected to 'childish' homophobic taunts after he and his wife were seen socialising with friends in the gay area of the city. Depressed and 'isolated' from his workmates, he began looting small sums from mail at the depot where he worked around last Christmas. Confronted with the incriminating footage, Whitehead told investigators his behaviour was 'a cry for help'. He went on to admit stealing £62 in cash and £30 in gift vouchers and was given a 26-week sentence, suspended for a year, with 60 hours unpaid work. Bernadette Baxter, prosecuting, told Manchester Crown Court that earlier this year staff at the Manchester Mail Centre, Oldham Road, Ancoats, became 'suspicious' of Whitehead's activities and launched a surveillance operation. In the early hours of January 28 he was observed opening a greetings card and pocketing the contents. Four dummy packages were put his way as a trap. He took the bait, and was seen opening three of them with a small blade. In the interviews that followed Whitehead made 'full and frank admissions', the court heard, saying he had been stealing for about a month. Miss Baxter said: 'The defendant said he couldn't give any particular reason why he had stolen those items from the post, he wasn't in any particular financial difficulty. 'He did say he was suffering from depression, that he had been bullied at work and saw it himself as something of a cry for help.' Alistair Reid, defending, said while the offence was in a 'special category' because of the 'trust' placed in Royal Mail staff, Whitehead had been a model employee for many years. 'This is somebody who has, in his early 50s, taken such an outrageous step in full view of CCTV, effectively knowing he would be caught and identified. Staff at Manchester Mail Centre (pictured) became suspcious of Whitehead's activities earlier this year . 'On the face of it it's hard to accept that bullying of such a childish nature has led to this - the difficulty is that he is a very withdrawn and timid man, who simply does not have the capacity to stand up to these bullies or report it to his line manager. 'In the cold light of day that is what he should have done. Instead he's internalised these difficulties, become extremely withdrawn, to the point where he'd retreat to his car for isolation at lunchtime. 'He didn't inform his family until he was investigated and suspended,' Mr Reid added. The court heard that Whitehead, of Heaton Street, Prestwich, had lost his job and now worked as a maintenance operative at McDonalds. Sentencing, and ordering him to pay £200 prosecution costs, Judge Atherton said: 'It's the meanest sort of theft, not very much money, but people have trust they can put the odd £5 or £10 in greeting cards. There might be a child looking forward to some extra pocket money and (Whitehead) comes along and steals it - and calls it a cry for help.'","Claims he was targeted after he and his wife were seen in a popular gay area .

The creatures is also transparent, allowing to see the fish's internal organs. The tiny Danionella translucida from Burma (pictured) is just 10mm long when fully grown, and its tiny babies are so small they are almost invisible to the naked eye . The fish are found in Southern Myanmar in small shallow muddy streams. One recorded habitat is known as Bala Stream. Here the water has a pH of 7.2 and is medium-hard. They are found with various barbs and rasboras, and are highly likely to be at the bottom of the food chain due to its size. The maximum recorded is 12mm. Males are larger than females. Eggs are reported to be 0.5mm in diameter (relatively large for the size of fish), and only a few are laid at any one time. Their estimated lifespan is 2-3 years, but accurate data is still lacking on this. Staff at the aquarium were amazed when they noticed the tiny babies swimming with their parents in the display tank. Steve Chester, our Freshwater Aquarist, told MailOnline: ‘I am delighted to have the chance to work with this very rare fish.

Flights could soon be a much more technology-friendly place following a leaked report that suggests all devices connected to Wi-Fi can be used on most U.S. airliners. The report claims that electronic devices can connect to Wi-Fi at all points in a flight, and not just above the current 10,000 feet threshold. It goes much further than previous recommendations which sought to lower existing restrictions on electronic devices. An FAA advisory committee has concluded passengers can safely use hand-held electronic devices during all portions of flights on nearly all U.S. airliners . The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) advisory committee's report and recommendations haven't yet been released, but the contents were leaked to the Wall Street Journal. The FAA committee said that ‘many aircraft flying today are largely ready to handle passengers using their electronic devices, including during take-offs and landings’, according to the newspaper. However normal, ground-based cellular connections, such as those used for calls and data, will remain restricted. The suggestions are a hot-button issue for passengers, many of whom have chafed under strict rules that require portable electronic devices be turned off for take-off and landing . The committee concluded that 'gate to gate use' of such devices would also be safe . Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president of global public policy and member of the FAA committee, told the Journal that no matter what apps a device is running,  most aircraft ‘are going to be just fine’ in terms of safety. He added that the committee believed ‘gate to gate use’ of such devices would also be safe. The suggestions are a hot-button issue for passengers, many of whom have chafed under strict rules that require portable electronic devices be turned off for take-off and landing. Some passengers fear their devices will imperil a flight by disrupting navigation or radio signals. Others consider the risks remote and leave devices on during those critical phases of flight when planes are most prone to accidents. The recommendations arose amid intense interest from the public and some members of Congress, prompting the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last year to set up a committee to recommend how the rules should change. The committee began work in January aiming to conclude in six months. In July it got a two-month extension to come up with guidance on how airlines can assess the safety risks posed to critical flight systems and develop a policy on stowing devices that would work with expanded use of the devices. FAA Administrator Michael Huerta ‘will review the report and determine next steps,’ an FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said this week.","Leaked report suggests all devices connected to onboard Wi-Fi can be used .

When trying to recognise someone from far away or when their face is obscured, the brain uses information from a person's body size and shape to work out someone's identity, scientists said . When trying to recognise someone from far away or when their face is obscured, the brain uses information from a person’s body size and shape to work out someone's identity, scientists have said. U.S. researchers previously thought recognition relied solely on facial features but the latest discovery found that working out who someone is from far away relies on other physical cues. They believe their work could have implications for some security and law enforcement services, which currently focus on facial features to identify people. Researcher Allyson Rice, who led the University of Texas study, said: 'Psychologists and computer scientists have concentrated almost exclusively on the role of the face in person recognition. 'But our results show that the body can also provide important and useful identity information for person recognition.' The university study found people are almost unaware that their eyes and brains are scanning someone’s body in an attempt to identify them when facial clues aren’t enough. Experiments were carried out on university students who were shown images of two people side-by-side and the results published in the journal Psychological Science. The images showed similar-looking pairs of people who were in fact different individuals and changed to show other pairs of people who looked different but were the same person. U.S. researchers previously thought recognition relied solely on facial features but the latest discovery found that working out who someone is from far away relies on other physical cues . This way the 'information' provided by the people’s faces wasn’t helpful in determining the pictured person’s identity, as was proved by repeating the tests on computer face recognition systems, the scientists said. In other tests the pictures were adjusted to show either heads or bodies to determine which features were the most important for working out who was who. The researchers found that overall people were able to work out if the pictures were of the same person when they had both the face and body to identify them and curiously were just as accurate when the faces were blocked off. However, they were not as accurate at identifying people when their bodies were removed and just the faces could be seen. The team was surprised to see accuracy return when bodies were shown. In a survey undertaken after the completion of the visual tests, the participants said they used the nose, face shape, ears, mouth and eyes as clues to work out who was who - even though their test results suggested otherwise. The scientists believe their work could have implications for some security and law enforcement services, which currently focus on facial features to identify people . Ms Rice said: 'This left us with a paradox, the recognition data clearly indicated the use of body information for identification. 'However, the subjective ratings suggested that participants were unaware of how important the body was in their decision.' The team used eye tracking equipment to see exactly where the participants were looking when they were shown the images, which revealed they actually spent more time looking at the body when the faces were not clear enough. 'Eye movements revealed a highly efficient and adaptive strategy for finding the most useful identity information in any given image of a person, Ms Rice said. Professor Alice O’Toole added: 'We will continue comparing humans to machines on these new challenges. 'By looking at the way computer face recognition systems work, we often learn new and surprising things about the way humans recognise other people.'","U.S. researchers previously thought recognition relied on facial features .

Horror: The 31 second clip, recorded by a race car fan from behind the stretch of fence Franchitti struck, shows the cars speeding around the track as onlookers cheered . The three-time Indianapolis 500 champion was airlifted to hospital after the horror crash, which occurred at the last corner of the last lap at the Houston race. Scottish-born Franchitti was edged out of the way by Japanese driver Takuma Sato. When he struck the safety fencing, the car spun several times, firing rubble into the grandstands. Franchitti was seen on television cameras to be moving in the aftermath of the crash as safety stewards dashed to offer assistance and his team owner Chip Ganassi said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' in the helicopter on the way to hospital and had injured his ankle and back.

Senior Captain Ruy Lozana of the Houston Fire Department said that two of the 13 spectators were sent to hospital while the rest were fine to be treated at the scene. Franchitti was taken to a hospital near Reliant Park in Houston to be treated. The Scotsman was stretchered off the track and taken by ambulance to the nearby Houston hospital. Race officials said Franchitti was 'awake and alert' but did not initially go into details on his injuries. His team owner Chip Ganassi revealed first that Franchitti had injured his ankle and back. 'He's talking,' said Ganassi, who rushed . to the crash scene on a scooter. 'His ankle is a little sore, his back . is a little sore. He is going to be OK.'

Venezuela but both the drivers were able to leave their cars and walk . away. Debris from the crash also flew over the top of the safety fencing, injury some spectators. Race officials did not immediately provide details of those injuries. The race was won by Australia's Will Power. The incident caused victory celebrations for Power to be muted as he hoped that Franchitti was alright. 'It just looked bad, I hate seeing that,' Power said. 'I just hope he's OK…But it was a very good day on the track. Emergency: Safety team members work to remove the Scot from his car after a crash . Airlifted to hospital: Dario was stretched off the track and loaded into an ambulance before being airlifted to hospital, where he underwent surgery on his ankle .

'We were able to help Helio out a bit in the championship, and I just hope Dario is alright.' 'Everybody hopes Dario is OK,' said New Zealand driver Scott Dixon. Sato said that his car clipped the wall before triple-Indy 500 champion Franchitti's car collided with his. 'On the last lap I caught the marbles and brushed the wall and lost . momentum,' Sato said to the LA Times. 'A couple cars passed me as I was off line and in . Turn 5. I got very loose and Dario and I came together. Hopefully Dario . is OK.' In January, it was announced that Franchitti was splitting from actress Ashley Judd, his wife of 13-years.

They told People.com at the time: 'We have mutually decided to end our marriage. 'We'll always be family and continue to cherish our relationship based on the special love, integrity, and respect we have always enjoyed.' A spokesman for the actress subsequently confirmed the news to MailOnline when asked for comment, stressing their decision to split was a mutual one, not one-sided.

Diesel pollution makes it harder for honeybees to find flowers by changing the chemical make-up of their scent, scientists have found . Diesel pollution makes it harder for honeybees to find flowers by changing the chemical make-up of their scent, scientists have found. Honeybees use floral odours to find flowers that will give the best yields of pollen and nectar but diesel fumes can affect their ability to locate and recognise the plants, potentially affecting pollination and ultimately global food security. British researchers took eight chemicals found in the odour of oilseed rape flowers and mixed them both with clean air, which had no impact on the scent, and air containing diesel fumes. When mixed with diesel fumes, six of the eight chemicals reduced in volume and two disappeared completely within a minute, changing the chemical mix of the scent as it reacted with nitrogen oxides (NOx) found in the exhaust fumes. The researchers, from the University of Southampton then trained honeybees to recognise a synthetic oilseed rape perfume, by giving the bees a sugar solution when they were exposed to the scent so that they learned to stick out their proboscis when they smelled it. When they were exposed to a synthetic floral odour which had the chemicals affected by nitrogen oxides removed, the proportion of honeybees able to recognise the scent was significantly reduced, the study published in the journal Scientific Reports found. The researchers said the number of bees recognising the odour fell from 100 per cent to 30 per cent when both the chemicals affected by nitrogen oxides were taken out of the scent. Dr Tracey Newman, a neuroscientist at the university, said: 'Diesel exposure alters floral odours and it's a significant enough change in the chemistry to impact on the honeybee's ability to recognise that odour. Honeybees use floral odours to find flowers that will give the best yields of pollen and nectar but diesel fumes (pictured) can affect their ability to locate and recognise the plants, potentially affecting pollination and ultimately global food security . The honeybee (Apis mellifera) is a social bee that forms large colonies. A strong honeybee colony may contain about 60,000 bees. Several factors have been identified as probable contributory causes of honeybee decline: . The Varroa mite sucks bee blood from the bodies of honeybee larvae, pupae and adult bees in hives around Britain. Infested colonies can die within two or three years. Honeybees and their larvae are affected by many diseases caused by bacteria, fungi and viruses. Research has shown a link between certain bee viruses and colony decline. As honeybees need more care and management to watch levels of Varroa mites, neglect by beekeepers can kill colonies. Pesticides are blamed for bee losses and insecticides are sprayed directly onto the creatures. Particular concern has been raised about some neonicotinoid insecticides, which are used by farmers and gardeners to control a wide range of pests. 'It's not just about a bee getting confused because there's a new smell around, it's that the odour itself is being chemically altered.' The scientists focused on diesel because they were also interested in the impact on bee foraging of particulates (PMs), which are known to harm human health and are found in much higher levels in diesel. But as nitrogen oxides - nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide - are also found in petrol fumes the pollution from much of road transport could be having an effect, they said. Harming the forager bees' ability to . find the flowers from which they get pollen and nectar is likely to . damage the success of the colony or hive, affecting the number of . colonies and the pollination of crops that are important to humans. Professor . Guy Poppy, ecologist at the University of Southampton, said: 'Honeybee . pollination can significantly increase the yield of crops and they are . vital to the world's economy - £430 million a year to the UK alone. The researchers said the number of bees recognising the odour fell from 100 per cent to 30 per cent when both the chemicals affected by nitrogen oxides were taken out of the scent. Dr Tracey Newman, of the university, said: 'Diesel exposure alters floral odours and it's a significant enough change in the chemistry to impact on the honeybee's ability to recognise that odour' 'However to forage effectively they need to be able to learn and recognise the plants. 'The results indicated that NOx gases, particularly nitrogen dioxide, may be capable of disrupting the odour recognition process that honeybees rely on for locating floral food resources.' The scientists said air pollution could be one of a number of stresses that could be harming honeybees which, like many pollinating insects, are struggling. Dr Newman said: 'Diesel exposure is not the root of the problem in honeybees. However if you think of a situation where they're dealing with vial infections, mite infections, another thing that then makes it harder in its environment adds to the list of stresses. 'It is likely to have detrimental consequences for the animals' health.' Dr Giles Budge of the Food and Environment Research Agency, said the researchers have pinpointed 'a fresh issue to add to the many problems facing our insect pollinators, the potential for the fumes from a generator to degrade flower scent. 'This work highlights a possible problem in a laboratory setting and the challenge will be to see whether this problem exists in the wider environment.' Friends of the Earth Nature Campaigner Paul de Zylva, said: 'Bees are highly sophisticated creatures facing many threats including air pollution and this research is yet more evidence that they are under attack from all sides.' The group has called on the government to put together a 'bee action plan' to combat the threats the creatures face.","Scientists from the University of Southampton said honeybees use floral odours to find flowers that will give the best yields of pollen and nectar .

As Sony and Microsoft gear up to do battle next month when they both begin selling their new consoles to gamers, early polls suggest the PlayStation may be the must-have gadget. Research carried out by Reuters and Ipsos found 26 per cent of shoppers said they are likely to buy Sony's new console when it goes on sale, compared to 15 per cent who said they'd prefer the Xbox One. The rest of the participants said they have no plans to buy a console before the end of the year. Research carried out by Reuters and Ipsos found 26 per cent of shoppers said they are more likely to buy Sony's new console, the PS4 pictured top, when it goes on sale in November, compared to 15 per cent who said they'd prefer the Xbox One, pictured bottom . Around a quarter of the Reuters/Ipsos poll participants who owned gaming devices said they were likely to buy Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto . V when the new consoles come out. While 22 per cent said they would pick up a copy of Activision . Blizzard's Call of Duty: Ghosts game. Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag came in third . place in the poll at 19 per cent. Electronic Arts' Madden NFL 25 and Battlefield 4 were the participants' fourth and fifth choices. A total of 1,297 were surveyed online about their interest in 'dedicated game devices' over the period of 23 to the 27 September. Almost a third (31 per cent) of this group were aged 40 or under and of this section, 41 per cent said they planned to buy the PS4, whereas the Xbox One got 27 per cent of the votes. Reuters highlights the fact the poll uses a limited sample, yet said: 'The results potentially point to a lopsided battle during the crucial holiday season, with Microsoft and Sony hoping to get their newest consoles into U.S. households. Apart from games, they act as conduits for living-room entertainment, from TV shows to music.' Commenting on why they are making their decisions, 26-year-old gamer Christopher Turner from Alabama said: Microsoft couldn't make up their mind and Sony hadn't wavered from the . beginning. 'The PlayStation 4 is . for both hardcore and casual gamers.' Turner is referring to Microsoft's initial decision to set restrictions on second-hand games and policies about the consoles internet connection.

A mother has said she is pulling her teenage son out of the Al-Madinah Muslim free school on the day the Government said it must take 'swift action' to address concerns over the way it is run or face the prospect of closure. Jacqueline Crossley, 53, has said her son, who she does not want to be identified, was forced to cover his head and banned from looking at female students and is the only non-religious pupil at the school in Derby. She has now decided to withdraw the 14-year-old from the school after claiming he was forced to join lessons with five-year-olds when he opted out of lessons studying the Qu'ran. A mother has withdrawn her 14-year-old son from the Al-Madinah Muslim free school (pictured) after claiming he was banned from looking at female students . And according to a letter sent to the school by Lord Nash, Al-Madinah has failed to keep pupils safe, provide a good education and has discriminated against female staff. The Schools Minister said that the school had 'manifestly breached' its conditions, and can expect to be closed down if it does not make immediate changes. Ms Crossley said she was told she couldn't sit near her son at an awards night because women and men would be separated by a partition. She said: 'I sent my son to the school because he had been badly bullied at his last school and I felt that a faith school would be a safe place to send him. 'But it felt as though the bullying was coming from the school, rather than other teenagers. He was discriminated against because he had no religion. The school was temporarily closed last week due to a 'health and safety issue' following an Ofsted inspection . 'At an awards night, I wanted to sit with my son and enjoy the evening. 'But . he said: ""No, mum, you can't the woman aren't allowed to sit with the . men"" - and there was a big partition in the hall so I couldn't see him. I . was stunned.'

A Muslim member of staff from Al-Madinah School. Other members of staff are claiming they have been asked to wear headscarves . She also claimed her son had been told off for looking at female students. She said: 'The girls sat at the back of the classrooms, and the boys at the front. My boy was told under no circumstances should he look behind at the girls.' Lord Nash's letter orders the school to provide evidence within the next week that it has stopped any practices that lead to women and girls being treated 'less favourably' than men and boys, and to notify all of its staff that they are not required to cover their hair if it is against their religion or beliefs. It says: 'The Trust has manifestly breached the conditions of its funding agreement by failing to ensure the safety of children at the school; delivering an unacceptably poor standard of education; discriminating in its policies and procedures towards female staff; and failing to discharge its duties and responsibilities in respect of the governing body. 'I will not tolerate breaches of the commitments you gave when entering into the funding agreement.' The letter, addressed to Shazia Parveen, chairwoman of governors at Al-Madinah Free School also sets out other action that the school must take in the next few weeks, including satisfying the Government that its curriculum is 'broad and balanced' and that it is welcoming to children of all faiths and none. Lord Nash warns: 'Unless swift action is taken to address these concerns in a comprehensive way I will be compelled to terminate the school's funding agreement.' This effectively means that the school will face closure if it fails to deal with the Government's concerns. Lord Nash's letter orders the school to provide evidence within the next week that it has stopped any practices that lead to women and girls being treated 'less favourably' than men and boys . Al-Madinah, which is one of the Government's flagship free schools, opened in September last year. On its website, it describes 'a strong Muslim ethos' with shorter holidays and longer school days 'to maximise opportunities for pupil achievement and success'. It adds: 'At the centre of our school is a community of pupils, able to enjoy learning in a caring Islamic environment which promotes a culture of high expectations and outstanding performance.' Recently, there have been reports in the media that female teachers at the school were forced to wear hijabs even if they were not Muslim. Other reports claimed that female pupils were made to sit at the back of the classroom and males at the front. Interim principal Stuart Wilson told the BBC last week that he had not received any complaints from colleagues over the school's dress code and denied that pupils had been split up. While Ofsted's findings have not been finalised and none has been published, reports suggest the watchdog will judge it 'inadequate', the lowest rating. Lord Nash's letter comes on the same day that Ofsted confirmed that its report into Al-Madinah Free School, which was forced to close last week just hours after inspectors arrived, is due to be published in the next few days. The school's inspectorate also confirmed that the principal of the school took the decision to shut due to inspectors' concerns that records showing whether staff were cleared to supervise children were missing or incomplete. The school re-opened to pupils yesterday. In a statement, Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said the school re-opened after inspectors made a return visit to ensure that the right checks - such as criminal records checks - were in place. 'Ofsted began an inspection of Al-Madinah School on Tuesday October 1,' Sir Michael said. 'Unless swift action is taken to address . these concerns in a comprehensive way I will be compelled to terminate . the school's funding agreement' - Lord Nash . 'On the same day, the principal took the decision to close the school as a result of inspection concerns over safeguarding checks. Inspectors discovered that staff records showing whether they were cleared to supervise children were either missing or incomplete. 'The school remained closed until yesterday when inspectors made a return visit to satisfy themselves that the necessary safeguarding arrangements were in place and that there were sufficient numbers of adults with the necessary clearance for the school to function safely. 'In particular, inspectors needed to see evidence that CRB/DBS checks had been properly completed for employees and were held on an accurate, single central register. 'Inspectors are now engaged in finalising the inspection report for Al-Madinah School, which we expect to be able to publish in the next few days.' Mr Wilson said at the time the school was closed that the decision had been taken on health and safety grounds, later insisting the action was to address a 'short-term health and safety issue that has now been completely resolved and will not reoccur'.","Jacqueline Crossley has pulled her son out of Al-Madinah free school .

Cube shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes have been unveiled by scientists. The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and can stick together using magnets. While the curious machines might seem like colourful versions of the 'liquid steel' androids in the terminator films, their creators think they could one day be used to make temporary repairs to bridges and buildings. Scroll down for video . Cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes have been unveiled by scientists. The small robots, known as M-Blocks have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and can stick together using magnets . In the finale of Terminator 2, Sarah Connor attempts to kill the T-1000 with a shotgun, but he simply rebuilds himself on the spot. T-1000 is made of 'liquid metal' that is capable of rapid shapeshifting, near-perfect mimicry and rapid recovery from damage. MIT's robots are not quite the same, but can shape shift . Researchers at at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) said their modular robots can adapt to different tasks and terrains. The M-Blocks are cubes with no external moving parts, but are able to climb over and around aone another, leap through the air, roll across the ground, and even move while suspended upside down from metallic surfaces. Inside each M-Block is a flywheel that can reach speeds of 20,000 revolutions per minute and when the flywheel is braked, it imparts its angular momentum to the cube, which lets it move independently as well as in part of a group. On each edge of an M-Block and on every face, are cleverly arranged permanent magnets that allow any two cubes to attach to each other. On each face of a cube are four more pairs of smaller magnets, arranged symmetrically, which help snap a moving cube into place when it lands on top of another . On each edge of an M-Block and on every face, are cleverly arranged permanent magnets that allow any two cubes to attach to each other. Each edge has two cylindrical magnets that are mounted like rolling pins so that when two cubes approach each other, the magnets naturally rotate so that north poles align with south (and vice versa) allowing any cube to attach to any other. On each face of a cube are four more pairs of smaller magnets that are arranged symmetrically, which help snap a moving cube into place when it lands on top of another. The scientists said that they hope the modules can be miniaturised to one day allow hoards of swarming microrobots to self-assemble like the liquid steel androids in Terminator II. They believe that 'armies' of mobile cubes could temporarily repair bridges or buildings during emergencies, or raise and reconfigure scaffolding for building projects. The M-Blocks are cubes with no external moving parts, but are able to climb over and around one another, leap through the air, roll across the ground, and even move while suspended upside down from metallic surfaces . In the Terminator 2 storyline, the T-1000 is made of 'liquid metal'. Arnold Schwarzenegger's character explains that the T-1000 is a more advanced Terminator, composed entirely of a mimetic metal alloy, rendering it capable of rapid shapeshifting, near-perfect mimicry and rapid recovery from damage. It can use its ability to quickly liquify and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing its arms into solid metal tools or bladed weapons, walking through prison bars, and flattening itself on the ground to hide or ambush targets. The T-1000 also had the ability to extrude small, simple items from itself. The T-1000 can also change its color and texture to simulate flesh, clothing, and other nonmetallic materials. The cubes could one day assemble into different types of furniture or heavy equipment as needed as well as swarming into environments hostile or inaccessible to humans, diagnosing problems and reorganising themselves to provide solutions, according to the team. John Romanishin, one of the research scientists, said: 'We want hundreds of cubes, scattered . randomly across the floor, to be able to identify each other, coalesce, . and autonomously transform into a chair, or a ladder, or a desk, on . demand.' The team is is currently building an army of 100 cubes, each of which can move in any direction and designing algorithms to guide them. They also imagine that some of the . cubes could be adapted to perform specific tasks and carry equipment . such as cameras, lights or battery packs. Postdoctoral . student Kyle Gilpin said: 'In the vast majority of other modular . systems, an individual module cannot move on its own. If you drop one of . these along the way, or something goes wrong, it can rejoin the group, . no problem.' Hod Lipson, a . robotics researcher at Cornell University, who was initially skeptical . that the robots really worked, said that the robots demonstrate a 'kind . of cooperative group behaviour,' as multiple cubes work together and . move other cubes.

Apple's patent not only covers the design of the cylinder, but more also the type of glass and construction methods used to erect such a structure, according to Apple Insider. The Shanghai cylinder is made almost entirely out of huge monolithic glass slabs, with only connecting joints made out of metal. ‘The Chinese build is more complex, however, as the specifications required the glass pieces be curved to form arcs. These panels were then joined to create a circle and ultimately a cylinder,’ said the report. The whole look of the store, conceived by Steve Jobs, is now covered by a number of U.S patents. The store on Shanghai's Hong Kong Plaza opened three years ago, on the same day a second Chinese store opened in Beijing. Apple already has a 2007 granted patent covering the Store's famous in-store glass straight staircase for which CEO Steve Jobs is listed as one of the inventors.

People with depression were 3.24 times more likely to develop the disease than those without the mental health problem, said the researchers writing online in the journal Neurology. However, scientists do not know whether depression is an early symptom of the neurodegenerative disease or a cause. Depression has proven links to range of illnesses including cancer and stroke.

Newly discovered fossils hint that flowers could have bloomed at a time when the first dinosaurs walked the Earth, Swiss scientists have said. The discovery dates seed-producing and flowering plants - known as angiosperms - to around 100 million years earlier than palaeontologists previously thought. Angiosperms became the dominant plants some 90 million years ago, when dinosaurs were still very much alive, but scientists were not sure exactly when the plants originated. Scientists have unearthed 245-million-year-old pollen grains (examples shown here), with tiny features typically that are seen in flowering plants, from samples taken in Switzerland . Today's flowering plants evolved from relative of seed-producing plants that did not flower, including conifers and cycads. Peter Hochuli, a paleobotanist at the University of Zürich's Paleontological Institute and Museum, told LiveScience that flowering plants were the final group of plants to evolve in Earth's history. 'They are an extremely successful group on which all terrestrial ecosystems today depend, including the existence of humanity,' he said. Scientists have discovered ancient pollen grains with features that are usually seen in flowering plants. The 245-million-year-old fossils were found in two samples taken from northern Switzerland and are approximately the same age as the earliest known dinosaur in the Middle Triassic period. Newly discovered fossils hint that flowers could have bloomed at a time when the first dinosaurs, such as Nyasasaurus parringtoni (illustrated) walked the Earth, Swiss scientists said . Pollen grains are robust and plentiful, which makes then easier to spot in fossil records than fragile leaves and flowers. An unrelated fossil of buttercups (left) and early aquatic angiosperm (right) is pictured . Dr Hochuli said: 'Our findings suggest that the origin of flowering plants is rooted much deeper than originally thought.' Pollen grains are robust and plentiful, which makes then easier to spot in the fossil record than fragile leaves and flowers, he said. The researchers analysed the structure of these grains to publish their study in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science and believe they were pollinated by beetles, as bees did not evolve until around 100 million years later. The fossils yielded six different kinds of pollen, hinting that ancient flowers were diverse, while scientists said they have seen similar grains in Switzerland and the Barents Sea, located north of Scandinavia. In the Middle Triassic, both the regions were located in the subtropics but modern Switzerland was much drier than its more northern counterpart, suggesting the plants adapted to different environments. While the fossil record of angiosperms dates back 140 million years, even Charles Darwin was unsure when they first originated - calling it an 'abominable mystery'. Now, the plot thickens as the fossils demonstrate that the flowering plants were in existence 100 million years sooner than imagined, although the longer period of time might explain how they came to diversity and spread in the age of the dinosaurs. However, the fossils do not shed any more light on the ancestors of angiosperms, which have baffled scientists who are unsure how they came to exist. Dr Hochuli said no direct ancestors of angiosperms have been identified. 'Some groups of plants are suspected to be . closely related. But the evidence is weak and most of these groups are . thought to be too specialised to be at the base of the flowering plants,' he said.","Flowering plants became dominant 90 million years ago but until now scientists were unsure when plants, known as angiosperms, originated .

The book is beige in colour and measures 3 inches (10cm) wide and 4 inches (11cm) tall. The oldest-known Torah scrolls recently dated by Italian scholars originated between the 12th and 13th centuries, which is 300 and 400 years after the latest Jewish prayer book. Research on the prayer book - which the Green Collection claims could the Jewish equivalent of a complete, early edition of the Christian Book of Common Prayer - will be released by early 2015.

HTC has reported its first ever loss of $100m (£62m) in the three months to September . HTC's troubles have pushed its shares down some 55 per cent for the year to date and sparked calls for the company to consider a radical overhaul. Its share of the global smartphone market has plummeted from a peak of 10.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2011 to 2.6 per cent in the most recent quarter, according to research firm Gartner. Dennis Chan, an analyst at Yuanta Securities in Taipei, said HTC has been hurt by its insistence on using more expensive components, particularly chips, for low-end markets like China, cutting profit-margins down to razor-thin levels. The company works with California-based chip vendor Qualcomm Inc for most of its models.

The identity of a huge stone object known as the 'Bosham Head' that has remained a mystery since it was discovered in a Chichester flowerbed over 200 years ago has been solved by scientists. Using the latest scanning technology to examine the object, a team of British researchers believe the stone, which dates from around 122 AD, is part of a statue of Roman Emperor Trajan. Before the hi-tech study, little was known about the eroded stone, which is twice as large as a human head, including who it was meant to depict. The identity of a huge stone object known as the 'Bosham Head' (pictured) that has remained a mystery since it was discovered in a Chichester flowerbed over 200 years ago is part of a statue of the Roman Emperor Trajan, scientists said. They used scanning technology to examine the object which dates from around 122 AD . Trajan was was Roman Emperor from 98 AD until his death . He is remembered as a successful soldier-emperor who presided over the greatest military expansion in Roman history, leading the empire to attain its maximum territorial extent by the time of his death . He is also known for his philanthropic rule, overseeing extensive public building programmes and implementing social welfare policies, which earned him his enduring reputation as the second of the Five Good Emperors who presided over an era of peace and prosperity in the Mediterranean world . Trajan's public building programme which reshaped the city of Rome, left enduring landmarks such as Trajan's Forum, Trajan's Market and Trajan's Column . Archaeologists at Bournemouth University used 3D laser scans to pick out facial . features and a distinctive hairstyle, which led them to conclude that . the statue was of Emperor Trajan. Miles Russell, a senior lecturer in prehistoric and Roman archaeology at the university and Harry Manley, from the school of applied sciences, led the study, which has been assisted by The Novium museum. It concluded the statue, made of Italian marble was set up by Trajan’s successor, Hadrian, . on a visit to Britain in AD 121-122 and would have greeted visitors as . they entered Chichester Harbour. Before the hi-tech study, little was . known about the eroded 170kg stone (left), which is twice as large as a human . head, including who it was meant to depict. However,  now archaeologists believe it is the head of a statue of Emperor Trajan. A more complete and less weather-beaten bust is pictured right . 'The statue is one of the most important finds from Roman Britain and would certainly have been the most impressive,' said Dr Russell. It is the largest Roman statue to have been discovered in Britain so far. 'The problem is because the face has been so battered by weathering – possibly because it was in the sea at one point – people have felt for the last 200 years that there’s not enough left of the face to be that precise on its identification. 'It is a shame that it has been ignored and overlooked for so long, but now that laser scanning has helped resolve its identity, hopefully it will now take pride of place.'

The statue is on show at the Collection Discovery Centre at Fishbourne - the site of a Roman palace - but a similar statue of Emperor Trajan was erected by Hadrian at Ostia Harbour, in Rome. 'The fact that it was on the harbour and mirrors what’s happening in Ostia suggests that this would have been a real monumental greeting not just to Sussex but to do the whole of Southern England,' Dr Russell said. 'There would have been this immense statue of the Emperor facing you as you came in to the harbour, so it’s a real ""Welcome to Britain"" statue but reminding you that Britain is part of the Roman Empire.' A similar statue of Emperor Trajan to the one found in Chichester was erected by Hadrian at Ostia Harbour, in Rome.

The table was constructed by Outsmarting Technologies and though it may appear as if it was outsourced away from students, the company is run by alums from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology so it was kept in the family.

Judges dismissed an appeal by Home Secretary Theresa May after ruling deportation would be a breach of the Nigerian man's right to family life . A Nigerian illegal immigrant thought to have married a British woman after being charged with a crime has won a court battle with the Home Office after judges ruled deportation would be a human rights breach. Home Office officials had ordered the man’s deportation three years ago - about 18 months after he married and 11 months after he was convicted of handling stolen goods and given an 18-month jail term. But the Court of Appeal today ruled that the man should stay. Three appeal judges refused to overturn a decision by an immigration tribunal, which had concluded that deportation would not be in the best interests of his teenage step-daughter. The tribunal had been told the girl did not have any involvement with her birth father and regarded the man as her 'de facto father'. It concluded that having a 'de facto father' was in the youngster’s best interests and said deporting the man would be a breach of a right to family life enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Appeal judges - who included Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, and the second most senior judge in England and Wales - said they could find 'no basis' for interfering with the tribunal’s decision. They dismissed an appeal by Home Secretary Theresa May following a hearing in London. Appeal judges were told the man had entered the UK illegally in 1998, claimed asylum in 2006, married in March 2009 and been convicted of handling stolen goods in November 2009. Home Office officials had refused his asylum claim and made a deportation order in October 2010. The man had initially challenged the deportation ruling before a first-tier immigration tribunal, and lost. He had then asked an upper immigration tribunal to review his case, and won. Mrs May had then challenged the upper tribunal decision in the Court of Appeal. Three Court of Appeal judges refused to overturn a decision by an immigration tribunal, which concluded deportation would not be in the best interests of the Nigerian man's teenage step-daughter . In a written judgement, Lord Dyson said the man had married 'at a time when it was known by all concerned that his immigration status was precarious and probably at a time when he had already been charged'. He said the Home Office officials had conceded that it would not be reasonable to expect the man’s wife and step-daughter - who met the man when she was about 13 -  to live in Nigeria. And the upper tribunal had felt that it was in the child’s 'best interests' to have a 'de facto father as she grows up' - and after weighing evidence had been satisfied that deportation would not be proportionate. 'They conducted a meticulous assessment of the factors weighing in favour of deportation and those weighing against,' said Lord Dyson. 'As they said, the factors in favour of deportation were substantial. They properly gave significant weight to the serious view taken by the Secretary of State of (his) criminality and his poor immigration history. 'On the other hand, they attached considerable importance to the interests of (the girl). The decision was finely balanced.' He added: 'But they did not take into account any irrelevant factors and they did not fail to take into account any relevant factors. In these circumstances, the upper tribunal were entitled to strike the balance in favour of (the man). We can find no basis for interfering with their decision.' Lord Dyson, who sat with Lord Justice Davis and Lady Justice Gloster, did not name the man.","Appeal judges refuse to overturn decision by immigration tribunal .

Middle class families today resemble the poorest Americans from the 1970s, former President Jimmy Carter has claimed. Carter, 89, said Monday that growing economic inequality in the United States has left middle class families financially unstable and eroded their economic security. 'Even in one of the wealthiest parts of the world there is a . great deal of foreclosures and now a great deal of people who are . fortunate to own their own houses owe more on them than the houses are . worth in the present market, and that's all changed in the last eight . years,' Carter said during an exclusive interview with The Associated . Press. Scroll down for video . Interview: Jimmy Carter says the middle class have spiraled into economic insecurity in the last eight years - on par with the poor when he was president . 'The disparity between rich people and . poor people in America has increased dramatically since when we . started. The middle class has become more like poor people . than they were 30 years ago. So I don't think it's getting any better.' Carter offered his assessment of the nation's economic challenges Monday at a Habitat for Humanity construction site in Oakland, California - the first of five cities he and wife Rosalynn plan to visit this week to commemorate their three-decade alliance with the international nonprofit that promotes and builds affordable housing. The recent economic downturn revealed that families living in even comparatively well-off, but expensive regions like the San Francisco Bay Area are economically insecure, he said. Taking a break from framing windows at a new 12-unit town house development in a section of East Oakland where Habitat already has built or repaired 115 homes, the 89-year-old former Democratic president said the federal government is investing less in affordable housing at a time of greater need. Carter said the poor were as well off when he was president as the middle class are now . Carter blamed years of tax breaks for the wealthy, a minimum wage untethered from the inflation rate and electoral districts drawn to maximize political polarization. He said those factors have reduced the quality of life for all but a small fraction of Americans and imperiled the nation's standing as 'a real superpower,' he said. 'Equity of taxation and treating the middle class with a great deal of attention, providing funding for people in true need, like for affordable housing, those are the sort of things that would pay rich dividends for Americans no matter what kind of income they have,' said Carter, looking relaxed in a baseball cap, blue jeans and white sneakers. 'The richest people in America would be better off if everybody lived in a decent home and had a chance to pay for it, and if everyone had enough income even if they had a daily job to be good buyers for the products that are produced.' Habitat for Humanity was founded in Georgia, the home state of the Carters. They first joined a Habitat for Humanity work site in 1984 in New York and have spent a week every year working on construction sites in the U.S. and abroad. On Tuesday, the former president and first lady are scheduled to help renovate homes in a section of Silicon Valley that has remained immune to the wealth generated by the high-tech industry. After that, they intend to travel to Denver, Colorado, New York and Union Beach, New Jersey, where they will help rebuild homes wiped out by Hurricane Sandy.

The owner of a San Diego restaurant says he’s abolished tipping waiters for the last six years and service has only gotten better. Concerned about income disparity between servers and kitchen staff, Jay Porter and his employees opted to tack on an extra 18 percent to each customer’s bill and distribute the money evenly among everyone who worked at his farm-to-table restaurant, The Linkery. Instead of creating an unhappy, unmotivated waitstaff, something miraculous happened: service actually started to improve. Gratuity included: Not a single tip was left at The Linkery in San Diego for six years . Porter wrote about the experience of running The Linkery, which specialized in farm-to-table cuisine with the tag line ‘Our friends grow food for you and we cook it,’ in a recent Slate article. ‘Within a couple of months,’ writes Porter, ‘our server team was making more money than it had under the tipped system. The quality of our service also improved.’ Over time, the servers evidently earned more overall with more consistent pay. And better service, logic would say, meant more customers with more of those built-in 18 percent gratuities. But it wasn’t just the service that benefited from the change, which the restaurant made a few years after The Linkery opened. The food also improved. Happy family: Owner Jay Porter says that taking away tips made for happier workers, customers, and more money for all . ‘Our food improved,’ writes Porter. ‘Probably because our cooks were being paid more and didn't feel taken for granted. In turn, business improved.’ Porter insists it’s not just about the money. ‘In my observation, however, that wasn't mainly because the servers were making more money (although that helped, too). Instead, our service improved principally because eliminating tips makes it easier to provide good service.’ Porter says in the years his restaurant, which recently closed, enforced the rule his business and service got progressively better. Less cutthroat? By giving servers to the same incentives as workers in other industries, Porter says his they strove toward professionalism and raises . ‘Servers want to keep their jobs,’ he reasons. ‘Servers want to get a raise; servers want to be successful and see themselves as professionals and take pride in their work.’ Most workers, Porter writes, must only negotiate salary occasionally, but servers must take on the often belittling task many times per day. Also unlike most workers, servers must negotiate with the customers who benefit from their work instead of with the employers who understand the difficulty of what they do. Porter and his employees simply made the stakes the same for everyone else. ‘These two principles probably apply at your work, too, if you work somewhere other than a restaurant and with your clothes on,’ he writes. Everyones happy: Porter says he made the new rule as a way to equalize pay between servers and kitchen staff . Though his employees and most of his customers were more than satisfied with the arrangement, Porter says he came up against critics. In fact, one detractor was literally a critic, for the local alt weekly of San Diego’s restaurant scene. Even the city’s attorney threatened to shut The Linkery down over the issue, which he called deceptive. In spite of them and the fact that his great experiment has come to an end, Porter maintains that tipless restaurants are the wave of the future. ‘It's a system that's successful in other industries, and in restaurants in other countries. It can work here, too—and it can work better, in almost every way, than the system we have now.’","No tips were left at The Linkery in San Diego for six years .

Thousands of women who have gone through the agony of early menopause could be offered new hope by a pioneering fertility treatment. The technique, which reawakens ‘sleeping eggs’, has allowed a woman who went through the menopause at the age of 25 to give birth to a healthy baby boy. The U.S. and Japanese researchers believe many more women could benefit – including those in their early 40s whose supply of eggs is dwindling fast. Thousands of women who have gone through early menopause could be offered new hope by a pioneering fertility treatment which enabled one infertile lady to have a baby (pictured with researcher and obstetrician Kazuhiro Kawamura) Experts described the work as a ‘real breakthrough’ but cautioned that it has so far only been tried out on a small number of women. The researchers, from Stanford University in California and St Marianna University in Kawasaki, treated women with primary ovarian insufficiency, a form of early menopause. It affects about one per cent of women of reproductive age and their ovaries stop working properly before the age of 40. Although they can try to get pregnant using a donated egg or adopt, neither option will give them a child that is genetically their own. With studies showing that some of these women have small immature eggs ‘sleeping’ in their ovaries, the researchers looked for a way of awakening them and coaxing them into maturing. They discovered that eggs were kept in an immature state by two biological ‘brakes’. One of these stop signals could be . overridden by drug treatment.  The second, bizarrely, was lifted by . cutting the ovary into strips before putting some of it back. Some . 27 women were treated and, in five, eggs grew and matured to such an . extent they could be used in IVF, the journal Proceedings of the . National Academy of Sciences reports. Professor Aaron Hsueh (left) said he hopes the technique can also be used to help women left infertile by treatment for cancer . IVF failed in once case and is still under way in two others.  But one woman is pregnant and another had a healthy baby boy. His mother had gone through the menopause four years earlier, aged just 25. The baby’s name has not been revealed, although a photograph of him in the arms of researcher and obstetrician Kazuhiro Kawamura has been released. Dr Kawamura said: ‘I performed the Caesarean section myself. ‘I could not sleep the night before the operation but when I saw the healthy baby, my anxiety turned to delight. Dr Valerie Baker, who heads Stanford's IVF unit but was not involved in the study, said she was amazed by the success of the technique . ‘The couple and I hugged each other in tears.’ Co-researcher Professor Aaron Hsueh said he hopes the technique can also be used to help women left infertile by treatment for cancer. It may also be suitable for those in their early 40s who have yet to go through the menopause but are struggling to get pregnant. It is not expected to help women who have gone through the menopause at the normal time. Professor Hsueh said: ‘Eventually we hope that this will help many, many infertile patients.’ Dr Valerie Baker, who heads Stanford’s IVF unit but was not involved in the study, said she was amazed by the success of the technique. She added: ‘Many women are devastated by a diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency because much of our happiness and purpose in life comes from our family. ‘This procedure does appear to be a real breakthrough but we are cautious not to give false hope because the treatment has not been done on large numbers of women yet.’ As it stands, the technique involves removing an ovary woman, cutting it up, treating it with drugs and grafting a strip of it back into the patient. However, the researchers hope to refine the technique so that ovary removal is unnecessary. They stress that more work is needed to show that the technique is safe and that it will not work for all women. Professor Charles Kingsland, a consultant gynaecologist and spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also urged caution. He said that while early menopause is a very serious problem, the research is at an extremely early stage.","Woman who had menopause at 25 has had a baby thanks to the treatment .

Facebook paid no corporation tax in Britain last year despite raking in more than £200million from its UK operations, documents reveal. It means the internet giant has paid just £1million in corporation tax on the half a billion pounds of revenue it has made since arriving in Britain in 2007. Furious MPs last night accused the social media company of ‘deliberately manipulating’ its accounts – and demanded tougher action on tax avoidance by big multinationals. Revenues: Social networking site Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, claims to have made a loss last year despite generating an estimated £223million in revenues from Britain . Facebook makes money from selling adverts targeted at its users based on their personal preferences. In a practice that is legal but has been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs, the social networking company records most of its UK sales in Ireland. Like other US technology firms such as Google, it bills its UK arm simply as a service and marketing division. During 2012 the company’s UK division states it made a pre-tax loss of £2.4million on sales of £34.6million – which meant it incurred no tax bill. But according to some analysts the true sales figure from its UK operations would be closer to £223million, the majority of which will have been registered to its Irish division. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee which has investigated Google and Amazon over tax avoidance, said: ‘This is yet another example of what appears to be deliberate manipulation of accounts of economic activity to deprive the British taxpayer of a rightful tax contribution, according to the profits they make in the UK. I am getting fed up of this constant stream of stories and little sign of a challenge from HM Revenue & Customs and a strange silence from Government.’ Fed up: Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge accused the government and HM Revenue and Customs of a 'strange silence' about global firms not paying their way . This figure could be higher than £300million during 2013. France is pushing for Europe to adopt a new corporation tax regime which would see multinationals such as Google and Facebook taxed in the countries where customers use their websites. A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Facebook pays all taxes required by UK law and we comply with tax laws in all countries where we operate. 'We take our tax obligations seriously, and work closely with national tax authorities around the world to ensure compliance with local law.’ Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: ‘This company is avoiding tax, plain and simple.

Black market gangs are marauding across the countryside and cashing in on one of the best mushroom crops in years after 'perfect' growing conditions this summer. They are stripping fields of tons of mushrooms which are sold in cut-price deals to traders supplying top hotels and restaurants - leaving the cupboard bare for families who want a few fungi as a mealtime treat. The gangs - many thought to be Eastern Europeans - are making a fortune because top London restaurants will pay over £50 a kilo for mushrooms. Gangs are stripping forests of mushrooms before selling them for up to £50 a kilo to traders on the black market . The gang behaviour means that the cupboard is bare for families who want to pick their own mushrooms. In a year where there has been a bumper harvest . Professional picker Nick Weston, who runs a foraging school in Sussex to teach people what is safe fungi and what is potentially deadly, said ""Gangs are going into places like Epping and Ashdown forests. ""They employ a mycologist - a mushroom expert - and strip every fungus in sight. ""Everything not declared edible is then just chucked. It needs more governance."" The Forestry Commission allows people to pick up to 1.5kgs of fungi at a time. After one of the wettest winters and . coldest springs on record, the countryside is displaying one of the most . abundant wild harvests seen in years. But experts warn pickers to beware because many fungi are poisonous and could even kill if they are eaten. They say families should arm themselves . with guide books and leave well alone if they are not 100 per cent . confident that a fungus is edible.

Elusive UK-based street artist Banksy is in the middle of a month-long stay in New York City, but says some of the places he's planned to do his art for months have quickly become too swanky for his tastes. '[I] returned to find most of the empty lots I planned to use have got condos built on them already,' Banksy said in a rare interview with the Village Voice. He said he staked out the city months ago and was shocked at the speed of development. 'I chose it for the high foot traffic . and the amount of hiding places,' he said. 'Maybe I should be somewhere more . relevant, like Beijing or Moscow, but the pizza isn't as good.’ Scroll down for video . He speaks: Anonymous graffiti artist Banksy is in the middle of a month-long residency on the streets of New York City and recently gave a rare interview to the Village Voice . The famously private graffiti artist . chose the New York City paper for his interview because he ‘feels an affinity with people who . provide quality content for free on street corners,’ though like . everyone who’s tried to make contact with Banksy, the Voice discovered . he’s not entirely forthcoming about his work. Through . a UK publicist, Banksy discussed his work, his self-imposed anonymity, . and his plans to create a new work on the streets of the Big Apple for . every month in October. ‘I represent the artist Banksy,’ began an email to the Village Voice with the subject line ‘confidential.’ The alt weekly received the message in September from London art publicist Jo Brooks. Brooks would be the facilitator between the Voice and Banksy, who keeps his identity hidden in part because of the illegal nature of his work. Private: Unlike in his 2010 documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop (pictured), the Village Voice had no sit down interview with the artist. They conversed only through email . Tongue in cheek: Banksy is creating a work per day on the streets of New York. Pictured is his piece from October 8 . Most recently, that illegal work includes Better Out than In: An Artist Residency on the Streets of New York. The month long project began posting photographic evidence of Banksy’s work on the website BanksyNY.com starting October 1. ‘The . plan is to live here, react to things, see the sights—and paint on . them,’ Banksy told the Village Voice in an email. ‘Some of it will be . pretty elaborate, and some will just be a scrawl on a toilet wall.’ Starting October 1, Banksy has used his masterful stenciling technique to turn New York City buildings into his canvas. Naughty paperboys, a dog peeing on a fire hydrant, and a Band-Aid covered balloon now decorate Manhattan and Brooklyn, or did until they were quickly painted over. Popular: Banksy signature humor is right at home on the streets of New York and his graffiti has attracted a swarm of media attention . Rumors: Banksy addressed questions surrounding his pieces and quashed rumors that he, himself, destroys his work after the fact. Pictured is a piece from October 2 in Manhattan . Playful: Banksy says he must remain anonymous because of the illegal nature of his art. Here, Banksy's signature stenciling can be seen on a Manhattan wall from October 1 . There was also an attempt to turn the . impatient graffiti of other spray painters into Broadway gold simply by . stenciling ‘The Musical’ beneath screeds like ‘Playground mob’ and . ‘Dirty underwear.’ In . addition to his painted works, Banksy also created a mobile installation . of a garden, complete with rainbow and waterfall, in the back of a . delivery truck. Banksy told the Voice he visited New York ‘a couple of months ago’ to do reconnaissance for the October show, but declined to say how long he planned to stay as after attempting to do one piece of art every day in the city until October 31. ‘I started painting on the street because it was the only venue that would give me a show,’ he writes. ‘Now I have to keep painting on the street to prove to myself it wasn't a cynical plan. Plus it saves money on having to buy canvases.’ One of the questions posed to the graffiti artist who's also sold art to the likes of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt centered on profit: . 'Does the artist stand to make a profit from his New York residency?' 'There's no way round it—commercial success is a mark of failure for a graffiti artist,' he writes. 'We're not supposed to be embraced in that way. When you look at how society rewards so many of the wrong people, it's hard not to view financial reimbursement as a badge of self-serving mediocrity.'

Kidney operation: Veteran sports broadcaster Archie Macpherson has revealed that he suffered from kidney cancer probably brought on by passive smoking . Broadcaster Archie Macpherson revealed yesterday that has been battling kidney cancer. The veteran sports commentator described his shock upon learning the disease was linked to smoking – despite the fact he has never smoked a cigarette. Mr Macpherson, 78, was given the diagnosis six months ago after abnormalities were detected in a urine sample during a routine check-up. He underwent surgery a few weeks ago at Monklands Hospital in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, to remove a tumour, which also saw him lose one healthy kidney and part of his second kidney. He has now been given the all-clear. Doctors said years of passive smoke during his career as a journalist almost certainly caused the cancer. Glasgow-born Mr Macpherson said his cancer was of the ‘sleekit kind’, one that displayed no symptoms and never prevented him from enjoying hobbies including golf and cross-country running. He said: ‘When I was told this condition was closely linked to smoking and informed them I had never had a cigarette in my mouth in my entire life, the doctors were adamant I was almost certainly a victim of passive smoking. ‘I had to add things up. As I am fond of a dram or two, I had spent many pleasant hours in howffs around the world with people around me creating the conditions of Auld Reekie at its worst. ‘I could take you to a bar in Marseilles where, before the ban, I could sit happily for hours, as a non-smoker, naively savouring the almost exotic aroma of the wonderful Gauloises French cigarettes, as innocently as breathing in the fragrance of a pine forest.’ He added: ‘I also worked blissfully in editorial offices and press boxes in the past, which had the sulphuric stench of Hades about them.’ Doctors told Mr Macpherson the cancer could have been developing for up to five years and might have turned life-threatening had it not been caught by chance this year. Veteran broadcaster: Mr Macpherson believes that years of working in smokey studios and press boxes led to his illness . The broadcaster, who lives in Bothwell, Lanarkshire, with his wife Jess, paid tribute to the ‘unsung heroes’ in the NHS who saved his life. He said: ‘I’ve spent years writing about overpaid, pampered footballers. Now I have a chance to praise the real heroes of the medical profession, who have saved my life. ‘When I learn that kidney cancers are occurring among people in their forties, that Scotland is the only nation in the UK where lung cancer remains the most common cancer, I shudder at the thought of how these dedicated people I encountered in the past couple of months will cope with a tsunami of ailments hitting them in future, as our society  seems largely indifferent to the self-immolations of reckless lifestyles. ‘Yet hopefully my narrative will encourage some to see the value of grappling with any uncertainties about their health in the knowledge that even in a harassed medical  system, skills and care exist to turn an early diagnosis into an affirmation of life, not its reverse. ‘Even were it to mean you have to sacrifice an organ in the process, as in my case, what you are being offered is the privilege of bartering with mortality. In such circumstances there is no such a thing as a bad deal.’","Mr Macpherson was diagnosed six months ago during a routine check-up .

Grieving families of war veterans recently killed in action are hitting out at the U.S. government for not paying death benefits to which they are entitled. The shutdown has halted many government services, including military death benefits totaling $100,000, a one year housing allowance, up to $9,000 for a funeral and a flight to Dover Air Force Base, in Delaware, for a dignified reception of their loved ones’ remains. The outcry has led Congress to act quickly, a bill is expected to be passed Wednesday morning to remedy the problem, according to Speaker of the House John Boehner. Heroes: Special Agent Joseph M. Peters and 1st Lt. Jennifer M. Moreno were both killed this weekend by an improvised explosive device . ‘The government is hurting the wrong people,’ Shannon Collins, who lost her son, Marine Lance Corporal Jeremiah M. Collins Jr., over the weekend in Afghanistan told NBC News. ‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they’re going to bury their child,’ she added. ‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they're going to feed their family if they don’t go to work this week,’ Of the seventeen service members who have died since the shutdown began, not a single one of their families has received the payments sent within three days of their deaths. Sergeant Patrick Hawkins, 25, Private First Class Cody Patterson, 24, Lieutenant. Jennifer Moreno, 25, and Special Agent Joseph Peters, 24 all died from an explosive device this past weekend. Marine Lance Corporal Jeremiah Collins Jr, 19, also died, but his death is under investigation. ‘They killed my boy,’ Randall Patterson, the father of PFC Patterson, told NBC News. Fallen but not forgotten: Pfc. Cody J. Patterson (left) and Sgt. Patrick C. Hawkins were killed by the same IED . The devastated father said all he wanted on the flight from his home in Oregon to Dover was a scotch on the rocks. ‘It better be on that tray,’ he told the Army. ‘I don’t care if you have to pay for it out of your own pocket.’ The wife of Special Agent Peters is also upset. Explaining to NBC News that she’s a stay-at-home mother, Ashley Peters lamented that her late husband said his family would always be taken care of if the worst should happen. ‘It is upsetting because my husband died for his country, and now his family is left to worry,’ she told the news outlet. Politicians first took the opportunity to point out that the Pay Our Military Act signed into law last week authorized the Department of Defense to pay all expenses, including pay checks and death benefits, but the military disagreed. A Pentagon official told the New York Daily News that the law failed to allow ‘any payments to family members of service members, and therefore cannot be used to legally justify the payment of survivor benefits.’ ‘If the department was allowed to make death gratuity payments at any point during shutdown, they would’ve been paid, with great relief,’ the official added. This isn't right: Shannon Collins, mother Mr Collins, says that families deserve the benefit because of the sacrifice made by their loved ones . Sgt Hawkins was on his fourth deployment to Afghanistan, he died rushing to the aid of another dying soldier. ‘’ Sgt. Patrick Hawkins was a brave and incredibly talented Ranger,’ Lt. Col., Patrick J. Ellis, the commander of the 3rd battalion, told NBC News. ‘His actions that night were in keeping with the epitome of the Ranger Creed: ‘I will never leave a fallen comrade.’ First Lt. Moreno was a nurse assigned to the cultural support team, it was her first combat deployment. This will be fixed: Speak Boehner promised the problem would be fixed Wednesday morning . ‘Our unit mourns the loss of 1st Lt. Jennifer Moreno,’ Lt Col. Ellis told NBC News. Lance Cpl Collins was out of high school for just over a year when he died in what NBC News termed ‘murky circumstances.’ Denied what they rightfully deserve, the families of these heroes should soon receive their benefits, according to Speaker Boehner. ‘Tomorrow, the House is going to act specifically on this and I hope the president will sign it,’ he said during a Tuesday press conference.","Seventeen soldiers have died since the shutdown began .

The Picture That Started It: Little Serafina Murphy pictured only days after serious life-saving surgery to fix a hole in her heart at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago . An Illinois father has revealed how he managed to turn the tables on cynical Facebook spam pages engaging in a growing trend dubbed 'Social Content Farming' and managed to raise money for the hospital which saved his daughter's life. Appalled that a picture he posted online five months ago that shows his little girl, Serafina, recovering from heart surgery was being used to bolster the advertising revenue of a page called Starteens, University of Illinois law student Sean Murphy decided to act. Adding to comments under the picture of his 22-month-old daughter, Sean asked those reading to donate money to the hospital which saved her life and in the past week has managed to raise almost $5,000. In May, University of . Illinois law student Sean Murphy posted online the touching and powerful . image of his then 22-month-old daughter Serafina after surgery to repair a . congenital defect to her heart at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s . Hospital of Chicago in October of 2012. The picture of the pretty little girl on the hospital floor in Hello Kitty . slippers with a bandage covering her chest and tubes running out of her . arms made it to online forum Reddit's front page and from there it went . viral. Family: Sean and his wife Megan and daughter Serafina (left) and Matilda (right) While Murphy did . not necessarily mind the countless usages of the image that ignored his . copyright, on October 1st the image appeared on a Facebook page . entitled Starteens, inviting users to 'LIKE' the picture only if they . wished her 'a quick and healthy recovery'. Understandably the picture quickly garnered 4.3 million 'likes', was shared 61,000 times and received more than 67,000 comments. However, the majority of these comments were from Facebook users angry at the blatant misappropriation of Serafina's touching image, angry about the growing phenomenon of baiting social media for likes, retweets and shares. The phenomenon has been dubbed 'Social Content Farming' by The Daily Dot and is designed to build the online profile of any particular Facebook page through likes and most importantly, through the 'talking about this' stat. This in particular shows potential advertisers the popularity and engagement of online users and reflects how many people are actually interacting with the page at any time. The higher 'likes' and 'talking about this' get the better a page such as Starteens can become at using people to click on links featured on their pages which go direct to external sites and from these they can make advertising revenue. 'Social Content Farmer': Starteens was launched in July and so far has garnered hundreds of thousands of 'Likes' and millions of people 'talking about this' Indeed, since launching on July 11th, Starteens has garnered 194,467 'Likes' and 11.4 million people 'talking about this.' However, the tech and morally savvy users of the Internet are wise to these scams which use stolen jokes and images - in some cases depicting obviously abused children. 'This page is a ‘like whore’ machine,' Facebook user David Dutcher commented according to The Daily Dot. 'Likes on Fb do nothing for anyone's physical recovery. All you are doing is building your popularity from other people's misfortune whist [sic] pretending to have done something positive. It is disgusting.' The vitriol is sometimes extreme and 11 hours hours after Serafina's picture was used by Starteens, Sean discovered it. Inane: Here is one example at Starteens that invites a user of Facebook to opt for the obvious 'Like' Famous: This picture and story of Astro the horse and his owner braving the quicksands of a Geelong beach in Australia was shared around the world and has been now appropriated by Starteens for a their 'social content farming' However, instead of adding to the bile, he thought that he would try something different. 'If you are touched by this image and the strength of children, don't just ‘like’ or comment,' he wrote. 'Please help me to give back to the hospital that gave my daughter life by donating as little as $5.' Sean's comment caused a chain reaction which led 43,000 people to his donation page to raise money for the hospital. So far, Murphy has collected $3,256 toward his $5,000 goal. Most importantly, Serafine has recovered from her surgery and is now healthy. Change the Game: This is the Facebook post that Sean Murphy added last week that convinced Facebook users to change their tact and to donate money instead of leaving their anger behind at Starteens . Indeed, due to the huge attention she received originally when her father posted her picture online five months ago she was gifted Hello Kitty coloring books and Hello Kitty headbands. Executives at Sanrio, the creators of Hello Kitty, were even alerted about the picture first time around. The company sent Serafina a three-foot, 75-pound box containing Hello Kitty gifts and clothing for Serafina and her 5-year-old sister, Matilda, and books for their brother, Felix. 'So does it thrill me that Starteens and other Facebook pages are profiteering off pictures of sick children? Do I like that they often misrepresent Serafina’s story, claiming that she just had the surgery, or that each like = $1 for her (I wish!)? No,' Murphy added according to The Daily Dot. 'But in the end, I believe that she has become somewhat of a symbol for those whose lives are in some way affected by a congenital heart defect.'","Law student Sean Murphy was upset to see a picture of his sick daughter had been used by a 'social content farm' to gather all important 'Likes' on Facebook .

Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a ‘sugar daddy’ lover he met when he was just 17. The Strictly Come Dancing judge said the 43-year-old man paid for his dance lessons and helped kick-start his television career in return for ‘doing the dirty’. Revel Horwood, known for his acerbic comments on the BBC1 show, said the nature of the relationship meant he had previously been described by some as a ‘rent boy’. Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood has revealed how he owes his success to a 'sugar daddy' lover he met when he was just 17. Right, the dancer at 18 years old . The dancer made the revelations last night at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, where he also disclosed he is to undergo hip surgery in two weeks’ time. In a wide-ranging interview, he also discussed how celebrities found it uncomfortable to be ‘flung about by dancers’ on the popular show. Discussing his relationship with the older man, Revel Horwood, 48, said he was approached while he was living in his native Australia as a teenager. Describing him as ‘Mr X’ for legal reasons, Revel Horwood said: ‘It was this man who was 43 and I was 17. ‘He said I will pay for your classes but you come away with me and we do the dirty. ‘I suppose that could be compared to a lady getting engaged and getting a great big sparkling Tiffany ring – and then breaking off the engagement but keeping the ring.’ At the time, Revel Horwood had left school and was training as a chef, but said he ‘hated’ it, adding that Mr X ‘saved me from that’. Revel Horwood has become known for his acerbic comments on BBC1 show Strictly Come Dancing . However, Revel Horwood did not divulge any further details of the relationship and quickly moved on to other subjects. Talking about his imminent hip surgery, Revel Horwood said it would clash with filming for the current series. He said: ‘I’m going in at six o’clock in the morning on Sunday after filming Saturday night live. ‘I will be watching myself on the telly . on Sunday night [the results show screened on Sunday is filmed on . Saturday night] with my old hip and I’ll have a new one in.’ He added: . ‘I will be made of titanium and I can’t wait, darling.’ Asked whether he would be fit to return to the show the following week, he said he might have to face the cameras and the audience in a wheelchair, adding: ‘A fabulous glittery one I hope.’ He also revealed how celebrities found it difficult being ‘manhandled’. ‘Sometimes you throw a girl up and she will fart and come back down,’ he joked. In his latest book, Tales From the Dance Floor, Revel Horwood wrote about how fellow Strictly judge Darcey Bussell breaks wind on set. Last night he said he had not warned her before the book was published – and the first thing she said to him when she saw him after reading it was, ‘Fart?’ But he added she had taken it well and spent the entire night’s filming leaning to one side and pretending to break wind. ‘We were in stitches,’ he said.","Craig Revel Horwood says he owes his success to a 'sugar daddy' lover .

The EU president has sent a shot across the bow of Europe's official spending watchdog warning it to rein in its criticism of Brussels and focus on promoting the union. Herman Van Rompuy told Europe's Court of Auditors that he wants their findings to generate positive headlines with particular regard to Europe's £110 billion yearly spend. The watchdog has been a thorn in the side of Brussels, publishing a series of critical reports on wasteful spending and refusing to sign off the EU’s budget for 18 consecutive years because of concerns about fraud. 'Your reports are not released into a void but into the rough and tumble of political life and media reporting,' he said on Thursday night. 'Every year, they generate headlines that ‘yet again the EU’s accounts have not been signed off’, with deceptive allegations of fraud and mismanagement. You and I know that such headlines can be misleading. 'Given this media handling of information, and its impact on public opinion in some countries, the court might want to give some further thought as to how it can encourage more nuanced reporting. 'It’s important that citizens can have the whole picture, with all its nuances.' In June this year the watchdog was told it would have its funding slashed by 4.2 per cent. 'In the end we are all responsible for Europe and its image,' Van Rompuy went on. 'In times of crisis, it is more vital than ever to foster confidence. We should also be teaching, to convince Europeans and demonstrate clearly that Europe is not the source of problems, but the solution.' His comments today angered British MPs who accused him of glossing over the EU's accounts to mislead the public.

Striker Johnny Adair, 16, shattered his tibia in a horror tackle during a Sunday League match two weeks ago.

'Then he sent me these sarcastic messages on Facebook making fun of me and saying I should play netball or rounders instead. 'It’s shocking. A ref shouldn’t behave like that.

The paltry sum is the lowest of the seven tiers of payments to victims of the DJ and presenter proposed by the corporation. It is about the same amount as the BBC’s director general is paid in a single day. The £1,500 payment would be made to those who suffered a ‘minor assault’ at the hands of the paedophile, who preyed on youngsters in his dressing room and backstage. Paedophile DJ Jimmy Savile's BBC premises victims may be paid as little as £1,500 in compensation . The highest payment – only £40,000 – would go to those who were raped by Savile. One of his victims, who did not want to be named, described the BBC proposal as ‘pathetic’, adding: ‘Their top bosses get that kind of money in a few hours and they think it will compensate for a lifetime of psychological trauma? Put another couple of noughts on the end, people might be satisfied.’ Savile, who died in October 2011 aged 84, attacked hundreds of children he met at the BBC and at hospitals, charity events and schools. Police believe the Top of the Pops and Jim’ll Fix It presenter attacked at least 1,300 people over the course of 54 years. A year after his reign of terror was exposed the NSPCC children’s charity is still taking calls from people he targeted. Scotland Yard says Savile spent ‘every waking minute’ thinking about abusing children, and used his celebrity status to that end. Victims of Savile have attacked the BBC's offer of compensation, arguing the £1,500 figure is about the same amount as the BBC¿s director general, Lord Hall, is paid in a single day . About 135 victims have launched legal proceedings against the BBC, the NHS, the now-defunct Duncroft school for girls in Surrey, and Savile’s £4.3million estate. The estate has been frozen in light of the allegations. Lawyers for all sides are due to meet in a High Court hearing on October 21 to discuss the compensation proposals. Under the BBC scheme, victims could be paid 25 per cent extra if Savile repeated the abuse, and another 25 per cent if it led to lifelong trauma, it is understood. If the BBC’s proposals are accepted, it means the broadcaster and hospitals that failed to stop the serial predator could get away with relatively low compensation payouts. They feared the scandal would cost them millions of pounds, but it seems likely they are facing a combined compensation bill of only two or three million pounds. But the meagre amounts have split opinion among victims, with some branding them an insult, and others saying no amount would compensate for what Savile did. One victim told the Mail: ‘Whether it is £100 or £100,000, it doesn’t matter to me – the point is to get an acknowledgment they did wrong. ‘So many people knew what Savile was like but nobody stopped him. There were dozens of chances for them, but they let him go on attacking children until he was an old man. Jimmy Savile is dead, and this is the only way to get back at him.’ Victims said it was shocking it had taken so long to expose the DJ’s predatory behaviour, and believe senior managers who missed opportunities to stop him should be named and shamed. The NSPCC said publicity surrounding the Savile case had also led to a more general surge in the number of child victims of sexual abuse making contact with them. The number of referrals the NSPCC helpline has made to police and social services was up by 84 per cent in June and July compared with the same period in 2012. The BBC’s director general, Lord Hall, who took up his post in the spring, is paid a salary of £450,000 a year, according to the BBC Trust. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The parties remain in discussions. It would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage.’","At least 450 people abused by the paedophile DJ on BBC premises .

This would be almost a year to the date since CEO Tim Cook, pictured, unveiled the iPad mini . Fresh off the launch of its new iPhones, and before its even had time to restock the shelves, Apple is said to be gearing up to launch its next range of iPads. According to Current Editorials, the tech giant could announce a new iPad mini as well as an improved iPad - dubbed iPad 5 - on 22 October. This would be almost a year to the day since Apple's CEO Tim Cook unveiled the first generation mini, and the release would see the tablets go on sale in time for Christmas. Previous reports suggested Apple would launch successors to its current range of tablets at an event on 15 October, but this has now changed. Apple historically launches products on a Tuesday, making them available for pre-order the following Friday, before putting them on sale the Friday of the week after. This suggests any new devices announced on 22 October will be on sale by 1 November. Leaked photos have already hinted at what the tablets could look like, including a range of colourful cases, and in an investor note, analysts state Apple could also be working on a 13-inch model. In the note, Barclays Equity Research claimed the latest 64-bit architecture - seen in Microsoft's new Surface 2 tablet - could pave the way for a . 13-inch iPad designed to appeal to laptop users. The 64-bit models are said to be more powerful and can handle more multitasking functions. Rumours in August also claimed suppliers in China had been asked to ship larger displays, potentially for use on new Apple products. Apple is rumoured to gearing up to launch an iPad 5 and an iPad mini 2, on 15 October. The latest leaked images from technology site Tactus, allegedly show the rear shell of the iPad 5, pictured, with brightly coloured cases . Analyst Gene Munster, from investment firm Piper Jaffray, surveyed 799 people about Apple's rumoured iWatch. It found 3 per cent of iPhone owners would consider buying the wearable device. There are said to be around 293 million Apple customers, suggesting this would equate to between eight and 10 million units sold in the first year. Respondents were also asked if they would be willing to buy the iWatch for around $350 (£217) with 12 per cent admitting they'd be willing to pay this price. The rest of the people who said they'd be interested in an iWatch said they would pass on the gadget if it cost this much. Source: International Business Times . During the iPhone announcement on 10 September, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said: 'Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new . hardware, software and services that we can’t wait to introduce this . fall and throughout 2014.' The current iPad mini came out in . November 2012 and if Apple follows suit, this would confirm a . mid-October announcement followed by an early-November sale date, in . time for Christmas. The price of the current iPads is also being cut in various regions, suggesting a new tablet is coming. It's likely the iPad mini 2 will keep the current 7.9-inch screen and not drop to 7-inches, in a bid to stay slightly bigger than Google's Nexus 7 and Tesco's new Hudl. If Apple adds the Retina display seen on its new iPhones and larger iPads, its possible the second-generation iPad mini will be heavier and thicker. However, leaked photos of the casing suggest it will be thinner - suggesting Apple will wait to add the high-definition display to later models. According to Apple site, 9to5Mac, the rumoured iPad 5 will also keep the 9.7-inch, high-resolution screen seen on older models. The camera is due an upgrade, too, and is thought Apple would move to an 8MP rear-facing lens, with the possibility of . even a 12MP camera being added.

Leaked images from Tactus additionally suggest the iPad 5 will be thinner than its predecessors. Technology site Expert Reviews believes Apple will stick with its traditional pricing strategy for both models and charge the same price for its new products as it did for the outgoing models. For example, the 16GB iPad 5 is expected to cost around £399, this raises to £479 for 32GB and £559 for 64GB.

The first evidence of a comet impact on Earth has been found in a mysterious black Egyptian pebble filled with diamonds. The comet is thought to have struck Earth 28 million years heating the sands of the Sahara desert to 2,000°C. It created huge amounts of yellow silica glass- also known as Libyan desert glass- which today lie scattered over a 6 000 square kilometre area in the Sahara. The comet is thought to have struck Earth 28 million years heating the sands of the Sahara desert to 2,000°C . A magnificent specimen of the glass, polished by ancient jewellers, is found in Tutankhamun's brooch with its striking yellow-brown scarab. The discovery reported in Earth and Planetary Science Letters could even help researchers unlock the secrets of the formation of our solar system. ‘Comets always visit our skies – they’re these dirty snowballs of ice mixed with dust – but never before in history has material from a comet ever been found on Earth,’ said Professor David Block of Wits University, who led the research. As well as the glass, the impact produced microscopic diamonds. The comet created huge amounts of yellow silica glass- also known as Libyan desert glass- which today lie scattered over a 6 000 square kilometre area in the Sahara . Tutankhamun's impeccably preserved brooch was recovered along with the numerous other artifacts within his tomb in 1922. The striking yellow-brown scarab that is set at its heart is made of a yellow silica glass stone procured from the sand of the Sahara. Researchers believe the silica glass was originally formed 28 million years ago, when an ancient comet entered the earth's atmosphere and exploded over Egypt. Evidence of this can be found in a small, black, diamond-bearing pebble found years earlier by an Egyptian geologist. After conducting chemical analyses on the pebble, the authors came to the conclusion that it represented the very first known hand specimen of a comet nucleus, rather than an unusual type of meteorite. The team have named the diamond-bearing pebble ‘Hypatia’ after of the first well known female mathematician, astronomer and philosopher, Hypatia of Alexandria. Understanding how a comet impact affects planets, could scientists solve some of the mysteries surrounding our solar system. Jan Kramers describes the find as a moment elation. ‘It’s a typical scientific euphoria when you eliminate all other options and come to the realisation of what it must be,’ he said. Comet material is very elusive. Fragments have never been found on Earth before except as microscopic sized dust particles in the upper atmosphere and some carbon-rich dust in the Antarctic ice. ‘Nasa and Esa spend billions of dollars collecting a few micrograms of comet material and bringing it back to Earth, and now we’ve got a radical new approach of studying this material, without spending billions of dollars collecting it,’ said Professor Kramers. The study of Hypatia has grown into an international collaborative research programme with several expeditions already underway in the desert glass area.

Rising numbers of students are likely to receive financial help from their grandparents, according to a survey. Three per cent of grandparents have already helped to fund a relative’s university fees and this is set to rise to 13 per cent in the next decade. The think-tank ILC-UK commissioned the survey of 2,072 Britons with equity release firm Key Retirement Solutions. Planning for the future: 13 per cent of grandparents expect to have to help pay for their granchildrens' studies . They said this means one in eight grandparents – 1.7million over-55s – believe they face helping with tuition fees while meeting their own living costs in retirement. The survey also found that three in four over-55s think they will need to dip into savings to help their student grandchildren in some way. Dean Mirfin, of Key Retirement Solutions, said: 'The numbers of grandparents providing financial assistance for university tuition is set to rocket from current levels as the implications of the maximum £9,000-a-year tuition fees become clear. 'With finances for the over-55s under . strain from falling annuity rates and historically low savings rates, . taking on extra commitments requires careful thought and planning.' Pricey: Think-tank ILC-UK estimates that 1.7million grandparents will be funding students within a decade . A report from last year, which interviewed 1,000 young people, also found that grandparents are a common solution for getting on to the property ladder. It found that one in ten people had asked their grandparents for help when buying their first home. The survey, by housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, also revealed that many young people feared they would have to live with their parents into their 40s and 50s because it would be so difficult to afford homes of their own.","Survey of found that three per cent of grandparents already help with fees .

Dr Richard Holmes, who committed suicide after quitting his job at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down . A weapons expert who worked with Dr David Kelly at the Government’s secret chemical warfare laboratory took his own life after leaving his job while under investigation for bullying, an inquest heard today. Dr Richard Holmes, a married father of one, resigned from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) in Porton Down, Wiltshire the day before he was due to face a disciplinary hearing for gross misconduct in February last year. Dr Holmes had been suspended from his role at the laboratory in November 2011 after a contractor he was working with on the Typhoon-Joint Strike Fighter project complained about bullying. On leaving his position Dr Holmes planned to take his former employer to an employment tribunal, and started to explore opportunities with US-based firms. But the inquest heard that on the day he disappeared, he had also found out that an application for a job as a cleaner at Salisbury District Hospital had been unsuccessful. In the 1990s Dr Homes worked with Dr David Kelly, the government scientist who killed himself in 2003 after being named as a source of controversial claims about the government's 'dodgy dossier' on Saddam's weapons of mass destruction. The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down where Dr Richard Holmes worked, before quitting his job over a bullying investigation . Dr Holmes' body was discovered by . police on April 13 last year in a field in the village of Laverstock, . close to his Salisbury home, two days after he had last been seen by his . wife and teenage daughter. His . wife has reported him missing on April 12 and a missing person inquiry . was launched. An examination of a computer found that Dr Holmes had . researched methods of suicide in the days before he died. A post mortem examination was carried out on Dr Holmes' body, and found that he had taken a poison, the court heard how he had been prescribed anti-depressants by a GP after being diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. A handwritten note was also found in his pocket the inquest was told. Police said that they were satisfied that no one else was involved in the scientist's death, and that it was not suspicious. Although . it is not clear if Dr Holmes and Dr Kelly were close, one source told The . Mail on Sunday that they were friendly when they worked at Porton Down . in the Nineties. Dr Homes worked with Dr David Kelly (pictured), the government scientist who killed himself in 2003 . At the . time, Dr Holmes ran a project organising the installation of chemical . protection equipment in RAF Sentinel spy planes, while Dr Kelly was head . of microbiology and frequently toured the former Soviet Union as a . weapons inspector. Dr Kelly's suicide in 2003 followed his naming as the source of the journalist Andrew Gilligan's BBC report about the government's 'dodgy dossier' on Iraqi WMD, which claimed that the government knew its claim that Iraq could attack British targets within 45 minutes was not substantiated. His death triggered the Hutton inquiry. The inquest into Dr Holmes' death also heard from his widow, Susan Holmes, who also works at DSTL. She told how her husband was very committed to his job, working 50 to 60 hour weeks and expected the same from colleagues. She . said: 'He lived and breathed his work. In some ways he always had . difficulties at work because if you were not as committed in delivering . the work, or had it in the forefront of your mind he didn't really have a . lot of time for you.' Historical: Scientists working at the Porton Down Laboratory in 1964 . 'He gave 110 percent and expected everyone else to. He felt strongly that as public servants spending tax payers' money you should make sure you were getting the best value for tax payers' money. 'Richard had quite strong views about the role of contractors and felt they were more committed to the company they worked for than the public purse.' She also told how her husband was shocked to be suspended and did not understand what he had done wrong. Although it is not clear if Dr Holmes and Dr Kelly were close, one source told The Mail on Sunday that they were friendly when they worked at Porton Down in the Nineties. At the time, Dr Holmes ran a project organising the installation of chemical protection equipment in RAF Sentinel spy planes, while Dr Kelly was head of microbiology and frequently toured the former Soviet Union as a weapons inspector. After the first Gulf War, Dr Holmes is also thought to have worked on the production of chemical protection suits for troops. In 1991 he was the joint author of a scientific paper about an RAF chemical and biological protection system. Mrs Holmes added: ' When he received the letter of complaint he was shocked because he thought they had quite a good relationship.' During the hearing Mrs Holmes  was asked whether her husband's character could be that of someone diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and admitted that her husband was single-minded and did not always pick up on how other people would be feeling. She also told how her husband had difficulty sleeping, but this had got worse following his suspension. Although he hoped to eventually take up work with one of the American contractors that DSTL dealt with, Mrs Holmes spoke of how her husband applied for a cleaning job to 'get out of the house'. She said: 'He had an email saying he had been unsuccessful, which I warned him he would because he was dramatically overqualified. 'He was cross. He said a couple of times' don't worry, I'm not going to do anything silly.'"" On the day that Dr Holmes disappeared the inquest heard how he went up to see his daughter Laura, who was in bed. He told her not to leave the house because he was going for a walk and not taking his keys with him. 'He kissed her teddy bear, which was not very normal, but in retrospect he was saying goodbye,' Mrs Holmes said. She added: 'He was just broken-hearted about not being part of the MoD - it had been so much a part of his life.' The inquest also heard from Nick Stokes, a trade union representative who had been supporting Dr Holmes through the disciplinary process. Mr Stokes agreed with a question from the coroner about improving measures to deal with employees at the laboratory who may be showing signs of autism. Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner David Ridley recorded a conclusion that: 'Dr Holmes took his own life while suffering from depression.' He also said that he would be writing a letter to the Ministry of Defence expressing his concerns about the welfare procedures in place to deal with an employee who may be displaying signs of autism.","Dr Richard Holmes quit his job the day before he was due to face hearing .

The family of an elderly woman who died in agony after developing a horrific bedsore which left her spine exposed, have received a £20,000 pay out. The NHS Litigation Authority reached an out of court settlement with the family of Molly Etty, 84, who died of a blood infection after developing a sore the size of a fist. Miss Etty was admitted to Southend University Hospital, on July 8, 2011, after she fell at her home and needed a hip replacement. Molly Etty, 84, died of a blood infection after developing a fist-sized bedsore while being treated at Southend University Hospital. The sore was so deep it left her spine exposed . But her family’s lawyers say the hospital failed in a number of ways. They say Miss Etty, from Canvey Island in Essex, should have been given an air mattress as recommended in Nice guidelines to prevent pressure sores. They also claim hospital failed to implement a care management plan ensuring Miss Etty was regularly turned and moved to prevent pressure sores, despite staff being aware that she was at risk of developing them. They added that staff failed for three days to send a nurse to assess her skin, despite a referral being made. The lawyers also claim the hospital regularly failed to monitor and assess Miss Etty and did not diagnose the pressure sore until it was classed as grade three - grade five is the most serious. Her niece, Lynda Clifford, was told Miss Etty was having a routine operation and she would be back home within days, but two months later, she died of a blood infection after suffering a terrible wound which exposed the base of her spine and left her crying out in agony. Miss Etty's niece, Lynda Clifford (pictured) said: 'It was horrific to see her suffer so much, but there was nothing I could do because the wound had been left untreated for so long' On July 25, Miss Etty went on a brief visit home with two occupational therapists for them to assess her requirements for when she was discharged from hospital. It was then that the severity of the former pharmaceutical assistant’s condition was discovered by her niece. Although the sore continued to worsen, Miss Etty was discharged to a care home where she died on September 7. Mrs Clifford said: ‘The care home staff were fantastic and did everything they could to try and make my aunt comfortable. ‘However, by this point the sore had become so deep and infected and she cried in pain as it was re-dressed. The family has received a £20,000 out of court settlement from the NHS Litigation Authority. Mrs Clifford says she believed her aunt would return home from hospital once she had had a hip replacement . ‘It was horrific to see her suffer so much, but there was nothing I could do because the wound had been left untreated for so long. ‘Florence Nightingale said one of the first things nurses should learn is how to deal with the elderly and infirm. Molly couldn’t move herself very well so I can’t understand why she wasn’t immediately put on a special mattress.’ Sue Hardy, chief nurse at Southend University Hospital, said: ‘We would like to take this opportunity to extend our sympathies to the family of Miss Etty. ‘We understand that this case will be the subject of an inquest and it would therefore be inappropriate to comment further.’","Molly Etty, 84, developed the sore while at Southend University Hospital .

Pub landlady Lisa Percy, 52, who had lost her hair following treatment for breast cancer, was left bleeding from a head wound as she tried to eject care worker Natalie Hull, 19, over a drunken scuffle at her bar. As Mrs Percy attempted to restore order, Hull hit another woman over the head with a beer bottle before attacking the landlady with a friend's high-heeled shoe, which left her requiring hospital treatment. Pub landlady Lisa Percy (left) was left bleeding from a head wound after she was attacked with a stiletto heel by Natalie Hull (right) following a drunken fight at her bar . The attack occurred after Mrs Percy, who runs the Welcome Tavern in Walton-le-Dale, near Preston, Lancashire, had just undergone her first mastectomy as part of her cancer treatment. Mrs Percy has spoken of the ordeal after Hull, now 20, was sentenced to 140 hours unpaid work with an 18 month community order after she pleaded guilty to assault. Mrs Percy said: 'I can’t think why Natalie did this or how she even knew I had cancer before she saw me. In a way I feel sorry for her because she is only 20 and now she has that terrible conviction on her record. 'She was drunk and stupid and its very sad she should have behaved like this. Everyone in the pub was mortified after the attack and I don’t see why anyone would do that to anyone - let alone someone who clearly had cancer. 'What’s worse was that her mother who is lovely was going round the village asking if my attacker had been caught, before she found out it was Natalie.' The incident began in January this year when Mrs Percy, who was diagnosed with her illness the previous September, was resting upstairs in her living quarters after the latest round of her treatment. The attack happened after Mrs Percy, who runs the Welcome Tavern in Walton-le-Dale, near Preston, Lancashire, had just undergone her first mastectomy . She said: 'I could hear some silly girl screaming outside and a barman came up and said ""I think you better come down"". He couldn’t control it. 'I found out the noise was coming from a girl around the front who said she had been attacked. I found out who the girls were who attacked this person and threw them out. 'There was lads with them and it erupted in a massive brawl. I’ve never had anything like that since and it had only happened once before. It’s usually a quiet pub. Mrs Percy said she managed to grab the stiletto after being hit with it and pushed Hull away . 'I went outside to try and stop them. My head was really bad after all the chemo and the steroids I was on for it. My youngest son came out and I told him to phone the police. 'About 20 lads were kicking hell out of each other and all I could hear was girls screaming like banshees. We had eldely customers inside and they were scared because of the fight and these girls shouting and wanting to fight. 'Ten years ago I would probably would have taken them on but I was so ill. This girl asked me ""who the f*** I was"" and I said it’s my pub. 'Then she said ""so you’re the c*** with cancer then?"" Then she grabbed me. I was absolutely speechless.' Mrs Percy told Hull to leave and one of the regulars Lauren Joyner, 21, tried to intervene - but was spat at in the fact. Mrs Percy said: 'Natalie picked up a Budweiser bottle and smashed it over Lauren’s head and you could see the blood pumping out. Then one of Natalie’s friends had fallen over and her shoe had fallen off so she picked it up and hit me on the head with it. 'I managed to grab it out of her hand and pushed her away but there was a lot of blood - presumably it looked worse because I was bald from the chemo. I actually wasn’t in pain at the time - the pain came about three days later. 'And of course the injury from the heel hitting my head was visible because I was bald. I just wanted to go back upstairs.' Hull ran off after police arived but was arrested later. She was also ordered by Leyland magistrates to pay Mrs Percy and Lauren £300 each as well as costs of £210 at a hearing on August 22. Hull, now 20, was sentenced to 140 hours unpaid work with an 18 month community order after she pleaded guilty to assault . Mrs Percy added: 'In the weeks before the attack I had lost all my hair. My nails fell out, my toenails fell off, my eyelashes fell out. 'I was sick, I was tired and I couldn’t work. I’m still not working properly. I feel quite well now, but still very tired I need to have a preventative mastectomy in three weeks time. 'I might be like this for two years because it was the most aggressive chemo you can have. What concerned me the most is people locally told us she was a care worker - what kind of person would do that to someone knowing they were poorly with cancer?' Hull was unavailable for comment.","Lisa Percy was left bleeding from a head wound following the attack .

Fad diets started at the beginning of the working week are most likely to be ditched by Friday, new research shows. While more than four out of 10 regular dieters see Mondays as a logical starting point to ditch junk food and get healthy, by the weekend most have succumbed to the temptation of eating out and drinking with friends. Just a stoic few will see it through to Saturday, and sometimes even Sunday, before packing it in and reverting to their old eating habits. Temptation too much: Most fad dieters who start their healthy regime on Monday have ditched it by Friday for junk food and drinking according to new research . The snapshot of the nation’s dieting habits has been revealed in a survey of more than 2,000 Britons by Alpro, a company advocating plant-based eating. The results help explain why high-profile fad diets including Atkins, Dukan, The Fast Diet, The Alkaline Diet, The Baby Food Diet, The Blood-Type Diet, The French Woman Diet, The Paleo Diet and the new 5:2 regime, almost always turn out to be passing fancies. Of the half of us who regularly diet, Alpro found that two out of five dieters quit within the first seven days. One out of five last a month, and the same number make it to the three-month mark, while the remainder stay dedicated for at least six months. However, only one in 20 is likely to still be following their new healthy eating regime after one year. Of those who quit in the first week, one in 10 will have already ditched their new regime by Tuesday. By Thursday, a further three out of 10 will have followed suit. By Friday, four out 10 say they are so proud of their achievement in lasting five days that they deserve a reward, or that the lure of Friday night cocktails or the chance to escape from family pressures or work by enjoying some drinks and eating out is too great to turn down. Only one out of 10 first-week quitters makes it through to Saturday before falling back into bad habits, and the same number makes it to Sunday. Maker of plant-based food and drink, Alpro, commissioned the study to highlight how strict eating and diet regimes, while looking great on paper and followed by millions - even if only fleetingly - are not the best way to sustain a healthy lifestyle when the realities of real life also kick in. Quick quitters: Of dieters who quit in their first week, one in 10 will have reverted to their old eating habits by Tuesday . In particular, it said that more and more people were realising the benefits of broader eating plans, such as its successful ‘plant-based eating’ campaign, which encourages people to ‘reshape their plate’ by adding more plant-based foods into a balanced diet - such as whole grains, beans and pulses, fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds. Alpro dietician Kate Arthur explains: . ‘More and more dieters are realising that the fad diet promises of . shedding huge amounts of weight in just a few weeks are either hollow, . or that the diets are impossible to follow. Hollow weight loss: Kate Arthur, a dietician for Alpro says most fad diets are almost impossible to follow . ‘The reality is that the majority of these diets are so impractical and indeed so little fun that we often give up within just a few days. ‘There has never been any secret to sustaining a healthy diet. 'It always has been, and always will be, about eating the right foods as part of a balanced diet, and exercising, while allowing yourself a treat now and again. ‘Effectively, we are advocating a return . to a more natural omnivore-based diet that embraces all food groups . which is nothing more than the plant-based diet that we, as a race, are . supposed to follow to maintain good all round health.’ The Alpro survey also highlighted how . considerations about health, the environment and where our food comes . from already appear to be prompting a move towards more sustainable food . choices and a more varied diet. Of all those surveyed, four out of 10 . said they were now trying to eat less meat because of concerns over . health and the negative impact that they believe the production of meat . has on the environment. Ms . Arthur said: ‘It is particularly pleasing that we are now really . beginning to see a step change in how people are thinking about food, . from the eating regimes they want to follow, to the foods they want to . eat both more and less of because of concerns over health and . considerations for the environment.’ No secrets to success: Ms Arthur says that to be healthy you need to eat plant-based foods as part of a balanced diet, exercise regularly and occasionally treat yourself . Environmental eating: Four out of 10 survey participants said they are trying to eat less meat because they are concerned about their health and the negative impact they believe the production of meat has on the environment .","Four out of 10 regular dieters start their healthy eating regimes on Monday .

A hotel in Germany are offering a 'captivating' stay - by locking up their guests in old prison cells. The Alcatraz hotel in Kauserslautern was once a fully functioning prison which has now been transformed into a modern guest house with a twist. The 56 rooms at the hotel offers a night behind bars, complete with a stripy prison pyjamas to give its willing inmates the full experience.

'Prisoners' at the hotel can find out firsthand what life was like inside the dingy cells, with the helping hand of a few modern necessities thrown in. Receptionist David Woodard, 23, says: ‘Dr. Michael Koll and Dr. Andreas Kirsch bought the former prison and had the idea to change it into a hotel in 2007, five years after it closed. ‘The decision was made for the prison to be fused with a bigger one further away, and my managers had the idea to turn it into a hotel, but wanted to keep some of the authenticity of the prison.’ A night in the cells would set you back just £41 for a single room, whilst a double costs £58 for the complete experience. Originally built in 1867, the prison was soon enlarged and more and more structures like working halls, cellars, outside grounds and a chapel were added. Safety first: Although the old prison was transformed into a hotel in 2007, it has kept a fair few of its original features, including the cage reception .

Dead man walking: Despite the warm colour scheme, the hallways have a distinct prison-like feel . ‘The people who come here for the experience of a prison hotel have given us very positive feedback in the aspects of authenticity and hospitality,’ said David. ‘Guests who have the time to participate in a tour are amazed; they get to see the old not yet refurnished parts of the prison, which includes three levels of cells.’ It took 18 months to complete the transformation from prison to hotel, which features cells, comfort rooms and suits, as well as a restaurant and meeting room. Dark history: Now an inviting hotel, the prison, originally built in 1867, did not close for inmates until 2002 .

A Czech family have been found guilty of stealing £500,000 of taxpayers' money by flying in 'benefit tourists' to claim tax credits. Sisters Iveta and Magdalena Ferkova, 32 and 33, along with their aunt Alena Lackova, 39, and her husband Jan Lacko, 29, organised housing and National Insurance numbers for workers from Slovakia. In exchange for setting the migrants up in Britain, often including a house and low-paid job, the gang pocketed the tax credits handed out to the foreign workers. Alena Lackova (left) and Iveta Ferkova (right), pictured outside Nottingham Crown Court, have been found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud by making false representations . Between January 2008 and April 2010, the four swindled more £500,000 from the HMRC in tax credits which was paid into a bank account controlled by the gang. The four were all found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud by making false representations after a week-long trial at Nottingham Crown Court. A fifth defendant, Julius Ziga, 34, who was Magdalena’s partner at the time, pleaded guilty to conspiracy. The court heard the gang, from Nottingham, posed as interpreters for the workers they flew over to Britain when conducting interviews with HMRC, in banks and at Job Centres. Iveta Ferkova (left), Alena Lackova (centre) and Jan Lacko were part of the gang which flew in 'benefits tourists' to claim tax credits . They helped the workers claim tax credits but the cash was paid into a newly-opened bank account controlled by the gang. Alena Lackova (front) and Jan Lacko (back) pictured at Nottingham Crown Court . Once the benefits were paid into the bank accounts the foreign nationals were then sent back to their native country. HM Revenue and Customs officers discovered 124 bank accounts set up to receive cash from 77 false tax credits totalling around £535,000. The court heard the family used the cash to fund a lavish lifestyle including gambling in casinos around the UK as well as splashing out on luxury cars including a Mercedes and BMW 5 series. Judge James Sampson said: 'In the case of each of the defendants, the prosecution say he or she agreed with the other’s knowledge to commit a fraud. 'The prosecution say they had a common aim and shared resources to commit a fraud. 'The fact they are all charged with the same conspiracy doesn’t mean they are all as deeply involved. They played different roles.' Abdul Iqbal, defending Lacko, said no money passed to his client’s bank account from the fraud and he did not get the National Insurance numbers for any claimant. Lackova’s barrister, Arshad Khan, said: 'There is no evidence she lived a life of Riley.' The five will be sentenced on November 4.","Gang pocketed tax credits after setting migrants up in Britain .

The Treasury¿s Financial Secretary Sajid Javid will extend the deadline so more victims of the Equitable Life scandal can be helped . Ministers will today launch a campaign to find 400,000 ‘lost’ victims of the Equitable Life scandal who cannot be traced. The Treasury’s Financial Secretary Sajid Javid will announce that around £1 million a day has been paid out since ministers agreed a £1.5 billion compensation scheme in 2011. But poor data means that 400,000 of the estimated one million victims of the saga cannot be traced. Mr Javid will today extend the deadline for claims by at least a year to give people more time to come forward. He will also announce plans for a national advertising campaign to highlight the existence of the Equitable Life Payments Scheme to policy holders who may not realise they could be eligible for compensation. Last night Mr Javid said: ‘This government has allocated up to £1.5bn to help the policyholders of Equitable Life who suffered an injustice, with hundreds of thousands of policy holders receiving over £700 million in payments since 2011. ‘We’ve made strong progress, but we want to maximise the number of people who will eventually receive payments, which is why we are extending the Equitable Life Payment Scheme to mid-2015.’ The near-collapse of Equitable Life in the year 2000 left hundreds of thousands of policy holders out of pocket. Following a long campaign by the Daily Mail, Chancellor George Osborne announced a major compensation scheme to help those who lost money on their pension investments. The latest figures show that a total of £734 million has been paid out so far. But the Treasury has faced criticism for failing to do more to track down victims of the scandal. Many policy-holders lost half their life savings when Equitable Life, a previously well-regarded insurer, came to the brink of collapse in 2000 after promising unrealistic annuity rates to investors. The near-collapse of Equitable Life in the year 2000 left hundreds of thousands of policy holders out of pocket . Others have died waiting for successive governments to restore their lost money. In July, the Commons public accounts committee said the lack of publicity about the compensation scheme meant there was a ‘real risk’ that tens of thousands of people would lose out. The committee’s Labour chairman said she was ‘stunned’ by evidence that the Treasury had destroyed details and addresses of 353,000 policy holders provided by the Equitable Members Action Group on data protection grounds. But Treasury sources pointed out Labour had failed to act on the scandal for a decade before Mr Osborne decided to take action. The National Audit Office also criticised the Treasury for failing to do enough preparatory work before launching the compensation scheme. The Treasury last night blamed poor data from Equitable Life for the failure to track down more eligible policy holders. A source said the list of addresses provided by the firm was more than 20 years old, with some details missing altogether. More than 400,000 policies were supplied without contact addresses. Officials are already using the electoral roll and credit records to try and track down those potentially owed compensation, as well as sending letters to victims’ last known addresses. The compensation scheme had been due to expire in April next year, but will now be extended until ‘mid 2015’.","Sajid Javid said there are still a million victims of financial storm .

Prosecution: Gillian Astbury, 66, died at Stafford Hospital after staff failed to give her insulin and the Trust has now admitted breaking the law . A scandal-plagued hospital trust has today admitted breaching health and safety law after a  a patient died when nurses failed to notice she was severely diabetic and needed insulin. The Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust has pleaded guilty to failing to ensure the safety of Gillian Astbury, yet no staff will face the consequences in the courts. The 66-year-old lapsed into a fatal diabetic coma while being treated at Stafford Hospital in April 2007. The NHS trust was prosecuted as an . organisation, meaning that individual nurses, doctors and managers will . not face jail for their failings. Today it has pleaded guilty through its barrister to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act by failing to properly manage and organise hospital services, including its systems for record-keeping, patient information and communication between staff members. Hundreds . of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire . between 2005 and 2009, and earlier this year a damning report warned . that many others had suffered inhumane abuse. Gillian . Astbury was admitted to Stafford Hospital following a fall at home. She was put under the care of a . team of nurses who did not bother to read her medical notes and failed . to realise she was diabetic and needed regular doses of insulin. She . fell into a coma and died ten days after first being admitted on to the . ward. Her friend and carer, . Ron Street, said that when he went to visit her she was often in soiled . bed linen and her meals would be left out of reach. Deaths: Up to 1,200 people died needlessly at Stafford Hospital - the worst scandal in NHS history . The . HSE began investigating the death in April, having postponed its probe . until after the publication in February of a major report following a . public inquiry into the scandal. Families of the Stafford Hospital victims and union chiefs called for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to resign . It concluded that there was . enough evidence to charge the trust under the Health and Safety at Work . Act, for failing to protect others against risks to health and safety. The criminal prosecution at Stafford Magistrates' Court was brought by the Health and Safety Executive three years after an inquest jury ruled that Mrs Astbury's death was contributed to by low staffing levels and a systemic failure to provide adequate nursing facilities. The trust could now be fined tens of thousands of pounds. The . HSE said it was not the first time a hospital trust had been prosecuted . under the law but there have been only a handful of cases. Although . the proceedings were not being brought against individuals, two of the . nurses involved face being struck off following professional hearings. In July the Nursing and Midwifery Council ruled that Jeanette Coulson and . Ann King had failed to keep Mrs Astbury’s records up to date or carry . out blood tests. The panel will decide on a punishment for the two . nurses over the coming weeks. Maggie . Oldham, chief executive at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, . said: ‘We accept the findings of the Health and Safety Executive’s . investigation.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:42 EST, 8 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:22 EST, 9 October 2013 . Abu Anas al-Libi, a suspected al-Qaeda leader connected to the 1998 embassy bombings, is being held aboard a ship . After Delta Force commandos seized Abu Anas al-Libi in Libya this weekend, he was whisked away to a nearby U.S. warship, where he will be interrogated by the military until he is sent back to the West for prosecution. Al-Libi is the latest terrorist suspect to be held aboard American naval vessels that have become 'floating black sites' used to house so-called enemy combatants offshore so they can be pumped for intelligence information. After interrogators from the military and the CIA are finished, experts say, the suspects can then be transferred to the United States, where federal prosecutors and the FBI can take over and pursue charges in a civilian court. Questioning suspected terrorists aboard U.S. warships in international . waters is President Barack Obama's answer to the Bush administration . detention policies of sending enemy combatant to secret CIA 'black sites' or to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. President Obama, as a candidate, promised to end such policies. The strategy . also makes good on Obama's pledge to prosecute terrorists in U.S. civilian courts, which many Republicans have argued against. But it also . raises questions about using 'law of war' powers to circumvent the . safeguards of the U.S. criminal justice system. That's the pattern emerging with the recent capture of al-Libi, one of the FBI's most wanted terrorists, long-sought for his alleged role in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa. He was captured in a raid Saturday and is being held aboard the USS San Antonio, an amphibious warship mainly used to transport troops. It was in the Mediterranean to support the now-canceled strikes in Syria. Al-Libi is being held aboard the amphibious transport dock ship USS San Antonio, where he could be interrogated for weeks or months before being read his Miranda Rights . Experts say he likely is being questioned by CIA and military interrogators - along with lawyers from the U.S. Department of Justice. After the interrogation, it is expected he will be sent back to the United States and read his Miranda Rights - including the 'right to remain silent.' He will be questioned again - this time within the bounds of federal law. By holding people in secret prisons, known as black sites, the CIA was able to question them over long periods, using the harshest interrogation tactics, without giving them access to lawyers. Obama came to office without a ready replacement for those secret prisons. The concern was that if a terrorist was sent directly to court, the government might never know what intelligence he had. With the black sites closed and Obama refusing to send more people to the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, it wasn't obvious where the U.S. would hold people for interrogation. And that's where the warships came in. On Saturday, the Army's Delta Force and Libyan operatives captured al-Libi in a raid. A team of U.S. investigators from the military, intelligence agencies and the Justice Department has been sent to question him on board the San Antonio, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press. The San Antonio was in the Mediterranean as part of the fleet preparing for now-canceled strikes on Syria last month. Al-Libi's sons show off the SUV from which their father was captured by Delta Force commandos this weekend. The troops reportedly broke out his window, pulled him into their black Mercedes and whisked him away . Al-Libi, who was indicted in 2000 for his involvement in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa, was being held on the warship in military custody under the laws of war, which means a person can be captured and held indefinitely as an enemy combatant, one of the officials said. Both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. As of Monday, al-Libi had not been read his Miranda rights, which include the rights to remain silent and speak with an attorney. And it was unclear when al-Libi would be brought to the U.S. to face charges. 'It appears to be an attempt to use assertion of law of war powers to avoid constraint and safeguards in the criminal justice system,' said Hina Shamsi, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union and the director of the civil rights organization's national security project. 'I am very troubled if this is the pattern that the administration is setting for itself.' The Obama administration publicly debuted the naval ship interrogation tactic in 2011 when it captured Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali citizen who the U.S. government said helped support and train al-Qaida-linked militants. Warsame was questioned aboard a U.S. warship for two months before he went to New York to face terrorism charges. He pleaded guilty earlier this year and agreed to tell the FBI what he knew about terror threats and, if necessary, testify for the government. The White House would not discuss its plans for prosecuting al-Libi. The Obama Administration is reportedly trying to avoid putting more terrorism suspects in the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba . 'As a general rule, the government will always seek to elicit all the actionable intelligence and information we can from terrorist suspects taken into our custody,' National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said Monday. The interrogators sent to question al-Libi are part the same group that questioned Warsame - the High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group. The Obama administration created the group of interrogators in 2009 to juggle the need to extract intelligence from captured suspected terrorists and preserve evidence for a criminal trial. Under interrogation, Warsame gave up what officials called important intelligence about al-Qaida in Yemen and its relationship with al-Shabab militants in Somalia. Because those sessions were conducted before Warsame was read his Miranda rights, the intelligence could be used to underpin military strikes or CIA actions but were not admissible in court. After that interrogation was complete, the FBI stepped in and started the questioning over in a way that could be used in court. After the FBI read Warsame his rights, he opted to keep talking for days, helping the government build its case. Al-Libi's case is different from Warsame's in that he already has been indicted for allegedly conducting 'visual and photographic surveillance' of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi that was attacked in 1998. Warsame was indicted after he was questioned aboard the naval ship. The ACLU's Shamsi said it's a good thing that al-Libi was not being held secretly, as was the policy during the Bush administration. But, she said, al-Libi should be entitled to counsel and a speedy trial. While prisoners have a right to a speedy trial, there's no reason the U.S. needs to rush al-Libi to court. That's because in 2010 U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ruled that the government could prosecute al-Qaeda suspect Ahmed Ghailani in New York, despite holding him for five years in CIA and military custody. Kaplan said the delay didn't violate Ghailani's speedy-trial rights because the government has the authority to detain suspects during wartime. Kaplan is also the judge in al-Libi's case. The Obama administration has said it can hold high-value detainees on a ship for as long as it needs to. During his confirmation hearing in June 2011 to be the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, Adm. William McRaven said the U.S. could keep a detainee on a ship for as long as it takes to determine whether the U.S. could prosecute the suspect in civilian court or whether the U.S. could return the suspect to another country. 'This situation, like the one with Ahmed Warsame two years earlier, is a hybrid model in which military detention under the laws of war is used to facilitate short-term interrogation, and then combined with civilian criminal prosecution in order to take the person off the streets for the long term,' said Robert Chesney, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law who tracks terrorism issues. 'The hybrid approach is not always available,' he said. 'But it can be the perfect approach in the right circumstances.'","Suspected al-Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Libi was sent to the USS San Antonio for interrogation after he was captured in Libya .

Council bosses are merging two houses together to create a new super six-bedroom home for an unemployed couple and their ten children - at the expense of the taxpayer. Tim Fisk, 43, and his pregnant partner Mandy Ball, 41, have between them ten children who live with them under one roof, two older ones who have moved out, and another baby due next month. The couple, whose children in the house range from 15-years-old to eleven months, have lived at the property for about seven years. Council bosses have ordered a wall be knocked through two homes to create one large one to accommodate Tim Fisk's sprawling family . Some 84 outraged neighbours and local residents have signed a petition to try and stop the council making one big home for Mandy Ball and her brood . Some of the children on holiday in Great Yarmouth. The huge family are expected to be able to move into their large home within two months . Ipswich-born Mr Fisk used to work as a security guard for Nighthawk Security in Clacton, Essex, but hasn’t worked for several years. Some 84 outraged neighbours and local residents have signed a petition opposing the scheme to knock two houses into one massive property in Ipswich. But council bosses have ignored the protests and have given the controversial £6,000 blueprint for the construction to go-ahead. Ipswich Borough Council chiefs snubbed local people's objections and protests to the radical project. Now work is set to start later this week on converting the two three-bedroom council properties into one super home. Builders will knock through an unoccupied house next door to where the family live, creating a new six-bedroom home. The family of 12 will move into a six-bedroom council home at the taxpayers' expense after council chiefs granted permission for the walls between the buildings to be knocked through and transformed into one huge building . Two council houses in Ipswich will be knocked together to accommodate the huge family . A council spokesman admitted it was a 'very unusual situation' but insisted it was the most 'cost-effective option' to meet the huge family's needs. He said the work would be completed within two months and cost £6,000. The family, who refused to comment last night, moved in to their home seven years ago. The council spokesman said there are 3,203 people on their housing waiting list, with 391 of these eligible for three-bedroom homes. He confirmed that 84 people signed the petition. 'This is a very unusual situation and not something we would normally contemplate doing. 'But, having reviewed all the options, we believe that this is the most cost-effective option to find a solution to this family's needs,' added the spokesman. Ipswich Borough Council chiefs snubbed local people's objections and protests to the radical project and have given the go-ahead to the £6,000 project, which should take two months . 'The alterations can be reversed in future. We have only one six-bedroom house in our stock. 'We have completed the structural surveys and will begin work on conversion soon.'. A homeowner who supports the petition said he wants to protest at the 'waste of taxpayers' money' The neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'It's been empty for three months and another family could have moved in. 'The council is missing out on extra rent. This is absolutely ridiculous.' He insisted: 'They could have built an extension instead; this has caused a real storm round here.' Another neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'She's been up here for seven, eight years, and she’s had a child every year. 'I just think it’s a total waste of taxpayers' money. The council should have had far more foresight than this.' He added: 'They are like an ant colony. 'It’s like being stuck in the middle of a playground. 'She pumps out a child every year and they are giving them a mansion. I think it’s disgusting.' Cllr Jim Powell, who represents the local Bridge council ward, said he supported the decision.

Hospital spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said they did not know either how long the mother-of-two had been left lying there, nor how she had come to be on the fire escape in the first place, according to Associated Press. She added: 'It's very concerning. We're distressed and don't know what happened. It's our top . priority to find out.' The cause of her death is now being investigated by the San Francisco Sheriff's Department and police. A police investigation was launched after the 57-year-old British woman first went missing. The disorientated mother-of-two had been admitted to the hospital for complications to an infection and was being monitored by staff every 15 minutes, but disappeared between check-ups.

Controversial ad vans telling illegal immigrants to 'go home' have been banned by the advertising watchdog. The Home Office has been told by the Advertising Standards Authority to stop using the vehicles because claims about the number of arrests were 'misleading'. The ASA said the 'go home' slogan was 'distasteful' but cleared it over complaints that it was offensive and irresponsible. Controversy: The Home Office's 'Go Home' vans were not offensive but were misleading, the advertising watchdog said . The Home Office sent the vans displaying billboards warning overstaying migrants ‘Go home, or you'll be picked up and deported’ to tour six London boroughs in July. Tory ministers made clear their desire to send the vans across the country but the Lib Dems dismissed them as 'silly' and refused to back their future use. Labour accused the Tories of using the ‘language of the National Front’. The Advertising Standards Authority received 224 complaints against the Home Office campaign earlier this year. Groups representing migrants in the UK, legal academics and Labour peer Lord Lipsey were among those who complained to the ASA. The poster featured a close-up image of someone holding a pair of handcuffs and wearing a uniform with a Home Office badge alongside a box stating: 'In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.' Green text in the style of an official stamp stated '106 arrests last week in your area'. Small print at the bottom of the poster said the arrest figures were from the period June 30 to July 6 and covered Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow. Most of the complainants said the poster, and in particular the phrase 'go home', was offensive and distressing because it was reminiscent of slogans used by racist groups to attack immigrants in the past, and irresponsible and harmful because it could incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multicultural communities. Backing: Home Secretary Theresa May wants to see the vans used across the country . Several complainants challenged whether the claim '106 arrests last week in your area' was misleading and could be substantiated, while others said the small print was not legible on a moving vehicle. The Home Office said the vans were sent to Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all boroughs which had either significantly above average, or very low, uptake of the voluntary departure route for illegal immigrants. The message, which the Home Office said was 'in no way racist', needed to be short and easily understood because it was displayed on moving vehicles. It said the Metropolitan Police had confirmed that there were no increases in 'community tension indicators' in the pilot boroughs or elsewhere in London during the period the posters were displayed. A survey conducted by YouGov on August 13 found that 66 per cent of those polled did not consider the posters racist. The Home Office said the data used to support the '106 arrests' figure was the most reliable and recent information on arrests made by the West, North and East London Immigration Compliance and Enforcement teams and from seven police custody suites in the six pilot boroughs during the week beginning June 30. The ASA said it acknowledged that the phrase 'go home' was reminiscent of slogans used in the past to attack migrants to the UK, but was generally used in that context as a standalone phrase or accompanied by racially derogatory language. It said: 'We considered that, in context, the claim would be interpreted as a message regarding the immigration status of those in the country illegally, which was not related to their race or ethnicity. 'We recognised that the poster, and the phrase ""go home"" in particular, were likely to be distasteful to some in the context of an ad addressed to illegal immigrants, irrespective of the overall message conveyed, and we recognised that wording less likely to produce that response, such as ""return home"" could have been used. 'However, we concluded that the poster was unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence or distress.' It also concluded that the poster was unlikely to incite or exacerbate racial hatred and tensions in multicultural communities, and that it was 'not irresponsible and did not contain anything which was likely to condone or encourage violence or anti-social behaviour'. Criticism: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the vans were 'silly' and refused to allow them to be used again while Labour's Yvette Cooper accused the Tories of using the 'language of the National Front' But it said those who saw the poster would understand the claim '106 arrests last week in your area' to mean that during the previous week 106 people in the area in which they saw the poster had been arrested under suspicion of being in the UK illegally. It said: 'Because the data on which the claim was based related to a significant part of London north of the Thames rather than to the specific areas in which the poster was displayed, and because the data did not relate to the week prior to the campaign, we concluded the claim was misleading and had not been substantiated. 'We considered the size of the font used for the qualification, its prominence relative to other information in the poster and the limited time in which those who saw the poster would have to read the qualification meant it had not been presented sufficiently clearly. We therefore concluded the poster was misleading.' The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form, and said: 'We told the Home Office to ensure that in future they held adequate substantiation for their advertising claims and that qualifications were presented clearly.' ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: 'Although distasteful to some, we've ruled that the Home Office ad wasn't offensive or harmful. But it was misleading. 'All advertisers, including Government, have to stick to the rules so we can trust the ads we see and hear.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper . said: 'The ad vans sent out by the Home Office were a divisive gimmick . and now the ASA has confirmed they were also misleading too. 'The . ASA has now confirmed that the phrase ""go home"" was reminiscent of . slogans used in the past to attack immigrants to the UK and that . different language could have been used instead. 'They have also . confirmed that the information used on the vans was misleading and . should not be used again.' A Home Office spokeswoman said: 'We are pleased the ASA have concluded that our pilot was neither offensive nor irresponsible. We have always been clear that this campaign was about encouraging illegal immigrants to leave the country voluntarily and was not targeted at particular racial or ethnic groups. 'In respect of the ASA's other findings, we can confirm that the poster will not be used again in its current format.'","Billboards caused a storm after touring six London boroughs .

Campaign: Miriam Clegg, wife of deputy prime minister Nick, said there needs to be more role models for women . Nick Clegg’s wife has claimed women do not have enough role models to aspire to, and are too often labelled as ‘fluffy’ or ‘shallow’. Miriam Clegg, a lawyer, said women ‘face a series of stark choices’, while men can ‘toy with unlimited options’. Mrs Clegg, known as Miriam Gonzalez Durantez professionally, said women are described as ‘scary’ if they are successful in their careers, ‘shallow’ if they follow fashion and ‘fluffy’ if they read women’s magazines. Mrs Clegg, a partner at European law firm Dechert LLP, said it was not surprising that many young girls struggled to find their identity. She added that there needed to be more visible female role models for girls to succeed. She quoted figures from Girlguiding UK, which claims 55 per cent of girls aged between 11 and 21 feel there are not enough female role models. On the contrary Mrs Clegg, who has three children with deputy prime minister Mr Clegg, said there was a ‘surplus’ of female role models. As a result, she is helping to launch a national campaign, called Inspiring the Future, which will encourage women from all backgrounds to visit schools and talk to girls about their jobs. Mrs Clegg said: ‘I believe that every woman has a role model inside her:  the role models of our everyday lives.’ She added: ‘It is little wonder that girls struggle, amid so many absurd labels, struggle to identify the right path for them. ‘As it is equally little wonder that, when threatened with that same flurry of labels, many female role models refuse to stick their necks out. ‘And yet while men are able to toy with unlimited options, we still face a series of stark choices. ‘If we do not have children, people assume we are “frustrated”. If we stay at home taking care of our children, it is said we are “not working”. ‘If we have a job, we are portrayed as just “part-time mums”, and sometimes even as bad parents. ‘If we succeed in our professional lives, we’re branded “scary”; if we follow fashion, we’re “shallow”; if we like science, we’re “geeks”; if we read women’s magazines, we’re “fluffy”, and if we defend our rights, we’re “hard”.’ The campaign will start with a ‘career speed-dating’ event on October 17, in which 100 girls from London state schools will meet ten successful women. The nine other women taking part in the launch event include BBC news reader Fiona Bruce (left) and Carolyn McCall, CEO of EasyJet (right) The nine other women taking part in the launch event include BBC news reader Fiona Bruce and Carolyn McCall, CEO of EasyJet. After the first event, the charity will continue to encourage women to speak for one hour about their career in state schools. She told the Telegraph: ‘It is our duty to guarantee that all that potential does not go to waste. Those girls should not have to limit their dreams and feel constrained by absurd and demeaning stereotypes. ‘They should rather feel free to aim high – high in their jobs, and high in their lives. ‘The new generation of girls are clever, engaged and curious; they are ambitious, but in a realistic way; they are not afraid of hard work and they are determined to shine.’","Miriam Clegg said women face a series of stark choices while men toy with unlimited options .

A poignant 133-year-old letter has revealed details of the last stand of Australia's most famous outlaw, Ned Kelly, describing the moment bullets 'slid off him like hail' as he faced a bloody battle with police. In the first 'everyman' account of the Glenrowan Siege, a young bank teller named Donald Sutherland tells how he witnessed Kelly being captured and, in the letter to his parents in Scotland, details the shootout with police on June 28, 1880. The heavy homemade armour and helmet which protected Kelly during the battle helped make him an iconic figure in Australian history. But in scenes similar to Clint Eastwood's western, a Fistful of Dollars, the bullets seemed to have bounced off him. In the film Eastwood's character Joe enters a showdown with a steel chest-plate hidden beneath his poncho, as his opponent's rifle shots bounce off, allowing him to win the duel. 'Ned's armour alone weighed 97 pounds,' Mr Sutherland writes. 'The police thought he was a fiend, seeing their rifle bullets were sliding off him like hail,"" Sutherland wrote. 'The force of the rifle bullets made him stagger when hit but it was only when they got him on the legs and arms that he reluctantly fell, exclaiming as he did so ""I am done. I am done"".' In the letter, Mr Sutherland tells how he had dashed by horseback . from the nearby town of Oxley after learning the notorious Kelly . gang was at an inn in Glenrowan. By the time he had arrived, Ned was . lying badly wounded on a stretcher after losing the battle with police, . despite the homemade suit of armour he had been wearing. He said: 'I was . really sorry for him to see him lying pierced by bullets and still . showing no signs of pain,' Mr Sutherland wrote in his . beautifully-scripted letter.

Alex McDermott, a research scholar at the State Library of Victoria, said the Glenrowan Siege had been heavily scrutinised in the past century. A framed photograph shows Ned Kelly, the day before he was hanged at a prison called the Old Melbourne Gaol . He said but the letter was the first time the events had been represented in an unbiased and 'everyman' perspective. 'To date, every single account has always been from a member of the police or a Kelly family member or adviser,' he said. 'Sutherland doesn't condemn either side, he just gives it out.' The Kelly Gang was outlawed after they killed three policemen and robbed several banks. They became a symbol of social tensions between poor Irish settlers and the wealthy establishment, with Kelly becoming a folk hero to many for standing up to the Anglo-Australian ruling class. 'He was lying on a stretcher quite calm and collected, not withstanding the great pain he must have been suffering from his wounds,' Sutherland wrote, and added that Kelly was surrounded by his crying sisters. The letter passed to Sutherland's descendants in Scotland, England and Canada before the family decided to donate it to the State Library of Victoria in Melbourne. It will be on view from Monday. Ned Kelly and his gang rode . through the hills north of Melbourne, plundering and robbing before the . shootout with police at Stringybark Creek. A desperate . confrontation with police occurred at Glenrowan on June 28, 1880, . Kelly, in his home-fashioned head and body armour, faced police before he was showered with rifle bullets. He was convicted of three . counts of wilful murder and hanged at the Old Melbourne Gaol in November . 1880. His last words before he was hanged were reported to have been: 'Such is life.' Australia's most infamous criminal Ned Kelly holds a gun in Melbourne . Edward 'Ned' Kelly was the first son of Irish convict John 'Red' Kelly, who moved to Australia in 1848. Ned was born in Beveridge, just north of Melbourne, some time between June 1854 and June 1855. At the age of 14, Ned was arrested for the first time for assaulting a Chinese pig farmer. The . year after, he was arrested again, this time for being a suspected . accomplice of robber Harry Power. Both these charges were dismissed, but . it was too late: Ned had come to the attention of the police. Some years later a police officer went to the Kelly home, hoping to arrest Ned's brother Dan for stealing horses. The officer claimed that when he turned up he was shot in the wrist by . Ned, although it was unclear whether Ned was even present at the time. Ned's mother Ellen was arrested for aiding and abetting an attempted . murder and sentenced to three years. Ned . and other members of his family went into hiding and hoped by starting . up a whiskey distillery they could earn enough money to appeal their . mother's sentence. But the . police were hot on their heels. Four officers were dispatched to track . them down and Ned ended up killing three of them, officially becoming an . outlaw. He went on to . rob two banks before police finally caught up with him. Ned was hanged . on November 11, 1880. His last words were ‘Such is life’.

Bitter feud: Bashar Assad's government has ignored the international envoy's call for a ceasefire, with no sign of respite 19 months into the fighting . The rebels have become increasingly resourceful over 19 months of civil war in the troubled country as they fight tooth and nail to bring down President Bashar Assad's regime. The Syrian army, meanwhile, has been responding with artillery shelling and even banned cluster bombs, according to an international human rights group. Tens of thousands of citizens have fled over the border into Jordan to escape the horrific violence, with activists claiming that more than 33,000 Syrians have now been killed. Tensions are also escalating with Turkey, which wants to ban Syrian planes from its airspace because one was seen transporting weapons. The Syrian government said today that the international envoy's call for a four-day holiday ceasefire would likely fail because the rebels fighting to topple Assad's regime have no unified leadership to agree to it.

Social mobility in England is among the worst of all developed nations because children from deprived backgrounds are less likely to get a good education, the OECD report said. Children born to parents with a poor education were eight times more likely to struggle with literacy than those from a well-educated family. This compared with an average of five times among the 24 countries covered in the survey. Poor comparison: The survey found that British children faced more of a struggle than children from poor families in Japan where background appeared to impact little on educational success . The countries where people’s backgrounds made the least difference to their education included Japan and South Korea, where the younger generation’s skills far exceed those of older people. Researchers said England had ‘one of the strongest associations between socio-economic background and literary proficiency among young people and the broader population of 16 to 65-year-olds’. Unlike most other countries, ‘this association is stronger among young people than among the overall adult population’. The standard of parents’ education also had a ‘stronger-than-average impact on young people’s proficiency in both literacy and numeracy’. Adults with at least one parent who went to university were far more likely to have good reading and mathematical skills compared with those whose parents did not complete secondary education. The report suggested the best way to overcome social disadvantages and improve education was to allow businesses to have a say in what is taught in schools. Exams: The study found that British students are more likely to be held back from success by their background than almost anywhere else in the world . Attempts to level the playing field for children from low-income families include the Pupil Premium, introduced in 2011 and paid to schools for every pupil they teach who receives free school meals. Universities that charge fees of £6,000 or more must produce access agreements to show how they plan to give places to more under-privileged children. The gender gap in pay in England was also highlighted by the report. It said women use problem-solving skills at work more than men – which is unusual compared with other countries – but they earn 15 per cent less on average. The Department for Education said: ‘As well as a rigorous new curriculum which focuses on the basics from a young age, we are investing in quality apprenticeships and traineeships.’ The DfE also cited measures such as making English and maths compulsory from last month for anyone up to the age of 18 who does not have at least a C grade at GCSE.","British children born to poor parent were eight times more likely to struggle with literacy compared with children from middle-class well-educated families .

Warning: Pensions minister Steve Webb said encouraging early retirement to give youngsters jobs is counter-productive . Routinely pensioning off older workers to make way for unemployed youngsters would hurt the economy, a minister claimed yesterday. Employees in their sixties tended to be more experienced, more productive and took less time off sick than younger staff, said pensions minister Steve Webb. Ushering them into retirement early would be a mistake because jobless youngsters cannot simply ‘slot in’ to their vacant posts. ‘This is not the battle of generations,’ he said during a debate in Westminster yesterday. The Liberal Democrat was answering a question from Ulster MP Jim Shannon, who said that keeping people working for longer meant youngsters could not get a job. But Mr Webb said youngsters with no work experience were no substitute for mature employees who still had plenty to offer Britain’s workforce. ‘Older workers on average are very productive,’ he said. ‘If you pension off older workers early, the economy as a whole suffers.’ He added: ‘Often older workers are more experienced and highly productive. They take less time off sick.’ Previous efforts to reduce youth unemployment by retiring workers early have had no major impact, claimed Mr Webb. Early in 1977, the Labour government introduced a ‘work release scheme’ to encourage those aged 59 to retire. The measure was then extended to men over 60 in 1983 by a Conservative government with the aim of taking tens of thousands off the dole queue, but the move made no difference to the figures, said Mr Webb. ‘All it did was stick lots of men in their early 60s on benefit,’ he said. ‘It did nothing for youth unemployment.’ Mr Webb said studies showed there is ‘no evidence that the younger workforce benefits if you pension off older workers’. He cited a study by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies, which showed that there was ‘no evidence of long-term crowding-out of younger individuals’ by the over-50s. Experienced: Mr Webb cited a study which said older workers were better at complicated tasks . Surveys by charities show that older workers often face discrimination by employers who fear they will be slower and take more time off to recover from illness. But a study for the charity Age UK by the University of Essex revealed that older workers showed ‘little sign of a decline in overall productivity because older workers compensated with skills and experience’. The report concluded that ‘while bottom line speed may deteriorate, overall efficacy offsets any impact to productivity’. ‘Younger people might be typically faster at carrying out repetitive tasks [but], in comparison older people are often faster at carrying out complex tasks that allow them to draw on their contextual knowledge and years of work experience,’ the research concluded. A separate study of German workers at a Mercedes Benz car plant found that older workers were more productive and less prone to errors than their younger counterparts. Car maker BMW also set up a production line staffed only by older employees and found productivity went up 7 per cent in the first year. The study also found that older people took fewer short-term absences. But when they were absent on sick leave, it was for longer. Similarly, older people were found to have fewer but more serious accidents at work. Researchers discovered that mature staff were motivated and as willing to work as flexibly as younger workers. Ros Altmann, a former adviser to the Treasury, said: ‘Keeping people in the workforce for as long as possible is good for the economy. ‘Once an older person loses their job, it can be nearly impossible for them to find a new one. ‘Yet all the evidence shows that older people are more productive, more loyal and have more useful experience in the workforce than younger people.’ She said ministers should do more to encourage older workers to stay on – at least in part-time roles – and even to retrain if necessary.","Lib Dem Steve Webb defended the role of more experienced staff .

A stolen Jack Russell missing for four years has been reunited with her owner after Sir Bruce Forsyth's campaign stepped in to help. Jackie Barozzi's dog, Biba, was stolen from her Berkshire home in July 2009, soon after having puppies. In August this year, Biba was found hundreds of miles away in Salford, Manchester, living with a new family who were unwilling to give her back. So Jackie enlisted the help of Sir Bruce's daughter, Debbie Matthews, to fight her case and the pair have now been reunited. Scroll down for video . Overjoyed: Jackie Barozzi (pictured) is reunited with her Jack Russell, Biba, after she went missing four years ago. Bruce Forsyth's Vets Get Scanning campaign helped fight her case . Flu: Sir Bruce's daughter Debbie confirmed her father is 'feeling much better' after a recent bout of ill health. He backs the appeal which aims to get all vets to routinely scan for microchips . Unbeknownst to Jackie, Biba had been adopted by a new owner in Salford and in August she went missing from her new home. The dog was picked up by a warden who got in touch to say eight-year-old Biba had been found and identified as Jackie's pet by her microchip. However Jackie's joy soon turned to despair when her pup was returned to someone else who proved they owned her with photographs. Thames Valley Police had asked Manchester officers to seize her. However, . an officer from Greater Manchester Police visited Biba’s new home - . where she was known as Lucky - and decided she was well cared for and . happy. Incredibly, Biba wandered off for a second time within a month and this time Manchester City Council’s warden picked her up. Once again Jackie was contacted and for a second time the erstwhile owner tried to claim Biba back. This time Debbie Matthews, Sir Bruce’s eldest daughter, quick-stepped in to end the agony. Her campaign, Vets Get Scanning, aims to reunite stolen and lost dogs with their owners. In a strongly worded email to the council she pointed out that Biba was ‘stolen goods’, backing up her claim with a crime number from Thames Valley Police. Debbie also told them that Biba had twice been found wandering without a collar, contrary to the law. The dog warden quickly decided Jackie was the dog’s rightful owner. Campaign: Debbie Matthews pictured with her father Bruce Forsyth, husband Richard Matthews and her two dogs Widget and Gizmo. She set up the Vets Get Scanning appeal after her Yorkshire Terriers were stolen from her car in May 2006. Although she was reunited with them within a week she was horrified to discover that many vets did not scan animals to find out if they already had owners . Divorced mother-of-four Jackie said: ‘I . don’t know what I would have done without Debbie. Thanks to her, I have . my dog back safe and sound.’ Debbie said: ‘Justice at last has been done, albeit in a roundabout way. 'But . we need to make sure that returning a lost dog to its owner via . microchip is standard operational procedure for councils, rescues and . vets.’ Debbie, 58, added: ‘At some stage the new owners would have taken Biba to the vet. If she had been routinely scanned it would have saved everybody heartbreak. 'We all think scanning is happening after having our dogs microchipped and it is not.’ Jackie (left) was reunited with her dog Biba after Manchester City Council's dog warden found her wandering . Jackie had been bracing herself for court action before Debbie and the Sir Bruce-backed appeal weighed in. Debbie . explained: ‘Why should you have to wait for seven days to get your dog . back in case another owner comes forward when your data is in the . microchip?’ Debbie, who has confirmed her father is feeling much better, began campaigning seven years ago after Yorkshire terriers, Gizmo and Widget, were stolen from her car while she was shopping in Camberley, Surrey. Although she was reunited with them within a week she was horrified to discover that many vets did not scan animals to find out if they already had owners. Waiting: Biba had been picked up by Manchester City Council's dog warden once before but given to a different person after they proved ownership with photographs. Jackie had been preparing for court action to get her dog back . An estimated 3,000 dogs are stolen each year and many are sold on to new owners. By 2016 microchipping will be a legal requirement but Trevor Cooper, a solicitor specialising in dog law, confirmed that at the moment microchipping was not proof of ownership. In cases where possession was disputed, a civil case before the small claims court would decide a dog’s future. A judge would consider the merits of the microchip against other evidence, including who has cared for the dog and paid veterinary charges. The court would then act in the best interests of the dog. The legal terms regarding micro-chipping in three years time had not yet been defined, he added. The Vets Get Scanning campaign aims to get all vets to routinely scan dogs for microchips on their first visit. This, they hope, will stop stolen dogs sold on to unsuspecting owners being lost forever. With her father’s help, Debbie runs a busy national ‘lost and found’ Facebook page that backs microchipping and highlights its importance. She also speaks publicly about the issue. Sir Bruce, who has lent his name to her campaign along with a host of other celebrities, is a lifelong dog fan. ‘He is 100 per cent behind this,’ said Debbie. Debbie said two Jack Russells taken from a neighbour’s home at the same time as Biba have still not been found.","Jackie Barozzi's dog, Biba, was stolen from her home in Berkshire in 2009 .

But bosses Great Newsome Brewery in South Frodingham, East Yorkshire, admit the prestigious accolade was a double shock, because they could not remember entering, . Great Newsome Brewery Director, Matthew Hodgson, said: 'I am still pinching myself. 'It's been a bit of a shock and we have all been very surprised. 'It comes after six years of very hard work so it's incredibly rewarding.' The family-run brewery put forward two of their beers to the competition, but actually forgot they had entered until they found out they had won. 'We have been going for six and a half years and we are a small family business but have been growing ever since, Mr Hodgson said.

It was set up following extensive research on the local and regional real ale market and peoples growing awareness of locally produced food and drink. Keeping with the family tradition the brewery proudly boasts the English Springer Spaniel Jem as their logo.

She became a popular feature of the brewery until she passed away at the age of 14 in 2010. To commemorate her life, the Hodgson family named April's seasonal ale after her, as it was brewed on the day she died. Each was blind-tasted by a panel of carefully selected judges under the guidance of respected beer writer and journalist Roger Protz. Judges commented on the orange notes of the palate and the sour start and smooth malts Frothingham Best has. They also described a good sweet bitter balance and good bitter finish. Matthew said: 'The secret is trying to be as consistent as possible. 'There are lots of small breweries around and we have really tried to be as good as we can be and listen to what out customers say. 'Our head brewer was on holiday when we won the title so it was great news to tell him. 'We're a close knit team so it was a great achievement for all of us. We are all chuffed to bits with it.'

Well-earned drink: Matthew Hodgson pours some beer, which beat competition from all over the world to win top prize . 'It's the best beer for people who haven't had our beers before or for those who don't drink a huge amount of real ale,' Matthew added. 'We get a lot of interest from the USA due to our unusual names and during the Olympics people asked us to send it to where they were staying.

High school sports players in Kentucky have been banned from conducting post-game handshakes unless they are ‘properly supervised’ because of too many physical confrontations. The state’s athletic sanctioning body, Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA), posted the directive on their website on Tuesday following more than two dozen post-game tussles in the past three years. The body’s commissioner, Julian Tackett, did not mention specific fights or conflicts but said several sports have had post-game incidents. No more handshakes: Kentucky sports teams have been banned from engaging in organised post-game handshaking with the opposite team due to too many fights . Do it at own risk: Schools are told they can continue doing the ritual, but that they will be penalised if fights break out . 'Disappointing': Kentucky High School Athletic Association Commissioner, Julian Tackett, said over two dozen incidents have happened during post-game handshakes in three years . In the directive, he said: ‘Don’t do it, unless you can properly supervise it. And if you don’t supervise it, or if you do and problems occur, then you will be held accountable.’ He said all sports have had problems over the years but cited a fight between volleyball players this fall as one example. The organisation, which also instructed game officials to immediately leave facilities after contests or risk being penalised, said it was ‘disappointing’ to take such action but that it had become necessary. ‘Henceforth, any incidents by an individual squad member (including coaches) or group of squad members that results in unsporting acts immediately following the contest will result in a penalty against the member school athletic program, and additional penalties against the individuals or schools as deemed appropriate following investigation,’ said Tackett. Teams can choose to ignore the order, but those who do must supervise the activity and report any incidents to KHSAA. Member schools or coaches that engage in unsportsmanlike behaviour will be fined and penalised. ‘Sportsmanship and civility remain hallmark values,’ said Tackett. ‘It is my hope that all schools can provide the proper supervision and accountability to continue these types of activities. But if they can’t, then stop doing them.’ He said there was no penalty for continuing post-game handshakes, but that ‘if you don't do it right, you're going to be held accountable’. No more: High school football players are told not to give handshakes to their opposing teams to avoid fights breaking out . 'Penalised': Game officials are also instructed to immediately leave facilities after contests or risk being fined . Brian Durban, varsity coach for Olden County High School Boys Soccer, told Fox News that sportsmanship was 'the most important thing you can teach'. The . coach has devised a plan to get around the new directive: 'If we can't . shake our hand after the game, we can shake before the game.' With the state football playoffs just around the corner and the possibility of players shaking hands after an emotionally-charged elimination game, the directive was implemented to make schools take responsibility for conduct or not performing a ritual of sportsmanship. 'Good luck': Brian Durban, varsity coach for Olden County High School Boys Soccer, said his teams are now having to shake hands before the game instead . Volleyball fights: The commissioner mentioned Volleyball as one of the sports where incidents have happened post-game . ‘Unfortunately, for whatever reason, all involved in contests seem to be more aggressive immediately after the contests are concluded and winning with honour and dignity, and losing the same way, doesn’t seem to be being instilled across the board,’ he said. ‘If you have 75 players shaking hands,’ Tackett said, ‘you'd better watch what's going on.’ Not everyone agrees with the directive, with some people taking to Twitter to complain. One comment from a Twitter user, Jenny Toth, says, ‘how about suspending the fighters instead?’ Todd Robertson, another Twitter user, posted: ‘As a HS coach I cannot say how ridiculous and object more to the new @KHSAA policy is banning post game handshakes.

Prisoners have been sent letters politely informing them not to take drugs and asking why inmates want to escape. Bosses at Ford Open prison admitted in a letter there had been an 'increase' of Class A drugs and reminded them of the 'risks' of taking them. Local MP Nick Gibb said officials need to be tougher on drug use inside the prison and said residents expect a 'zero tolerance' approach. Ford Open prison bosses have written to inmates to ask why they abscond and to warn them about drug use . He told Mail Online that there are known 'drop zones' around the Category D prison, which is next to the small Sussex village of Climping. Prison security chief Esther Dainton wrote to inmates saying: 'We would like to take this opportunity to alert offenders as to the obvious risks both to those using drugs and those who may be in the vicinity whilst others are under the influence.' In a separate letter inmates were asked why people wanted to abscond from the open prison in Arundel. The institution has a history of escaped prisoners and in July convicted murderer and burglar Paul Flint went on the run after walking out of the facility. He was not rearrested until last month. Local MP Nick Gibb said residents expect a 'zero tolerance' approach to drugs and alcohol at Ford . Ford governor Sharon Jefcut said there had been a 'slight increase' in the number of inmates absconding from the prison. In a letter published by The Sun, she wrote: 'As a Senior Management Team we would be interested in what your views and perceptions are as to why offenders choose to abscond.' She did warn that those who absconded faced additional time in custody. The prison holds about 500 inmates, including serious offenders. It has previously housed Learco Chindamo, who was jailed for stabbing headmaster Philip Lawrence in 1995, and George Best following his 1984 conviction for drink-driving and assaulting a police officer. Last year a report on Ford by the chief inspector of prisons found that a third of inmates said it was 'easy to get drugs in the prison'. Twenty five prisoners had absconded in 2011 and 13 in the early part of 2012. The inspectorate said it was good practice for bosses to ask prisoners for information about absconding. However, Mr Gibb said people will be appalled at the seemingly gentle approach taken. He said: 'They will want officials to be tougher and firmer in terms of drugs policies, and not just hard drugs. 'It should be very clear and say that if they find you in possession of any drug you should simply go into closed conditions. 'Absconding itself presents risks and people disappear into the countryside.' The Category D prison has previously housed convicted killer Learco Chindamo (left) and George Best (right) In 2011, inmates started a riot in the prison after they were ordered to undergo breathalyser tests and several buildings were set on fire. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: 'We take the illicit use of drugs in prisons very seriously and offenders are made well aware that anyone caught with prohibited items will face swift and decisive punishment. 'This can include having days added to their sentence, being transferred to a different prison and losing privileges.'","Ford open prison bosses asked for inmate's views on why some abscond .

Dead: FBI agents shot and killed Jim DiMaggio after they discovered him with Hannah in Idaho . An Idaho coroner says kidnapping suspect James Lee DiMaggio died after being hit by six gunshots fired by FBI agents during a rescue in the wilderness this summer. Valley County Coroner Nathan Hess confirmed on Tuesday that the multiple gunshot wounds to DiMaggio's head, chest and extremities were the cause of death of the 40-year-old California man. DiMaggio died on August 10 after his campsite was spotted in the vast Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. He became the focus of a massive manhunt for abducting 16-year-old Hannah Anderson and killing her brother Ethan and her mother Christina at DiMaggio's home about 65 miles east of San Diego. Hannah Anderson was rescued. The final autopsy is pending a toxicology report. The death has also been classified as a homicide. Hannah Anderson, meanwhile, is set . to speak for the first time about her terrifying ordeal where . her captor allegedly zip-tied her, forced the teenager to play Russian roulette . then murdered her mother and brother. The 16-year-old from California says she feels 'shocked, sick and angry' following her abduction. The teenager spoke to the Today . show with her father in an interview to air on Thursday. She traveled . to New York for the taping from which she excitedly posted pictures on . her Instagram account, including several close-ups of Miley Cyrus' live . performance. Miss Anderson told presenter Savannah Guthrie that things took a horrifying turn when DiMaggio brought her to his home on August 3. DiMaggio handcuffed and zip-tied her feet, telling her in detail how he was going to abduct her and take her to Idaho. The schoolgirl added that her role was to carry her kidnapper's backpacks and that he would 'get me home afterwards'. The teenager has regularly posted to her public Instagram account in the wake of her mother and brother's tragic deaths. She added this picture on Monday from the airport in New York . The teenager described her fear when DiMaggio forced her to play a game of Russian roulette with a gun while her mother and brother were in the house. When she started to cry, he said they could stop the game. Her mother and little brother were killed when DiMaggio's house burst into flames after he rigged it with explosives. One of the riders who alerted authorities after coming across the teenage girl and her captor in the wilderness told the Today Show that there was 'pure fear' in the girl's eyes. Happier times: Hannah Anderson posted this picture of her with her boyfriend to Instagram . During her short trip to New York City this week, the San Diego school girl updated her followers on Instagram with pictures of her hotel room and a montage of photos and video clips of Miley Cyrus. She told the followers that she got a hug from the singer. The teenager paid tribute to her little brother Ethan on Monday on what would have been his 9th birthday. As part of a longer message, the grieving teenager wrote: 'Sorry for blowing up your instas but I wanna say happy birthday to little E. 'Today he would have turned 9.

Cadillac unveiled its new, revamped Escalade on Monday night in New York and in addition to a slick new look, General Motors also managed to tack an inch or two onto the already hulking SUV. GM hopes the new look and feel of the once proud king of luxury sport utility vehicles in America will help Cadillac get back its crown. They’ve also added new theft prevention technology to the $70,000 SUV. The move comes just as the vehicle has finally shed its dubious reputation as America’s most stolen vehicle and as Cadillac sales in general begin to recover from a recession era slump. Scroll down for video . Revamped: The 2015 Cadillac Escalade has been given a new look and some extra inches as GM looks to corner America's rebounding luxury SUV market . ‘The 2015 Escalade is completely new and elevated in design and technology, inside and out. The clear objective is to once again assume the leadership position among luxury SUVs,’ said senior VP Bob Ferguson in a statement. One way in which the Escalade is new is in size. Already one of the largest SUVs, Cadillac has added an inch and a half to both its ESV model and the standard Escalade. According to the Detroit Free Press, sales at Cadillac have risen 29 percent this year from the first nine months of 2012. While the Escalade makes up only 12.3% of luxury SUV sales versus American market leader Mercedes-Benz’s 44.4 percent, market analysts say the 2015 model could start to tip the balance.

Beaming: The new Escalade has made its signature skinny headlights even skinnier than the 2014 model (left) by adding high tech LED lamps to the 2015 model (right) ‘[It] leaves no doubt that the brand is staying on its course of providing a big, bold SUV to its luxury customers with no excuses. The vehicle is more powerful than ever, yet offers better fuel economy, and it is filled with electronic driver aids that should improve its already impressive safety record,’ Jack Nerad, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book, told USA Today. Cadillac intends to aid drivers while they’re not even driving, with new theft-prevention technology designed to make sure the SUV doesn’t slide back into first place as America’s most commonly stolen car—SUV or otherwise.

Specifically, they’ve focused on refining the vehicle’s signature deluxe interiors even further. ‘It’s a very rich-looking interior,’ Nerad said. ‘It seems ergonomically excellent, and at the same time it’s luxurious and looks rich.’ The 2015 also comes standard with the Cadillac User Experience touchscreen, heated and cooled front seats, and the market segment’s only front-center side airbag. The Escalade goes into production next spring and is expected to MSRP close to today’s starting price of $67,970.","The Escalade was until recently America's most stolen vehicle .

The first person to buy a house for £1 in a scheme designed to breathe life back into deserted neighbourhoods received the keys to his new home today. The Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, handed over the keys to Jayalal Madde, 48, who is the first applicant to be allocated a house under the city council's pilot scheme to sell 20 of its properties for just £1 each. Mr Madde, a self-employed taxi driver, who lives in Toxteth with his wife and two daughters, aged 10 and 12, bought a terraced house in Cairns Street, Granby. Jayalal Madde stands in the living room of the house he bought for just £1 as part of a scheme to breathe life into deserted neighbourhoods in Liverpool . Mr Madde and his family are now responsible for refurbishing the run-down house which is likely to cost about £35,000 . Mr Madde raised the money to refurbish the derelict house (pictured) through a local credit union . He has raised the money for the refurbishments - expected to cost up to £35,000 - from his local trade union. Once the house is brought up to the Decent Homes Standard he and his family can move in. The taxi driver is one of an initial 10 people who are being contacted by the city council this week to confirm they have been successful in getting a home for £1. More than 1,000 people applied for one of the 20 properties in the Granby Four Streets, Arnside Road and Webster Triangle East areas of the city. Mr Anderson said: 'I'm delighted to be officially handing over the keys to the first recipient of a home for £1. 'We've had an amazing response to this scheme and have been absolutely inundated with applications, so to already be in a position to allocate the first 10 homes is fantastic. 'Everything we are doing is about building a sustainable future for our neighbourhoods - and we've placed that at the heart of the decisions we've made when looking at the applications. Taxi driver Jayalal Madde, pictured with his wife Chami and daughters Sanali (left) and Sansali (right) were the first of 10 successful applicants to pick up the keys to their £1 home . Liverpool City Council Mayor Joe Anderson, pictured left, said he was 'delighted' to hand over the keys . 'We are only looking for people who have a genuine commitment to bringing these properties back to life and turning them into a home they are proud to live in. 'We're confident that Mr Madde is one such individual.' The decision to sell the houses for £1 came after months of delays caused by the council's decision to break off talks with developer Leader1. The firm had been in line to redevelop hundreds of homes in the 'Granby Triangle' but city leaders pulled the £25 million tender after the company failed to meet deadlines. Residents are expected to refurbish their house to Decent Home Standard, which means it must be in a reasonable state of repair, be warm, weatherproof and have reasonably modern facilities. The Madde family hope to move into their new home within a year once it has been brought up to standard . The pilot scheme in Cairns Street (pictured) is part of the council's promise to bring 1,000 homes into use . The Mayor added: 'It mustn't be forgotten that bringing these houses up to a decent standard will be a real challenge. 'Those who are successful in obtaining a house will have to put in a lot of hard work, as well as their own finances. 'But we'll be there to support them in any way we can. Properties in these areas have lain empty for too long - but in tough economic times, we need to be creative and look at doing things differently.' This pilot scheme forms part of the city council's commitment to bring 1,000 empty properties back into use across the city, and help as many local people as possible get on the property ladder. When the initiative was launched in April, the city council set out strict criteria, with applicants required to live or work in Liverpool, be a first-time buyer and to be employed. Successful applicants must also agree to live in the property for a minimum of five years and not sub-let it within that time.","Taxi driver Jayalal Madde, 48, is the first applicant to pick up the keys .

Wants an outright ban: Siv Jensen, leader of Norway's Progress Party, says a national ban on begging is 'the best way' to reduce the number of Roma on the streets . Norway's new leadership is urging councils across the country to ban begging on the streets as it tries to force Roma immigrants out of the country and tackle rising crime. The Conservative-Progress Party coalition government said in a joint statement on Monday, they will 'allow municipalities to impose a ban on begging in their local police regulations, in order to combat human trafficking and other organised crime'. The statement comes shortly after the formation of the new government and is in line with, but still falls short of, the Progress Party's manifesto to ban it altogether . Leader of the party, Siv Jenson, told The Local before the election that a national ban on begging was 'the best way' to reduce the number of Roma on the streets. She told the English language news service: 'The Conservative Party and the Progress Party have a proposal to ban begging in the streets, because that would be quite efficient we think.' She said that the problem was far greater than people simply begging in the streets and extended to increasing rates of petty crime. 'We see this throughout the country and its growing, and its growing rapidly,' she said. Increasing problems surrounding Roma immigrants have been reported across Europe. In Paris this week, gangs were filmed working together to rob unsuspecting people at cash points. Police in the French capital also believe an organised crime gang from Roma are responsible for an axe-wielding heist of a jewellery store at the weekend, in which £1million worth of Swiss watches were stolen. Five Eastern Europeans have been arrested. Roma gypsies are known to frequently set up camp in some of the most exclusive London addresses and police are routinely removing them from Park Lane and leafy squares around Mayfair and Oxford Street. Increasing numbers of Roma immigrants have been blamed for petty street crime in city's across Europe. Jensen claims they are also central to increasing rates of serious crimes such as people trafficking and organsied crimes . In London, police repeatedly have to move Roma rough sleepers from the streets. Recently they have been found in Mayfair, Marble Arch and Oxford Street . They are known to beg, which has been theoretically illegal in the UK since 1824, but are also blamed for increases in petty crime such as theft of cash and mobile phones. Even Romania's prime minister, Victor Ponta, has admitted that Roma crime is a problem in Britain and said it was 'fair' that David Cameron plans to tighten laws that allow migrants to claim benefits.

A California appeals courts has ruled that spanking a child with a wooden spoon is not abuse, setting an surprising legal precedent. The 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose yesterday reversed the child abuse determination made by the Santa Clara County Department of Social Services against Veronica Gonzalez, who whacked her daughter so hard with the cooking utensil she caused bruising. 'We cannot say that the use of a wooden spoon to administer a spanking necessarily exceeds the bounds of reasonable parental discipline,' Justice Conrad Rushing wrote for the unanimous three-judge panel. Spanking: The 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose, pictured, yesterday ruled that spanking a child with a wooden spoon is not abuse, setting an surprising legal precedent . Social workers wanted to report the South Bay mother to the state Department of Justice's child abuse database with a 'substantiated' abuse determination. That determination was upheld by a trial court judge. However, while the appeals court said the spanking came close to abuse, it ruled that social workers and the lower court judge failed to consider the family's entire circumstances. Gonzalez and her husband testified that other forms of punishment such as groundings and taking away her phone had failed to persuade their 12-year-old daughter to do her schoolwork. They said she as increasingly 'boy crazy' and had developed a growing interest in gangs. The parents said other family members had testified that spankings in the household were a rarity but the implement was used in the April 2010 incident after the girl failed to come home until late at night. Weapon: Veronica Gonzalez whacked her daughter so hard with a wooden spoon, like that pictured, she caused bruising (stock photo) The appeals court said the mother's growing frustration with her daughter's behavior and her intention not to inflict harm in the spanking weighed heavily in its ruling. 'Nothing in the record suggests the mother should have known she was inflicting bruises,' Rushing wrote. Rushing continued that 'the spanking was entirely the product of a genuine and deliberate disciplinary purpose, i.e., to arrest troubling behavior patterns exhibited by the daughter.' The court ordered the child abuse report to be withdrawn or Gonzalez given another hearing in which the San Jose family's entire circumstances are considered and the spanking put into context with the parents' growing frustration with a recalcitrant daughter.","The 6th District Court of Appeal in San Jose yesterday reversed the child abuse determination made social services against Veronica Gonzalez .

From striking the right balance between being informative and smug, to tracking down stamps and locating a postbox, sending a postcard can seem like a chore to holiday makers wanting to get away from it all. But a new smartphone app claims to enable lazy sun worshipers to send postcards to their friends and family without having to leave their sun loungers. The app allows a user to upload their own scenic photo for the front of the card and type a message that will be printed onto the back. Wish you were here: A new app called Ps Postcards has been invented that will send postcards for lazy holidaymakers who struggle to find the time themselves . Once completed, the virtual postcard is sent to a 'mailroom' of the company, which is based in Britain, where a real paper version is created and posted to the desired recipient. The app, called Ps Postcards, could halt the demise in the trend of people sending postcards while on holiday as research has shown that just 16 per cent of the population now send postcards regularly while holidaying. The app is the brainchild of Fionn Concannon, 33, from Queen's Park, north west London, who says he aptly came up with the idea when he came back from a holiday. The app allows a user to upload their own photo (pictured left) or choose from a range of per-loaded pictures for the front of the card and write a message (pictured right) that will be printed onto the back of the postcard . 'I really like people sending me postcards but when I try to write them for other people I always end up coming back with them in my bag because I hadn't been bothered to write and send them,' he said. 'I heard of people who normally don't manage to find a stamp or can't find a postbox and eventually end up just giving them to their family and friends when they arrive home. Mr Concannon set out to find an easier way to send the cards and came up with his iPhone app, which allows people to create and send a postcard from anywhere in the world with an internet connection. Once the picture has been chosen and the message written, the virtual postcard (pictured) is sent to a 'mailroom' of the company, which is based in Britain, where a real paper version is created and posted to the desired recipient . 'All they have to do is upload a picture, enter their text and send it off, and we will print it out in the UK and post it to wherever they want it to go,' he said. 'It's perfect for people who are travelling around, to show grandparents photographs, and for those who prefer something physical instead of an email.'

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 10:41 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:12 EST, 9 October 2013 . Artist Graham Ovenden, who avoided prison after being found guilty of sex offences against children, was jailed for two years and three months by Court of Appeal judges today when they ruled that his non-custodial sentence was 'unduly lenient'. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, sitting with two other judges in London, quashed the suspended sentence imposed in June in the case of Graham Ovenden, 70, of Barley Splatt near Bodmin Moor in Cornwall. Ovenden, who was accused of abusing children who posed for his paintings in the 70s and 80s, originally received 12 months imprisonment suspended for two years at Plymouth Crown Court, but the sentence was referred to appeal judges by Attorney General Dominic Grieve. Ovenden, who was present in court for the hearing, was convicted of six charges of indecency with a child and one allegation of indecent assault relating to three girls . As well as the sentence review, the judges also heard a bid by Ovenden, who had denied the charges against him, to challenge his conviction. But the court rejected the application for permission to appeal, ruling that the verdicts were 'safe'. Ovenden, who was present in court for the hearing, was convicted of six charges of indecency with a child and one allegation of indecent assault relating to three girls. Lord Thomas, who said Ovenden had not shown a 'shred of remorse' for his victims, ruled that the sentence should not have been suspended and the correct total to be imposed today was a term of 27 months. Ovenden claimed that his interest in young girls was artistic and not sexual - but that claim was rejected by the three judges. Lord Thomas said the girls had 'no understanding of the true purpose' behind what Ovenden was doing. Lord Thomas said Ovenden had shown 'no contrition' BY maintaining that he had done nothing wrong . 'There was no doubt that his purpose was sexual. There is no doubt that he had a sexual interest in children.' When . considering the appropriate sentence the court had to have regard to . the fact that the only mitigation Ovenden had was his former good . character and his age. Lord Thomas added that against that 'there are a very large number of aggravating factors'. Those . factors included the 'comparison in age between the victims and his own . age at the time the offences were committed' and the number of victims. But the 'most serious' was the 'very serious abuse of the position of trust' that he had in relation to the girls. His reputation as a landscape artist enabled those who were closest to the children to trust him, said Lord Thomas. There . was also the factor of the 'very serious impact on the victims, . magnified by the way in which he had grossly manipulated them and . degraded them by the photographs he had taken'. Lord Thomas said the court had seen victim impact statements from the three victims in which they described how giving evidence at Ovenden's trial was the worst experience of their lives. When suspending the prison term, the sentencing judge said he took into account Ovenden's age, the length of time since the offences, and his 'steep fall from grace and irretrievably tarnished reputation'. It was argued on behalf of the Attorney General that 'reputational impact' on him was not a reason for suspending the sentence and it was 'wrong in principle' to take that into account. Exceptional circumstances were required for a sentence to be suspended. Lord Thomas said Ovenden had shown 'no contrition', maintaining that he had done nothing wrong, and that as an artist he seeks to 'capture the innocence of children in a state of grace'. He claimed he was the victim of a 'global witch-hunt against artists'. Ovenden claimed that his interest in young girls was artistic and not sexual . Lord Thomas said: 'He seeks to blame others and asserts a conspiracy against him. It is self-evident he has no understanding of the very serious harm he has done to the victims by his serious criminal misconduct. 'He still asserts that art is being put on trial. That is nonsensical bearing in mind the facts.' Speaking after the hearing, the Attorney General said: 'Graham Ovenden committed terrible sexual offences against vulnerable young girls who were in his charge and ought to have felt safe. He manipulated them and abused his position of trust. 'The Court of Appeal agrees that the 12-month suspended sentence handed to him was unduly lenient, and I am satisfied they have replaced it with 27 months custody. 'It is right that sexual crimes, whether committed many years ago or more recently, should be punished appropriately. 'Today the court affirmed this and sent a clear message that people who have behaved in this way in the past will face the consequences through the courts.' Under the early tutelage of the 'godfather of Pop Art' Sir Peter Blake, Ovenden embarked on a career which catalogued life on the streets of London, landscapes of the countryside, and portraiture of children. He had been tutored by Lord David Cecil and Sir John Betjeman, with his work displayed across the world including exhibitions at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, The Tate and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. In 1975 he founded the Brotherhood of Ruralists movement - artists who had left the city to live in the countryside.","Committee quashed suspended sentence in the case of Graham Ovenden .

A man survived after being struck by lightning during a storm thanks to his rubber-soled slippers, which stopped the electricity passing through his body. Greg Slater was hit by a lightning bolt after he went outside with an umbrella to check a leaky gutter at his home near St Austell, Cornwall. However, he escaped unhurt and did not even know anything had happened until his wife told him she had seen him showered in electrical sparks. The 43-year-old father of two could have been seriously injured or even died if he had not been wearing rubber soles. Lucky escape: Greg Slater was saved by his slippers after he went outside in a storm carrying an umbrella . Danger: The father of two was checking a leaky gutter during a thunderstorm at the time of the incident . His lucky escape came during a storm over the hamlet of Higher Porthpean last week, when 'ball lightning' apparently struck him. Other villagers reported seeing the flash of light, which destroyed circuit boards and caused an explosion so loud it could be heard in the next village. One local even witnessed a lightning bolt jump across his kitchen after entering his house via the Aga. 'I thought I'd nip out and see where our gutters have been leaking, so I ran outside with a big umbrella and was leaning back looking up towards the gutter when a hole literally opened in the sky above me,' said Mr Slater, a development manager for Cornwall Council. Destruction: A telephone socket was burned out when Mr Salter's house was hit by ball lightning . Home: Neighbours of Mr Slater in Higher Porthpean, Cornwall saw the lightning flash too . 'It had been a totally grey clouded sky and this small area momentarily opened up and then there was the most almighty bang and flash of light. 'I was rooted to the spot for a few seconds before going into the house. I thought the cottage had been struck by lightning, but it was only when I saw my wife who was in total shock that I realised I had been hit by lightning. 'My wife had been looking out of the window and had seen me just showered from head to toe in white. She said the lightning had gone down my umbrella to the ground. 'To have been completely unharmed by it is really a chance in a million. I was thanking my lucky stars - and slippers.' Mr Slater thinks he was hit by ball lightning, a mysterious phenomenon which occurs during thunderstorms as a ball of electricity reaches the ground and explodes, leaving a sulphurous stink. Grateful: The council worker could have been seriously hurt without the help of his slippers . 'I saw this ball of light then there was the most almighty bang,' he said. 'The village just had this incredible smell of sulphur. 'Afterwards I noticed that my neck and shoulders were very stiff and sections of my legs and arms were in spasms and felt really tight. 'They also went cold and tingled and I felt pretty hyperactive afterwards. I felt like I was literally buzzing.' He added: 'My father, who was a physics teacher, thinks the fact that the umbrella and I were wet allowed the charge to pass down the outside of me. All I can say is thank the Lord I had rubber-soled slippers on. 'People need to realise that they need to take these ever more frequent extreme weather events seriously, and to believe the old wives' tale about lightning and umbrellas.'","Greg Slater, 43, went outside with an umbrella during a thunderstorm .
