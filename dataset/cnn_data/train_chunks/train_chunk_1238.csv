"A man convicted of murder in the 1978 shooting death of a Southern California man could be free within a week after 36 years behind bars. Michael Hanline, who is now 69, could be released after it emerged crucial DNA analysis and investigative reports were withheld from his original trial. It saw local prosecutors re-examine the evidence and on Wednesday,a judge overturned the 1978 conviction. The California Innocence Project, which worked to win the freedom of Mr Hanline, say their case represents the oldest conviction ever reversed in state history. Ready to leave: Michael Hanline, 68, was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1980 over the death of JT McGarry but new DNA evidence has come to light that put his original conviction in doubt . The shooting death of truck driver J.T. McGarry that led to Hanline's 1980 conviction and his bid for exoneration has been a complicated case to unravel, said Ventura County special assistant district attorney Michael Schwartz. Prosecutors are still investigating who might have killed McGarry, who had ties to a motorcycle gang, he said. McGarry, a Ventura resident who also used the name Michael Mathers, dealt in drugs and ran motorcycle-oriented swap meets for the publishers of Easyriders magazine, according to court papers. He went missing on November 10, 1978, and was found shot to death two days later by a highway. Hanline, who was romantically involved with McGarry's ex-girlfriend, was arrested on an unrelated charge that month after traveling to Northern California and using McGarry's credit card, court papers stated. He was charged with murder by prosecutors who suggested his motive was jealousy over McGarry's on-again, off-again relationship with the ex-girlfriend. 40 years ago: This 1974 photo shows Michael Hanline with his then girlfriend and now wife, Sandee. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. DNA analysis was not conducted at the scene where McGarry's body was discovered because the technology did not exist then. But Ventura County prosecutors said in court papers an analysis this year found the DNA profile of an unidentified male, not Hanline. In addition, evidence that should have been disclosed to Hanline during the trial was withheld from him. Special Assistant District Attorney Michael Schwartz said 'flaws in the trial and the totality of evidence cast sufficient doubt to warrant vacating the jury's guilty verdict.' Ventura County Superior Court Judge Donald Coleman last week ordered Hanline to return to court on November 24 for a hearing, where he will be released on bail based on the DNA tests and investigative reports prosecutors said should have been turned over to defense attorneys in his trial. 'The documents withheld by the government during Mike Hanline's trial and the DNA testing point to another suspect,' Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence Project, said in an email. The DA's office will conduct an investigation and decide whether or not to retry him. Schwartz said that while Hanline's conviction is vacated, prosecutors 'have not concluded that he's factually innocent.' 'It's possible that Hanline did it, but we're not confident enough at this point that he's guilty to justify keeping him in prison,' Schwartz said. The California Innocence Project, which took up the case in 1999, says Hanline's case was the longest wrongful incarceration in state history. 'It's amazing that Mike will finally be released after 36 years of wrongful incarceration,' said Justin Brooks, the director of the project at California Western School of Law. 'It's time for him to get back to his family and his life.'","Michael Hanline was serving life without parole for killing JT McGarry .

"As many as 10,000 patients a year are dying due to poor NHS care, the head of the health service watchdog has warned. David Prior, chairman of the Care Quality Commission, said standards across the country were ‘dangerously variable’. He said there were anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 avoidable deaths a year in hospitals alone, not counting those which occur due to failings by GPs. David Prior, chair of the Care Quality Commission warned that NHS standards were 'dangerously variable' Mr Prior, who took up his post in January 2013, said the NHS must change its culture to ensure there is ‘no hiding place’ for inadequate doctors. The watchdog is currently carrying out spot checks on every GP surgery, hospital and care home in England – which could lead to the worst being shut down. It has promised the inspections will be more rigorous than before and each organisation will be given an Ofsted-style rating of ‘outstanding’, ‘good’, ‘needs improvement’ or ‘inadequate’. Mr Prior, a former Tory MP and party chairman, said: ‘Standards of care are highly variable, sometimes dangerously so. ‘We have some outstanding hospitals, we have some inadequate hospitals. And the variation in primary care between different GP practices is probably even greater. ‘This variation matters, not just because many patients receive poor care, indeed many thousands die avoidably every year. No one knows how many, but in hospitals it has been estimated to be anywhere between 3,000 and 10,000 – not a statistic that any other area of human activity would be happy with.’ Writing in The Guardian, he added: ‘Variation strikes at the heart of the NHS and its core principle that everyone should receive good quality care free at the point of delivery. In fact they do not.’ The CQC has already published its findings for the first 40 hospital trusts to be inspected and five were rated inadequate – one in eight. A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured, said poor care had been 'swept under the carpet' A study in the BMJ in 2012 warned that up to 5 per cent of all hospital deaths were avoidable, the equivalent of 12,000 a year in England. It is not the first time Mr Prior has spoken out about failings in the health service. Last year, he warned the NHS had been allowed to become so powerful under Labour that nobody dared criticise it. He also attacked his own organisation, saying in the past there had been a culture of ‘incompetence’, ‘suppression’ and ‘oppression’. Responding to Mr Prior’s comments on avoidable deaths, a spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘For too long poor care in the NHS was swept under the carpet which resulted in the tragedy we saw at Mid Staffs under the last Labour government. ‘The role of the CQC and the new chief inspectors is to root out poor care wherever they find it without fear or favour.’ Jane Cummings, chief nursing officer at NHS England, said: ‘The overwhelming majority of our patients receive great care from staff who are pulling out all the stops. ‘We do need to do more, but the quality of care is better now than at any point in the history of the NHS.’","Care Quality Commission chair David Prior issued the stark warning today .

"The mother of a seven-year-old girl recovering from cancer could face prison after allowing her to skip seven days of school. Kerry Capper, 25, said she let her daughter have the odd day off to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill – fearing the disease had returned. In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy. Scandal: Unemployed mother Kerry Capper with daughter Libby when she was diagnosed with cancer in 2009. She has kept her daughter off school over cancer fears but is being prosecuted for not sending her to classes . Redress: Kerry Capper, left, said she had apologised to the school but said they should take into account what her daughter, right, and her family have gone through in the five years since she was diagnosed with cancer . The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children’s Hospital for regular check-ups. Between . January and March this year Miss Capper kept her at home for a total of . seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget . Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham. Now . the mother has been summoned to appear before magistrates for failing . to pay a £60 penalty fine for the ‘unauthorised absence’. If she does . not pay Miss Capper, of Erdington in Birmingham, could face a . three-month jail sentence. Yesterday . she said: ‘Libby woke up saying that she’s got a sore stomach and I get . scared. I want to keep my eye on her and I kept her off school on those . days and they have sent me to court because of it. Failed to pay £60 fine: Miss Capper is set to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court (pictured) next month . ‘They . should give consideration of what I went through as a mother and when . she does say she’s ill I get really scared because we did nearly lose . her.’ But Birmingham . council said no reason was given for the time off and that Miss Capper . had failed to attend meetings to discuss the situation. The . unemployed mother claims she had run out of credit on her mobile phone . so was unable to inform the school that Libby – who had an 85 per cent . attendance record prior to the fine – would be absent. She . also says she went in on the wrong day after being invited to a meeting . by the school and accidentally missed a second date to explain the time . off. Miss Capper added: ‘I said, “Apologies, I’ve missed that . appointment”. ‘The teacher . just said, “I’m sorry, Mum, it’s getting sent to court now”. Then I got a . penalty notice of £60. But I couldn’t afford to pay that at that time.’ The fine rises to £120 if not paid within 21 days. Miss Capper’s legal team, Birmingham-based Glaisyers, said the council was being ‘heavy-handed and inflexible’. Education: The council claims Kerry Capper never gave staff at Paget Primary School (pictured) in Birmingham a reason for her daughter Libby's absences, and then failed to attend a meeting to discuss the issue . But the authority said it took a ‘robust stance’ on unexplained school absences. A . council spokesman said the school had invited Miss Capper to a meeting . ‘to talk through any issues and concerns’, adding: ‘When there was still . no response a penalty notice was issued and when this was not paid the . matter was sent to magistrates.’ Miss Capper, who will appear before Birmingham magistrates on September 5, said she is  worried about the outcome. Her . solicitor Claire Riches said: ‘We feel strongly that the council should . not have brought this case against Kerry. Every time Libby would feel . unwell her symptoms were like the time she was diagnosed with cancer and . Kerry wanted to keep an eye on her in case the cancer had returned.’ The . Government’s change to the law on school absences, in September last . year, was designed to stop families taking pupils on term-time holidays. But some parents have been penalised for children missing class to attend important events or medical appointments. In . May, Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, were warned they . could face a £1,000 fine if they took their ten-year-old daughter out of . school for her grandfather’s funeral. Hanbury’s Farm Primary School, Tamworth, told the couple the reason did not amount to ‘exceptional circumstances’.","Kerry Capper says she wanted to keep close eye on Libby Bennett .

"Cyber thieves hacked into the accounts of more than 1,000 StubHub customers and fraudulently bought tickets for events. Online criminals obtained the login details and passwords from users around the world in a scam believed to be part of an international cyber fraud ring. An international investigation involving the City of London Police, U.S. Secret Service and Canadian Mounted Police uncovered the illicit operation and arrests are expected to be announced today during a press conference hosted by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance. Online scam: The login details and passwords of StubHub customers from around the world are said to have been hacked . The San Francisco-based company insist the thieves didn't break through its security — rather, they got account-holders' information from data breaches at other websites. The company detected the unauthorized transactions last year, contacted authorities and gave the affected customers refunds and help changing their passwords. StubHub's head of global communications, Glenn Lehrman, said he could not reveal how much money was involved or how many people were being charged. Fraudulent charges were posted after hackers obtained user credentials by hacking into other sites, then used them to log in StubHub, he said. Sanctions: Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance will hold a conference with the City of London Police to announce the arrests . 'We did not have anyone who hacked into our system,' Lehrman said. He said the schemes involved a 'pretty intense network of cyber fraudsters working in concert with each other.' It's unclear whether the digital prowlers then exploited their access to scoop up more information from the compromised accounts. The company and the law enforcement official wouldn't give further details Tuesday. StubHub, owned by eBay, is the leading digital marketplace for reselling concert, sports, theater and other tickets, offering brokers and fans a way 'to buy or sell their tickets in a safe, convenient and highly reliable environment,' as its website pledges. In the last year, major companies such as Target, LinkedIn, eBay and Neiman Marcus have been hacked. Target, the nation's second-largest discounter, acknowledged in December that data connected to about 40 million credit and debit card accounts was stolen as part of a breach that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Even Goodwill Industries Inc. found itself announcing last month that shoppers' payment card data might have been stolen. Ticket-sellers also have been targeted. The event ticketing service Vendini last month settled a class action lawsuit related to a data breach in 2013. Authorities generally advise consumers to protect against possible identity theft from such breaches by keeping close watch on their bank statements and using credit card monitoring services, among other tips.","Customers around the world are said to have been affected by the scam .

"David Cameron last night accused Brussels of existing in a ‘parallel universe’ and ‘insulting taxpayers’ last night as EU budget talks collapsed in acrimony. In the strongest condemnation of EU institutions ever issued by a British prime minister, Mr Cameron reacted with scorn after being accused of ‘blackmailing’ other leaders by demanding spending cuts and defending Britain’s rebate. Mr Cameron said he was astonished that EU bosses were refusing to cut ‘a single euro’ from their spending plans – as the two-day summit designed to fix the next seven-year budget deal for the EU broke up without agreement. Scroll down for video . David Cameron revealed his frustration that some countries would not back real cuts in EU spending . European Council Herman Van Rompuy today said work will go on to try to reach a deal in the New Year . Heading home: EU leaders have abandoned their budget talks. Front row left to right, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, Luxembourg's Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, European Parliament President Martin Schultz, Cypriot President Demetris Christofias, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, French President Francois Hollande, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Back row left to right, Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic, Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Belgium's Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Sweden's Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, Czech Republic's Prime Minister Petr Necas, Slovenian Prime Mini . British officials were also ‘surprised’ EU bosses thought it appropriate to serve leaders with 1992 Chateau  Angelus Grand Cru, a red wine costing £120 a bottle, as they discussed spending plans.But having made it clear he would veto the budget unless ‘tens of billions’ were slashed from it, the Prime Minister won crucial support from Germany’s Angela Merkel. France, Italy, Spain and other southern economies who do best out of the budget were horrified at the new alliance between the pair, dubbed ‘Merkeron’ or ‘Camerkel’ by angry EU officials. The Prime Minister deserves great credit for trying to force the spendthrift EU elite to join the real world, in which national budgets are being slashed and household incomes ruthlessly squeezed. We also applaud Mr Cameron for recruiting Germany as a powerful ally in resisting a budget deal that would have done nothing to slim down the grotesquely bloated Brussels bureaucracy. A note of caution, however: the arrogant, self-serving, and unaccountable EU elite rarely takes No for an answer. The PM will need to be every bit as determined when they come calling with an updated but doubtless equally ludicrous list of budget demands early next year. The two-day summit was deadlocked by a split between northern countries who put more into the EU budget than they get out, including Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden – and those who are net recipients, such as Spain and Italy. French president Francois Hollande, who opposed any cuts in the Common Agricultural Policy of farm subsidies, which hugely benefits his country, insisted he would not agree to any cut in the EU budget. As he left Brussels last night, Mr Cameron said those countries who, like Britain, ‘write the cheques’ were entitled to block the deal being put forward by European Council president Herman Van Rompuy. ‘We’re not going to be tough on budgets at home just to come here and sign up to big increases in European spending,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘We need to cut unaffordable spending – that’s what’s happening at home, that’s what needs to happen here.’ Setting out a range of areas where the budget could be slashed in a way that ‘would not result in hardship for any member states’, he suggested a cut in the EU’s justice and security budget, and was scathing about the European Commission’s refusal to countenance any reduction in the pay and perks of 40,000 Eurocrats. He said the EU’s administration budget of 56billion euros should be cut by ten billion, but EU bosses instead wanted to increase it to 63billion euros. The Prime Minister said 200 EU officials were paid more than him, adding that Britain has had to cut administration budgets in Whitehall departments by a third. ‘Brussels continues to exist as if it is in a parallel universe,’ he said. Chateau Angelus Premier Grand Cru is a red Bordeaux blend loved by wine connoisseurs – and even the less outstanding 1992 vintage which EU leaders were served still costs £120 a bottle. The wine was given a valuable boost when it was drunk by Daniel Craig’s James Bond in the film Casino Royale. The 1992 vintage is considered one of its ‘least successful’ years but, according to one reviewer, was still ‘eminently drinkable’. Experts recommended the 1992 should have been drunk at least four years ago. In the film, James Bond drank the 1982 vintage which costs at least £220 a bottle. As one-to-one negotiations between individual EU leaders and European Council president Herman van Rompuy dragged on for hours longer than scheduled on Thursday, Mr Cameron got so fed up that he sloped off for lunch at a nearby Belgian brasserie and dinner at a fish restaurant. ‘EU institutions simply have to adjust to the real world. Last night the Commission didn’t offer a single euro in savings – not one euro – insulting European taxpayers. ‘Who is there to stand up for the taxpayer? Which institution in Europe is there to say “where is the money going to come from, who is going to pay for this?” He insisted the budget rebate negotiated by Margaret Thatcher, worth £3.2billion last year, remained ‘completely justified’ despite demands by other EU leaders it be scaled back. He also vowed to continue to defend it in future negotiations, with another budget summit expected in February. British officials were privately scathing about the refusal of Mr Van Rompuy to offer a better deal, with one saying the president had ‘f***** it up’. Mr Cameron insisted it was still possible to salvage a deal at a future summit, but again suggested the British people would have to be asked to give ‘fresh consent’ for a renegotiated relationship with Brussels. European Commission president José Manuel Barroso said: ‘We want of course efficiency gains. By efficiency gains I mean reducing costs that are avoidable but not necessarily cutting the capacity of the European institutions to act. The reality is the EU budget is small, only around 2 per cent of total public expenditure in the EU.’ Hannes Swoboda, president of the Socialists and Democrats group in the European Parliament, to which Labour MEPs belong, said the summit had been ‘disastrous’ and blamed Mr Cameron. Mr Cameron’s stance was welcomed by Eurosceptic Tory Bill Cash, who said the Prime Minister ‘has done as much as anyone reasonably could’. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was driven through rain to arrive at day two of the budget talks, with hopes of a deal fading . The Prime Minister warned other EU leaders to stop 'tinkering' with Europe's budget . EU president Herman Van Rompuy arrived at the summit day, struggling to meet the conflicting demands of all  27 countries, with French President Francois Hollande demanding increases in subsidies for farmers .

"A vaccine against deadly meningitis B was yesterday approved by experts – but may not be available on the NHS before the end of the year. Until then, families will have to go private for the jab, the first to prevent the form of meningitis which kills hundreds annually – with half the deaths among under-5s. The European Commission has found the vaccine – called Bexsero – safe and effective for infants aged two months and over and older children. The vaccine is the first to prevent the leading cause of life-threatening bacterial meningitis in the UK, which is expected to dramatically cut the toll of death and disability among children . But it will not become immediately available on the NHS. The Government’s advisory committee on . vaccination has not decided whether the jab will become part of the . NHS routine immunisation programme. Health campaigners fear it could take until the summer or even until the end of the year for a ruling. Meningitis UK Founder Steve Dayman, . who lost his 14-month-old son Spencer to meningitis and septicaemia in . 1982, said: ‘This ground-breaking vaccine is the most important . development since I lost my son to meningitis 30 years ago. ‘The Government must introduce the . vaccine into the immunisation schedule as soon as possible – it will . save thousands of lives and spare families so much suffering. Any delay . means lives will be lost.’ The Joint Committee on Vaccination and . Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the Government, must first recommend . Bexsero and decide which age groups should receive it. It is likely to be given as routine . jabs for babies from age two months in three doses, with a booster at . one year, plus an initial catch-up programme for toddlers and teenagers . aged 15-18. The JCVI will consider factors such as price, . cost-effectiveness and compatibility with other vaccines. Meningoccocal B (pictured) is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in this country and one of the most deadly. It poses the toughest challenge for scientists because there are so many strains to target . The committee has discussed the . vaccine before, but there is no deadline set for agreement. It took five . years for the last major jab against meningitis – the pneumococcal . vaccine – to be introduced into the immunisation schedule. A mother who lost her 10-month old son wants the new vaccine to be approved by the NHS as soon as possible. Kadyn Busby died on Christmas Day 2011 just hours after contracting meningitis B and septicaemia. The baby boy seemed his usual happy self on the morning of Christmas Eve, but hours later he became lethargic and sick. Parents Nikki and Tony took him straight to A&E, where 40 minutes later he developed a rash all over his body. At 2.20am on Christmas Day, doctors delivered the devastating news that Kadyn could not be saved. The Busbys, of Neyland, Pembrokeshire, support the Beat it Now campaign by Meningitis UK for the jab to be introduced on the NHS. Mrs Busby, 29, said: ‘Meningitis absolutely shattered our lives within hours. ‘There’s no need for debate. The Government  needs to act. No parents should have to go through our ordeal. ‘It’s important that the vaccine is brought in as soon as possible. It’s the difference between life and death.’ Bexsero will be available privately in . the ‘middle of the year’ when supplies are released by makers Novartis. No price has been set. A meningitis C jab costs the NHS £7.50, which . may be indicative of the new jab’s price. Meningitis B is the most common form . of bacterial meningitis in Britain and one of the most deadly. There are . 1,870 cases on average each year, resulting in up to 200 deaths – with . half the fatalities in those aged under five. Up to 400 children are left with major life-long complications such as limb amputations, blindness, deafness and brain damage. Although vaccination programmes have . been introduced to combat pneumococcal meningitis and the strains C and . Hib, no B vaccine currently exists in this country. In trials in Europe involving 7,500 . children, adolescents and adults, Bexsero produced antibodies against at . least 73 per cent of 1,000 meningitis B strains found. Sue Davie of the Meningitis Trust said . EU approval was a ‘significant milestone in the fight against . meningitis’ but urged a swift decision by UK authorities. She said: ‘It’s wonderful news that . this new vaccine has been licensed, but licensing alone will not save . lives. 'That will only happen when the JCVI recommends the vaccine is . introduced into the Childhood Immunisation Programme, and the Government . agrees and implements this recommendation. ‘With vaccines being the only way to protect against bacterial meningitis, the sooner this happens the better.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: . ‘Meningitis is a worry for many parents so we’re pleased that a . meningococcal B vaccine has now been licensed. ‘Our independent group of vaccination . experts, the JCVI, is looking at the use of this vaccine and will . provide advice in due course.'","There is currently no defence against meningitis B - the most deadly strain .

"Tireless philanthropist and Manhattan socialite, Brooke Astor, will be sharing her wealth from beyond the grave on September 24 as 900 personal items from her estate will be put up for auction at Sotheby's. The charitable millionaire, who died in 2007 at age 105, was a fixture in New York's high society, and her jewels became as well known as the socialite herself. Her . favourite emerald and diamond Bulgari necklace, estimated at . $350,000, is up for grabs along with dozens of dog paintings and porcelain tea sets, cumulatively worth up to $9.7million. Old favourites: Brooke Astor's most precious personal items will go up for sale, including her favourite dazzling diamond and emerald necklace from Bulgari, which is estimated at . $350,000 . Presidential necklace: Brooke Astor wearing her Bulgari necklace (left) with President LB Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson . The auction catalogue features a photograph of Mrs Astor . wearing the necklace while standing next to President Lyndon B. Johnson . at a Plaza Hotel dinner dance - and it is a piece she has worn on handfuls of outings. From a small leather jewellery case starting at just $80, to a Tiepolo drawing for $400,000, a vast array of other personal items from Mrs Astor's Park Avenue apartment, and her Westchester mansion, Holly Hill, both currently under administration of New York State, will be up for grabs. Philip Marshall, Mrs Astor’s . grandson, told Bloomberg Business Week: 'There are so many small objects that . are hopefully affordable for people. They were just as important to her . as her expensive paintings.' And . as Mrs Astor wished, the proceeds will go to her favorite charities, . like the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the . Animal Medical Center. Barking mad: The staircase at Brooke Astor's Westchester estate, Holly Hill, is lined with the paintings of the late socialite's favourite animal that will go up for auction in September . Priceless: William Nedham's A Toy Spaniel and a Springer Spaniel in a Landscape is just one of the many paintings of dogs owned by the late Mrs Astor . Animal auction: Among the highlights are Mrs Astor's dog paintings, many of which hung salon-style along the spiral stairwell in Holly Hill . Although the state, as . administrator, has the authority to sell assets of the estate, some have . said that donating proceeds to Mrs Astor's preferred beneficiaries is . not quite as simple as they would hope. Mr Marshall told the Wall Street Journal in December: . 'This complex estate remains in surrogate's court in Westchester. And it . is much more complicated than initially presumed... that . monies realized from the sale would go to charity.' One person who won't be seeing any of auction's money will be his father, Anthony Marshall, who was found guilty . in 2009 of fraud and grand larceny, taking advantage of his mother's dementia in order to steal . millions of dollars from her. While . all of Mrs Astor's furniture had originally been left to Anthony, after . his conviction he reached a settlement with the state attorney general . stipulating that all furniture be returned to her estate, leaving him . with just $14million. Charlene, . his wife, whom Mrs Astor had a particular distaste for, was left one . necklace and two fur coats that were too small for her. Ladylike touches: In 1953, Mrs Astor (pictured in 1991 going to a construction site for housing and homeless) married her third husband, Vincent Astor, the oldest son of millionaire John Jacob Astor IV .

Admiring collectors have a keen eye on her beloved paintings of dogs, many of which hung salon-style along the spiral stairwell in Holly Hill, and her antique Chinese lacquer furniture dating back to the Qing dynasty.

"Earth is seen as a tiny speck surrounded by an enormous magnetic 'bubble' surging through space in this image released by Nasa. Far from the usual view of a blue and green globe spinning peacefully in the solar system, the dramatic picture illustrates the speed and energy of the magnetosphere that surrounds Earth as it moves around the sun. Scientists studying data collected by Nasa's WIND spacecraft have used it to create a more detailed snapshot of the way solar particles streaming in from the sun bounce off the bubble. A complex system of charged particles from the Sun and magnetic structures piles up in front of the Earth. Scientists now hope to better understand this area in front of the Bow shock, known as the foreshock, as it can help explain how energy from the rest of space makes its way into the magnetosphere . Nasa researchers have been examining data from WIND - which travelled through the region at the boundary of the magnetosphere 17 times between 1998 and 2002 - to find out more about the 'dramatic' changing conditions within the complex, turbulent system called the foreshock. As the magnetosphere ploughs through space, it sets up a standing bow wave or bow shock - much like that in front of a moving ship. The foreshock lies just in front of this bow wave. Conditions in the foreshock change in response to solar particles streaming in from the sun, moving magnetic fields and a host of waves sweeping through the region, according to Nasa. Lynn Wilson, deputy project scientist for Wind at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, explained how 'cool squiggles' she stumbled upon in the data 'turned out to be a special kind of magnetic pulsations called short large amplitude magnetic structures, which we call SLAMS for short'. Studying the region around these 'rogue waves' and how they propagate may help to establish what accelerates narrow jets of charged particles back out into space and away from Earth. Serene: Earth, seen here in a less dramatic image, ploughs through space surrounded by a giant magnetic bubble known as the magnetosphere . David Sibeck, a space scientist at Goddard who is co-author of the paper, explained how space weather events that seem small can have 'profound effects downstream', from affecting GPS satellites to prompting solar storms. 'The front of the magnetosphere is right in the line between sun and Earth, so it's a crucial place to understand which small things can lead to big results,' he said. 'What happens to Earth's magnetic field depends on what's happening here at the front of the bow shock. 'And what's happening there is dramatic. 'It's going to affect how much energy moves into the magnetosphere. Once inside the magnetosphere, it can create powerful solar storms and impact communications and GPS satellites that we depend on daily.' According to Nasa: 'The more we know about what happens in the frothy, turbulent area in front of Earth, the more we know about how the solar wind and other material bursting off the sun may be able to penetrate into near Earth-space.'","Earth is surrounded by giant bubble known as the magnetosphere .

"The government finally released Obamacare enrollment figures Monday and the findings could spell higher premiums for those who need coverage most. Enrollments are lower for the healthy, younger Americans are needed to keep premiums from rising because they pay more and take less from the system. According to the statistics, it's an older, costlier crowd that's signing up so far under President Obama's law and officials fear the age gap could make the government subsidized health coverage too costly for the middle-aged and older. Unexpected: The White House released Obamacare enrollment figures for the first time Monday and numbers show middle aged Americans are signing up the most despite the laws original intend to help cover uninsured young people . The White House reports that middle-aged Americans make up the bulk of the 2 million Obamacare enrollees. The major targets of the law creating subsidized health insurance were young adults, who are healthy and pay more into the system and take less thus keeping premiums down overall. However, Monday's report shows that young people are mostly passing on the new, cheaper healthcare. 33 percent of enrollees are aged 55 to 64 . 22 percent are aged 45 to 54 . 24 percent were aged 18 to 34 . And it’s the middle aged who are, for now, signing up the most. Adults ages 55-64 were the most heavily represented in the signups, accounting for 33 percent of the total. Overall, the premiums paid by people in that demographic don't fully cover their medical expenses. Some are in the waiting room for Medicare; that coverage starts at age 65. Young adults from 18 to 34 are only 24 percent of total enrollment, the administration said in its first signup figures broken down for age, gender and other details. With the HealthCare.gov website now working, the figures cover the more than 2 million Americans who had signed up for government-subsidized private insurance through the end of December in new federal and state markets. Enrolling young and healthy people is important because they generally pay more into the system than they take out, subsidizing older adults. While 24 percent is not a bad start, say independent experts, it should be closer to 40 percent to help keep premiums down.Some questions remained unanswered. For example, the administration is unable to say how of many of those enrolling for coverage had been previously uninsured. Some might have been among the more than 4.7 million insured people whose previous policies were cancelled because they didn't meet the law's standards. ‘The uninsured folks for whom the law was intended don't seem to have signed up in nearly as high numbers,’ said Richard Foster, a former statistics chief for the Health and Human Services department. ‘There is still a huge unknown aspect to this.’ US Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius could have a headache on her hands if more young people don't enroll in an Obamacare plan . But even if the age mix remains tilted toward older adults, ‘it's nothing of the sort that would trigger instability in the system,’ said Larry Levitt, an insurance expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Premiums would go up next year for the overhaul, along with taxpayer costs per enrollee, but not enough to push the system into a ‘death spiral’ in which rising premiums discourage healthy people from signing up. Levitt and other experts expected older, sicker people to be more heavily represented in the early numbers. They would have had strong motivation to persevere in the face of website dysfunction.Still, he said ‘it underscores a need to heighten outreach efforts to young people.’ Adults ages 18-34 represent 40 percent of the target group for the health care law, according to a recent Kaiser study. Open enrollment ends March 31. Considering that the federal health care website was down most of the time in October, administration officials said they were pleased that the percentage of young adults was as high as it was. ‘We think that more and more young people are going to sign up as time goes by,’ said Gary Cohen, head of the HHS office in charge of Obama's push to cover the uninsured. And there's a hammer, too: Those who fail to sign up face a tax penalty in 2015 for being uninsured. Making bets: To keep premiums affordable, officials say they need 40 percent of enrollees to be in the 18 to 34 age group . Officials remain confident they'll be able to get young adults interested. Insurers, nonprofit groups, and advocates are moving ahead with marketing campaigns that were put on hold when the federal website that serves 36 states was struggling. Administration officials said that in the coming weeks they plan to increase outreach to young people . in 25 communities located in states served by the federal website. That effort includes a national youth enrollment day on Feb. 15 and targeted outreach by sororities and fraternities, as well as Voto Latino, which focuses on Hispanic youth. In Miami, 19-year-old college student Stacy Sylvain was one of the last-minute online signups as 2013 drew to a close. In about an hour, the part-time waitress signed up for a plan with a $158 monthly premium, with the feds kicking in $48. She has a $2,500 deductible. Sylvain said she had no trouble navigating the website. 'Many people have a preconceived notion that young people are healthy and don't need to go to the doctor,' said Sylvain, who suffered a minor injury when she fell and hit her head during an indoor soccer class in 2012. 'Not having to worry about being uninsured and the what-ifs has made an incredible impact on my life.'","New enrollment statistics show middle aged Americans the vastly outnumber young adults 18 to 34 .

"Released: Andy and Tracey Ferrie at the Belvoir hunt ball in March 2006 . The couple arrested for opening fire on intruders who targeted their isolated cottage will not face charges, the Crown Prosecution Service announced last night. Andy and Tracey Ferrie had been held on suspicion of grievous bodily harm after dialling 999 to report that they had discharged a shotgun when a four-man gang broke in to their home in the middle of the night. The couple spent almost three days and nights in custody until they were released on bail late on Tuesday night. Yesterday, hours after two men appeared in court charged with burglary in connection with the raid on the Ferries’ 200-year-old cottage, prosecutors said it was ‘clear’ the couple ‘did what they believed was necessary to protect themselves, and their home, from intruders’. The decision was greeted as a victory for common sense by friends and relatives. Mrs Ferrie’s mother, Hazel Towell, and her husband, John, called for a change in the law to give greater protection to property owners who defended their homes from intruders. Mr Towell, 62, said: ‘It is terrifying, what happened to them. ‘What else could they have done? I feel so overjoyed the charges have been dropped. ‘Her mother has the weight off her shoulders. ‘This is the way forward. Police should have common sense.’ When asked about the people who raided his stepdaughter’s home, Mr Towell had previously told the Daily Mail he would have ‘blown their bloody heads off’. Judith Walker, chief crown prosecutor for CPS East Midlands, said the department had advised Leicestershire Police to release Mr and Mrs Ferrie from their bail. Scroll down for video . Analysis: Leicestershire Police cordoned off the stone cottage, which had reportedly been burgled several times already . Taking notes: Police were first called to the property shortly after midnight on September 2, by homeowner Mr Ferrie . Mrs Walker said: ‘I am satisfied that . this is a case where householders, faced with intruders in frightening . circumstances, acted in reasonable self-defence.’ Relatives said Mr Ferrie, who runs a . caravan repair business, and his wife, a saleswoman, were being looked . after by police at an unknown location as detectives remained at their . home at Welby, outside Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, last night. A friend of the couple, who set up a Facebook support group after the shooting which had topped 18,000 members last night, said she was ‘relieved’. Homeowners: Andy and Tracey Ferrie were at their Leicestershire home when a group broke in to the property. They have been told they will not face charges after the intruders were shot . She added: ‘If masked intruders go . into somebody’s bedroom in the middle of the night then the householder . has every right to defend themselves.’ At Loughborough Magistrates Court yesterday, Daniel Mansell, 33, admitted burgling the Ferries’ rented home.

"American airline Southwest is being fined $200,000 for false advertising. Last October, Southwest advertised flights from Atlanta to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles for just $59 but then did not make any seats available at that price. The American Department of Transportation (DoT) said that Southwest’s ads were deceptive and violated rules on advertising of airline fares. Last October, Southwest advertised flights from Atlanta to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles for just $59 but then did not make any seats available at that price . Southwest was also ordered to pay an extra $100,000 that had been suspended after a similar offence last year. The DoT commented that airlines already knew that as part of the rules governing fair fare advertising they must have a ‘reasonable number’ of seats available at the advertised price. In October, Southwest ran advertisements on eight stations in the Atlanta region in which a voiceover intoned: ‘Discover amazing low sale fares’ of $59 ‘to places like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago’. The American Department of Transportation said that Southwest's advertisements were . deceptive and violated rules on advertising of airline fares . Officials from the DoT checked and found that on the travel dates listed in the commercial there were no $59 seats to those three cities. Southwest blamed a flawed review of the advertising copy. ‘As soon as we became aware of our mistake, we pulled all incorrect advertisements off the air,’ said spokesman Brad Hawkins. The airline said that it honoured the $59 fare to the three cities for consumers who called its reservations centre and asked for that price.

"Scientists from the University of Western Australia may found evidence that plants can 'talk' each other using microscopic sounds. A study looking into how chilli plants grow has discovered that when seedlings are put next to so-called 'friendly' plants, they grow stronger. Yet, when the seedlings were put near 'bad neighbours', such as fennel, germination was hindered. Dr. Monica Gagliano and her research team at the University of Western Australia studied how chilli plant seedlings reacted when placed near other plants, such as basil and fennel. Basil encouraged the seeds to grow, whereas fennel hindered development. Scientists believe this could be due to microscopic sounds . The research team put one lot of chilli seeds in a locked container with basil, and then fennel. Another lot were left to grow outside. In both cases, the chilli seeds sprouted and grew when the basil neighbour was present, and were hindered by the presence of fennel. This suggests that the development differences had little to do with the growing environment, and more to do with how the plants interact with one another . The experiment was set up to block . all possible known means of communication between plants, including . chemical and light signals, and physical contact. Chilli seeds were . planted in isolated dishes around an adult basil plant that was either . left open to the elements, or sealed in a cylindrical box covered in . black plastic. The cylinder blocked all airborne . chemical signals, and all wavelengths of light. As a comparison, other . seeds were planted around a cylinder that was left empty. More of the chilli seeds sprouted and . grew when the basil neighbour was present, whether or not the plant was . masked and cut off from them. Sounds generated by microscopic movements within plant cells might be the key to the mystery, the scientists suspect. The team, lead by researcher Dr Monica Gagliano, found that sprouting chilli plants grow more successfully next to 'friendly' neighbour, which in the chilli plant's case was an adult basil plant. Yet place them next  a neighbour from hell, such as fennel, and germination is held back. The study even discovered that the plants recognise what kind of plant lives next door when they are still seeds. Gagliano said: 'Our results show that plants are able to positively influence the growth of seeds by some as yet unknown mechanism. 'Bad neighbours, such as fennel, prevent chilli seed germination in the same way. 'We believe that the answer may involve acoustic signals generated using nanomechanical oscillations from inside the cell which allow rapid communication between nearby plants.' Fennel is a bad plant neighbour because it competes aggressively, releasing chemicals that stunt the growth of its rivals. Basil, on the other hand, produces helpful chemicals that keep out weeds and act as natural insect pest killers. When the basil plant, pictured left, was near the chilli plant the seeds grew stronger because basil produces helpful chemicals that keep weeds out. Alternatively, fennel, pictured right, competes 'aggressively' and releases chemicals that stunt growth, which hindered the chilli plants development . 'Interestingly, this was true even when all known signals from the basil were blocked, indicating that the facilitative interaction observed between these two species is mediated through a signalling modality other than those studied thus far. 'Most importantly, the fact that germination of chilli seeds did not differ between the masked and open treatment indicates that light, touch or chemical signals may be important but clearly not necessary for chilli seeds and basil plants to sense each other's presence.' They added: 'The observed differences in germination between treatments were relatively small but even small differences in germination are likely to have significant effects on competitiveness and thus on fitness.' Previous research by Dr Gagliano showed . that, even when protected against fennel's chemical chilli seeds are . reluctant to germinate when placed near the plant. The new findings have been published in the online journal BMC Ecology.","Australian scientists have found that plants talk to each other using microscopic sounds .

"This is the moment a volcano erupted in the snowy wastes of Russia's remote far east. The stunning pictures were captured by a Russian film crew who swooped across in a helicopter and braved roasting hot pyroclastic flows on the ground to create an immersive, interactive panorama. Plosky Tolbachik is one of four . volcanoes, all within 110 miles of each other, that have been active . simultaneously on the peninsula in Russia's far east since late . November. Plosky Tolbachik erupting in Kamchatka in November: The volcano is the subject of an incredible 360 degree interactive panorama by Russian group Airpano . The Tolbachik Volcano system, which . consists of the active Plosky Tolbachik and it's extinct sister Ostry . Tolbachik, is the largest of the south-western sector of the . Klyuchevskaya volcanic group, said Airpano, the group which captured these amazing images.. It . was formed about 10,000 years ago, in the Early Holocene, with a . caldera at the summit of Plosky Tolbachik about 3km in diameter. A regional zone of cinder cones north-east and south-west of the volcano resemble the rifts of Hawaiian volcanoes. The . south zone of the Tolbachik system extends about 45-50km down to the . Nikolka volcano and is called Tolbachinsky Dol. It is here that the . latest fissure eruption began at the end of November. Shot from a variety of locations . around the volcano, the incredible panorama can be zoomed and panned in . much the same way as Google Street View. It was captured in December by Russian non-profit outfit AirPano, a group of photographers and panorama enthusiasts who create high-resolution 3d aerial panoramas. In a blog post accompanying . the incredible panorama, Oleg Gaponyuk told how the team cancelled a . trip to Dubai to shoot the Burj skyscraper at the last minute to capture . the spectacular light show. 'The . Tolbachik volcano eruption is classified as an unconventional fissure . eruption. Fissure eruptions are known for emitting great volume of . lava,' he said. 'They are also called ""touristic"" eruptions for relatively low level of danger and photogenic beauty of flowing rivers of lava. 'Weather . permitting, one can fly up close to a volcanic crater or hover right . above a lava stream. We knew it all in theory, but in reality we kept . our fingers crossed for a good weather.' The volcano was captured in December by Russian . non-profit outfit AirPano, a group of photographers and enthusiasts who create high-resolution 3D aerial panoramas . The team cancelled a trip to Dubai to shoot the Burj skyscraper at the last minute to capture the spectacular light show . Stas Sedov, who was among the Airpano team that braved temperatures fluctuating from -19C to red-hot lava to shoot the volcano, recalled the dramatic scenes that met them as they arrived. 'The volcano in front of us is covered with clouds and smoke,' he wrote. 'We decide to move up the lava flow. Finally there are the first red hot lava streams underneath us! 'We slow down the helicopter and shoot several spherical panoramas. We are overwhelmed - we finally saw IT!' He told how the pilot of the helicopter braved strong winds and cloudy conditions to hover right over the hot lava flow. 'Ascending flows of hot air threw the helicopter side to side like a feather, but Dmitry held it over the spot as if it was tied to an invisible anchor. 'Every time I looked out of the window with my camera it felt like I was sticking my head into a hot oven. Everyone was perspiring from unbearable heat and concentration.' The Airpano team flew around the volcano by helicopter as well as shooting it from the ground to put together their incredible panorama . Kamchatka is a 780 mile peninsula in the Russian Far East, with an area of about 100,000 sq/miles. The Kamchatka River and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts containing around 160 volcanoes, 29 of them still active. The peninsula has a high density of volcanoes and associated volcanic phenomena, with 19 active volcanoes being included in the six UNESCO World Heritage List sites in the Volcanoes of Kamchatka group, most of them on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The highest volcano is Klyuchevskaya Sopka (15,584 ft), the largest active volcano in the Northern Hemisphere. The most striking is Kronotsky, whose perfect cone was said by celebrated volcanologists Robert and Barbara Decker to be a prime candidate for the world's most beautiful volcano. Somewhat more accessible are the three volcanoes visible from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky: Koryaksky, Avachinsky, and Kozelsky. In the centre of Kamchatka is Eurasia's world famous Geyser Valley which was partly destroyed by a massive mudslide in June 2007. This map shows the location of the Tolbachik volcano on the Kamchatka peninsula in the Russian Far East . That volcanoes erupt in Kamchatka is hardly news - it boasts 29 active volcanoes - but for four to be active at any one time is the vulcanological equivalent of winning the lottery. The peninsula, which has a landmass slightly larger than Germany, is one of the most active parts of the 'Ring of Fire' zone of volcanic and seismic activity that encircles the Pacific. It is the meeting point of three tectonic plates - the North American Plate, the Okhotsk Plate and the Pacific Plate - where they all collide causing massive geological turbulence.","Russian team creates incredible interactive panorama of the Plosky Tolbachik volcano in the Russian Far East .

"More customers are opting to shop from the comfort of their homes this Thanksgiving weekend, forgoing the chaos of Black Friday for the ease of Cyber Monday deals, a survey has found. But web shoppers beware: For the first time, residents in California, Texas and Pennsylvania will be automatically charged state sales tax at the checkout on Amazon and other online stores. And next year, they will be joined by shoppers in Virginia and New Jersey, and by January 2014, those in Nevada, Indiana and Tennessee. Scroll down for video . Getting ready: Online companies prepare their warehouses ahead of a manic Cyber Monday. Pictured, the Sierra Trading Post Fulfillment Center sits stocked in preparation in Cheyenne, Wyoming . Amazon has  admitted it made £3.35billion in sales in Britain last year - much higher than the £207million figure that it previously showed in its UK accounts . What comes as bad news for shoppers comes as good news for Amazon's competitors, who have expressed their relief at finally 'levelling the playing field' with the e-commerce giant, which earned a staggering $17.45 billion in the holiday quarter last year. Other stores have claimed that Amazon's success is partly due to the fact it can undercut them by avoiding sales tax, which is as high as nine per cent in some states. The changes are coming into play after individual states have passed legislation on online sales tax after Congress has failed to pass a national law. Chains including WalMart and Target have been lobbying the bills, Politico reported. 'Now for a sizeable chunk of the U.S. population, Amazon is playing by the same rules as the rest of the retailers,' Jason Brewer, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, told the site. Avoid the queues: By ordering bargains online, shoppers avoid the chaos of Black Friday . Madness: Shoppers position themselves for midnight openings at the Clackamas Town Center, Oregon . Chaos: Shoppers fight for deals in the shoe department at the Columbiana Centre Belk in South Carolina . Trying: People wait in line for a Best Buy store in Northeast Philadelphia to open it's doors at midnight . Amazon has avoided state sales tax after hiding behind a 1992 Supreme . Court decision, which found that mail-order retailers didn't have to collect state and local sales taxes from places where they . didn’t have physical operations, like factories or warehouses. The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates that in 2010, states missed out on a staggering $8.6 billion in revenues from failing to collect sales tax from online purchases. There has been increasing pressure from companies and states to create federal internet tax law but, as this has yet to come into fruition, some states are setting up their own. In June, Amazon agreed to start charging the tax in New Jersey and struck deals with other states - including those where it has long had a physical presence with offices or distribution centres. This holiday season, shoppers in California, Texas and Pennsylvania . will be charged state sales tax for the first time. Next year, Amazon will include Virginia and New Jersey and by 2014, Nevada, Indiana and Tennessee. 'There are going to be fewer people who shop online solely for the sales tax benefit.' But Amazon maintains that it expects this holiday season to be its most successful yet. 'As analysts have noted, we offer customers the best prices with or without sales tax,' said Scott Stanzel, an Amazon spokesman. 'We collect sales tax or its equivalent in more than half of the areas where we do business and we are pleased to say we are thriving in those geographies because Amazon offers low prices, vast selection and fast delivery.' Yet some retailers said they are already noticing a difference in states were Amazon is collecting sales tax. Best Buy has seen a four to six per . cent increase in sales in California, Texas and Pennsylvania compared to . the rest of the chain, Amy Von Walter, a spokesperson at Best Buy, told . Politico. 'These are encouraging data points,' she said. 'It lends itself to the idea that a level playing field is good for business.' Online sales during Cyber Monday last . year reached $1.25 billion, up 22 per cent from the previous year, . according to ComScore. This year, the data firm expects $1.5 billion in . sales that day. Getting ready: Amazon has avoided paying sales tax but new state legislation has now been passed . Preparation: A survey has shown that more than 40 per cent of shoppers will buy online this weekend . Despite changes to sales tax, research . has shown that more people are shunning the mania of Black Friday to . shop from their homes on Cyber Monday. On the rise: A graphic shows the increase in online sales over previous holiday seasons . A survey by shopping comparison site PriceGrabber.com revealed that almost half of all Thanksgiving weekend shoppers will shop online on Monday - and more than half of these said they would shop more online than at shops on Black Friday. Of the 5,000 people surveyed, 41 per cent of people said they would shop on Cyber Monday - up from the 37 per cent last year, and 33 per cent in 2010, Fox News reported. Eighty-four per cent of Cyber Monday shoppers said they wanted to take advantage . of one-day deals, discounts and free-shipping offers. A third of shoppers said they would be shopping on Monday after scouting for deals over the weekend. But although the interest in online shopping is growing, the total sales will still not come close to those in shops on Black Friday. Stores are expected to take as much as $11.4 billion. Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, was created in 2005 as a retail alternative to Black Friday. This year, as Black Friday begins earlier than ever - with retail giants nudging their opening times into Thanksgiving - e-commerce departments are doing the same. Walmart emailed customers this week to reveal that its Cyber Monday sale will start this Saturday and last until Sunday, December 2, 2012 for deals on toys, electronics and video games. Target, Best Buy and Amazon also announced they would have tech deals starting on Black Friday. Amazon is also offering special Sunday deals - so that bargain hunters don't have to click from their work compuers come Monday - on golf equipment, clothing, lamps, books, clothes and cameras.","Cyber Monday is expected to earn online stores $1.5 billion, up from last year - but will still be dwarfed by Black Friday sales of $11.4 billion .
For the first time, residents in California, Texas and Pennsylvania will be automatically be charged state sales tax when shopping on Amazon .
Amazon critics say the move finally levels the playing field ."
"A petting zoo featuring light-up 'cyborg creatures' instead of the usual rabbits and miniature goats has opened in France. The robotic animals have bright, flexible tentacles and react when touched, much like a living animal, as each arm has features and 'personalities' that change according to the activity of visitors. The interactive exhibition, created by a British architecture and design studio, intends to make visitors question how future environments could enable new forms of communication.

A petting zoo featuring light-up 'cyborg creatures' instead of the usual rabbits and miniature goats has opened in France and invites humans to interact with the futuristic animals . The robotic animals have bright, flexible tentacles and react when touched like a living animal as each arm has features and 'personalities' that change according to the activity of visitors . Petting Zoo is the latest work by two brothers who make up the Minimaforms studio and is on show at the FRAC Centre in France. Theodore and Stephen Spyropoulos designed the artificially-intelligent creatures with the capacity to learn and explore behaviours through interaction with participants, using Microsoft's Kinect sensors. The animals show 'emotions' when touched by moving, lighting up and making sounds and evolve their behaviours over time, which the designers said allow the pets to develop their own 'personalities'. The designers created the artificially-intelligent creatures with the capacity to learn and explore behaviours through interaction with participants, using Microsoft's Kinect sensors . Writing on the company's website, they said: 'Within this immersive installation . interaction with the pets foster human curiosity, play, forging intimate . exchanges that are emotive and evolving over time. 'Beyond technology the project explores new forms of enabled communication between people and their environment.' As well as reacting to humans, the robots are also able to communicate with each other.

Other technology lets the pets evolve relationships and avoid repetitive behaviour. The robotic creatures are aware of humans thanks to camera tracking and data scanning technology. Real-time camera streams are processed and coupled with 'blob tracking' and optical flow analysis to locate people and read their gestures.

The robotic creatures are aware of humans thanks to camera tracking and data scanning technology that lets them identify human presence in their environment . If a person stays still and is not taking an interest in the pets in the environment, they can stimulate responses of disinterest and boredom in the animals. Groups of humans can interact with the animals by the ability of the system to identify and map in real-time the number of people seeking attention. Minimaforms was founded in 2002 by brothers Stephen and Theodore Spyropoulos as an experimental architecture and design practice. The duo explore new forms of communication and aim to push the boundaries of art, architecture and design by constructing spaces of 'social and material interaction'.

"If you have ever grimaced at your petrol bill and dreamed of a car that runs on fresh air, your prayers are about to be answered. French car giant PSA Peugeot  Citroen believes it can put an air-powered vehicle on the road by 2016. Its scientists say it will knock 45 per cent off fuel bills for an average motorist. And when driving in towns and cities costs could be slashed by as much as 80 per cent because the car will be running on air for four-fifths of the time. Saving the planet: The Hybrid Air technology could allow a car the size of a Citroën C3 or Peugeot 208 to emit as little as 69g/km of CO2 . Cutting costs: A look inside the 'air engine' which could cut 45 per cent off the petrol bill for the average driver . The system works by using a normal internal combustion engine, special hydraulics and an adapted gearbox along with compressed air cylinders that store and release energy. This enables it to run on petrol or air, or a combination of the two. Air power would be used solely for city use, automatically activated below 43mph and available for ‘60 to 80 per cent of the time in city driving’. By 2020, the cars could be achieving an average of 117 miles a gallon, the company predicts. The air compression system can re-use all the energy normally lost when slowing down and braking. The motor and a pump are in the engine bay, fed by a compressed air tank underneath the car, running parallel to the exhaust. The revolutionary new ‘Hybrid Air’ engine system – the first to combine petrol with compressed air – is a breakthrough for hybrid cars because expensive batteries will no longer be needed. Lift-off: The air power will be automatically activated below 43mph and can be used for up to 80 per cent of driving time in urban areas . Cars fitted with Hybrid Air will be about £1,000 cheaper to buy than current hybrid models. For more than two years, 100 elite scientists and engineers have been working on the air-powered car in top-secret conditions at Peugeot’s research and development centre at Velizy, just south of Paris. Hybrid Air is the centrepiece of Peugeot chief executive Philippe Varin’s efforts to restore the fortunes of the historic car maker. The revolutionary system will be able to be installed on any normal family car without altering its external shape or size or reducing the boot size, provided the spare wheel is not stored there. From the outside, an air-powered car will look identical to a conventional vehicle. A spokesman said: ‘We are not talking about weird and wacky machines. These are going to be in everyday cars.’ Peugeot, which unveiled its prototype yesterday, envisages introducing it in smaller models such as the 208 at first. Running on air: The Peugeot 208 is one model that may use the air engine technology in future . The company said that as well as being greener and cheaper to run, the air system created no extra dangers in a collision. Motorists never run the risk of running out of compressed air late at night on a deserted country road because the car will be fitted with a sophisticated artificial brain that ensures it replenishes itself automatically. The air compresses and decompresses of its own accord as the car speeds up and slows down. Spacious interior: Allows for full-sized passenger compartment without surrendering boot volume. Driving comfort and road handling: Hybrid Air promises to deliver nimble response with the boost effect as well as first-class road handling thanks to its automatic transmission. Worldwide potential: The technology is viable in all markets, making it possible for energy efficient cards in all types of climate and regardless of the state of the roads. Boot: No space for a spare tyre once the Hybrid Air motor is installed. As well as the revolutionary air car, . Peugeot also unveiled plans for new larger cars such as the Peugeot 508 and the . Citroen C5 that will save 20per cent on fuel bill through the use of new . materials such as lightweight steel and aluminuim composites. They will also deploy other innovations such as electric power steering instead of hydraulic and new tyres with reduced drag. These . will be introduced from this year. The first cars to feature them will . be the replacement for the Citroen C4 Picasso produced at the company’s . plant in Vigo  Spain and the replacement for the 308 built at Sochaux in . France. The audience gasped as the covers were . removed from the prototypes at a packed ceremony attended by French . politicians and business leaders. The innovations are crucial to chairman Philippe Varin’s efforts to revamp the ailing automaker that has suffered badly due to the crisis in southern european markets including Italy, Portugal and Spain that account for a large chunk of its sales. The economy in its home market of France has also been hard hit in the single currency crisis. It has lost its triple-A credit rating and socialist President Francois Hollande has earned international ridicule through his plans for a supertax on the wealthy. The Peugeot company was founded in 1810 and the family still has a controlling stake. Thierry Peugeot drafted in Varin - widely hailed in the UK for rescuing Corus, the former British Steel, from the brink of ruin - in 2009. Varin’s attempts to revive the marque have been hit by the euro meltdown and militant French unions. Worldwide sales for 2012 were down 8.8per cent to 2.82m. The company has been hindered in efforts to improve its performance by France’s rigid labour laws. It has also been plagued by violent industrial action at its Aulnay plant near Paris which is due to close next year with the loss of thousands of jobs. It is embroiled in controversy with rival European car makers over a French state guarantee given to its financing arm last year.","Peugeot Citroen invents technology for air car ready for the market by 2016 .

"A man who was released from prison after spending 26 years on death row is rebuilding his life with the help of an Amazon wishlist - donated to him by the kindness of strangers. Glenn Ford, 64, had been on death row . since August 1988 in connection with the death of 56-year-old Isadore . Rozeman, a Shreveport jeweler and watchmaker for whom Mr Ford had done . occasional yard work. But his conviction was quashed and he walked free from Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, on the 12 March, wearing a simple jean jacket, jumper and beanie hat, carrying all of his worldly possessions in two tiny boxes. Scroll down for video . First steps to freedom: Glenn Ford, 64, center, walked out of a maximum security . prison, in Angola, La., after having spent . nearly 26 years on death row . Prison officials gave the 64-year-old a debit card worth just $20. The debit card, along with the money that he had in his bank account left Mr Ford with a paltry $20.04 to his name. As he walked out of the prison gates, a TV crew from WAFB-TV asked him how he felt about his release. He said: 'It feels good; my mind is going in all kind of directions. It feels good.' But as he began to put the pieces of his life back together, the newly exonerated man had absolutely no way to support himself financially after spending nearly three decades behind bars. In light of this, Capital Post Conviction Project's Louisiana director, Gary Clements - who acted as Mr Ford's lawyers when he was exonerated- decided to step in and help him by setting up an Amazon wishlist (which can be found here.) Wishlist: This is the Amazon wishlist set up for Mr Ford to help him get his life back on track . It would enable him to receive donations for  things that would help him put his life back together. The simple list of around 49 items include an ironing board and a pair of men's silk pyjamas. And Mr Clements said that after Mr Ford's release he began getting calls from strangers asking how they could help, donate and  contribute. Ford, an African-American, was tried and . convicted of first-degree murder by an all-white jury panel in 1984 and . sentenced to death. Nearly three decades on, much had changed in the world and technology had advanced in ways that Mr Ford simply could not have imagined. There were now smart phones, iPods, iPads and the internet. Lawyers in the Capital Post Conviction Project's office were keen to give Mr Ford a taste of modern technology and put a second generation iPad on the wishlist. But the freed inmate is struggling to get to grips with using a mobile phone. Lost years: Upon leaving death row, Ford told reporters that he does harbor some resentment at being wrongly jailed and denied the chance to help raise his sons, who are now grown men . The groundwork for Ford's release was . based off a confession by confidential informant Jake Robinson who . revealed that he was the one who pulled the trigger, killing Rozeman. Robinson . was one of four people initially charged in the killing. The other . three were Ford, George Starks and the informant's brother, Henry . Robinson. State . District Judge Ramona Emanuel voided Mr Ford's conviction and sentence . based on the new information that corroborated his claim that he was not . present or involved in Rozeman's death. His lawyers Gary Clements and Aaron Novod said Ford's trial had been . 'profoundly compromised by inexperienced counsel and by the . unconstitutional suppression of evidence, including information from an . informant.' They also . cited what they said was a suppressed police report related to the time . of the crime and evidence involving the murder weapon. The victim's family were also notified of Ford's release from death row earlier this month. 'We . understand that and actually believe the DA is acting honorably,' the slain jeweler's nephew, Dr Phillip Rozeman, told Shreveport Times. 'This is positive . reflection on the criminal justice system that does the right thing for . people. On his release, Ford told WAFB-TV he does harbour some resentment at being wrongly jailed. 'Yeah, . cause, I've been locked up almost 30 years for something I didn't do,' the freed inmate said. 'I can't go back and do anything I should have . been doing when I was 35, 38, 40 stuff like that.' The newly liberated man added he was sad that he had not been there to raise his sons, who are now grown men. Wrongful conviction: Ford, an African-American (pictured in booking photos), was tried and convicted of first-degree murder by an all-white jury panel in 1984 and sentenced to death . Under state law, Louisiana is required to pay Mr Ford $25,000 in compensation for . wrongful imprisonment. Mr Ford is also eligible for $80,000 for loss of life opportunity, but getting the money isn’t guaranteed, especially if state officials contest it, according to Mr Clements. However, Mr Clements hopes that Mr Ford can begin to change his life with the things donated on the Amazon wishlist.

"Michael Brown Sr. has released a public service announcement shortly before the grand jury decision on whether or not to indict the police officer who shot dead his son, Michael Brown. In it, he appeals for calm and non-violence among those who might protest, saying that 'hurting others is not the answer.' He also takes a moment to thank many of the protesters for 'lifting [their] voices to end racial profiling and police intimidation.' This as Darren Wilson, the officer responsible for the fatal shooting, has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department. Scroll down for video . Making a plea: Michael Brown Sr. (above) has urged that protesters remain calm and be non-violent as Ferguson prepares for a grand jury decision in the death of his son . Fate: The grand jury will decide whether or not to charge Officer Darren Wilson (above) in the death of Michael Brown, though Wilson feels confident he won't be found guilty says a source . Tragic end: Brown (above in photo) was unarmed when he was shot dead by Wilson on August 9 . Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the shooting. 'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said. Meanwhile, Wilson may announce as early as Friday his plans to resign from the force, as a way of protecting fellow officers and easing pressures in the wake of the shooting. Regardless of what happens though, Brown is trying to keep things calm. 'No matter what the grand jury decides, I do not want my son’s death to be in vain,' says Brown. 'I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone. Brown does make it clear however, that there is still more work to be done. 'Continue to lift your voices with us and lets work together to heal and to create lasting change for all people regardless of race,' he says. This as the FBI has warned law enforcement agencies across the country that the grand jury verdict in this case 'will likely' lead to violence. The grand jury decision is expected to come this month. Meanwhile, Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in Missouri and activated the National Guard, citing the 'possibility of expanded unrest.' The state of emergency will last 30 days unless extended by another order. Getting ready: police have been preparing for what may happen in Ferguson . His side: Wilson, labeled a cop killer by many protesters (above), says Brown punched him in the face and tried to wrestle his gun away on August 9 before he shot at the teenager . No doubt fueling many of these fears of unrest are reports like the one that came out on Tuesday claiming that Ferguson's own cops and their supporters were urging people to go out and get guns on online message boards. 'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family,' said one commentor on the forum St Louis Cop Talk. Then there is the report that a militant group is offering a cash reward for anyone who can give them the location of Willson. A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer's whereabouts. Brown was shot by Wilson on August 9 in Ferguson. Wilson allegedly claimed, according to his grand jury testimony which was leaked to the public, that he saw Brown and his friend Don Johnson walking down the middle of the road that day, and thought Brown matched the description of a young man involved in a recent robbery. When he tried to stop the boys, he said Brown punched him through the window. Getting ready: Missouri Governor Jay Nixon (above) has declared a state of emergency in his state, and activated the National Guard . Making themselves heard: Protesters on both sides of the argument feel very strongly, leading the FBI to warn that the grand jury verdict in this case 'will likely' lead to violence . Wilson claims he then drew his weapon but Brown tried to wrestle it from him while continuing to punch him in the face. During that struggle for his gun, Wilson said he got off two shots, missing the Brown on the first and hitting him in the hand with the second. When Brown tried to escape, Wilson allegedly stated that he continued to shoot, firing off the fatal volley of shots when Brown turned and started rushing towards him. This account is in stark contrast with that of several eye witnesses, and Brown's companion Johnson, who have claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up, or by his side, and begged the officer 'Stop shooting.' The office of St Louis Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said that they will unseal all evidence reviewed by the Grand Jury following their decision and release it to the public.","Michael Brown Sr. has filmed a public service announcement ahead of the grand jury decision in the death of his son Michael Brown .

"Tommy Morrison, the former heavyweight champion who stood toe-to-toe with Lennox Lewis and George Foreman and later tested positive for HIV, died Monday. He was 44. Morrison died Sunday night at a Nebraska hospital, said Tony Holden, his longtime promoter and close friend. The family would not disclose the cause of death. In 1993, Morrison beat Foreman to win the WBO heavyweight title, only to lose it to unheralded Michael Bentt in a defeat that scuttled a showdown with Lewis. Morrison would fight Lewis a couple of years later, getting knocked out in the sixth round in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Scroll down for video . Passed away: Tommy Morrison, pictured in 2007, was a former heavyweight champion who was better known for appearing in the film Rocky V . Morrison, nicknamed 'The Duke,' never reached the status of such contemporaries as Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield, but it was surely a full career. He was a prodigious puncher whose bid to fight in the 1988 Seoul Olympics ended at the hands of Ray Mercer, who later dealt Morrison his first professional loss. He had a starring role in 'Rocky V' alongside Sylvester Stallone. And perhaps most memorably, Morrison tested positive for HIV when the virus still carried a significant stigma, only to declare later the test was false. His mother, Diana Morrison, told ESPN he had been in denial about having HIV ever since receiving the first test results. He hated people to know he was sick. she said, adding that he got pectoral implants to make himself look bigger and stronger. The implants were later removed after becoming infected. She said for the past year he had been bedridden and fed through a tube. He was unable to speak and relied on a ventilator. No 1 fan: Tommy Morrison celebrates his win over George Foreman with his mother in Las Vegas in 1993 . Fighter: Tommy Morrison in New Jersey in April 2011 . 'He's in the end stages. That's it,' she said in an interview last month. 'I tell him that the family loves him, he's always in our prayers ... I don't tell him to keep fighting or nothing, because I want him to go.' Because of numerous legal issues, including a prison sentence that stemmed from weapons and drunk driving, Morrison's name became attached to headlines that would eventually overshadow his work in the ring. 'If Tommy was fighting today, he no doubt would be a world champion,' Holden said. 'You have to look at who he was fighting in the '90s, the guys in that division were Tyson, Lennox Lewis, Riddick Bowe, Ray Mercer, George Foreman. There's no one with that talent today. Tommy would absolutely dominate if he were in his prime boxing today.' Morrison won his first 28 professional fights, beating faded champions such as Pinklon Thomas along the way. His career reached its apex in the summer of 1993 with a unanimous decision over Foreman, then in the midst of his comeback, to claim a vacant title. Big screen: Morrison appearing as Tommy 'Machine' Gunn alongside Sylvester Stallone in Rocky V . As with so many things in Morrison's life, the good was quickly followed by the bad. Morrison was in line for a high-profile bout with Lewis when he was upset by Bentt in Tulsa, Okla., not far from where Morrison was raised. He was knocked down three times and the fight was called before the first round ended. Along with the stinging defeat, Morrison saw a potential $7.5 million payday for a title unification fight against Lewis wash away. 'I zigged when I should have zagged,' Morrison said afterward. 'It's one of those situations you have to live with and learn from it. I'll be back.' Morrison indeed came back, but he was never the same feared fighter. He beat a bunch of long shots and faded stars over the next couple of years before his loss to Lewis. That fight happened in October 1995. By February, Morrison had tested positive for HIV. He'd been preparing for another fight that winter when his blood test came back positive for the virus that causes AIDs. Morrison's license was quickly suspended by Nevada, and the ban was, in effect, upheld by every other sanctioning body. 'Tommy had a hard time with it back then,' Holden told ESPN. 'People wouldn't shake his hand, wouldn't come close to him, wouldn't let babies next to him.' 'You took a kid from this height of stardom, being in movies, to the point where everyone wanted to be Morrison's friend to the point where, man, nobody wanted to be in the same room with him. I witnessed it. And it was heartbreaking,' he said. Morrison said at a news conference after receiving his test results that he'd never fight again, blaming his plight on a 'permissive, fast and reckless lifestyle.' His lifestyle never changed, though, even when he stepped away from the ring. He had already run afoul of the law in 1993, when he pleaded guilty to assaulting a college student. He also dealt with weapons charges and multiple DUI incidents over the years. He was finally sentenced to two years in prison in 2000, and another year was added to his sentence in 2002 for violating parole. Champ: Morrison was crowned WBO heavyweight champion in 1993 after defeating George Foreman in Las Vegas . When he was released, Morrison said his HIV tests had resulted in false positives, and he wanted to resume his career. He passed medical tests in Arizona - even as Nevada stood by its decision - and returned to the ring. Morrison fought twice more in his career, winning once in West Virginia and for the final time in Mexico. He finished with a record of 48-3-1 with 42 knockouts. 'Tommy's a very stubborn person and he views things the way he wants to view things. That's his right and privilege,' Holden said. 'All through his career, him and I would come not to physical blows but disagreements on certain things. We always ended up friends. That was Tommy. 'That's the way Tommy took off after he was told he was HIV-positive,"" Holden added. ""When he first was told, I was taking him to seek treatment and to different doctors around the country. And then he started research on the Internet and started saying it was a conspiracy. He went in that direction and never looked back.'","The Duke took on big names, including Lennox Lewis and George Foreman .

'One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind, ‘said Neil Armstrong  as he landed on the surface of the moon 45 years ago and left the first footprint in the new age of space travel. The spacecraft’s two parts consisted of the command module called the Columbia manned by Collins and the Eagle manned by Armstrong and Aldrin. 'The Eagle has landed,' Armstrong famously said as the Eagle safely arrived at a moon basin called The Sea of Tranquility with only 40 seconds of fuel left to burn. After Armstrong set foot on our moon, Buzz Aldrin followed behind him and the two men read from a plaque that said, 'Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D.

CNN reports that Neil Armstrong acted as the commander, Buzz Aldrin was the lunar module pilot and Michael Collins acted as the command module pilot. The crew traveled 240,000 miles from Earth to the moon in just 76 hours. Networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC spent somewhere between $11 and $12 million on coverage from Apollo 11 and covered the mission from Sunday morning to Monday evening. Networks televised a two-minute call between President Nixon who spoke to Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin by radio from the Oval Office of the white house in what some call 'the most historic phone call ever made.'

"The illegal drug ketamine could be used to treat severe depression, new research shows . An illegal drug has successfully been used to treat NHS patients with serious depression. Infusions of ketamine had a rapid beneficial effect on patients who were not responding to more orthodox treatments. Some were suffering from unremitting depression that had plagued them for years despite various drugs and talking therapies. Although many patients taking part in the trial at Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust relapsed within a day or two, almost 30 per cent showed improvements lasting at least three weeks. In 15 per cent of cases, patients took more than two months to relapse and some benefited for eight months. Ketamine, a horse tranquilliser, has become a popular recreational drug on the dance club scene. It is due to be upgraded from Class C to B amid increasing concern over its physical and psychological effects. There is evidence of users as young as 20 having to have their bladders removed due to heavy consumption of the drug. But the doses used in the patient trial were much lower than those on the street and side effects were minimal, even though the drug was injected rather than swallowed. Psychiatrist Dr Rupert McShane, from Oxford University, said: ‘Ketamine is a promising new antidepressant which works in a different way to existing antidepressants. ‘We wanted to see whether it would be safe if given repeatedly and whether it would be practical in an NHS setting. We especially wanted to check that repeated infusions didn't cause cognitive problems.’ He added: ‘We've seen remarkable changes in people who've had severe depression for many years that no other treatment has touched. It's very moving to witness. ‘Patients often comment that that the flow of their thinking seems suddenly freer. Most patients treated with ketamine relapse within a few days, but 30 per cent benefit for at least three weeks . ‘For some, even a brief experience of response helps them to realise that they can get better and this gives hope.’ Results from the first 28 patients treated with ketamine are reported in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. Either three or six infusions of up to 80 milligrams of ketamine were administered during the three-week course of treatment. Ketamine is a horse tranquilliser and in humans it can cause severe bladder problems . Memory tests were conducted a few days later and patients reported their mood symptoms daily via text or email. None of the patients suffered memory or bladder problems. Some became anxious, a few were sick and one fainted. Most trial participants experienced temporary ‘dissociative’ effects, marked by distorted perceptions and a feeling of being disconnected with their body, while the infusions were taking place. A total of 400 infusions have now been given to 45 patients. ‘Intravenous ketamine is an inexpensive drug which has a dramatic, but often short-term, effect in some patients whose lives are blighted by chronic severe depression,’ said Dr McShane. ‘We now need to build up clinical experience with ketamine in a small number of carefully monitored patients. ‘By trying different infusion regimes and adding other licensed drugs, we hope to find simple ways to prolong its dramatic effect.’ The Government announced last month that it planned to reclassify ketamine. As a Class B drug, the maximum penalty unlawful possession will increase from two to five years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for trafficking offences will continue to be 14 years in jail.","The drug has been given to patients in Oxford with promising results .

"Councils are being forced to slash millions from school maintenance budgets to pay for Nick Clegg’s controversial plan to provide free school meals to all infant children, a report warns today. The Local Government Association (LGA) says that councils will be left more than £25million out of pocket as a result of the policy championed by the Liberal Democrat leader. The LGA report also warns that the plan, which comes into force next month, could have an impact on learning in some schools because lunch times may have to be extended to cope with demand, leaving less time for lessons. A Lib Dem spokesman said last night it was right to make free school meals a priority . David Simmonds, the chairman of the LGA’s children and young people board, said that while free school meals could have benefits for children, councils were being forced to raid other parts of the schools budget to pay for them. Mr Simmonds said: ‘Councils and schools have been working really hard to make this happen within this ambitious timescale. But it cannot be right that for some councils, money set aside for maintenance has instead had to be spent plugging the shortfall in money which government should have provided for meals. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's controversial plan to provide free school meals to all infant children means Councils are being forced to slash millions from school maintenance budgets to pay for it . ‘This research makes it clear central government has not provided schools with enough money to do the essential work necessary to give 1.5 million children a free meal at lunchtime. It is councils and schools who are picking up the bill for this work, at a time when budgets are already squeezed and tough decisions are being taken.’ A survey of 150 major local authorities found that half of those responding had been forced to subsidise the free school meal programme. The average bill was just under £500,000. Councils responding to the survey reported spending £25.8million of their own cash to prepare for the introduction of the policy at the start of the new school year. But the true figure is likely to be far higher as only half of those contacted responded to the survey. Church schools, which have to fund 10 per cent of all capital projects from their own funds, are said to have been hit particularly hard. The findings will fuel criticism of Mr Clegg for pressing ahead with the eye-catching announcement at last year’s Lib Dem conference before detailed work had been done on the practicalities and likely costs. A survey of 150 major local authorities found that half of those responding had been forced to subsidise the free school meal programme . The decision led to a furious row with the then Education Secretary Michael Gove who was charged with trying to make the policy work. Aides to Mr Gove said Mr Clegg pressed ahead with the plan despite warnings it was unaffordable. Labour’s education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: ‘Hard-pressed schools and councils are being forced to bail out the Government because of its own incompetence. Nick Clegg announced the policy without doing the maths first.’ A total of £150million was set aside to pay for improvements such as new kitchens and extended dining areas. But councils have warned the money underestimated the true cost. Today’s report warns that despite the extra spending some schools will only be able to provide packed lunches and others will be forced to deploy portable kitchens. A Lib Dem spokesman said last night it was right to make free school meals a priority. He said: ‘Free school meals are good for children’s attainment, make sure they eat more healthy food, and will save parents money. That’s why the Liberal Democrats are proud to be delivering them in government and we believe councils should prioritise them too.’","LGA says councils will be left more than £25m out of pocket because of the policy .

"The Hubble Space Telescope has given astronomers their clearest view yet of Comet ISON, which experts believe could light up the sky in a breathtaking display later this year. The image of . Comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) was photographed on April 10, when the comet was . slightly closer than Jupiter’s orbit at a distance of 386 million miles . from the Sun, and 394 million miles from Earth. Experts believe it will get dramatically brighter as it swings around the sun in late November, with some claiming the comet could shine brighter than Venus or even the full moon. Scroll down for video . Comet C/ISON was imaged with the Hubble Space telescope on April 10 using the Wide Field Camera 3, when the comet was 394 million miles from Earth . Preliminary measurements from the Hubble images suggest that the nucleus of ISON is no larger than three or four miles across. This is remarkably small considering the high level of activity observed in the comet so far, said researchers. The comet’s dusty coma, or head of the comet, is approximately 3,100 . miles across, or 1.2 times the width of Australia. A dust tail extends . more than 57,000 miles, far beyond Hubble’s field of view. Even at its current distance, the . comet is already active as sunlight warms the surface and causes frozen . volatiles to sublimate. Comets become more active as they near . the inner solar system, where the Sun’s heat evaporates their ices into . jets of gases and dust. A detailed analysis of the dust coma surrounding . the solid, icy nucleus reveals a strong jet blasting dust particles off . the Sunward-facing side of the comet’s nucleus, Nasa says. Like all comets, ISON is a 'dirty snowball'  a clump of frozen gases mixed with dust, formed in a distant reach of the solar system, traveling on an orbit influenced by the gravitational pull of the Sun and its planets. ISON’s orbit will bring it closest to the Sun, of 700,000 miles on November 28. 'As a first-time visitor to the inner . solar system, Comet C/ISON provides astronomers a rare opportunity to . study a fresh comet preserved since the formation of the solar system,' said Planetary Science Institute Research Scientist Jian-Yang Li, who . led a team that imaged the comet. 'The expected high brightness of the comet as it nears the Sun allows . for many important measurements that are impossible for most other fresh . comets.' An enhanced image reveals enhanced dust particle release on the sunward-facing side of the comet's nucleus, and the small, solid body at the core of the comet . Next week while the Hubble still has the comet in view, the Maryland team will use the space telescope to gather information about ISON’s gases. 'We want to look for the ratio of the three dominant ices, water, frozen carbon monoxide, and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice,' said Maryland astronomy Prof. Michael A’Hearn. 'That can tell us the temperature at which the comet formed, and with that temperature, we can then say where in the solar system it formed.' Preliminary measurements from the Hubble images suggest that the nucleus of ISON is no larger than three or four miles across. This is remarkably small considering the high level of activity observed in the comet so far, said researchers. The comet’s dusty coma, or head of the comet, is approximately 3,100 miles across, or 1.2 times the width of Australia. A dust tail extends more than 57,000 miles, far beyond Hubble’s field of view. Comets are dusty balls of ice, which generally originate from the Kuipler belt - a region of icy small bodies beyond Neptune. Occasionally, a comet gets dislodged from its orbit, and plunges in to the inner solar system. They differ from asteroids, which are made of metal or rock, and are usually the left over remnants of planets or moons. Comets are not really reflective - they only reflect 4 per cent of the the Sun's rays, about the same as coal. So although they look brilliantly white from Earth, they are black at the surface. Halley's . comet is the most well-known, named after Edmond Halley who noted the . regular 75-76-year appearance of a comet, and predicted it would return . in 1758, although sadly the astronomer died 16 years before he was . proved correct. Halley's comet has passed within a fraction of the Earth before - in 1910 the Earth even moved through the comet's tail. Sadly, the 1986 re-appearance was the worst for 2,000 years, as the Earth and the comet were on opposite sides of the sun.","Comet could shine brighter than Venus or even the full moon in November .

"How do you stop the world’s fastest car? With the world’s strongest brakes, of course. The team behind the Bloodhound SSC have revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour to zero. The engineers based in Bristol have been trying to find brakes that can withstand the huge temperatures and stresses of the vehicle - and they might now have the answer. Scroll down for video . The Bloodhound SSC is being built by a British team based in Bristol. The world record attempt will be made in South Africa's Kaksken Pan, a large patch of desert 2 miles (3 kilometres) wide and 12 miles (19 kilometres) long, in the coming years . The Bloodhound SSC is a supersonic car in development, with the goal of setting a remarkable new world land speed record. A jet engine accelereates the car from rest to just over 300 miles (480 kilometres) per hour in about 30 seconds. At this point the rocket is ignited, increasing accelerationto about 2g. Maximum speed, 1,050 miles (1,690 kilometres) per hour, will be reached after about 55 seconds. At this point the parachute and air brakes will be deployed, slowing the car to 160 miles (260 kilometres) per hour with a deceleration of 3g. It is here that the world’s strongest brakes, made from steel rotors, will then be applied, slowing the wheels from 10,000 revolutions per minute down to zero. The British project, based in Bristol, hopes to break 1,000 miles (1,600 km) per hour in the coming years with former RAF Pilot Andy Green at the ‘wheel’. To get to that speed requires extraordinary power, but figuring out how to then stop the thin steel wheels has posed a problem. After the ‘car’ reaches its top speed, air brakes and parachutes will slow it to 160 miles (260 kilometres) per hour. Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60 miles (95 kilometres) per hour in a normal car to zero in one second - for 20 seconds. This last stint to zero is where the problem lies, however. Even at this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute. The Bloodhound SSC (pictured) is a British attempt to become the first car in the world to break 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour, breaking the world land speed record in the process. The vehicle is currently under development with the groundbreaking run scheduled for some time in the next few years . The SSC stands for ‘SuperSonic Car’, because the Bloodhound will be going faster than the speed of sound. The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both a jet and rocket. It is designed to go over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) per hour. The slender body, 46 feet (14 metres) long, keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic. It weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower. That’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a Formula 1 starting grid put together. In the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new  land speed record. Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach. Instead, they switched to steel rotors from brake manufacturer AP Racing. In tests these proved much more promising, withstanding temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F). They even survived to such an extent that they can be used again. The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced. But hopes are high that they could be the solution to bring the Bloodhound safely to a halt. The current land speed record stands at 763.035 miles (1,227.985 kilometres) per hour, set by former RAF pilot Andy Green (who will also drive the Bloodhound) back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. The Bloodhound will beat this record by some distance if it is successful. It will take the vehicle 55 seconds to accelerate to its top speed of 1,000mph (1,600kph), where a mile will be covered in just 3.6 seconds, and at this speed the drag on the car will be 20 tonnes. The brakes shown here might be the answer to helping slow the car from these tremendous speeds .","Bristol engineers behind Bloodhound SSC have revealed how it will stop .

"Former Brazil striker Adriano was charged by Rio de Janeiro prosecutors on Tuesday for his alleged connection with drug trafficking. Prosecutors claim the striker bought a motorcycle and gave it as a gift to a known drug dealer in the shantytown where he grew up. It will be up to a judge whether to accept the charges. Adriano could face up to 10 years in prison if he is convicted. Former Brazil striker Adriano leaves the Public Ministry after being interviewed by police . Adriano has been accused of gifting a motorbike to a drug dealer that was later used for trafficking . It is not the first time he has been investigated for his alleged ties to drug trafficking in Rio, but he had never previously been charged. Several years ago, prosecutors had requested a probe into Adriano's purchase of the motorcycle, which allegedly was registered in the name of the drug dealer's mother and was used for drug trafficking. Prosecutors on Tuesday did not request Adriano's arrest but asked for him to surrender his passport, claiming the player has enough money to try to flee the country if wanted. Adriano and his lawyers could not be immediately contacted for comment. The 32-year-old forward reportedly has been negotiating with second-division French club Le Havre to return to football after several months without a club. He travelled to France recently to meet with club officials, and French media reported that a deal was close. The 32-year-old has hardly played over the last two years because of injuries and off-field problems . Adriano is reportedly close to a move to French Ligue 1 side Le Havre . Adriano played a few games with Brazilian club Atletico Paranaense earlier this year after being out of action for nearly two years because of injuries and off-field problems.

"Most people know that no two snowflakes are exactly alike. But to see how they become unique hexagonal wonders requires a microscope. Now one man has created a beautiful video showing how the flakes grow to form their hexagonal shapes in incredible detail. Scroll down for video . A water droplet freezes around a dust particle in the air, creating an ice crystal. More water molecules land on the crystal and create the hexagonal shape as they extend six ways to form arms. The reason the flakes have six lines of symmetry is because of the hydrogen bonds in water crystals. The precise nature of the shape created depends upon the temperature and the humidity. Snowflakes with long needles-like arms form in warmer temperatures, while very circular ones are created in colder climates. Russian video maker Vyacheslav Ivanov filmed the formation of the hexagonal ice crystals to produce a two minute ‘microscopic time-lapse'. The flakes are created when a water droplet freezes around pollen or a speck of dust in the air, creating an ice crystal. Then more water molecules land on the crystal, creating the hexagonal shape as they extend six ways along the ‘arms’. These ice crystals that make up snowflakes are symmetrical because they reflect the internal order of the crystal’s water molecules as they arrange themselves in predetermined spaces to form a six-sided snowflake, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) explained.

Bailey, who in 1989 helped the American government tackle an outbreak of Ebola among rhesus monkeys being used for research, told the LA Times: 'We know for a fact that the virus occurs in sputum and no one has ever done a study [disproving that] coughing or sneezing is a viable means of transmitting. 'Unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air are ""misleading"".' Dr C J Peters, who has undertaken research into Ebola for America's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told the paper: 'We just don't have the data to exclude it [becoming airborne].' Meanwhile virologist Dr Philip K Russell, a former head of the U.S Army's Medical Research and Development Command, told the paper: 'I see the reasons to dampen down public fears. But scientifically, we're in the middle of the first experiment of multiple, serial passages of Ebola virus in man.... God knows what this virus is going to look like. I don't.' In September, Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, writing in the New York Times, said experts who believe that Ebola could become airborne are loathed to discuss their concerns in public, for fear of whipping up hysteria. Discussing the possible future course of the current outbreak, he said: 'The second possibility is one that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private: that an Ebola virus could mutate to become transmissible through the air.' The public is being told by health officials that the virus that causes Ebola cannot be transmitted through the air and can only be spread through direct contact with bodily fluids . Dr Osterholm warns viruses similar to Ebola are notorious for replicating and reinventing themselves. It means the virus that first broke out in Guinea in February may be very different to the one now invading other parts of West Africa. Pointing to the example of the H1N1 influenza virus that saw bird flu sweep the globe in 2009, Dr Osterholm said: 'If certain mutations occurred, it would mean that just breathing would put one at risk of contracting Ebola.' Dr Osterholm said public health officials, while discussing the possibility in private, are reluctant to air their concerns. Virus expert Charles L. Bailey said unqualified assurances that Ebola is not spread through the air are 'misleading' 'They don't want to be accused of screaming ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater - as I'm sure some will accuse me of doing. 'But the risk is real, and until we consider it, the world will not be prepared to do what is necessary to end the epidemic.' He called for the United Nations to mobilise medical, public health and humanitarian aid to 'smother the epidemic'. The chair of the UK's Health Protection Agency, Professor David Heymann of the London School of Hygiene of Tropical Medicine, said it is impossible to predict how any virus will mutate. He said scientists across the world do not know enough about genetics to be able to say how the Ebola virus will change over time. He told MailOnline: 'No one can predict what will happen with the mutation of the virus. I would like to see the evidence that this could become a respiratory virus.' The first person diagnosed with Ebola in the U.S. died on Wednesday despite intense but delayed treatment, and the government announced it was expanding airport examinations to guard against the spread of the deadly disease. The checks will include taking the temperatures of hundreds of travelers arriving from West Africa at five major American airports. The new screenings will begin Saturday at New York's JFK International Airport and then expand to Washington Dulles and the international airports in Atlanta, Chicago and Newark. An estimated 150 people per day will be checked, using high-tech thermometers that don't touch the skin. The White House said the fever checks would reach more than 9 of 10 travelers to the U.S. from the three heaviest-hit countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. President Barack Obama called the measures 'really just belt and suspenders' to support protections already in place. Border Patrol agents now look for people who are obviously ill, as do flight crews, and in those cases the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is notified. As of Wednesday, Ebola has killed about 3,800 people in West Africa and infected at least 8,000, according to the World Health Organization. A medical official with the U.N. Mission in Liberia who tested positive for Ebola arrived in the German city of Leipzig on Thursday to be treated at a local clinic with specialist facilities, authorities said. The unidentified medic infected in Liberia is the second member of the U.N. mission, known as UNMIL, to contract the virus. The first died on September 25. He is the third Ebola patient to arrive in Germany for treatment. The virus has taken an especially devastating toll on health care workers, sickening or killing more than 370 of them in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone - places that already were short on doctors and nurses. There are no approved medications for Ebola, so doctors have tried experimental treatments in some cases, including drugs and blood transfusions from others who have recovered from Ebola. The survivor's blood could carry antibodies for the disease that will help a patient fight off the virus.","Public is being told that Ebola can only be transmitted by direct contact .

"American billionaire Charles Koch is involved in a secretive funding organization to undermine the science of global warming, it has been claimed. The Donors Trust and the Donors Capital Fund, both based in Alexandria, Virginia, have been funding the climate counter-movement which seeks to cast doubt on the climate change while keeping its wealthy backers anonymous, The Independent has said.

"A $150million U.S. Army airship crash landed in woods today after it could only reach half of its expected altitude on a test flight. The unmanned solar-powered airship was only in the air for less than three hours after it launched in Akron, Ohio, on Wednesday morning. It ascended as planned up to 32,000ft but the Lockheed Martin airship then encountered problems and was not able to get up to 60,000ft. Scroll down for video . 'Controlled descent': The unmanned solar-powered airship was only in the air for less than three hours after it launched in Ohio on Wednesday morning .

"The 'Peking Man', an ancient human ancestor, donned clothes and may have been an expert fire-builder. Scientists have built up a remarkable account of what life was like for the early human, who existed between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago. They have been studying the Chinese cave where the Peking Man fossils were first discovered in 1923. Scientists have re-excavated the cave in the village of Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, where fossils of early humans, dubbed the Peking Man, were initially found . The famous Peking Man skull went missing after in 1941 when it was being transported to the U.S. from China during WWII. Scientists have revisited the site to discover more details about our ancient ancestor . The re-excavation, in the village of Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, has unearthed fascinating details proving our ancestors were more advanced than previously believed. The Peking Man was outfitted, wearing animal hides that had been softened using stone tools. Belonging to the species Homo erectus, the Peking Man was able to make fire, work wood and bizarrely drilled holed in objects for as yet unknown reasons. Discoveries: A bust of the Peking Man at the Zhoukoudian World Heritage Site, Beijing . Using powerful microscopes, the scientists are examining tools used by the Peking Man to gain more details about their use. Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Science said that a 3,000-year-old living room, or 'activity floor', had been discovered in the cave, containing what could be a fireplace. Chen Shen, a curator at the Toronto Museum and a special member of the academy, said that it was also likely the species had attached stone points to sticks, creating spears. The discovery could be significant as it shows the Peking Man potentially joining two materials to form a tool. The Chinese cave system is one of the most important Palaeolithic sites ever discovered. Archaeologists unearthed thousands of stone tools and hundreds of fragmentary remains from about 40 early humans as they worked on the site between 1921 and 1966. The human remains discovered in the cave were later assigned to the species Homo erectus. The original fossils of the Peking Man vanished in 1941 as they were being transported to America at the peak of World War II. A number of techniques have attempted to accurately date the remains numerous times over the years but have failed to find a definitive answer. Early discovery: Scientists originally found the fossilised remains of the Peking Man in 1923 but only now are they establishing details, such as that the homo erectus species may have been able to build and master fire . Likeness: Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History putting muscles on a cast of the Peking Man's face . Scientists believe the discoveries at the Zhoukoudian cave may finally prove that the Peking Man could control fire despite the low temperatures of northern China. The team also believes that the Peking Man was working wood, with the possibility that they were creating wooden tools. While the exact details of the dig have not been finalised, the initial findings will fascinate scientists. The fossils revealed that the ancestors drilled holes but scientists have no idea what purpose this activity fulfilled. The findings may also be significant because of their timing with scientists in South Africa recently discovered that another early human ancestor was making spears 500,000 years ago. Similarities: A modern human (Homo sapiens) skull, left, compared with the Peking Man skull (Homo erectus), right . Swedish . scientist Johan Gunnar Andersson and American colleague Walter W. Granger first arrived in Zhoukoudian in 1921 where they were directed to . the site by quarrymen. Upon arrival at the cave Andersson announced: 'Here is primitive man, now all we have to do is find him.' The . confidence was well-founded as the scientists had just discovered what . would become one of the most important paleontological sites in the . world. Anderrson . found human molars at the site but it was Canadian scientist Davidson . Black who made some of the most significant discoveries, despite his . initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the . world. Around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the Japanese invasion. Fossils . were placed in the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Peking Union . Medical College for safe-keeping, before being packed up for the U.S. in . 1941. But the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern China. It is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on Japanese ship the Awa Maru in 1945. U.S. financier Christopher Janus appealed for information on their . whereabouts in 1972, promising a reward of $5,000. One woman made . contact, demanding $500,000, but this failed to materialise. The . Chinese Government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to . coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII.","Scientists are re-excavating Chinese cave to examine ancient human tools .

"North Korea announced that it will quarantine foreigners for 21 days over fears of the spread of the Ebola virus, even though no cases of the disease have been reported in the reclusive country, or anywhere in Asia, and very few foreigners are allowed to enter. North Korea is always on guard against outside influences, but now that it perceives the deadly disease to be a threat, its anxiety has reached a new level. It has banned tourists, put business groups on hold and is looking even more suspiciously than usual at every foreign face coming across its borders. Case in point: when a high-level delegation from Japan arrived in Pyongyang this week, two of the first people they met were dressed in full hazmat gear. Nothing left to chance: Medical personnel in protective suits stand by an ambulance at the Sunan International Airport, in Pyongyang, on Monday . The steps also send a message to the North Korean people to be very afraid of the outside world and of outside influences. An announcement distributed Thursday to diplomatic missions in Pyongyang said that, regardless of country or region of origin, all foreigners will be quarantined under medical observation for 21 days. Foreigners from affected areas will be quarantined at one set of locations, while those from unaffected areas will be sent to other locations, including hotels. The staff of diplomatic missions and international organizations will be allowed to stay in their residences. Tourist visits to North Korea were halted last week, so few were likely to still be in the country. North Korea announced that it will quarantine foreigners for 21 days over fears of the spread of the Ebola virus. Pictured is the Worker's Monument in Pyongyang . Foreigners from affected areas will be quarantined at one set of locations, while those from unaffected areas will be sent to other locations, including hotels. Pictured is the Reunification Arch in Pyongyang . Most tourists do not stay for 21 days. It was unclear if they or others already in North Korea on shorter stays, for example on business, would have to remain for the quarantine period. North Korea's frantic response to the Ebola outbreak, including the broad but so far poorly defined ban on foreign tourism, is also surprising because it admits so few foreigners at all. Other than diplomatic and government missions, it has virtually no contact with any of the countries that have been most affected in west Africa, though Africa is one of the places it has tried to develop good relations. Kim Yong Nam, the head of North Korea's parliament, is now touring the continent, though not Ebola-impacted areas. The strict measures shed some light on how the bureaucracy in North Korea tends to work, and on the isolated country's often-fearful views of the outside world in general. Last week, after rumors began to circulate among the small foreign community in Pyongyang that draconian measures were in the offing, North Korea's state media announced that travelers and cargo would be subject to stricter monitoring at airports, seaports and railway border crossings. Daily reports are being broadcast on television news and during evening programming to increase public awareness of the disease and its symptoms. North Korea's Korean Central Television aired a news story on Sunday that showed quarantine officials strengthening inspections of people and boats moving in and out of the port city of Nampo. 'Our army, which protects our borders, has a high responsibility to block the disease,' Han Yong Sik, director of the Nampo inspection center, told the network. 'We are strengthening quarantine education and thoroughly inspecting boats and planes to ensure that not even a single person carrying the disease enters our country.' So far, there has been no official statement in North Korea's English-language media outlining the tourism ban or other restrictions on travel. There was, and remains, little information about what groups are affected, whether travel out of North Korea will be stopped and under what conditions the restrictions would be lifted. That, of course, has left potential travelers scratching their heads - and businesses bleeding money. North Korea's frantic response to the Ebola outbreak, including the broad but so far poorly defined ban on foreign tourism, is also surprising because it admits so few foreigners at all . 'It was poorly communicated,' said a post Monday on the website of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based organization that specializes in promoting business and educational exchange with North Korea. 'This didn't allow stakeholders time to prepare for it. For Choson Exchange, we could be seeing potentially tens of thousands of dollars of losses as we delay training programs, and possibly even more as this drags on. 'For businesspeople, a shutdown will likely hurt their investment plans or transactions.' Uri Tours, a U.S.-based travel agency that specializes in tours to North Korea, already had informed potential customers that tours have been halted, and that anyone coming to North Korea from certain areas may be quarantined. The new quarantine announcement - though slim on details - suggests a much broader response. A copy of the document, dated Wednesday and issued by North Korea's Non-Standing National Emergency Prevention Committee, was obtained by The Associated Press. More than 13,700 people have been sickened in the Ebola outbreak, and nearly 5,000 of them have died. Nearly all the cases are in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, though there were 20 in Nigeria, four in the U.S. and one each in Mali, Senegal and Spain. Uri Tours says it believes the ban on tourists is just temporary - and is holding out hope that they may be able to return in December. North Korea's reaction isn't unprecedented. It closed its borders for several months in 2003 during the scare over SARS. But that was a much more obvious threat. SARS affected China, and Beijing is where most flights into Pyongyang originate. In the case of Ebola, North Korea's efforts to defend itself from what appears to be a tiny risk may end up alienating it from foreigners who have been willing to invest here. 'Overall, this episode seems to reflect two things. First, a callous attitude toward stakeholders in the country's development stemming from poor communications or the lack of will to communicate,' said the Choson Exchange blog. 'Second, that North Korea's `fear of the foreign' outweighs their interest in whatever benefits foreign investment brings.'","Anxiety about the outside world has reached new levels in North Korea .

"A British ice-cream maker has invented a dessert which can help with erectile dysfunction - by flavouring the batch with Viagra. The Arousal flavour contains around 25mg of Viagra per scoop. It was created on specific request from a celebrity customer of South Wales ice cream company, Lick Me I’m Delicious. Inventor Charlie Harry Francis added the Viagra to the ice cream and used champagne for flavour to complete the bespoke recipe.

For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 milligrams. Mr Francis says he was approached by an ‘A-list celebrity’ to create the very specific flavour for a party, and spent a few days perfecting the recipe. He said: ‘It's all very secretive. We had to sign a confidentiality agreement so I can't reveal the name of the client. ‘All I'm allowed to say is it was for a party and that they were very happy with the end result and that I made “the required amount”.' Double up: The recommended dose of Viagra is 50mg - or two scoops of the ice cream . ‘Because it was for a celebrity they're being cagey about what I can say about it.’ Mr Francis, who last year succeeded in making the world’s first glow in the dark ice cream using Jellyfish luminescence protein, says that although creating the ice cream was great fun, sourcing the Viagra was ‘embarrassing’. His team is currently working on creating the world's first flammable ice cream.

"Scientists are learning how children's brains change as they develop intellectual abilities like reading and math - by letting them watch Sesame Street. The team at the University of Rochester are using brain scans to study watching to children's TV show to see how neural pathways change as we develop. They say it could pave the way for new understanding of brain development, and even lead to new therapies for learning disabilities. What your brain looks like on Big Bird: One one the team's neural maps. The fMRI scan on the left represents correlations in neural activity between children and adults, in the middle between children and other children, and on the right between adults and other adults. Unlike X-rays, CAT scans, and other . types of brain imaging, fMRI involves no risks, injections, surgery, or . exposure to radiation. Using magnetic fields, the scans virtually . segment the brain into a three-dimensional grid of about 40,000 pixels, . known as voxels, and measure the neural signal intensity in each of . those tiny sectors. For example, researchers have compared scans of adults watching an entertaining movie to see if neural responses are similar across different individuals. 'But this is the first study to use the method as a tool for understanding development,' said lead author Jessica Cantlon, a cognitive scientist at the University of Rochester. Eventually, that understanding may help pinpoint the cause when a child experiences difficulties mastering school work. 'Psychologists have behavioral tests for trying to get the bottom of learning impairments, but these new imaging studies provide a totally independent source of information about children's learning based on what's happening in the brain,' says Cantlon. For the investigation, 27 children . between the ages of 4 and 11, and 20 adults watched the same 20-minute . Sesame Street video. Like the regular program, the recording featured a . variety of short clips focused on numbers, words, shapes, and other . subjects. The researchers analysed brains scans of both children and adults as they watched Sesame Street characters, such as Bird Bird, shown here, to see how their brains developed as they learnt . The study produced 609 scans of each participant, one every two seconds, as they watched Big Bird, the Count, Elmo and other stars of the educational series. Using statistical algorithms, the researchers then created 'neural maps' of the thought processes for the children and the adults and compared the groups. The children then took standardized IQ tests for math and . verbal ability. Children whose neural maps more closely resembled the neural maps of adults scored higher on standardized math and verbal tests. In other words, the brain's neural structure, like other parts of the body, develops along predictable pathways as we mature, the team said. The study also confirmed where in the brain these developing abilities are located. For verbal tasks, adult-like neural patterns in the Broca area, which is involved in speech and language, predicted higher verbal test scores in children. Puppeteer Jerry Nelson, who died last year, is shown with 'Sesame Street' character Count von Count. Researchers are using the show to study how we learn . For math, better scores were linked to more mature patterns in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a region of the brain known to be involved in the processing of numbers. Although the study does not advocate TV watching, it does show that 'neural patterns during an everyday activity like watching television are related to a person's intellectual maturity,' says Cantlon. 'It's not the case that if you put a child in front of an educational TV program that nothing is happening–that the brain just sort of zones out. Instead, what we see is that the patterns of neural activity that children are showing are meaningful and related to their intellectual abilities.'","Team showed children and adults 20 minute long Sesame Street videos while giving them brain scans .

"A trainee doctor who was dumped by his ex-girlfriend for being 'too chubby' has become a professional bodybuilder. Jack Darby, 23, from Wolverhampton, was made to feel ashamed of his rounded 14.5 stone build and decided getting into shape was the best revenge. The medical student at Leicester University has spent the last 18 months bodybuilding to achieve his muscular physique - and can now lift one and a half times his own body weight. Jack Darby piled on the pounds after boozy nights out at Uni (left) but is now a bodybuilder (right) - he has spent the last 18 months lifting weights to achieve his muscly physique . 'I've been walking around campus and have definitely noticed girls looking my way,' he said. 'Before, I was pale and podgy and I felt uncomfortable taking my top off, but now I'll happily walk around naked.' Four years ago Jack, who is 5ft 11in, felt embarrassed taking off his shirt in public, and was worried that his rounded belly and love handles were a turn off. He regularly ate fast food and developed a beer belly after boozy nights out. Happily loved up with his long-term girlfriend, Jack, then 19, became uncomfortable when she compared him with other men with toned physiques. 'She never told me I was fat, but she kept dropping hints about going to the gym and I noticed her looking down at my gut,' he said. 'We'd be sat drinking in a pub and I'd see her eyes following fit, muscly guys. She'd also swoon over men on the TV saying, ""You could be like that if you wanted to be"".

Jack piled on the pounds after boozy nights out at Uni, pictured left and right, before he began his transformation . Looking down at his sagging belly, he was determined things could change and started doing weight training in his room. After six months of pumping iron and doing cardio at the university gym Jack transformed his average midriff into a ripped set of abs. He was so proud of his sculpted new body that he decided to take it further and began bodybuilding. 'I knew I was shaping up and my friends were amazed,' said Jack, who now boasts just six per cent body fat. 'I'd been watching all these videos of bodybuilders and fitness models on YouTube and decided I wanted to be just like them. My friends laughed at me, but I knew I could do it.' Instead of scoffing on junk food, Jack cut out the carbohydrates and began training every morning before going to work at Leicester Hospital. 'All I wanted was to get rid of my tummy at first, but it's become so much more than that,' he said. 'Girls who usually wouldn't even look at me are all over me now.' Soon, . Jack will be working as a full-time doctor, but he also hopes to become . a personal trainer in his spare time. He has lost three stone of fat . and replaced it with pure, raw muscle.

"Scientists have discovered a military fortress previously thought to have been destroyed under the prison yard at Alcatraz, the San Francisco Bay former prison and current tourist attraction. Using radar technology, researchers from Texas A&M University found the remains of military buildings and tunnels dating back to 1850. The fort was built as San Francisco's fortunes boomed with the discovery of gold in California and it proved to be of strategic value at the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hidden: Beneath the prison yard of Alcatraz, scientists have discovered a fortress that was long thought destroyed . Strategic: Before the gold rush in California, San Francisco was a small town with little need of protection, but afterwards it became an important port city . 'From 1850 to 1907 was the era of Fortress Alcatraz,' Texas A&M Professor of Geology and Geophysics Mark Everett told BBC News. No shots were ever fired from the Alcatraz fortress, and at the beginning of the 20th century it was repurposed as a federal penitentiary. The fortress buildings were thought to have been destroyed - until now. 'The main prison building was built in about 1915, and we have photographs showing how the rec yard was constructed,' says Professor Everett. Scanning for secrets: Mark Everett (left) and grad student Tim DeSmet (right) taking underground readings on Alcatraz . Deep underground: The red lines show where the fortress buildings lie beneath the present-day prison structures . 'But what we don't really know is . what exactly became of the fortifications, what state they are in and . what is left of the cultural resources. And although it is not always . desirable to excavate, with geophysics we can help people to know what . is below the surface without actually disrupting it.' The . Texas A&M team is using a radar that penetrates the ground and send . signals to a receiver, which reflects the structures under the ground. Scans . of the prison yard have revealed a subterranean tunnel system that . would have been used to transport people and ammunition, and would have . been covered in earth to protect it. Former life: Taken in 1868, this photo shows one of the many cannons that formed the garrison . Military history: In 1903 it was turned into a military prison, then it was made into a state penitentiary in 1934 . 'We get signatures that indicate there is not only a tunnel, but magazine buildings too.' Another expert, California State University Chico's Dr Tanya Wattenburg Komas, says parts of the fortifications were earthen and covered over with concrete that would have arrived in barrels from Europe, since the U.S. was not producing its own at that time. It is some of the oldest concrete in existence in the United States. Fort buildings: Testing on the parade ground shows that a large structure exists beneath the ground that researchers believe to be a caponier . Locked up: Prisoners would spend most of their time in tiny cells on the island, occasionally spending an hour in the yard beneath which lay the remains of the fortress . Everett and his team believe the most exciting discovery is lying in wait for them under the parade ground at the southern end of the island. 'It is called a caponier, and it is a large structure that juts out into the bay and provides defensive cover. We have seen it in the old photographs but it has completely disappeared from present view,' Everett told BBC News. The radar shows a very large structure exists beneath the ground. Archaeologists hope to begin excavating the area soon. Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary was home to the 'worst of the worst.' During its 29-year life as a prison, beginning in 1934, some of the country's most notorious prisoners passed though its cells, including Al Capone and James 'Whitey' Bulger.","Radar scanning has revealed parts of a fortress that occupied Alcatraz are intact beneath the prison .

"A female anteater left zoologists at a Connecticut conservation center baffled after unexpectedly giving birth more than a year and a half after being separated from her mate. Officials at the LEO Zoological Conservation Center said they had removed the only male anteater from the enclosure in August, long before the six-month gestation period for baby Archie would have begun. However, the mystery of how Armani the anteater eventually  conceived has finally been revealed as  'embryonic diapause' . It's not virgin birth in the strict sense of . the phrase, however embryonic diapause happens when a mother puts a fertilized . egg on hold in her uterus. How did Archie come into being? Embryonic diapause - not virgin birth in the strict sense of the phrase, but embryonic diapause happens when a mother puts a fertilized egg on hold in her uterus . Mysterious anteater birth: Little Archie, pictured, was unexpectedly born at a Connecticut conservation center after his mother and father were separated months prior . No male mate: Officials at the LEO Zoological Conservation Center told the Greenwich Time they had removed the only male anteater from the enclosure in Augus, but little Archie was born in April regardless . If environmental conditions aren’t right, the mother can prevent the fertilized egg from implanting and developing for long periods of time. The process has never been observed in an anteater, however it has been documented in armadillos. Whilst zookeepers may not have witnessed Armani with her male companion, Alf, at some point they actually were together. Some scientific papers have mentioned . the scenario in which an animal's body pauses a pregnancy until . environmental conditions are right. ‘When she gives birth, her entire . uterus is going to clear out,’ Stacey Belhumeur, species survival plan . coordinator for the North American population of giant anteaters, told . the Greenwich Time. ‘Anything that's in her uterus, even another undeveloped embryo, would clear out.’ Egg delay: Marcella Leone, founder and director of the conservation center, suspects this might be a rare case of delayed implantation, when fertilized eggs remain dormant in the uterus for a period of time (Stock photo) For weeks there had been theories as to how Armani became pregnant. Some had suggested parthenogenesis, or for want of a better term, a virgin birth. During such cases, the embryo grows and . develops in the absence of fertilization. It sounds unusual—some might . even say miraculous—but it’s a surprisingly common occurrence in the . animal kingdom. Researchers believe that an absence of available males likely drives the phenomenon. Although . the exact mechanisms of parthenogenetic reproduction can vary from . species to species, all parthenogenesis produces normal, healthy . offspring.","Armani the anteater hadn't been with her mate in the months before she conceived .

"Of all the places you'd expect to find an 8ft snake that squeezes rats and birds to death, central London probably wouldn't be the first. But a colony of the beasts has been living beside the capital's Regent's Canal - despite being powerful enough to kill a small cat or dog. Now a row has broken out after a government quango said the snakes were an 'invasive species' which could be culled, even though they may have been living peacefully in the city for decades. Invasive: A colony of around 30 Aesculapian snakes has been living by London's Regent's Canal (file photo) It is not known for certain where the snakes came from, but it is thought their ancestors may have escaped several years ago from London Zoo. They are native to central Europe and are already a foot long when they hatch, before growing to their adult length of four to five feet. Some have been recorded growing up to 8ft long. It is thought the snakes' ancestors may have escaped from London Zoo (file photo) The snakes are non-venomous, and instead kill small animals by constricting them. But now the animals face a possible cull after a government quango, the London Invasive Species Initiative, marked them as a 'non-native species of high concern'. The quango put the species in its second highest-priority group and said the snakes would require 'control, management, eradication etc.' It added staff would have to 'establish ecology, breeding sites and methods of removal'. The plans come despite a colony of the animals having lived peacefully for several decades in north Wales after they escaped from the Welsh Mountain Zoo, in Colwyn Bay. Dr Wolfgang Wuster of Bangor University, who works with the Welsh colony, hit out at the plans as a possible waste of resources. He said: 'Any attempt to eradicate the Aesculapian snake would require justification of resources to be devoted to an almost certainly non-problematic introduced species with little prospects of spread, as opposed to the many far more damaging species already out there. 'From a wider and more philosophical point of view, we should ask ourselves what we can really conserve. Popular: The Regent's Canal is a summer hangout for thousands of people - but they have not been alone . 'Given the near certainty of massive . global climate change over the next century, the idea that we can treat . the UK fauna and flora like some kind of pre-industrial vicarage garden . and preserve it forever without any changes is simply farcical.' LISI . manager Karen Harper said: '[The] Aesculapian snake species is listed . in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, meaning it is illegal to allow . the species to spread or escape into the wild.

"When the Ebola began to savage thousands West Africans, it was Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head, Dr. Thomas Frieden, who promised Americans that a similar 'widespread outbreak' would not occur in the U.S. After the first Ebola patient was diagnosed in the U.S., it was Frieden who took to national television to assert that nation's top doctors 'know how to stop Ebola spreading in hospitals.' And when the man who brought Ebola to the U.S. died last Wednesday, Friden was the Obama administration official tasked with announcing that the U.S. government was 'stepping up protection for people coming into this country and for Americans related to travel.' Frieden, not the 'Nation's Doctor,' has been at the forefront of the Ebola crisis throughout the last several months, leading some Americans to wonder why the surgeon general hasn't led the administration's efforts to stop the spread of the deadly disease in America. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Tom Frieden has been giving press briefings on the Ebola virus from the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, rather than the surgeon general, who is commonly referred to as the 'Nation's Doctor' Frieden has become of the face of the Obama administration's efforts to stop the spread of Ebola because it's nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, pictured here in February, has not been confirmed by the Senate because of his controversial views on gun violence . Currently the U.S. does not have a permanent surgeon general. President Barack Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy to fill the spot last November after the previous surgeon general vacated the position. Murthy's nomination has been tied up in the Senate since March amid concerns from conservative, gun rights group, the National Rifle Association, that the Harvard and Yale educated doctor would seek to implement restrictions on the Second Amendment if he were confirmed for the position. British-born Murthy is a supporter of President Obama's efforts to reduce gun violence by restricting the sale of certain firearms. In October of 2012 he sent the following tweet out from his twitter account: 'Tired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting lives at risk b/c they're scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue.' The NRA and it's powerful lobbying arm pounced on the statement after Murthy, who also co-chaired a group called Doctors for Obama, was nominated and warned Senators that they would punish them  if they voted to confirm the 36-year-old doctor as the spokesman for the government's public health initiatives. At a nomination hearing before a Senate subcommittee in February, Murthy testified that his views on gun control would not affect his ability to serve as surgeon general . 'My concerns with regard to issues like gun violence have to do with my experience as a physician, he further explained and 'seeing patients in emergency rooms.' But that didn't quell the NRA's concerns that he may allow his political beliefs to seep into his medical work. In mid-March a spokesman for the organization told the New York Times that 'given Dr. Murthy’s blatant activism on behalf of gun control, that’s not a gamble we’re willing to take.' As a result, Murthy's nomination has still not come for a vote before the Democratically-controlled Senate - more than six months later - as vulnerable Democrats in conservative-leaning states have tried to distance themselves from anti-gun efforts ahead of November's federal elections. Murthy's fight to become surgeon general had mostly been forgotten amid a number of other high-level scandals and resignations that have hit the White House in recent months until Ebola showed up on America's shores. Now, liberals in the media are arguing that Murthy, not Friden, should be out calming Americans and cautioning them on how they can avoid contracting the disease. 'Murthy has no business sitting around and waiting to be confirmed. The Obama administration should have been raising holy hell, demanding that a pre-eminent doctor get his vote on the Senate floor,' News One Now host Roland Martin wrote in an op-ed for The Daily Beast titled Where the Hell Is the Surgeon General? Martin argued that the Obama administration should use Murthy 'as the poster child for a nasty, devilish lobbying group being the de facto fourth branch of government.' Likewise, MSNBC's Krystal Ball wrote in a joint op-ed with MSNBC producer Anne Thompson that 'thanks to NRA power and Senate cowardice, we are left with no surgeon general during a time when, we not only have Ebola arriving on our shores, but are also dealing with the mysterious Enterovirus, which is infecting and contributing to the deaths of children in the U.S.' Ball and Thompson said that Frieden has 'his own vital work to attend to as both head of the CDC and the U.S. Ambassador to the World Health Organization' and shouldn't have to divide his time doing the surgeon general's job, as well. While the U.S. does have an Acting Surgeon General, Rear Admiral Boris D. Lushniak, MD, he has opted to stay behind the scenes throughout the Ebola scare and defer to Friden, instead. Former Health and Human Services Director Michael Levitt, a George W. Bush cabinet member, told the Washington Post last week that in his opinion, it's not critical that the U.S. does not have a permanent surgeon general at this time nor is it crucial that the agency's acting director is allowing Frieden to take the lead on Ebola outbreak prevention. 'The surgeon general has a big brand, but in terms of their capacity to execute health response, that really isn’t their responsibility, and this is a job that CDC is well equipped for and they have physicians more authoritative on this particular subject,' he said. The nation's most recent surgeon general, Regina Benjamin, disagreed. Asked for her thoughts on the situation, the former Obama administration official told WaPo 'there’s a major role in any crisis, in any potential crisis, any potential event that people are concerned about' for the surgeon general. 'We need that level of trust and conversation that there is someone there in Washington as America’s doctor,' she said.","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Thomas Frieden has been the face of the Obama administration's Ebola outbreak efforts .

"Britain’s economy grew even more this year than previously thought - outstripping all other major countries, official figures revealed this morning. The Office for National Statistics confirmed the economy grew by 0.8 per cent between April and June. But it revised up its estimate for how fast it had grown over the last year to 3.2 per cent – from 3.1 per cent. It means the economy is now growing at the highest level since the end of 2007 - and faster than the US, Germany, France, Japan and Italy. Scroll down for video . The British economy has soared away from the US, Germany, France, Japan and Italy over the past year . Chancellor George Osborne wants the next election to focus on the economy . The figures are a further boost to the Chancellor George Osborne who hopes to use the economic boom to bash Labour ahead of next year’s general election. A survey published today suggests Mr Osborne’s message has some traction with the public – with voters giving most of the credit for the recent growth to the Tories. Asked how much the coalition would benefit on election day from its record on the economy, 8 per cent thought it would get ‘significant credit’ and 44 per cent predicted ‘some credit’. Voters thought that 65 per cent of the credit should go to the Conservatives and 35 per cent to the Liberal Democrats. The latest growth figures reiterated that the UK had finally climbed out of its longest downturn since the war, with GDP finally surpassing the 2008 pre-recession peak by 0.2 per cent. It contrasts sharply to the dismal picture in the eurozone, where growth ground to a halt over the second three months of the year after France managed zero growth, while the German economy shrank. Overall, Britain is expected to record the strongest economic growth of any of the major world economies. However, Labour have claimed the boom is not being felt by ordinary families – with wages actually falling by 0.2 per cent last year. But today’s poll, published in the Times, shows that voters believe the issue of unemployment - at its lowest level since the end of 2008 - is more important than higher earnings. More than half - 58 per cent - of those surveyed chose lower unemployment as the most important issue, while 40 per cent who opted for better pay. It comes on the same day that another poll shows the Conservatives drawing level with Labour. A YouGov poll for The Sun puts both parties on 35 per cent of the vote, with the Lib Dems lagging on 8 per cent and Ukip on 12 per cent. Labour argues the economic recovery is not benefiting ordinary families, who have seen stagnant wages squeezed by inflation . Today’s figures also revealed that beleaguered construction industry did not perform as badly as had been thought, posting flat quarter-on-quarter growth compared to the initial estimate of a 0.5 per cent slump. Figures also confirmed that growth in the April-June period was led by the dominant services sector, which represents three-quarters of output and grew one per cent quarter-on-quarter, while manufacturing could manage only 0.2 per cent. The Bank of England revised upwards its forecast for UK GDP growth this year from 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent this week. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Today’s figures confirm that our economy has recovered all of the output lost in the great recession, and is now bigger than its previous peak in the first quarter of 2008. ‘The Government’s long-term economic plan is working, with the economy growing at its fastest annual rate in six years.’","Official figures confirm economy grew by 0.8% between April and June .

"A strange ghost town that spent a quarter of a century under water is coming up for air again in the Argentinian farmlands southwest of Buenos Aires.

She lived in the town until the flood forced her family to desert their home. 'I think my pets could feel that the water was coming,' she added. Now the water has mostly receded, exposing what looks like a scene from a movie about the end of the world. The town hasn't been rebuilt but it has become a tourist destination again, for people willing to drive at least six hours from Buenos Aires to get there, along 340 miles (550km) of narrow country roads. People come to see the rusted hulks of automobiles and furniture, crumbled homes and broken appliances. They climb staircases that lead nowhere and wander through a graveyard where the water toppled headstones and exposed tombs to the elements. It's a bizarre, post-apocalyptic landscape that captures a traumatic moment in time. One man refused to leave. Pablo Novak, now 82, still lives on the edge of the town, welcoming people who wander into the wrecked streets. 'Whoever passes nearby cannot go without coming to visit here,' Novak said. 'It's getting more people to the area, as they come to see the ruins.' When the flood came, people fled with what they could, and within days their homes were submerged under nearly 10 metres (33 feet) of corrosive saltwater.

Many residents of Epecuen fled to nearby Carhue, another lakeside town, and built new hotels and spas, promising relaxing getaways featuring saltwater and mud facials. 'Not only do we have Epecuen with the ruins and its natural wealth, but we also can increasingly offer other alternatives,' said Javier Andres, the local tourism director. The spooky town provided the perfect backdrop to 2010 film And Soon The Darkness - a thriller starring Karl Urban. In the 1970s more rain than usual was delivered to the surrounding hills and Lago Epecuen began to swell. In 1985, the salty waters broke through the clay dam, and Villa Epecuen was flooded .

"Ever wanted to see what's going on with the weather in the world at this very second? Now you can thanks to an interactive map that lets you see temperature, rainfall, winds and more in countries across the globe. Called MeteoEarth you can navigate around the 3D globe below using your mouse, while selecting the icons on the right hand side will also reveal different types of weather. MeteoEarth.com was launched by MeteoGroup, headquartered in London, one of Europe’s leading private weather companies. The technology which powers MeteoEarth.com has been adapted from a professional broadcasting tool used by TV presenters around the world . Impressive 3D graphics compliment the high-end gaming technology used to fully engage the user with exploring the world’s weather. For people who are simply interested in gaining a general overview of the world’s weather conditions, they can choose from a selection of weather layers; ranging from precipitation and cloud cover, to wind direction and temperature. They can zoom in to focus on different areas of the world, zoom out to get a global overview, or even rotate the globe using the mouse. For the more avid weather enthusiasts, there is the option to observe tropical storms by simply clicking a button to be guided towards an area on the globe where a tropical storm is occurring, with a line showing its path. Once here, there are details of the storm’s name, wind, gust and overall speed. Different layers of weather information can be built up to visualise the storm in its entirety. An interactive map from Europe's MeteoGroup lets you watch the weather unfold around the world. By selecting different icons weather of varying types can be watched live in different countries. For example users can see the global cloud cover or also where it is raining at the moment. The interactive map even tracks the path of tropical storms (shown in Central America ) and shows where wind is moving on Earth . The interactive map will also show isobars (seen here above the UK), which reveal high and low-pressure systems (pictured). In order to make the air pressure comparable, no matter what height you’re at, the air pressure is converted to the mean sea level. As a comparison value, the barometric (atmospheric) pressure is shown in white, high pressure areas are in red and low air pressure is in blue . What will weather reports be like in 2050? Rather dramatic and unnerving if climate change gets out of hand, researchers have claimed. In a series of videos this month the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) will reveal how the effects of global warming could affect our planet in the future. The fictional weather reports will describe how droughts, floods and heat waves could cause problems in the next 30 years. In addition a built-in screenshot feature provides an easy way to take particular weather images of a certain area, capturing still images of weather situations. The frame of the map can be altered to include close-up sections of the map or zoomed out to get a more global overview. The data on MeteoEarth.com comes from a forecast model by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. This is then refined by MeteoGroup using their own algorithms, and finally visualised on the website in the interactive map.. The data on MeteoEarth.com is updated twice per day. It comes from the forecast model each day at 0:00UTC and 12:00UTC and the data is updated at 6:00UTC and 18:00UTC. This is all an automated process with no human interaction, although MeteoGroup tells MailOnline their in-house developers are currently working on improving this process to offer an even more ‘live’ representation. 'This website will help to educate users with no prior meteorological experience about the weather,' said David Kaiser, Head of Consumer at MeteoGroup. 'The breathtaking graphics combined with the wealth of information about each weather feature provides an engaging demonstration of the world’s current weather and is sure to provide hours of entertainment to anybody viewing it.'

"Teenage girls so obsessed with copying stick-thin celebrities are starving themselves so they can achieve a 'thigh gap'. Young women have become fixated with their legs not touching and hope to emulate the thin frames of models such as Cara Delevingne and Eleanor Calder, girlfriend of One Direction member Louis Tomlinson. Admirers of the look - which demands legs so thin that they do not touch above the knees, have created Twitter accounts dedicated to the pair's 'thigh gap'. Role models: Teenage girls hope to emulate the slender frames of Cara Delevingne and Eleanor Calder . Young Twitter users say they are desperate to lose weight so they can copy the girls' look - even if it means denying themselves food. The Daily Star said Twitter users had threatened to 'starve themselves' to reach the 'longed-for look'. Websites promoting the desired thigh gap show thousands of images dedicated to the achievement of losing weight until they have a space between their thighs. And young women are using social networking technology to share tips and pictures and 'inspire' each other's misguided attempts to copy their favourite celebrities. In April last year Alexa Chung was forced to remove a picture of her and her mother from her Instagram account after she was accused of being 'thinspiration' for vulnerable fans. The model and presenter is known for her very slim frame, but fans felt that this picture made too much of her shockingly slim legs. Admirers of the models' thin legs have set up Twitter accounts and websites dedicated to them . Alexa Chung was forced to remove this picture of her and her mother from Instagram following a backlash from her followers . After two hours of followers having . dissected her body image, Miss Chung replied to the negative commentary, . writing: 'Ok everyone thanks for the teen angst discussions.' She continued: 'People are different . sizes. I'm not trying to be thinspo for anyone,' in response to . accusations she is contributing to the current 'thinspiration' culture . of young girls. While opinion was divided, with many . defending the former MTV host, and some openly praising her slender . frame, the overwhelming response was negative. One commenter wrote: 'I'm going to be . very honest. I look at this picture and think ""This is a woman not . eating."" Thus, I worry for women everywhere.' Another remarked: 'THIS degree of skinny is frankly alarming, sadly.' Miss Chung made a final reply, before deleting the post altogether: 'I am now making this acct private. Byyyyyeeee.' Speaking to OK! about her online . bullying stress, she explained: 'It basically got really nasty and they . were like, ""We're going to stab you.""' She continued: 'It was genuinely . horrible. I stopped using Twitter for a while because I got so much s**t . about being anorexic. And I'm not.' The original queen of lean Kate Moss made thigh gaps and Hunters all the rage at Glastonbury back in in 2005. Seven years later the model still has a thigh gap, although her softer shape means that it is less pronounced . Susan Ringwood, chief executive of eating disorder charity B-Eat, told The Daily Star: 'Hardly anyone has a thigh gap without being underweight, or not yet fully adult.' The number of people using social networks to share 'thinspirational' images that encourage eating disorders has seen a worryingly sharp rise. Photo-sharing website Instagram banned the use of hashtags using pro-anorexia keywords last April, it was widely praised. But now Beat says the site still isn't doing enough. Although users attempting to search keywords such as 'thinspiration' or 'proanorexia' can no longer do so, more than 300,000 images featuring frighteningly thin women or acts of self harm are still available on the site. Despite removing more than 30,000 graphic photos, the site's 80 million users can still access 'thinspo' content simply by using 'eating disorder' as the search term. If you need information or advice about an eating disorder, contact Beat.

"With its sweeping glass roof and viewing tower popping out against the countryside, this high-tech house looks just like the type of pad an evil mastermind might call home. Indeed, this sophisticated lair was given a starring role in the climax to the third series of Sherlock where it appeared as Appledore - home to the fabled detective's latest nemesis, Charles Augustus Magnussen. But instead of housing the great and good's most protected secrets, the eight-bedroom mansion in fact boasts a bowling alley and a squash court, and is owned by one of the country's leading engineers Sir David McMurtry. Scroll down for video . The real-life Appledore: This is the eight-bedroom, ten-floor mansion which played the home of Sherlock Holmes' new nemesis, Charles Augustus Magnussen . The country mansion, which boasts a viewing tower as well as a panorama room, is owned by businessman Sir David McMurtry, who spent £30 million on his home . Viewers of the popular BBC detective series were almost as wowed by the luxury home as they were by Sherlock's powerful powers of deduction when it appeared on screen on Sunday night. Master blackmailer Magnussen, played by The Killing star Lars Mikkelsen, was seen descending the building's sweeping spiral staircase, and lounging on an enormous white leather sofa in the sprawling property, under a magnificent glass-panelled ceiling. The huge mansion, which is really called Swinhay House, was designed for Sir David, the head of . high-tech precision engineering firm Renishaw. Set on ten floor levels and boasting a . viewing tower located 14.5m above the lower ground floor level, the property is tucked away near Wotton-under-Edge in the south Cotswolds, and cost Sir David - who was knighted in 2001 for design and innovation - more than £30million to complete. However, the businessman does not actually live at the 30,000sq ft mansion, and instead stays at a more modest property because his wife Terry believes it is too flashy. The building, shaped to his own vision of sustainability, has eight bedrooms, set in three separate wings, as well as an eight-bay underground garage. Around one of the bedroom wings flows a water canal that cascades into a lagoon. Swinhay House was designed for Sir David, the head of high-tech precision engineering firm Renishaw . A significant amount of Sunday night's episode of Sherlock, broadcast on BBC One, was filmed at the site in the south Cotswolds . Based near Wotton-under-Edge in the south Cotswolds, the property cost Sir David - who was knighted in 2001 for design and innovation - more than £30 million . It also has a two-lane bowling alley, . a 25m swimming pool and a squash court as well as boasting a . fully-enclosed, glazed winter garden and a panorama room, and as well as the latest episode of Sherlock has also provided a dramatic backdrop to a number of fashion shoots. Sir . David got planning approval to build the mansion in 2000 under guidance . that allowed for the creation of houses of exceptional architectural . interest within the green belt. According to Roberts Limbrick’s website, a third of the 23,250 sq ft property's floor space is located ‘partially underground behind a highly insulated waterproof concrete structure’. It says: ‘The house is highly energy efficient with sophisticated computer controlled environmental systems. ‘It is also extremely well insulated and great care has been taken to eliminate thermal bridging. Alternative energy sources include a geothermal heating system. ‘The house contains large areas of glazing and the orientation of the building was carefully tuned to maximise passive gains. The glazing is triple layered gas filled units with integral blinds and could only be sourced and procured from Scandinavia.’ In the final episode of the third series of Sherlock, which was broadcast on BBC One on Sunday night, Appledore was the home of Charles Augustus Magnussen . It has a two-lane bowling alley (pictured), a 25m swimming pool and a squash court as well as boasting a fully enclosed and glazed winter garden and a panorama room . Its 60 acres of manicured parkland and gardens dominate an estate covering more than 230 acres of woodland, fields and orchards .

Its principal architect was David Austin, who has won awards for his environmentally friendly approach to construction. A striking solar-insulated glass atrium covers the mansion's indoor recreation area and the pool and leads the eye to a bow-shaped gallery capped by a glass turret with panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. The house is spread across 11 levels that incorporate several self-contained apartments, a Jacuzzi and sauna and a games and TV room. Architect Andy Rathbone designed the parkland and gardens, the most striking feature of which is a curving lake, which has extraordinary bird sculptures and serves as an eco-friendly heat-exchanging system to control the temperature in the house.

"Albert Einstein: He was right about the expansion of the universe . Albert Einstein has been proved correct in his view of how the universe is expanding, according to a scientific study released today. The new test of Einstein's view of the universe has proved him right with ‘incredible accuracy’ and is helping scientists to understand the mysterious acceleration of the universe. A team of cosmologists have announced at the National Astronomy Meeting being held at the University of Manchester the most accurate measurement ever made from when the expansion of the universe began to accelerate. It means that the phenomenon can be explained using just Einstein's general theory of relativity and the cosmological constant - the simplest theoretical explanation for the acceleration of the universe. The results will be used to understand what is causing the acceleration and why, and will shed new light on dark energy - the name adopted for the fundamental agent driving the acceleration about which little is known. The cosmologists from the University of Portsmouth and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics have examined the period between five and six billion years ago when the universe was almost half its present age and made measurements of extraordinary accuracy - within 1.7 per cent. The findings support Einstein's general theory of relativity which predicts how fast galaxies, separated by large distances, should be moving toward one another and at what rate the structure of the universe should be growing. The conclusions are consistent with the concordance model of a universe that bloomed from the big bang 13.7billion years ago. Team member Dr Rita Tojeiro said: ‘The results are the best measurement of an intergalactic distance ever made, which means cosmologists are closer than ever to understanding why the universe's expansion is accelerating. ‘One of the great things about Einstein's general theory of relativity is that it is testable. Our results support the theory and are fully consistent with the notion that constant vacuum energy - empty space creating a repulsive force - is driving the acceleration of the universe. ‘These are profound statements that describe the physics of our universe at the most fundamental level. ‘Critically, the results find no evidence that dark energy is simply an illusion stemming from our poor understanding of the laws of gravity - Einstein's theory has passed its most stringent test yet at extra-galactic scales.’ Jeff Forshaw, professor of theoretical physics at the University of Manchester and co-author with Brian Cox of The Quantum Universe: Everything That Can Happen Does Happen, underlined just how important the study has been. He told MailOnline: 'Understanding the cosmological constant represents possibly the biggest unsolved mystery in physics. Einstein's theory anticipates its existence but modern theories of particle physics fail spectacularly to predict its value. Accurate measurements like these are vital in order to unravel this conundrum.' Ironically, he added, Einstein thought his cosmological constant was a mistake and didn't like it at all. The experiment was designed to follow up on an observation made in 1998, when scientists studied the brightness of mighty stellar explosions to deduce that the universe's expansion is, against all odds and against our understanding of fundamental physics, becoming increasingly fast. The new discoveries are based on work by a collaboration of astronomers from across the globe representing the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), part of the third Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), which is mapping the three-dimensional positions of more than one million galaxies. Way to grow: The universe began 13.7billion years ago and is now expanding at a mind-boggling rate, for reasons that have yet to be discovered . Professor Will Percival, head of this team at the university's Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation, said: ‘Dark Energy was only discovered 14 years ago, and there's this feeling that we are still riding the wave of discovery. ‘It's a very exciting time to be a cosmologist.’ ‘We see the influence of dark energy on cosmic structure, but we have no idea what it is. The data gathered by this survey will help answer that question,’ said Daniel Eisenstein from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the director of SDSS-III. Maps of the universe like BOSS’s show that galaxies and clusters of galaxies are clumped together into walls and filaments, with giant voids between. These structures grew out of subtle variations in density in the early universe, which bore the imprint of “baryon acoustic oscillations” -- pressure-driven acoustic (sound) waves that passed through the early universe. Billions of years later, the record of these sound waves can still be read in our universe. ‘Because of the regularity of the ancient sound waves, there’s a slightly increased probability that any two galaxies today will be separated by about 500 million light-years, rather than 400 million or 600 million,’ said Eisenstein. In a graph of the number of galaxy pairs by separation distance, that magic number of 500 million light-years shows up as a peak, so astronomers often speak of the ‘peak separation’. The position of this peak depends on the amount of dark energy in the universe. But measuring the distance between galaxies depends critically on having the right distances to the galaxies in the first place. That’s where BOSS comes in. ‘We’ve detected the peak separation more clearly than ever before,’ said Nikhil Padmanabhan of Yale University. ‘These measurements allow us to determine the contents of the universe with unprecedented accuracy.’ Meanwhile, Einstein's brain has gone on show as a star attraction at an exhibition of human brains. Slice of genius: Two sections of Einstein's brain are on display at the Wellcome Trust in London . Other brains on display at The Wellcome Trust, London, include those of Charles Babbage and William Burke. The exhibition, Brains: the mind as matter, includes more than 150 objects such as rare images of real brains, artworks, manuscripts, artefacts, videos and photography. Curator Dr Marius Kwint, art historian and University of Portsmouth lecturer in visual culture, said: ‘The exhibition shows how a single, fragile organ has become the object of modern society's most profound hopes, fears and beliefs, and some of its most extreme practices and advanced technologies. ‘The different ways in which we have treated and represented real, physical brains open up a lot of questions about our collective minds. ‘The brain is the most complex entity in the known universe and the exhibition is a fascinating exploration of how humans have tried to come to terms with this infinitely mysterious organ.’","Dark energy was only discovered 14 years ago .

"Edward Snowden, the former government contractor behind the biggest security leak in U.S. history, has been pictured for a new magazine cover cradling the American flag to his cheek. The image of the 31-year-old hacker, who was recently granted another three years of asylum in Russia, has drawn strong opinions after it was published on Wednesday by Wired. Oliver Willis, a blogger for Media Matters, tweeted: 'He should be hugging the russian flag, or maybe putin himself.' Dan Gainor, a VP of Business and Culture for Media Research Center, posted: 'Snowden is both a whistle-blower AND traitor.Went out of his way to hurt US. This is BS. #wiki' Edward Snowden, pictured on the September issue of Wired, cradling the American flag. The former NSA contractor, who leaked classified documents, revealed that the NSA have developed a program called MonsterMind which can respond to cyber-attacks without human intervention . Mr Gainor later added: 'Snowden went out of his way to warn US - good, then went out of his way to release material to harm US abroad, treasonous.' Miriam Elder, from Buzzfeed, described the article as an 'amazing read' but added: 'The greatness of the Snowden story is unfortunately matched by the ridiculousness of the cover photo.' Stefania Maurizi, a journalist for Italian news publication, L'Espresso, described it as a 'must read'. The controversial shot was taken by Platon, one of the world's most highly-respected photographers, who previously snapped Valdimir Putin for a 2007 Time magazine cover. Wired editor Scott Dadich revealed that Snowden had to think hard before posing for the shot. Dadich wrote: 'He [Snowden] said he was nervous that posing with the flag might anger people but that it meant a lot to him. He said that he loved his country. He cradled the flag and held it close to his heart.' The Stars and Stripes used for the Snowden shot also came with its own history. Dadich revealed that it was the same flag Platon had draped around a naked Pamela Anderson for a cover shot in 1998 for the now-defunct George magazine. Snowden used the exclusive interview to reveal further government secrets about a secretive NSA cyber-attack program, MonsterMind, and to explain why he would volunteer to go to jail - but only under the right circumstances. He told the magazine: 'I told the government I’d volunteer for prison, as long as it served the right purpose…I care more about the country than what happens to me. 'But we can’t allow the law to become a political weapon or agree to scare people away from standing up for their rights, no matter how good the deal. I’m not going to be part of that.' Snowden faces espionage charges in the U.S. that carry a sentence of up to 30 years but Russia has no extradition treaty with Washington. Snowden, the former government contractor who instigated the biggest leak of government documents in u.S. history, has been living in Moscow after seeking asylum from Russia . MonsterMind not only has the capability to detect incoming cyberattacks but can also counterattack - with no human intervention at all, according to Snowden. This could lead to catastroph because cyberattacks are often routed through computers in innocent third countries. The 31-year-old told Wired: 'These attacks can be spoofed...You could have someone sitting in China, for example, making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia. And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital. What happens next?' Last year, the former systems analyst was granted temporary asylum of one year in Russia, but that expired on August 1. His lawyer said last week that he had been granted permission to stay in Russia for three more years. Snowden is wanted in the U.S. for leaking details about the National Security Agency's snooping operations. The spokesman for the White House National Security Council, Ned Price, said Snowden needed to return to the United States to face charges related to the leaks. In his latest interview with Wired, Snowden said the NSA has exaggerated the number of documents that he stole from them - a number far lower than the 1.7million that has been claimed. The IT specialist said that he purposely left a digital trail so that investigators could tell exactly what he took and what he only touched - but government auditors didn't find it. He said: 'I figured they would have a hard time. I didn’t figure they would be completely incapable.' He speculated that the documents he stole - the majority of which he has not read - may hold a secret about a senior government figure which would destroy careers. He said: 'I think they think there’s a smoking gun in there that would be the death of them all politically. 'The fact that the government’s investigation failed - that they don’t know what was taken and that they keep throwing out these ridiculous huge numbers - implies to me that somewhere in their damage assessment they must have seen something that was like, ''Holy s***.'' And they think it’s still out there.' He refused to answer whether he believed his leak of confidential documents influenced the reported leaks of more documents from the American intelligence community but spoke of the NSA's lack of control over its own sprawling operation. Snowden told Wired magazine that he would be happy to go to prison for his actions but that he wanted it to be for the right reasons . Snowden said of the agency: 'They still haven’t fixed their problems. They still have negligent auditing, they still have things going for a walk, and they have no idea where they’re coming from and they have no idea where they’re going. 'And if that’s the case, how can we as the public trust the NSA with all of our information, with all of our private records, the permanent record of our lives?' Snowden spoke of his concerns over program MonsterMind which had the ability to not only detect cyberattacks but would respond - without any human involvement in the decision. Snowden said that because cyberattacks are often routed through innocent third party countries that leaves the U.S. open to unwittingly making an enemy out of someone who was not involved. There are other disturbing shock waves from the actions of the NSA, Snowden told Wired. When Syria lost Internet connection in the midst of its civil war in 2012, the outage was caused by the NSA, Snowden claimed. He told Wired that while working for Booz Allen in early 2013, he was told by another employee that a division of NSA hackers had tried to infiltrate a major internet provide in Syria the year before, giving them access to much of the country's private communications. But the U.S. government operation failed - and instead, the hacking attempt blocked a router in Syria, causing the entire country to be thrown offline. WIRED's September issue with cover story, The Most Wanted Man in the World, is on newsstands on August 26. Commentators on Twitter shared their outrage over the Snowden cover, describing him as a 'traitor' and telling him he should be hugging the Russian flag . The flag used for the Wired September cover is the same one that photographer Platon had used with Pamela Anderson in a 1998 shoot for the late JFK Jr's magazine, George .","Snowden gave the interview in Moscow where he is currently living after being approved for asylum for the next three years .

"A soldier who faced losing most of his pension after he was made redundant has been granted a transfer within the Army that means he will now receive his full entitlement. Sergeant Michael Anderson, 35, of the Royal Dragoon Guards, was 72 hours away from qualifying for a substantial Army pension when he was told he was to lose the job he had held for nearly 18 years. As a result, he and his wife Jolene, 32, who live in service housing in Catterick, North Yorkshire, feared he would miss out on a sum totalling almost £175,000. Sergeant Michael Anderson, 35, pictured with his . wife Jolene, 32, had faced losing his job with the Army three days before he . would qualify for his full pension - but he has now been given the opportunity for a transfer . The case had fuelled suspicions that . the Army, which is shedding 20,000 personnel in a cost-cutting exercise, . was targeting those within touching distance of generous lifetime . payments. And it sparked criticisms that the Government was breaking the Armed Forces Covenant, the nation's duty of care to troops. But today, after significant media . coverage and a petition signed nearly 100,000 supporters, the Ministry . of Defence said Sgt Anderson had been given the chance to take on a new . role in the Army. An MoD spokesman said: 'There have . been a number of inaccuracies reported surrounding an individual soldier . in an online petition. 'We can be clear that the individual . in question has successfully applied for a transfer to another branch . within the Army, and subject to successful completion of training will . not be made redundant. 'The individual is fully aware of this . and has been kept informed throughout the process. We will continue to . work with him to secure his transfer within the Army.' In a statement, Sgt Anderson added: . 'There has been a considerable amount of misunderstanding surrounding an . online petition with the aim of securing my pension. 'I was selected for redundancy but . have applied for transfer to another service within the Army. I have . been successful in the application process and am looking forward to . beginning training for my new role.' Poppy: Mrs Anderson has written an open letter to the Prime Minister asking for better treatment for her soldier husband . It comes after Mrs Anderson started an . online petition on change.org asking the Prime Minister to give her . husband his job back that by tonight had been signed by nearly 100,000 . people. Mrs Anderson, whose husband has served . in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq, wrote on the site: 'When Michael . was informed of his redundancy I felt like my heart had been ripped out, . more for Michael than me. 'Everything he knew and had worked for . from the age of 16 taken away. We had planned on using the pension to . secure a mortgage when we left army accommodation and to support our . young family while Michael established a new career on civvy street. 'After a life of service for our country our family's financial security has now been cruelly snatched away from us.' She said calling it a 'pension' was . incorrect, arguing that the military pension was 'the key financial . promise on which personnel are recruited, retained and promoted'. Sgt Anderson, a father of two, whose . case was first reported by the Mail in July, has been a soldier since he . was 18 years old. The non-commissioned officer has also served as a . casualty visitor, providing support for the families of killed or . injured troops. He was told in June that he had been . selected for compulsory redundancy from his job as a welfare officer . with a 12-month notice period, ending on June 18 2014. Had he been allowed to work until June . 21, he would have qualified for an immediate pension and tax-free lump . sum worth an estimated £261,278 over his lifetime . Instead he faced a redundancy payout of £87,417, with a £4,374-a-year pension once he reached 60. In the preamble to the petition . started by Mrs Anderson, a mental health care manager, she wrote how she . and her husband had felt 'honoured to be part of the Army family' and . said they wanted to continue to be part of it. And now they have the chance after her . husband was offered a transfer to another branch of the Army - an . opportunity that means he will be able to collect his full pension. If Sgt Anderson successful completes the training for the new job, he will now longer face redundancy. And even if he fails the training . programme he will be eligible for his immediate pension due to the time . spent on his ongoing transfer process. The MoD's spokesman added: 'All those made redundant will receive an Armed Forces pension and a generous compensation package. 'Inevitably we have to draw the line somewhere, but those who are close to their immediate pension point ...will receive a larger tax-free lump sum in compensation.' Army pensions are one of the key selling points to would-be recruits, and guarantees retired soldiers a full monthly pension based on their final salary. One of its chief attractions is the fact that contributors to the scheme do not have their salary deducted each month, as in many other pension schemes. After two years of regular service, soldiers are entitled to receive the pension when they are 65. Soldiers who serve for 12 years will receive a tax-free resettlement grant to ease them into their civilian life. And anyone who is over 40 and has served at least 18 years can claim an immediate pension and tax-free lump sum when they leave the Army, with a second lump sum when they turn 65. From April 2015 changes to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme will come in, meaning soldiers will have to work for 20 years rather than 18 before they can qualify for a full pension. The new scheme will also see retired soldiers able to claim at a reduced rate, rather than the full rate, from the age of 55 until they reach the planned state pension age of 67.","Sgt Michael Anderson, 35, was to be made redundant just 72 hours short of the 18 years service he needed to collect his full Army pension .
Case sparked accusations that the Army was seeking to save cash by targeting soldiers close to generous lifetime payments for redundancy .
But now the MoD says Sgt Anderson has applied for transfer to another job within the Army and will be entitled to his full retirement package ."
"Basildon mayor Mo Larkin, 66, has ended her relationship with John Handley, also 66, after it was revealed that his illustrious past was a fabrication . A mayor's consort who boasted of a distinguished past serving as a diplomat and in the armed forces is actually a TV repair man turned cleaner, it was revealed today. John Handley, 66, who accompanied Basildon mayor Mo Larkin, also 66, to official functions during their four-year relationship, told people he had helped the peace process in Palestine after being hurt in 'friendly fire' while serving in the Gulf War. But Handley, who was also called 'Dr' on official council correspondence because he said he had a PhD in law, was today exposed as a fantasist  - and dumped by his Conservative mayor lover. Rival Labour councillors are now calling on Mrs Larkin to quit and have asked Essex Police to investigate whether the mayor and her grey-haired lover, whom she met in 2006, had committed misconduct in public office. Mrs Larkin, who this summer was criticised after she was pictured looking at her phone during an Armed Services Day ceremony, issued a statement distancing herself from Mr Handley after it was revealed he he had lied about his past. She said: 'Following allegations and rumours that have been circulating for some time about John Handley, I would now like to make it public that I ended our relationship last week. 'I will always put the reputation of Basildon borough and that of the office of the mayor above my personal feelings.' Mrs Larkin insisted that her ex-boyfriend had not influenced her political work for Basildon Council and said it was 'up to him' to deal with any further accusations. Mr Handley, who lives in Southend, said: 'I am just a member of the public.  We are not a couple any more so it's not an embarrassment to her. 'I have never been a part of the council or a Conservative.  I have only ever driven Mo to places and enjoyed her company. 'I adore the woman, but that's it.' As the mayor's consort, Mr Handley accompanied her to official engagements including meeting the Essex High Sheriff Julia Abel Smith, in white trouser suit, left, and former star footballer Sir Geoff Hurst, right, in jeans . Mr Handley is seen on the far right, with file, accompanying Mrs Larkin to a 2012 Remembrance Sunday parade . As the mayor's consort, Mr Handley drove her to functions where he rubbed shoulders with celebrities, politicians and dignitaries ranging from singer Will Young to football legend Sir Geoff Hurst. At official engagements he boasted of his illustrious past, telling people he served in the Royal Navy before working on the peace process in Palestine. He told a reporter at the Basildon Echo that US President Barack Obama had asked for his help on the Edward Snowden scandal, and boasted that he had worked for Hillary Clinton, helping her fight a smear campaign suggesting she was a lesbian. Nigel Smith, Basildon Labour group leader, said: 'He and the mayor have led me to believe as recently as July he was a naval officer, worked with the United Nations, Foreign Office and Tony Blair and still exchanges Christmas presents with David Miliband.' After the Royal Navy confirmed they had 'no records for this individual', and the UN and Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the same, Mr Smith said: 'It is disgusting he could say he is a distinguished person and war hero.' Mrs Larkin was criticised after being pictured looking at her phone during an Armed Forces Day parade in June . Celebrity engagements: Mr Handley met singer Will Young when he accompanied Mo Larkin to a function . Rumours about Mr Handley's past not being what he said it was began circulating this summer after he posted a tweet in June boasting: 'Saw Obama and Clinton today, legal work in the States is going viral. #hush! butIamricherstill [sic].' A reporter asked him about his work there, and Mr Handley said he had been helping Mrs Clinton on her election campaign and had even been invited to join her team of legal advisers. He also claimed to have worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the aftermath of the Kenyan mall shooting, helping to get the bodies of British victims home, although the FCO said there was no John Handley working for them. The mayor's lover told the same reporter he was told he would 'never walk again' after being injured by US bombs in the Gulf War, and implied he had killed in action, saying: 'It's the most unnatural thing to do and you suffer in your heart and mind... 'Each time you kill it gets worse.  I have been there, done that, worn the t-shirt.  There is nothing glamorous or heroic. 'I don't want anyone to say what a heroic man I am - I don't feel like that at all.' Boastful: Mr Handley's lies were uncovered after a reporter questioned him about this tweet, posted in June . When told the Royal Navy had no record of him, Mr Handley said: 'No, they won't have - that's why I don't go public. 'But I'm not going to go into it.  Whose business is it, really?' He said he gained legal qualifications at 'London University', but later admitted his PhD came from an online, unaccredited, company called Camden University USA, which is not recognised as an educational institution. Mr Handley said the institution was accredited when he did the online course in 2007, and hoped his qualification could be transferred to another university so that it could be registered and accepted in the UK.  A certificate he produced to back this up bore the name of 'Ashley University' in the US. A former colleague of Mr Handley's in his home town of Ramsgate, Kent, said he had worked for a TV rental repair chain until it folded in 1988, before setting up a cleaning firm. Paul Young, 59, who said he worked with Mr Handley from 1971 to 1981, said: 'If you said you had a Jag, he said he had two and he had got them before you.' A Basildon Council spokesman said: 'Although Mr Handley has no official council position, we recognise as the mayor's partner he has supported her and helped her carry out a very considerable amount of good work. 'Allegations being levelled at him are a private matter.  They are not related to council policies and should therefore in no way reflect on its reputation.'","John Handley, 66, boasted he was injured in friendly fire in the Gulf War .

"For people who need a caffeinated kick in the morning or crave a cup of strong coffee when they are far from a kitchen or coffee shop, there is now a unique handheld espresso machine. Unlike other portable coffee systems, the Minipresso doesn’t use batteries or a plug and instead relies on users pumping the device to brew the coffee to their liking. It uses coffee grounds or capsules along with precisely 2.4 ounces (68ml) of hot water, which is poured into its main chamber. Unlike other portable coffee systems, the Minipresso doesn’t use batteries or a plug and instead relies on users pumping the device to brew the coffee to their liking . The Hong Kong-based company behind the design – which also includes a cup – says: ‘you won’t find better gear to travel light and enjoy a quality espresso away from home.’ The Minispresso machine creates coffee at 116 psi, which is the same pressure produced by traditional espresso machines. It doesn’t use compressed air or coffee cartridges because experts say they blow cold air into hot water. The machine is just under 10 inches tall and includes a built-in cup (pictured left). It  uses normal coffee grounds or capsules along with precisely 2.4 ounces (68g) of hot water, which is poured into its main chamber (pictured right) so people can make coffee on the go . Ingredients needed: 0.25oz (7g) of coffee plus 2.4ounces (68mls) of hot water. Pump: A pop-out a semi-automatic piston injects small quantities of water into the coffee adapter. Users pump the machine 13 times for weak coffee, 18 times for espresso and 28 times for a double espresso. Size: 9.7 inches (25cm) tall . Weight: 0.8lbs (363g) Cost: $39 (£24) plus shipping and taxes . Instead, the device uses a semi-automatic piston to inject small quantities of water into the coffee adapter. After a few pushes, the optimal pressure for extracting the coffee is achieved and ‘a rich and bold espresso is extracted,’ the company says. Users can pump the machine 13 times for a tiny shot of coffee, 18 times for espresso and earn a double espresso by pushing the pump 28 times. There is minimal distance between the water tank and coffee chamber, to avoid losing hear during water displacement. ‘As a result of our cares to build the perfect device, Minipresso produces at ambient condition 24°C (75°F), an espresso at perfect temperature 67°C (152°F in cup) with a nice compact and persistent crema on top,’ the company says. The pump can be easily locked in place and pushed to release and the whole device has been designed to be as compact as possible, measuring 9.7 inches (25cm) tall and weighing 0.8lbs (363g). ‘Minipresso has been designed to be the smallest, lightest and most versatile handheld espresso machine. It's also the first of its kind to integrate an espresso cup,’ the company says. The makers of the machine recommend that users clean the cup and coffee adapter after each use, but stressed that the device will not be dishwasher proof. The device is available to pre-order for $39 (£24) plus shipping and taxes, as it will be sent from Hong Kong in early 2015.

"Ordeal: Madeleine Pulver was said to be 'in good spirits' after her terrifying ten hours . The tearful father of the teenage girl chained to a 'bomb' for ten nail-biting hours spoke today of his pride in his daughter as police revealed that the device was a hoax. Police said the 'collar bomb' strapped to   Madeleine Pulver's neck contained no explosives but confirmed that there was a note making demands and said they were treating the case as attempted extortion. Today Miss Pulver's father fought back tears as he spoke of his 18-year-old daughter's ordeal at the family home in an exclusive Sydney suburb. With his wife Belinda beside him, he told a press conference: 'We as parents are extraordinarily proud of Maddy. 'I think she has woken up this morning in pretty good spirits. She's a . little tired, a little sore, from holding this damned device in place . for about 10 hours.' He thanked police and friends who rallied around and said the family were hoping to move on with their lives. Mr Pulver, believed to be one of the richest men in Australia, said of his daughter: 'She is now, as we are, eager for her to get on with her life. I sincerely ask you to respect our privacy going forward.' The . lead detective in the case has praised a female PC who stayed with a . terrified Miss Pulver during the early stages of the ordeal, even though it . was not known at the time that the device was not a bomb. Detective . Sergeant Luke Moore said: 'One of the first responding . female police officers who attended and first spoke to Madeleine put . herself in a potentially life-threatening situation. 'To . stay and to comfort Madeleine in those early, traumatic stages, I can . only praise that police officer's selflessness. It is a great example.' Miss Pulver told police a man wearing a balaclava broke into the family home in Mosman, a wealthy Sydney suburb, yesterday afternoon.and confronted her while she was in the kitchen. She said the man forced her to stay still while he fitted the device to her neck, and then fled. When police arrived, they found her alone in the house with the device tethered to her by a chain. It . was reported the man had pinned a note to her chest warning the family not to contact police 'or I'll detonate'. He had told allegedly told her there was a microphone to her so he could hear what she . said and he could trigger the device remotely. The 'bomb' appeared to be so elaborate that experts had no idea whether it would explode as they attempted to detach it during a tense ten-hour operation in which Miss Pulver's parents waited outside and nearby homes were evacuated. Today Detective Superintendent Moore said he  was now leading a . 'very serious and complex investigation' and that a letter attached to a . 'small briefcase' device made 'certain demands'. He would . not reveal the contents of the note, but said: 'We are treating this as an . attempted extortion, a very serious attempted extortion. 'That letter gives us certain lines of inquiry we are trying to follow.' New South Wales Police assistant . commissioner Mark Murdoch said the operation was: 'A very, very . elaborate hoax as it turned out. 'But . it was made and certainly gave the appearance of a legitimate . improvised explosive device. 'We had to treat it seriously until we . could prove otherwise and that's exactly what we did and that's why it . took so long. End of the ordeal: After being released from the device Madeleine Pulver was rushed to hospital so doctors could examine her . The intruder sneaked into the family's luxurious home and chained  the device to the terrified schoolgirl's throat . The drama . began when Miss Pulver's family contacted police saying their daughter . had been attacked and there was a strange device attached to her. Miss Pulver's father, William, is believed to be one of the wealthiest men in Australia. He is the former CEO of internet market research company Nielsen NetRatings, based in Manhattan. The . family recently moved back to Australia from Old Greenwich, . Connecticut, when he became CEO of software company Appen Butler Hill, . which specialises in linguistic solutions. Miss Pulver's mother, Belinda, 51, has a successful landscaping company. ' The exclusive suburb of Mosman where the family live is home to multi-millionaires, sports stars, stockbrokers and bankers. After the phone call, bomb technicians, negotiators and detectives rushed to the scene. Nearby homes were evacuated, streets were closed and medical and fire crews waited nearby. Emotional: Madeleine's parents Bill and Belinda Pulver spoke of their pride in their daughter after she was freed from the device . Cordoned off: Police stand outside the family's home in Mosman, Sydney, the day after the bomb ordeal . [captin] . Police bomb disposal experts sought advice from British military authorities as they delicately worked to free Miss Pulver, who is said to have been ‘absolutely petrified’ during the ordeal. Throughout the ordeal Mr . Murdoch kept the outside world informed. After several hours he said that four police . officers, including two bomb specialists, were with Miss Pulver but he could not estimate how long the drama would continue. 'We are continuing to . work very very hard under difficult circumstances and we are working . very hard to ensure the welfare of the family. 'This operation is serious, it is delicate and we will have to take as long as it takes to ensure this young lady's safety.' Later he said: 'We are still treating the suspicious . package as live. I can't confirm whether it is strapped to the woman . involved but she is still in the vicinity of the device.' Asked if she could move away from the device, Mr Murdoch said: 'No, she can't get away from it.' Tight knit: Madeleine Pulver, seen with her father Bill was examined by police and bomb experts while her parents had to wait for her rescue outside . Tense: Police and bomb officers stood outside the mansion in, Mosman, Sydney where the 18-year-old girl had a bomb strapped to her collar . Nail-biting: Police officers, wearing protective equipment, had to spend hours trying to work out what the device was and how to free the terrified teenager . Holding their breath: While experts tried to free Madeleine, her parents waited outside and comforted each other . As the hours passed and tension rose, he admitted that device was proving to be 'a tough nut . to crack', and said police had to 'hasten slowly' in a delicate situation like this. Immediately after the device was . removed, Mr Murdoch said bomb squad officers still did not know how . dangerous it was. He said that neither . he nor the bomb squad officers had seen anything like it and he . admitted it would be ‘some time’ before it could be dismantled, not only . for safety reasons, but to look for clues as to who had put it . together. He said the . teenager was ‘doing well’ after being freed and was reunited with her . parents, who had been kept out of the house by police during the ordeal . for their own safety. Delicate: Police cordoned off the street as the terrified girl's parents were forced to wait outside . Emergency: Bomb officers spent ten hours trying to work out how they could diffuse the device . Miss Pulver was taken to a hospital for an examination. ‘She’s . good – she’s been kept in a very uncomfortable position,’ Mr Murdoch . said. ‘She has been and will be uncomfortable for a little while to . come.’ Police were also reported to be . scouring other 'items' inside the house while they moved Miss Pulver to . the front part of the building. There were some suggestions that the drama mirrored a scene from the horror movie Saw and an episode of the CSI crime show. Madeleine Pulver underwent a terrifying ten-hour ordeal while explosives expert detached the device which had been chained to her neck by a masked intruder . Mr Murdoch said police had found ‘some . items’ in the house that were being examined and he confirmed that among . the detectives involved in the drama were men from the Robbery and . Serious Crime Squad who deal with extortion. ‘We are working hard to find out exactly what it is and equally importantly what it isn’t,’ said Mr Murdoch. The young woman, he said, was ‘going pretty well’ and had specialist police with her. Darkness: Temporary lights were used to conduct the operation while inside the multi-million pound property bomb officers tried to calm the girl . Battle: Police continued their efforts to free the teenager from the 'ransom' bomb as night fell on Burrawong Avenue in Mosman, Sydney . Desperate: Assistant commissioner Mark Murdoch answers questions about the bomb . Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she was shocked when she heard about the case. 'When I looked at it this morning, the first thing I said was ""it's like a Hollywood script - the kind of thing you would see at the cinema or on TV',"" she told Fairfax Radio. 'You would never expect it to happen in real life in Australia.' At that time the teenager's parents had not been able to speak to their daughter, said Mr Murdoch, but he did not say why. There was speculation at the time that a phone call might trigger an explosion. The suburb of Mosman, where the famous Taronga Park Zoo is located, is on the northern shores of Sydney Harbour. Huge homes line the leafy streets and luxury yachts are moored in harbour inlets. Miss Pulver is a . student at the exclusive North Sydney private school Wenona. The family had a share in an historic 946 hectare grazing property, which was sold . two months ago for just under $3.7 million, and they own a Central Coast beachhouse. Last year, Mr Pulver's hi-tech information technology business, Appen, joined forces with the Butler Hill Group. At the time of the multi-million-dollar merger, Mr Pulver, chief . executive of the new company, Appen Butler Hill, said the two companies . could provide linguistic and voice-recognition services in more than 120 . languages for clients including software companies and security organisations, as well . as global government agencies. Customers include Microsoft, IBM, Fujitsu, Toshiba and Telstra.","Emotional parents thank police who stayed with daughter throughout nail-biting ten hours .

"The elite University of California, Berkeley has seen a blow to its uber-serious reputation with a controversial article from a student boasting about her marathon campus sex sessions. Nadia Cho's detailed account was part of her weekly column in The Daily Californian, Berkeley’s independent, student-run newspaper. Cho writes . that she and an unnamed male student started their romp in Berkeley’s . library, Main Stacks, the day before Thanksgiving, when the campus was . ‘marvellously empty’. Berkeley Student Nadia Cho's Twitter Profile reads: 'i like coffee, cats, and ice cream. and being the sex on tuesday columnist at the @dailycal :)' But other students were in the library studying while the two performed and more than one student walked by them in mid-act, Cho writes. She and her partner then moved into one of Berkeley’s classrooms, as she graphically describes. ‘Sex isn’t always about c****** and having orgasms. Sometimes it’s for s**** and giggles,’ she writes. ‘Having expectations and goals can . ruin the fun of it. Besides, it’s probably not a good idea to ejaculate . in public places - just saying. Keep this in mind should you ever . attempt sex on campus.’ Not so private: The Main Stacks library at Berkeley University, where Cho says she and an unnamed male student had sex .

"At age 19, Rebecca Musser was 'given away' by her father and married to Rulon Jeffs, the 85-year-old leader of an extremist polygamist Mormon sect later led by his notorious son Warren. For seven years, she was 'sexually violated' by the elderly man, who had 64 other wives - terrified to resist his physical advances. When he died in 2002, age 92, she escaped the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and began helping authorities prosecute members of the church. She testified 20 times and helped federal prosecutors win 11 convictions. Standing strong: Rebecca Musser said she testified for the federal government 20 times as a way of winning justice for the women left on the FLDS compound . 'Sexual violations': Miss Musser (left) was the 19th wife of Rulon Jeffs (right), who taught that women were not allowed to refuse sex to her husband, who was 85 when he married her at age 19 . Among those sent to prison with the help of her testimony was Warren Jeffs, who took over leadership of the FLDS church after his father's death. But before she broke free, her husband owned her -- 'body and soul.' Miss Musser, now 36, opened up publicly for the first time about her 26-year ordeal inside the close-knit extremist organization. 'My father sold my innocence,' she told an audience, the Deseret News reported. 'My life there was a constant state of fear, unknown... silence.' Miss Musser said she is speaking out now to offer inspiration to women everywhere. However, she spent nearly a decade working with authorities to held the women she grew up with in the tightly-controlled FLDS church. Family portrait: The picture shows dozens of . Warren Jeffs's brides, lined up together as if they are posing for a . school photograph . Jailed for life: Warren Jeffs, shaven and . dishevelled in his booking photograph, was in a coma after starving . himself in prison where he is serving a life sentence . 'She asked for assistance in leaving the community, and a deputy responded and facilitated that request,' he said. During her marriage to Rulon Jeffs she was terrified of disobeying him. The church taught that followers they could enter heaven only by following their leader, whom they taught was a divinely-inspired prophet. She couldn't cut her hair and couldn't choose what clothes to wear. 'After seven years of continual sexual violations, I'd had enough,' Miss Musser said, according to the News. 'Give me hell because I don't want that heaven.' Free woman: When her husband died, age 92, she slipped out of the FLDS compound under cover of darkness and fled -- deciding she no longer wanted to live under the strictures of the extremist church . In the cover of darkness, she slipped past the armed guards and fled, knowing that leaders of the sect would drag her back to the compound if she was caught. On the outside, Miss Musser said she found herself. Helping the federal government prosecute 11 members of the church allowed her to cope with the pain of adjusting to life outside the compound. She showed up to to testify against Warren Jeffs and other FLDS members in a striking red dress. It was a show of defiance to a religious leader who banned followers from wearing the color. Warren Jeffs was convicted in August 2011 of raping a two girls, age 15 and 12, who were his 'spiritual wives.' The first time Miss Musser testified against him was in 2007, when he was convicted of accessory to rape after he married off Alyssa Wall, Miss Musser's 14-year-old sister, to an older man. Warren Jeffs, who reportedly had as many as 80 wives, is serving life plus ten years in a Texas prison.","Rebecca Musser married Rulon Jeffs aged 19 but escaped when he died .

"Criticism: Europe's top diplomat Catherine Ashton has been skewered by a report which says she has failed to advance EU influence in her post . Labour peer and top EU diplomat Baroness Ashton was branded a ‘national embarrassment’ last night after her work was condemned by MEPs – even as she demanded an inflation-busting increase in her department budget. The peer came under fire from the European Parliament which said her department, the European External Action Service, was indecisive and unresponsive to crises. In a hard-hitting report, MEPs on the foreign affairs committee said the EEAS – which they want to behave like an EU foreign office – is ‘top heavy’, has ‘too many decision-making layers’ and has been slow to respond to situations such as the Arab Spring and the conflict in Mali. Yet Baroness Ashton, 57, who became High Representative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy when the post was created in 2009, is now demanding a budget increase of £18million for 2014 – a 4 per cent boost at twice the rate of inflation. That will take the annual cost of the EEAS to £451million. Baroness Ashton, who earns £287,543 a year, has faced repeated criticism for coming across as  a political lightweight and for failing to offer comment on the financial crisis gripping the EU. She will be replaced next year and will enjoy a £400,000 payoff over the following three years from European taxpayers. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘For the first time in as long as I can remember, someone in the European Parliament has said something sensible. ‘She is a national embarrassment. The organisation she heads is monumentally useless. It is absurd that it should be asking for more money. Affairs: Baroness Ashton, right, and Chief Executive of European Defence Agency Claude France Arnould talk prior a Foreign Affairs Council (Defence) yesterday . ‘There are many public services which haven’t had anything like a 4 per cent increase in budget for years. It’s ridiculous.’ Fellow Tory Peter Bone added: ‘I don’t know what planet some people in Brussels live on. ‘What we want from a leader in Europe . is someone who wants to save money and control their budgets. To be . condemned by the European Parliament takes some doing, but it is a . wake-up call for her.’ A recent report by the European . Parliament’s budgetary control committee attacked the EEAS for being . ‘top-heavy’ with highly paid officials and incompetent staff in its 141 . embassies or delegations across the world. Request: When the Arab Spring broke out, Ashton had to be asked several times before she finally flew to Cairo . The report said: 'Even with an ongoing crisis brewing in Mali, it was France that ultimately intervened to keep the country from falling completely to Islamic fundamentalists' The foreign affairs committee report . adds: ‘It has become apparent that the EU is unable to ensure, in the . short term, a reallocation of resources to match new political . priorities.’ Tory MEP Philip Bradbourn said: . ‘Staff are paid too much to do too little and seem to expect the very . best in accommodation all over the world. Since much of their work . duplicates what member state diplomatic missions have been doing for . years, the value has to be questionable.’ The Government has described budget . demands by Baroness Ashton as ‘ludicrous’ at a time when governments . have acted to restrict rises in the overall  EU budget. A British diplomat said: ‘The UK continues to  argue against any increase to the EEAS budget. ‘All EU institutions should be looking for savings in their  budgets, not increases.’","Baroness Ashton is representative for foreign affairs and security .

"An emotional father who lost his six-year-old son in the Newtown school shooting has been heckled by pro-gun activists as he testified at a local hearing on firearm control. Neil . Heslin, whose son Jesse was killed in last month's massacre at Sandy . Hook Elementary, questioned the need for any civilian to own . semiautomatic, military-style weapon at the state legislative subcommittee hearing in Hartford Connecticut on Monday. But he was shouted down by members of the audience who shouted 'The Second Amendment' as he spoke. Scroll down for video . Broken family: Neil Heslin, holding a picture of himself with his son Jesse, wipes his eye before testifying at a hearing in the Legislative Office Building . Victim: Neil Heslin, whose 6-year-old son Jesse Lewis was one of the 20 first-graders killed in the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, told a legislative subcommittee reviewing gun laws that there is no need for such weapons in homes or on the streets . He said: 'It's . not a good feeling. Not a good feeling to look at your child laying in a . casket or looking at your child with a bullet wound to the forehead. It's a real sad thing,' said Heslin, who held up a large framed . photograph of himself and his son. A handful . of people at the packed legislative hearing then shouted about their . Second Amendment rights when Heslin asked if anyone could provide a . reason for a civilian to own an assault-style weapon. 'We're . all entitled to our own opinions and I respect their opinions and their . thoughts,' Heslin said. 'But I wish they'd respect mine and give it a . little bit of thought.' The hearing by a . legislative subcommittee reviewing gun laws offered the first public . testimony by family members of those killed at Sandy Hook Elementary, . where a gunman slaughtered 20 first-grade children and six women. Parents of children . killed in the Newtown school shooting called for better enforcement of . gun laws and tougher penalties for violators. Adam . Lanza had killed his mother in their home across town and then drove to . the school to carry out the shooting before committing suicide. The . testimony was expected to continue late into the night. Members . of the Connecticut State Police firearms training unit brought weapons . to the hearing to provide state lawmakers with a short tutorial on . what's legal and illegal under the state's current assault weapons ban, . passed in 1993. Firepower: Firearms Training Unit Detective Barbara J. Mattson of the Connecticut State Police holds up a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle, the same make and model of gun used by Adam Lanza in the Sandy Hook School shooting, for a demonstration during a hearing of a legislative subcommittee reviewing gun laws . The group included an AR-15, the same type of rifle that . was used in the Sandy Hook shooting. Many gun . rights advocates, wearing yellow stickers that read: 'Another . Responsible Gun Owner,' were among the estimated 2,000 people at the . hearing. Metal detectors were installed at the entrance to the . Legislative Office Building, and some people waited as long as two hours . to get into the building in Hartford. Many spoke about the need to protect their rights and their families' safety. 'The . Second Amendment does not protect our right to hunt deer,' said Andrew . Hesse of Middletown. 'It protects our right to self-preservation and . preservation of our family. The right to bear arms.' Elizabeth . Drysdale, a single mother from Waterbury, spoke of three recent . incidents that caused her to fear for her safety. She said she should be . able to choose the size of magazine and type of firearm to defend . herself. 'Don't my children and I deserve your support and consideration to be safe,' she asked lawmakers. Judy . Aron of West Hartford said bills such as those requiring gun owners to . have liability insurance and ammunition taxes only harm lawful gun . owners. Every gun owner did not pull the trigger that was pulled by Adam Lanza, she said. The . state's gun manufacturers, meanwhile, urged the subcommittee to not . support legislation that could put the state's historic gun . manufacturing industry at risk. Mourning: Mark Mattioli and his wife Cindy, right, lost their son, James, in the Sandy Hook massacre. The problem is not guns, but rather a lack of civility, Mattioli said . Mark Mattioli, . whose 6-year-old son James was killed at Sandy Hook, got a standing . ovation when he said there are plenty of gun laws but they're not . properly enforced. He urged lawmakers to address the culture of . violence. 'It's a simple concept. We need . civility across our nation,' he said. 'What we're seeing are symptoms of . a bigger problem. This is a symptom. The problem is not gun laws. The . problem is a lack of civility.' Two Southbury . natives who survived a mass shooting last year at a movie theater in . Aurora, Colo., urged lawmakers to address online, private guns sales . that don't require background checks. Stephen Barton and Ethan . Rodriguez-Torrent also want to require background checks for purchases . of so-called long guns and not just handguns. State . Rep. Arthur O'Neill, R-Southbury, who has known Rodriguez-Torrent since . he was a child, predicted state lawmakers will reach a compromise on . guns.

"A South African cardinal who helped elect Pope Francis has described paedophilia as a psychological illness and not 'a criminal condition'. The Catholic Archbishop of Durban, Wilfrid Fox Napier, told BBC Radio 5 live that people who were abused as children and became paedophiles were not criminally responsible for their actions in the same way as somebody 'who chooses to do something like that'. Cardinal Napier, who was among the 115 cardinals in the conclave at the Vatican that elected Pope Francis earlier this week, called paedophilia a 'psychological disorder. And just three days into the new role, the pope and the Catholic Church are now faced with fresh child abuse controversy after the cardinal's remarks. Newly elected Pope Francis (right), is given a yellow Catholic faith bracelet by Cardinal Wilfrid Fox Napier of South Africa following a meeting at the Vatican (left). The South African cardinal claimed that paedophilia is an 'illness' He said: 'What do you do with disorders? You have got to try and put them right. 'If I as a normal being choose to break the law knowing that I am breaking the law, then I think I need to be punished... 'From my experience paedophilia is actually an illness, it is not a criminal condition, it is an illness.' The cardinal spoke of two priests he knew who were abused as children and went on to become paedophiles. He told the BBC: 'Don't tell me that those people are criminally responsible like somebody who chooses to do something like that. The cardinal said that in his experience, paedophilia is an illness, not a criminal condition, and the people who have been abused as children and then molest others are 'damaged' Pope Francis explained to journalists in an audience today that he wants a 'church for the poor' 'I don't think you can really take the position and say that person deserves to be punished when he was himself damaged.' Barbara Dorries, from the US-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests was abused as a child by a priest. She told the BBC: 'If it is a disease that's fine, but it's also a crime and crimes are punished, criminals are held accountable for what they did and what they do. 'The bishops and the cardinals have gone to great lengths to cover these crimes to enable the predators to move on, to not be arrested, to keep the secrets within the church.' The cardinal has made controversial . statements before, maintaining that people should abstain from sex . rather than use contraceptives, to stop spreading HIV. He took the official Roman Catholic . Stance and argued that government programmes to distribute condoms were . ineffectual in stemming the spread of HIV. Instead, he supported programmes based around abstinence. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. The cardinal is a prolific Twitter user, and has kept his followers up to date about the conclave and his meetings with the newly ordained pope. He wrote: 'Last 2 days quite unreal. Mass with Pope Francis in Santa Martha Chapel, Breakfast, Lunch & Supper with him sitting at a different table! 'What's it like in Conclave? Apart from NO radio or TV, NO newspapers or phone calls, Emails or SMS's, NO Twitter or Facebook, all is normal.' 'We chat, discuss, get to know each . other. Meals are special times. We relax, share stories about our home . Churches, dream about the future!' His remarks came on the day that the pope held a private meeting with journalists. Pope Francis has said he wants 'a poor Church, for the poor' following his election as head of the Catholic Church. In . a meeting with journalists, the Pontiff said he was inspired to choose . the name Francis after the 12th Century saint Francis of Assisi.","Claimed people abused as youngsters who then become paedophiles 'not criminally responsible'

The actress, 40, has spoken for the first time about her years of trying to start a family, her two miscarriages and how she turned to IVF to try to find a solution before deciding not to have children. Scroll down for video . Maxine Peake, pictured, has spoken for the first time about her years of trying to start a family, her two miscarriages and how she turned to IVF to try to find a solution before deciding not to have children . And she hit out at those who assume all women ought to become mothers, saying it ‘shocks’ her that childless women are subjected to more scrutiny than men. She said: ‘I haven’t talked about those things before because they’re very personal and I didn’t want to be a spokeswoman for women who don’t have children. ‘But when I did interviews, it was the first thing they asked about, like it was a conscious decision on my part to not have kids, and it wasn’t.’ Miss Peake told Red magazine she and her long-term boyfriend Pawlo Wintoniuk, 43, a television art director, have been unsuccessful trying to start a family for a number of years. She said: ‘Paw and I have been down every avenue and it hasn’t happened but there are other things to do.’ In The Village, Miss Peake plays Grace Middleton, the wife of an impoverished farmer who loses her son in World War One. In BBC drama Silk she played a barrister who suffers a miscarriage when a client punches her in the stomach.

Miss Peake criticised interviewers who constantly questioned her why she doesn’t have children. She said: ‘I get angry about the way women are forced and bullied into what the male ideal is. Men don’t get quizzed about their personal lives in the same way. No one says to a man, you’re 38 and you haven’t got children – why? ‘You spend your life as a woman building your career, then, once you’re there, there’s a tiny window and all this pressure.’ Miss Peake revealed her own mother had advised her against becoming pregnant. She said: ‘My own mum told me not to have children. She loved us, but she realised that because of us there were things she hadn’t done. ‘I think women can feel ashamed, like they’ve failed or like they’re not a woman somehow if they don’t have kids, and that’s wrong.

"Norwegian businesswoman Marte Deborah Dalelv, 24, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for extramarital sex after she reported being raped . An alleged rape victim who was jailed in Dubai for having sex outside of marriage has spoken out about her ordeal. Marte Deborah Dalelv, was sentenced to 16 months in prison for having sex outside of marriage after she was raped by a . co-worker in March during a business trip to the city. But when she reported the attack to police, she herself was arrested. The Norwegian 24-year-old claims during an interview about the assault police asked her: 'Are you sure you called the police because you just didn't like it?' They took her passport away and she was convicted and sentenced on charges of having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol. Her alleged rapist was sentenced to three months less prison time than she got. Ms Dalelv said the attack happened after she had been out at a bar with her colleagues and friends. She told CNN that she had a male co-worker to escort her to her room as the hotel was 'large and confusing' and she did not want to be wandering aloe as she had been drinking. She said she realised the room was not hers, and after initially objecting when he pulled her inside by her handbag, she agreed to go in 'to calm the situation down'. Her next memory, she says, is waking up on her front while he was raping her. When the hotel wake-up call knocked on the door, she dressed and went down to reception to call police. Up to a dozen make officers arrived and took statements from Ms Dalelv and her alleged attacker. When she arrived at Bur Dubai police station, she said police asked her  of events to officers, 'Are you sure you called the police because you just didn't like it?' She replied: '""Well of course I didn't like it."" That is when I knew, I don't think they are going to believe me at all.' She was then examined and tested for alcohol and locked in a prison cell for four days without explanation. Scroll down for video . Waiting game: Marte Deborah Dalelv, pictured in Dubai, faces an uncertain future as Norway doesn't have an extradition treaty with Dubai . Eventually she was able to contact her parents on the third day and ask them to contact the Norwegian Embassy who arranged her release. She claims she was advised to claim that the rape was in fact voluntary in order for the issue to 'go away'. But she was then charged with making a false statement. Ms Dalelv claims she was fired from her position with Al Mana Interiors - which is owned by Janet Jackson's husband, Wissam Al Mana -  during the ordeal. A spokesman for the Qatari billionaire's company, Al Mana Interiors, strongly denied the claims from Marte Deborah Dalelv, saying instead its representatives were 'by her side' throughout the 'ordeal' and that the firm was forced to let her go after she 'declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status.' Dalelv was sentenced to one year and four months in jail but as Norway has no extradition treaty with Dubai, her future is uncertain. Dalelv claims she was fired from her position with Al Mana Interiors - which is owned by Janet Jackson's husband, Wissam Al Mana -  during the ordeal . Dark side: Having been detained in Dubai since the assault in March, Ms  Dalelv has now been found guilty of sex outside marriage, drinking alcohol without a licence and perjury and was jailed for 16 months . Janet . Jackson married the Qatari billionaire in a secret ceremony last year. The pair have been together for three years after meeting in 2010.

"Another witness who claimed Labour’s biggest funder was embroiled in vote-rigging is standing by her account – piling more pressure on Ed Miliband to reopen an inquiry into the scandal. Michelle Hornall is one of several who claimed to have been signed up as Labour members without their knowledge by the union Unite. The development came as a Tory MP reported Unite to the police for alleged intimidation in a dispute with the bosses of one of Britain’s leading oil refineries. Ed Miliband, pictured in Edinburgh yesterday, is under increasing pressure to reopen an inquiry into Unite vote-rigging claims. At least two key witnesses insist they were signed up to Labour without their knowledge . The union deployed a squad to target senior staff of the Ineos chemical company and their families at their homes in a dispute over the Grangemouth plant. Mr Miliband has shelved an inquiry into allegations that Unite ‘stitched up’ the Falkirk seat by signing up members to the party without their consent earlier this year, saying that a change of heart by two whistleblowers meant there was no longer enough evidence to prove the claims. But on Monday, the Daily Mail revealed that Lorraine Kane, the whistleblower who first alleged she and her family had been signed up as Labour members without their consent, had rejected Unite claims that she had withdrawn her testimony. Now Mrs Hornall, a member of Mrs Kane’s family, also maintains she was signed up to Labour by Stephen Deans – the chairman of the local constituency party and a Unite convener – without her consent and using her maiden name, which she has not used since she was 20. Mr Deans has since quit his union role. Grangemouth oil refinery, where Unite members are accused of intimidation in a dispute with executives . Mrs Hornall has declined to speak . directly about what happened to her, but her husband, Steven Hornall, . said: ‘I think it is just going to drag on until it gets brushed under . the carpet.’ He told The Times: ‘Stevie Deans has not even been in touch . to see how they [members of his family] are doing. Tory MP Priti Patel has reported the union to police . 'This is all one man’s doing and it is our family being harassed over it.' But Mr Miliband said: ‘We’ve got very, very clear legal evidence from the people concerned about how that lady was signed up to the Labour Party. ‘What I’m saying to you is we’ve looked into all of the allegations that have been made, we’ve talked to that family and they’ve given us very, very clear evidence.’ Mr Miliband, who visited Scotland yesterday, said he agreed that ‘machine politics’ had been at work in Falkirk, but insisted he was satisfied there were no grounds for a second inquiry. A Unite spokesman said last night: 'The Kane family are not and never have been Unite members. Unite therefore did not sign them up to the Labour Party, either through the union-join scheme that then existed, or otherwise.' Late last month, police were called after Unite approached one executive’s neighbours, telling them he was 'evil', while the daughter of another had 'Wanted' posters denouncing her father posted through her letterbox. Yesterday Conservative MP Priti Patel said the tactics of the union were unacceptable and asked detectives in Hampshire and Scotland to investigate whether they had been in breach of the law.","Michelle Hornall claims she was signed up to Labour without her knowing .

"A serial child rapist wrote to one of his traumatised victims from prison, telling her he missed her and begging her not to hate him. Darren Myhill, 45, wrote to the teenage girl from the jail in Stockton-on-Tees where he is serving an indefinite sentence after admitting a catalogue of rape and sexual assault charges against five youngsters. The Prison Service has launched an investigation after the victim received a letter from her attacker, scrawled on a piece of lined paper, saying: 'I miss u...Please try not to hate me too much.  Hatred will not take the pain away.' 'Hatred will not take the pain away': Serial paedophile Darren Myhill, 45, wrote to one of his victims from jail . The paedophile, from Throckley, near Newcastle, went on to complain that he felt bad, saying: 'The pain I feel plus sick to my stomach.' He added: 'Please live your life', tried to exonerate himself by saying 'there were lies', and told his victim he loved her. Frighteningly for his victim, the letter makes references to places the girl had visited in recent weeks, and also accuses her of lying. Myhill, who is in HMP Holme House in Stocton-on-Tees, added: 'I could have killed myself, but that would have been the coward’s way out.' He was jailed in April at Newcastle Crown Court after admitting 22 charges of rape, indecency with a child, indecent assault and incitement against victims aged between nine and 16. Serial child rapist Darren Myhill is serving an indefinite jail sentence in Stockton-on-Tees . The abuse stretched over more than 20 years, during which Myhill kept a scrapbook containing photographs of his victims and a checklist of the illegal sex acts he carried out on them. He was initially jailed for 13-and-a-half years, of which just six would be served with the rest on licence. But the Court of Appeal found his punishment to be 'unduly lenient' and quashed the original sentence, handing him instead an indefinite sentence which means he cannot be considered for release for 10 years. The mother of the victim who received Myhill's letter said it left her daughter in floods of tears and too frightened to leave the house. She said the letter to her daughter, who said after her attacker was jailed that she hoped she could get on with her life, came 'totally out of the blue.' The mother said: 'She rang me screaming and crying her eyes out. 'I was away at the time and so had to come back as fast as I could to be with her.

"A British expat who was shot dead in Libya has been named as Mark De Salis.

The discovery comes less than a month after an American teacher was shot to death in the eastern city of Benghazi. A photograph which is claimed to be of the dead pair has been posted on Facebook. The grim picture, which was taken at night, shows both the of the dead lying face down on sand. Near them is what appears to be a picnic blanket with their belongings spread out on it, alongside a backpack. Their belongings were not stolen and the motive for their killing was unclear, he said.

The death of the two foreign nationals comes after rebels agreed to end a two-month blockade of a key oil export terminal, prompting hopes of reviving the Libyan economy. According to Reuters, Libya's central government hopes that it will resume oil production and export at one the country's largest oilfields, El Sharara. The government had been expecting it to happen within three days after local militia agreed to suspend their two-month blockade. The rebels are demanding greater autonomy in the region. 'They agreed to lift the blockade,' a defense ministry spokesman said. Tuareg tribesmen, who have held the some 350,000 barrels per day field hostage since October, have been demanding the creation of a local council and granting national identity cards for tribesmen. Libya's main source of income, its oil sector, has been crippled following the power vacuum created after the civil war. Armed tribesmen seized key ports and oilfields across the country, cutting output to around 220,000 barrel per day (bpd) from 1.4 million bpd in July.

"With her smooth and sultry tones, Linette Beaumont has become the first woman to star in a commercial for Viagra. If the English actress looks vaguely familiar, it's because she's made brief appearances in most of Britain's most popular TV soaps. The 44-year-old blonde was picked, according to Viagra makers Pfizer, after the company polled men suffering with erectile dysfunction who admitted that a woman would 'reassure' them - as well as motivating them to contact their doctor. Scroll down for video . The new face of erectile dysfunction: Linette Beamont stars in the first Viagra TV commercial that targets the less-obvious sufferers of the sexual condition: women . New approach: In the new 60-second commercial, Linette Beaumont reclines on a bed in a tropical setting as she addresses the problems that couples encounter when a man is impotent . The advert was rolled out last month and Linette's US debut has entranced American viewers, with one, Patrick Cox, tweeting: 'Don't need Viagra. Just need the hot blonde with the British accent'. Linette, who lives in the UK, has had parts on British soaps including EastEnders, Holby City, Casualty and The Bill - and appeared in a video called The Taliban Don't Like My Knickers. She's appeared in campaigns for brands including Burberry, as well as adverts for Sony, Perrier and Schwarzkopf. She filmed the Viagra advert for Pfizer, directed by Jonas Ackerlund, in August. However, she was forced to keep the project a secret up until its release, according to a source. Reclining in a tropical destination, Linette tells viewers: 'So guys, it's just you and your honey. The setting is perfect. But then erectile dysfunction happens again,' she says before encouraging men to ask their doctor about Viagra. 'Plenty of guys have this issue - not just getting an erection, but keeping it.' Soapy:  Linette Beaumont played the role of Izzy on British soap Coronation Street in December 2008 . Familiar face: Linette Beaumont has made appearances on most of the popular British soaps, including a stint on Holby City as Roberta Colvin in 2007 (left) and a character called Chanel Bentley on Doctors in 2010 . The commercial has been shown during Sunday Night Football in America and during baseball games, prompting a Twitter storm. Kyle Friedrich tweeted: 'Nothing is worse than sitting next your grandma while a hot blonde British woman talks about erections. Thanks Viagra.' While Joe Remi noted: 'Ya know, Viagra could save a lot of money on pill production by just sending dudes a DVD of the British lady talking.' A Pfizer source told MailOnline: 'We intend to feature various women during this advertising campaign. 'We felt the commercial with Linette was the best spot to launch this campaign.' Advertising creatives at BBDO in New York came up with the idea to use women - and an online survey of men with erectile dysfunction was conducted by Pfizer. A source said: 'It's a new and unexpected approach to de-stigmatize ED, for the first time the adverts will feature a woman reassuring men with ED that they are not alone and motivate them to speak with their doctor.' Bizarre: Linette Beaumont appeared in a video where she played a woman taken hostage by the Taliban . Odd: Actress Linette can be seen in the video clip, oddly entitled: 'The Taliban don't like my knickers' A reassuring face: Linette Beaumont on The Bill, a show about London police officers . The world's second-biggest drugmaker is looking for ways to boost sales of Viagra, Pfizer's No. 6 seller, at a time when it is encountering new competition. Viagra has faced competition from cheaper generic versions in Europe since its patent expired there 15 months ago. Sales fell eight per cent last year, to $1.9 billion. And in three years, Viagra will get generic competition in the U.S., where it costs about $35 a pill. Meanwhile, new competitor Stendra just got approved. However, a Pfizer source told MailOnline:  'We've always sought to raise men’s awareness of ED as a treatable medical condition, inform them about the benefits and risks of therapy and motivate them to talk to their doctors, regardless of the medicine’s market share position. 'Pfizer launched this campaign because we’re committed to providing support and resources for men with ED.' Patents give a drug a monopoly, generally for 20 years. But when those patents expire, cheaper generic versions flood the market, often wiping out most of the brand-name drug's sales within a year. Pfizer has seen generic competition for several of its other drugs cut revenue by billions, so it is hoping to stem the revenue losses for Viagra. Competition: Having a woman speak directly to men about impotence is a unique strategy for Pfizer Inc. The market for ED drugs is big. About half of men over the age of 40 suffer from ED, occasionally or always, yet only 10 per cent take medicine regularly, Dr. Irwin Goldstein told The Associated Press. Dr Goldstein, who directs the San Diego Sexual Medicine center and has researched sexual disorders for decades, said that having a woman in ads makes sense because women often are more upset by ED than men. He said men generally dislike going to doctors - and when older men pay a visit, they often linger as the doctor finishes, shifting from one foot to the other in what doctors call 'the Viagra shuffle.' Doctors then ask if the man wants Viagra. Pfizer's marketing chief, Vic Clavelli, told The Associated Press that the company is trying to take a more direct approach in ads, unlike past ones 'built around very subtle innuendo.' Until now, women have been absent or played background roles in the many ads for ED drugs since the first, Viagra, was launched in 1998. Viagra gave men an alternative to penile suppositories, surgery and injections, and 50 million worldwide have since taken it. Little blue pill: The market for ED drugs is big. About half of men over 40 suffer from ED, occasionally or always, yet only 10 per cent take medicine regularly . Ads for rival Cialis have featured couples getting frisky during everyday activities, then lounging in his-and-hers bathtubs. Viagra ads typically show middle-aged men doing things such as construction work and deep-sea fishing. 'It's definitely a unique strategy that could work,' said Edward Jones health care analyst Ashtyn Evans.

"Confirmation: The human remains found under a car park in Leicester are expected to be confirmed as belonging to Richard III . A skeleton found underneath a car park in Leicester is expected to be confirmed as that of Richard III. The remarkable discovery of the remains, entailing a curved spine back and wounded skull, was made last September. Since then scientists have been conducting a range of tests to establish whether the remains do indeed belong to the Plantagenet King. Researchers from Leicester University will hold a press conference on Monday morning where they will present the findings of their investigation. Philippa Langley, who initially funded the excavation of what is now a Leicester City Council car park, said she was '99 per cent certain' that the remains are those of Richard III - one of England's most controversial kings. The scientists will present the results of carbon-dating tests and a DNA investigation, pairing the skeleton's genetic material with that of Michael Ibsen. Mr Ibsen, a London-based furniture-maker, is a direct descendant of the medieval king's sister, Anne of York. Reports suggest that the scientists will also confirm the body was not buried within a coffin or shroud. Richard III died during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, becoming the last English king to die on the battlefield, and is thought to have been crudely buried by his successor Henry VII. The body in the car park has an arrow in its back, matching details of his death in the battle. The skeleton's scoliosis – severe curvature of the spine – ties in with the . famous description by Shakespeare and others of the monarch as a . hunchback. However, those working on the project previously said these details were not enough to prove that the skeleton was Richard. Miss Langley, who is working on a documentary charting the excavation for Channel 4, said that she had a hunch the king's remains were under the car park. Scroll down for video . Discovery: The human remains were uncovered in September in what is now the car park of Leicester City Council's social services department, pictured . The documentary, titled Richard III: . The King in the Car Park, has been made alongside the university . academics and will be screened on Monday night following the press . conference. Previous reports suggested that . academics withheld evidence during press conferences to . generate publicity for the documentary, much to the annoyance of some . involved in the project. Langley, who is a screenwriter and . member of the Richard III Society, said a play that she began . researching three years ago has been turned into a script for television . and film. She told the Sunday Times the scripts are now 'getting serious interest from Los Angeles and in the UK'. The new evidence will also include tartar analysis from the skeleton's teeth. Once it is confirmed that the body is . Richard III, it is believed the remains will be buried inside Leicester . Cathedral - more than 500 years after he was killed in battle. Findings: This image shows the dig in progress. Scientists have conducted carbon-dating on the remains, as well as DNA testing . The . decision, made by the Ministry of Justice, came after a row between MPs . as to where Richard should . be laid to rest. Some said he should be given a state burial in Westminster Abbey because he was a reigning monarch. Others said the remains should be buried in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, the centre of the Plantagenet monarch’s kingdom. But in a parliamentary answer, the Government settled for Leicester Cathedral, a stone’s throw from the car park. Jon Ashworth, Labour MP for Leicester .

"The U.S. Embassy worker accused of spying on Russia for the CIA has left Moscow, five days after he was publicly arrested by Russian security forces. Video broadcast by Russia's NTV station shows Ryan Fogle going through airport security at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow before boarding a Delta Airlines flight to New York on Sunday afternoon. Fogle, 29, a third secretary at the embassy in Moscow, was accused by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) of trying to recruit a Russian counter-terrorism expert who had recently been to Dagestan, the Russian province where Boston bombing mastermind Tamerlan Tsarnaev visited before the attacks. Scroll down for video . Fleeing: Ryan Fogle, seen here at a Moscow airport on Sunday, was told the leave the country after he was arrested by Russian security officers . Friends: Fogle - second from right - was pictures unloading a suitcase in the airport parking lot, flanked by embassy staffers . But the FSB claimed that the Russian anti-terrorism expert he was . hoping to lure to work for the Americans wasted no time in personally apprehending . him, pinning him to the ground, and handing him over to the authorities. Fogle has . been mercilessly mocked on the web both in Russia and the West after he was pictured wearing a conspicuously fake blond wig during his arrest. The U.S. Embassy has refused to comment on the case. However, video shows embassy officials with Fogle as he unloads a suitcase from an SUV in the airport parking lot. NTV cameras then track him as he stands in security lines before boarding his flight. The network is known in Russia as being friendly to the Kremlin. Arrested: The US diplomat was pinned to the ground and arrested by the Russian agent he was trying to recruit . Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer . Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained . Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols . The FSB stressed that the . US and Russia 'will try to avoid ratcheting up tension around the Ryan . Fogle case, focusing instead on the positive aspects of their . relations'. But Russian intelligence services say they have trapped a CIA ‘spy’ as he offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent. Diplomat . Ryan Fogle was thrown down and handcuffed in a night-time sting by the . FSB secret service – formerly the KGB. He had a rudimentary espionage kit . containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, . three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and . an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read . remotely, Russian intelligence sources said. Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB . The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia. Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in June 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country. The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S. In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany. One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot. The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the . political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared . Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials. Unusually, the FSB made its coup . public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue . checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and  baseball cap, along with images of . him in detention. Spy sources said Fogle was . caught after a lengthy covert operation. US ambassador Michael McFaul – . who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s . foreign ministry. Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said. They implied that he wanted to contact a senior FSB agent who was snooping on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bomber. A letter in Russian which Fogle . carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big . fish. Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you . $100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and . co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to . answer certain questions. ‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’ The recruit is instructed to use an . internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for . staying in touch with us’. The incident is the biggest spy . scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other . Russians in the US in 2010. The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US . intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees . of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’ Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security' Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested . the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus . bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter . released by the FSB is genuine .

"The survey found men who consumed more alcohol over 20 years were likely to suffer memory loss at a later age . If you’re a middle-aged man looking forward to a couple of pints tonight, you might want to stop at one. Men in their 40s who drink just two pints of beer a day risk accelerating mental decline by up to six years by the time they reach retirement age. In the first long-term study of its kind, scientists tracked more than 5,000 British men for 20 years and found heavy drinking was behind premature damage to the memory. Moderate drinking, defined as less than 2.5 units a day – roughly a pint of beer or a large glass of wine – was found to have no effect on memory, reasoning or problem solving. But men who drank more than 4.5 units a day – less than two pints or two large glasses of wine – suffered a deterioration in their ability to recall information, the equivalent to an extra six years of ageing. And the decline of the brain’s ‘executive function’ – which includes attention span and reasoning skills – was hastened by an extra year and a half. The study, carried out by scientists at University College London, involved tracking the drinking habits of 5,054 civil servants over a ten-year period until the late 1990s, and then testing their mental ability over the next ten years until 2009. Dr Séverine Sabia, lead author of the study, said: ‘Much of the research evidence about drinking and a relationship to memory and executive function is based on older populations. ‘Our study focused on middle-aged participants and suggests that heavy drinking is associated with faster decline in all areas of cognitive function in men.’ Those classed as heavy drinkers performed significantly worse than the light drinkers, with a memory decline equivalent to an extra six years over the decade. File image . The participants, who were in their . mid-40s when they were recruited, were quizzed three times during the . first decade to establish how much, how often, and what they were . drinking. The second stage was to analyse their cognitive function. Each man was assessed three times over the next ten years, starting at age 56 on average and ending when they were 66. Those . classed as heavy drinkers performed significantly worse than the light . drinkers, with a memory decline equivalent to an extra six years over . the decade. The heavy drinkers also fared worse in experiments testing their verbal fluency and mathematical ability. The . results showed their decline in general cognitive ability and executive . function was accelerated by a year and a half, compared to those who . did not drink at all. Some 2,099 women also took part in the experiment. Those who drank more than two units a day tended to show an accelerated cognitive decline, but researchers said the results were not strong enough to be statistically significant, and said they could not draw any conclusions. The study, published in the journal Neurology, concluded that ‘heavy alcohol consumption in mid-life is likely to be harmful for cognitive ageing, at least in men’. Dr Sabia admitted that the research relied on self-reported drinking, so ‘some participants may have underestimated their consumption’. Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, welcomed the study ‘as one more reason to stick to any New Year’s resolutions to cut back on alcohol’.","Men in their 40s who drink two pints of beer a day at risk of memory decline .

"A horse believed to be the oldest in the world has died after reaching the age of 51. Shayne, a liver chestnut Irish Draught cross thoroughbred, had been enjoying a comfortable retirement at an Essex sanctuary, spending up to five hours a day in the fresh air despite suffering from mild arthritis. But last month he was unable to get back up after his legs gave way and staff took the decision to put him down. Scroll down for video . Shayne, pictured with stable hand Paige Emmins, had mild arthritis but still enjoyed the fresh air . Shayne, a liver chestnut Irish Draught thoroughbred, has died at the age of 51 at an Essex sanctuary . Sue Burton, founder of the 40-acre Remus Memorial Horse Sanctuary, near Ingatestone, Essex, said:  'Shayne was a happy horse, a lovely old boy and we are proud to have known him. 'He was great to own and we are delighted to have had him and we shall miss him dearly.' Ms Burton believes that the elderly gelding's personality and the fact that his previous owners did not overwork him helped him to live for so long. Shayne had a few grey hairs and mild arthritis, despite his advanced years . She said: 'He was such a lovely horse with a great character and he showed how good a horse of this age could look.' Shayne had a few grey hairs around his . eyes and in his mane but a high-calorie diet kept him strong and . he enjoyed four meals a day. His diet included sugar beet and chaff mixed together along with alfalfa nuts, with along cabbage for treats. Shayne, who stood at 15 hands and weighed 480kg, was put to sleep after he collapsed on February 22. Staff at the Row Green Equine and Pet Crematorium in Braintree carried out Shayne's cremation for free, waiving their usual fee of £600. Ella Martin, from Row Green, said: 'It was an honour to be asked to collect Shayne. 'We have worked with Remus Horse Sanctuary for many years and as a token to Sue and her team we offered to cremate him free of charge, a fitting tribute.' The Remus team, which relies on donations to support its work, is now deciding on a final resting place for the ornate wooden cask carrying Shayne's ashes. Last year, when the tale of Shayne's incredible longevity came to light, Ms Burton said: 'We get people who rescue a horse and they tell us that it is in its 30s so it knocks them for six when we say we have one in its 50s.' The previous title of oldest living horse in the world was held by Welsh/Arab steed Badger, from Pembrokeshire, Wales, who died aged 51, in in 2004. Last year, the Guinness World Records team said nobody had laid claim to the title since Badger's death. Staff at the sanctuary believed him to be 51 based on the date of birth given by his previous owner, and medical checks. Veterinary staff try to find out how old a horse is by looking at the condition of a horse's teeth. How long teeth are, how worn they are, and how deep any grooves are, can all give clues as to which birthday should be celebrated. Old Billy, a working barge horse, was 62 years old when he died on November 27 1822. He was born in Woolston, Lancashire in 1760 and spent his life pulling barges along canals. From paintings, Billy is shown to have a brown coat with white blaze and to be similar in size to a shire horse. His skull is on display in the Manchester Museum and his taxidermied head is on display in the Bedford Museum. A British Horse Society spokesman estimated that Shayne's years made him the human equivalent of more than 100, but said that 'the older they get, the harder it is to tell' once horses get past their average life expectancy of early thirties. On average, every horse year beyond the age of four is roughly the same as 2.5 human years. Using this method, Shayne would easily be receiving birthday cards from the Queen if he were human - at a whopping 120. As Shayne's birth was believed to be before horse passports were introduced, there would only be paperwork detailing the exact date if he were a purebreed. But elderly Shayne fell a little way short of laying claim to being the oldest horse in history. That title belongs to 'Old Billy' who was foaled in Woolston, Lancashire and had reached the age of 62 when he died in 1822. Staff at the Remus Memorial Horse Sanctuary are now deciding what to do with Shayne's ashes .","Shayne, a liver chestnut Irish Draught cross thoroughbred, died last month .

"The BBC’s coverage of the Arab Spring has been heavily criticised – by the corporation’s bosses.Head of news Helen Boaden admitted that her journalists got carried away with events and produced ‘over-excited’ reports. She told a BBC Trust report that in Libya, where reporters were ‘embedded’ with rebels, they may have failed to explore both sides of the story properly. Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen was among those criticised in the study into coverage of the uprisings, which found that ‘excitement’ did sometimes ‘infect’ the reporting, which some viewers described as ‘too emotive’ and ‘veering into opinion’. The BBC's coverage of major revolutions such as Libya, pictured. were prioritised over reporting from countries where regimes were not overthrown resulting in 'insufficient' coverage . The document, published yesterday, . also raised concerns about the corporation’s use of footage filmed on . mobile phones and other user-generated content. It noted that the BBC . failed to warn viewers with ‘caveats’ about the ‘authenticity’ of such . footage in 74 per cent of cases. It also warned that the corporation ignored events in some countries as it concentrated on ‘big’ stories. Miss Boaden is quoted saying: ‘In the . conflict in Egypt in the beginning . . . we might have sounded . over-excited – you can take on the colour of who you’re with. I had to . say “just be careful about your tone”. ‘In Libya too, where we were . essentially embedded [with the rebels] at the start, we might have . sounded over-excited – you have to be careful if you can’t get to the . other side of the story.’ While the report found that overall . the BBC’s coverage was ‘generally impartial’, it did raise concerns . about aspects of its reporting. Journalist Edward Mortimer who authored the report said it was 'a pity' that reporting suffered on behalf of coverage of uprisings in countries like Egypt, pictured . Embarrassingly for Mr Bowen, it . suggested he should ‘travel a little less’ so he would have more time to . provide ‘insight’ and ‘strategic guidance’ to bosses. The report’s author, former UN . director of communications Edward Mortimer, added that the BBC made . mistakes in its reporting of countries such as Bahrain, where he said . coverage was ‘rather sporadic’ and arguably insufficient. The report added there should have . been ‘greater eagerness’ in covering the situation in Yemen and also . questioned coverage of Algeria, Morocco and Jordan. Alison Hastings, chairman of the . trust’s editorial standards committee, said: ‘We’re keen to see if . improvements can be made . . . both in the scope of coverage to provide a . fuller picture of events, and in providing better context for . audiences.

"Nigel Farage has said the voices of overseas territories are dangerously 'muted' in Britain and they should be allowed to elect their own MP . The Falklands, Gibraltar and Britain’s other overseas territories should be given a seat in the Commons, Nigel Farage said yesterday. The UKIP leader claims their voices are dangerously ‘muted’ in Britain and they should be allowed to elect their own ‘MP for the Territories’. He points to France, which reserves seats in both of its houses of Parliament for dependencies including Reunion, Guadeloupe and French Polynesia. Last year France elected its first MP for Britain because London has so many French expatriates. Both Gibraltar and the Falklands had ‘big neighbours behaving with increasing belligerence’, Mr Farage said. ‘The voice of these lands, however, is muted in London. They have shown us loyalty: isn’t it about time we reciprocated?’ There are 14 overseas territories – parts of our former empire that have not acquired independence or have voted to stay British. Collectively, the territories have a population of 260,000 people and a land area of approximately 667,000 square miles. Mr Farage said: 'Let us copy the French. Give the Crown dependencies a House of Commons seat, so that their voice can be heard in the chamber and at the top table of British politics.' The current minister responsible for the Territories is Mark Simmonds, of the Foreign Office. Gibraltar, however, is the responsibility of the Minister for Europe David Lidington MP, while the Falklands are the responsibility of Hugo Swire, another Foreign Office minister. But Mr Farage said that the French National Assembly had 27 seats reserved for its overseas dependencies, with 21 representatives in its other legislative house, the Senate. He suggests one ‘MP for the territories’ should represent all of Britain’s overseas territories. ‘Before anybody says that the combined population for these territories would make this difficult we must remember that the old Western Islands seat now called ‘a h-Eileanan an Iar’, has a population of less than Gibraltar alone,’ the UKIP leader insisted. Mr Farage pointed to an unhappy historic precedent - when Malta was declined three MPs in the House of Commons and went on to break away from Britain. Collectively, the territories have a population of 260,000 people and a land area of approximately 667,000 square miles. Pictured is Santa Barbara beach and the Rock of Gibraltar . ‘Before Malta became independent it was offered full integration with the UK, including three MPs. A referendum was held in 1956 on the island and 77 per cent voted in favour of the proposal,’ he said. ‘Sadly the turnout was only 60 per cent - how we long for turnouts of 60 per cent today - and under the rules of the time the result was regarded as void. ‘Britain rejected the result, Malta didn’t get the MPs, slowly the path was set and its government became increasingly anti British, setting up deals with Gaddafi and becoming a republic. ‘If the UK had had the wit at the time to accept that referendum, welcome Maltese MPs and integrate fully Malta would be a contented part of the UK. So let us take up the challenge, and welcome those far-flung parts of the Queen’s territories as full members of our family.'","Nigel Farage claims voices of territories are dangerously 'muted'

"Markus Persson (pictured) created Minecraft in 2009 before releasing it widely in November 2011 . The creator of global gaming success Minecraft is being accused of 'selling out' after allegedly accepting a £1.2billion deal from Microsoft. Marcus 'Notch' Persson, a 35-year-old high-school dropout who learned to code at the age of seven, is now set to become a billionaire from the game he created in his bedroom. The response from the gaming industry is one of shock, as the Swede is known for promoting piracy, defending small-time developers and often mocking Microsoft and its operating systems. Last year, Persson's company Mojang AB recorded a profit of £70million, and Minecraft has now sold 54million copies world wide. Persson, . the son of a nurse and a drug-addict ex-convict, is now being branded a . 'sellout' after accepting the $2bn (£1.2bn) offer from Microsoft - a . company he has not always supported, quite the contrary. In 2012, Markus Person criticized Windows 8 and accused Microsoft of trying to 'ruin the PC as an open platform' He also tweeted that he would 'endorse your c***' for $2bn, and it appears that he has done just that. In . response to the news fans have tweeted that his 'indie values sell out . in the face of cash', and worrying that Microsoft will 'ruin' Minecraft. 'The . gaming world is in shock. Not because Microsoft would pay two million . dollars for Mojang, but that Mojang is even for sale,' writes . gamingexpert Thomas Arnroth on ComputerSweden. 'Markus Persson and his Minecraft is the symbol of the so called breakthrough of the 'indiegames'. The one scene where he has not feared the limelight has been the battle for indie-developers against the big companies.' Markus Persson was just seven when he started teaching himself how to code. One year later he produced his first game on the family Commodore 128. Switching sides: The Swedish 35-year-old is being accused of 'selling out' having spend years defending 'indie developers' and criticising the big names in the industry . Building blocks: Persson began coding at the age of seven and created Minecraft after dropping out of high school to become a game developer - the game has now sold 54million copies worldwide . The . family – Markus, his parents Ritva, a nurse, and Birger, a railway . worker, and his younger sister Anna, had recently moved from tiny Edsbyn . in Halsingland to suburban Stockholm. In . a biography of Persson, he remembers struggling with friendships at the . new school, preferring playing with the computer or building with Lego . blocks. Minecraft was created in 2009. At the start of the game, a player is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.' They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves. Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape. Players are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different materials. The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available. His . parents divorced when he was 11, and his father, a former drug addict . who had remained clean throughout his children’s lives, moved out. Persson’s relationship with his father deteriorated as Birger began using again, and he was later jailed for burglary. Persson's . high school years were meant to have focused on his chosen specialty . subject, media studies, but he spent his time programming, and . eventually dropped out aged 16. He . ended up working as a game developer at King.com, leaving the company . after 4.5years in 2009 to work on Minecraft, releasing a Classic version . of the game in May that year. By January 2011 the game had sold 1,000,000 copies. Just nine months later, numbers hit 3,000,000. ‘The gaming world was starved of the type of star Markus Persson became,’ Linus Larsson, co-author of Minecraft: block, pixlar och göra sig en hacka (Minecraft: blocks, pixels and making a profit), told Expressen last year. In 2012, founder Markus Persson, who tweets under the handle @notch, openly criticised Microsoft's Windows 8 software (pictured) Persson also separately tweeted this his price to ‘endorse c***’ was $2 billion dollars, which may explain the pricing of the deal . ‘He . has a lot of fans and is received as a superstar at gaming events, it’s . pretty amazing. He even has 1.3million [now 1.77million] followers on . Twitter. ‘At the same time, far from everyone knows who Markus Persson is, he can still walk anonymously on the streets of Stockholm.’ MENSA member Persson is not exactly in dire needs for cash. Last year he bought Stockholm's most expensive apartment - a £2.4million penthouse in exclusive Ostermalm. The reasons for the sale has yet to be made official, however, ComputerSweden speculates that it could be that Persson is simply bored of Minecraft. The soon-to-be billionaire, who officially remains single after divorcing his wife of one year in 2012, has not made any comments on the deal, instead tweeting about his Rubik's cube record (it's one minute, 45seconds).","Minecraft founder Markus Persson 'selling game to Microsoft for £1.2bn'

"A piece of furniture which launched the global flat-pack revolution is going back on sale after nearly 60 years. Homeware giant Ikea yesterday announced it was to start selling the Lovbacken three-legged side table, more than half a century after the original went on sale in Sweden. The leaf-shaped wooden side table takes its inspiration from the Lovet, which was first sold in flat pack form in 1956 after Swedish designer Gillis Lundgren was forced to saw the legs off to fit it into his car. Inspiration: A modern version of the Lovet table that triggered the flat pack trend is set to go on sale again at IKEA. The new model, made of stained veneer on MDF, will be called the Lovbacken and will cost £40 . A classic in the making: The Lovet from the original IKEA catalogue in the 40s . Ikea claims Lundgren’s drastic move triggered the flat-pack revolution that has swept the UK and the other countries ever since. The Lovbacken will cost £40 and is billed as the ideal piece of furniture to pair with an armchair or alongside a sofa. Emily Birkin, Ikea UK sales manager, said: 'Most people will have a piece of furniture that they have either built or put together somewhere in their house. Where it all began: An IKEA catalogue from 1956 . 'But until now, not many will know the incredible story about how it all began with a simple little table. 'We know from our research that people are becoming more interested in buying pieces of furniture that have a story attached to them, so we decided to bring back a popular piece that not only comes steeped in history, but combines retro styling with modern convenience.'

"An Indian female politician and activist has said women's clothes and behaviour are also to blame for rapes. Asha Mirje, a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader in western Maharashtra state, questioned at a meeting on Tuesday why a 23-year-old physiotherapy student who was gang-raped on a bus in Delhi in 2012 was out late at night. The student died of her injuries sparking thousands of people to take to the streets in nationwide protests against the prevalence of rape and sexual assault in India. Scroll Down for Video . Controversial: Dr Asha Mirje said women's clothes and behaviour are also to blame for rapes . A number of shocking incidents have since been highlighted in Indian media, most recently the case of 20-year-old woman who said she was gang-raped in a rural area of West Bengal in eastern India on the orders of a village court last week. Mirje, who is a member of the state women's commission, said in reference to the Delhi assault: 'Did Nirbhaya really have go to watch a movie at 11 in the night with her friend?' 'Nirbhaya', a Hindi word meaning 'fearless', has been widely adopted by the Indian media as a name for the victim. She also commented on the gang rape of a photojournalist who was on assignment at a disused mill in Mumbai last year, asking why the victim had gone to such an isolated place. 'Rapes take place also because of a woman's clothes, her behaviour and her presence at inappropriate places,' she said. Mirje, who is a member of the state women's commission, said in reference to the Delhi assault: 'Did Nirbhaya really have go to watch a movie at 11 in the night with her friend?' Women must be 'careful', she said, and think if they are inviting assault. Sexual violence has become a huge social and political issue since the Delhi rape and India toughened laws on sex crimes in March last year. Public anger over the poor state of women's safety in Delhi was one reason that the ruling Congress Party was wiped out in local elections in the city last month. Mirje's party belongs to the Congress-led national coalition government and her comments caused an immediate outcry. 'Every time such a statement is made by a public figure it justifies rape,' said Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association, a lobby group. 'It's unconscionable that people in public posts make such remarks.' She also commented on the gang rape of a photojournalist who was on assignment at a disused mill in Mumbai last year, asking why the victim had gone to such an isolated place . Even members of her own party distanced themsleves from her remarks. NCP member of parliament Supriya Sule told reporters she was sorry Mirje had made them and that they reflected her personal views, not those of the party. 'She did make a mistake yesterday. She should not have said it,' she said . While Mirje is thought to be the first senior female public figure to make such comments about the Delhi rape, other members of commissions looking after women's affairs have made similar remarks about less high-profile attacks. NCP member of parliament Supriya Sule who was on stage with Dr Mirje said she was sorry she had made those remarks . Enough is enough: A demonstrator holds a placard during a protest outside a court in New Delhi last year . 'Mirje is reflecting what is a much larger problem. There are many others who hold such views,' Krishnan said. Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal, initially dismissed a gang rape in her state in 2012 as a fabricated incident aimed at tarnishing her government. Assaults have tarnished the reputation of a country that has enjoyed growing prosperity in the past decade and is modernising fast. Still, Mirje's comments were a reminder that conservative and traditional mores are still deeply held by many of its 1.2 billion people, women as well as men. In the most recent case, a 51-year-old Danish tourist was gang-raped in the back-packers' district of Delhi last month by men she asked for directions to her hotel.","Asha Mirje is a Nationalist Congress Party leader in Maharashtra state .

"A florist is being sued by the Washington State Attorney General for refusing to sell flowers for a gay wedding, it emerged today. A lawsuit was filed on Tuesday on behalf of Attorney General Bob Ferguson against Barronelle Stutzman, the owner of Arlene's Flowers in Richland, Washington. The row emerged last month when Stutzman refused to sell flowers to longtime customers Robert Ingersoll and Curt Freed for their wedding in September. Row: A legal fight has broken out over Arlene's Flowers in Richland, Washington, after the owner refused to provide flowers for a gay couple's wedding . She told the couple she would not provide them with her service 'because of [her] relationship with Jesus Christ'. Ferguson, who had written to the florist asking her to change her stance two weeks ago, says she is violating the state's Consumer Protection Act, which bars any discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 'As Attorney General, it is my job to enforce the laws of the state of Washington,' Ferguson said in a statement. 'Under the Consumer Protection Act, it is unlawful to discriminate against customers based on sexual orientation. If a business provides a product or service to opposite-sex couples for their weddings, then it must provide same sex couples the same product or service.' Stutzman on the other hand has won the backing of several groups and has set up a fighting fund to pay for her legal case. The small business' Facebook page has become a hotbed of debate on gay marriage and a group has been set up calling for the shop to boycotted. On the page Stutzman posted: 'To those who have and do support us, we want to thank you for all your concern and phone calls. Many have requested a place to send financial support to help with legal defense. We have set up a deposit only account with our local Key Bank.' It goes on to provide the bank details. In a statement posted at the time of the refusal, Stutzman refused to back down on what she called 'her conviction'. Offended: Robert Ingersoll says he felt compelled to complain to the Attorney General over Baronnelle Stutzman's refusal to provide his wedding flowers . 'This customer has been in many times and purchased flowers from us,' she wrote. 'When it came to doing his wedding, I said,  'I could not do it because of my relationship with Jesus Christ.' He thanked me and said, 'He respected my opinion.' We talked and gave each other a hug and he left. 'Since that day, we have received many comments on same sex marriages. I believe, biblically, that marriage is between a man and a woman. That is my conviction, yours may be different.' 'I have hired all walks of people in different circumstances, and had the privilege of working with some very talented people that happen to be gay.' 'I’m sure there are many places you can purchase flowers, if you choose not to purchase them from Arlene’s, because of your beliefs, then I certainly understand.' Lawyers on her behalf wrote to the Attorney General making clear she would fight his stance. 'Discrimination is not the issue. Although gay marriage may be legal in Washington for the time being, the concept offends...Ms Stutzman and many others in Washington,'  the letter said. Intervention: Attorney General Bob Ferguson, pictured, has filed a lawsuit against Barronelle Stutzman, the owner of Arlene's Flowers in Richland, Washington . The very same day the legal bid was launched a worker left the florist in objection to her boss' stance. Eryn Hugo, who had worked there for a . year and a half told the Tri-City Herald: 'Some things are more important than money, and I felt making a stand by . quitting -- just not doing something completely against my beliefs -- . was very important to me.' Ferguson wants a permanent injunction against the florist forcing her to comply - possibly leaving her with a $2,000 fine. Ingersoll said it was a difficult decision to raise the issue with the Attorney General but the couple ultimately felt it was the right thing to do. Ingersoll told the Herald: 'It really hurt because it was somebody I knew. We laid awake all night. It was eating at our souls. There was never a question she'd be the one to do our flowers. She does amazing work.' 'We're both passionate about seeing people succeed and that nobody should be hurt or in pain.' 'This is one of those things -- it's very hurtful. I probably haven't felt this much pain since I was in high school and people called me names, and I'm 42.' 'People are going to hate us,' he added. 'That is sad and makes me unhappy. I know people are going to come out of the woodwork and going to be hateful. I don't say hateful things. I'm not that kind of person.'","Attorney General Bob Ferguson has filed a lawsuit against Arlene's Flowers in Richland, Washington, after the owner refused to supply flowers for a gay wedding .

"Cat owners have raised fears for their pets' lives after more than 100 went missing in one town - and some returned possible signs of abuse. The animals have all vanished from Ipswich, Suffolk, where their worried owners have told police and animal protection groups. Their fears were heightened this week after Rupert, a four-month-old tabby kitten, returned a night after going missing with burnt whiskers, bruises and missing chunks of fur. Worries: Louise Catchpole with her kittens Rupert and Nigella (also pictured right). She said four-month-old Rupert - one of more than 100 to go missing in Ipswich, Suffolk - returned with burnt whiskers and bruises . Ms Catchpole said vets told her Rupert (pictured today) 'looked like he had been kicked around like a football' Rupert's owner Louise Catchpole, 30, said he and another kitten called Nigella went missing from her home on Sunday night. 'When he came back he was limping, covered in faeces and absolutely terrified,' she said. 'His whiskers had been burned, there was a large chunk of fur that seemed to have been ripped out. 'When I took him to the vets they said it looked like he had been kicked around like a football.' Nigella was found unharmed yesterday, but Ms Catchpole said she feared that she was also taken but managed to escape unharmed. 'I think this needs to be taken very seriously,' she added. 'I am so relieved to have the cats back but they are both very nervous now. I am not letting them out of my sight at the moment.' The worried owner is one of almost 400 who have joined the community group Ipswich Missing Cats on Facebook. The owner of Rupert (pictured) is one of almost 400 who have joined the Ipswich Missing Cats Facebook group . Recognise this animal? Cat owners in Ipswich, Suffolk, say more than 100 have gone missing this year, most of them in recent months. Pictured is Lulu, one of the missing pets who is spayed but not microchipped . The group has so far counted 108 cats missing since the start of the year, most of which have been in the last few months. Only a handful are thought to have returned, including Rupert and Nigella, and it is thought at least three were injured. The pet owners said one animal, whose owner asked not to be named, had to be put down after coming back injured. Another, one-year-old Jenessa who belongs to Sarah Mindham, 44, limped back in through her owner's catflap after a week with a broken pelvis. 'I think that she could have been taken because she had no other injuries,' her owner said.

Worry: An animal which has been missing since August 20 (left) and Midnight, last seen on August 13 (right) High number: Most of the disappearances have happened in the last few months, but some of the vanishing pets date back to the beginning of the year. Freddie (pictured) disappeared on March 9 in the IP4 postcode area . 'I took her to the vet and they said she could have been run over but she could have also been kicked, it's a really scary thought.' Kirsty Downing, 37, lost two of her four cats at the beginning of September and is convinced somebody is stealing the animals. The mother-of-three said her pets were ‘very homely’ and it was more than a coincidence that Marley, six, and Oreo, two, had disappeared at exactly the same time. The teaching assistant added: ‘They both went off on the same day and didn't return. It was only when I went on the Facebook group that I realised so many had disappeared. ‘It is strange because they are very homely cats but it made sense when I heard that somebody had been taking them.' Part-time nanny Deni Parkes, 50, who founded the group, said many pet owners she spoke to were now so frightened they did not want to let their cats outdoors. 'I believe someone is harming them and whoever is doing this needs to get some psychiatric help', she said. 'You have to think if these people can torture a cat, they can easily torture a child or another person.' She said her group has been inundated by stories of pets vanishing, including one owner who lost all three of his pets in a single week. Debbie Westwood's cat Millie has gone missing, The 41-year-old from Ipswich has put up posters . Mystery: Freddie (pictured) is one of the vanished cats and has been missing from his owners since March 9 . Cute: Mixed breed cat Frank went missing from the Cedars park area of the town and featured on the group . The description for this advert said the animal was missing since early August from Creeting Road West, Ipswich. He is young, has yellow eyes and a high-pitched meow, and is one of dozens reported missing . The disappearances began at the beginning of the year but have markedly increased in recent months, the owners said. David Smith, the co-ordinator of Cats Protection’s Ipswich branch, said: 'We hear of cases of cats going missing or being mistreated from time to time but to hear of this number of cats going missing in such a short space of time is astonishing. 'It must be completely heart-breaking for the owners concerned to have lost their beloved pets and, in some cases, not know what has become of them. 'It is also horrific to hear that some of these cats have returned with such serious injuries that they have had to be put to sleep.' Ipswich mayor Bill Quinton said: 'I share the devastation any cat owner feels when their much-loved pet goes missing or is injured or killed. 'I hope there is no pattern behind this - certainly, we have not experienced any increase in reports to the council. 'People who are worried should contact the RSPCA or Ipswich Cats Protection, who both do excellent work.' The RSPCA urged owners who fear their cat is in danger to call them on 0300 1234 999. Sergeant Mark Thomas, of Suffolk Police, said: 'Police have been made aware of allegedly stolen or mistreated cats in the Ipswich area. 'The matter is being looked into and officers will establish if any criminal offences have taken place.'","Facebook group set up in Ipswich, Suffolk, by hundreds of owners .

"The mayor of a German city claims Romanian and Bulgarian migrants are causing havoc, committing crimes and costing his authority close to £15million a year to house, feed and police.Soeren Link, the left-wing mayor of the former industrial city of Duisburg, close to the border with Holland, claims prostitution and robberies have spiked since the EU's latest members began arriving last year.'We are massively affected,' said the mayor, confirming the fears of the Association of German Cities which recently warned of 'social unrest' because of the economic refugees.

He added: 'We didn't ask for this problem and we can't handle it alone.' On his Facebook page the mayor wrote: 'Platitude slogans and strong words do not help!' His outspokenness earned him the . praise of citizens including pensioner Heinz Hoffmann, 67, who said: 'If . my rubbish spills out on the street I would be slapped with a summons . in no time.

'The Roma in particular', states the report, 'end up in desolate conditions once they are here'. The knock-on effect is chaos also in classrooms where native children are being held back because the newcomers know no German. 'This is a totally new phenomenon, brought about by the euro crisis,' says Michaela Menichetti, integration commissioner for a school district in Reutlingen. Police in several German towns report on organised Romanian crime gangs where children and women are sent out each morning with specific instructions where to steal and from whom. One police report from Duisburg read: 'For at least a year, observations in Duisburg (but also nationally) show that Romanian groups - apparently family clans - are committing organized crimes on an alarming scale.' In 2007 there were 31,596 immigrants into Germany from the two countries and a further 83,000 arrived in the following three years. In 2011 alone nearly 64,000 arrived from Romania and Bulgaria.","Duisburg mayor Soeren Link says Roma send children on 'stealing missions'

"Taxpayers were forced to pay out more than £2.5m in overtime wages in just a month to clear the runaway backlog of passport applications, new figures show. The Passport Office paid £6.75 million to staff for working extra hours during July, August and September as they attempted to a clear a backlog of thousands of applications. Extra staff were drafted in  and working hours were extended over seven days a week as the backlog of applications soared to more than 500,0000. Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog . Immigration minister James Brokenshire revealed overtime costs were £2m in July, £2.5m in August and £2.1m in September . The Passport Office's overtime costs were £2.065 million in July, £2.53 million in August and £2.14 million in September, according to immigration minister James Brokenshire. Previously released figures show overtime payments stood at £964,742 in May and £3.19 million for the first five months of 2014 compared with £1.5 million in the same period last year. Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to issue an apology to people whose travel plans had been disrupted by the delays, while measures were brought in to try to fast-track applications. A total of 226 staff were temporarily transferred from the Home Office to the Passport Office between June and August, Mr Brokenshire added. The backlog of applications in progress spiralled to 550,000. Mrs May announced last month that HMPO was to be brought back into the Home Office and be directly accountable to ministers. In response to a written parliamentary question from shadow immigration minister David Hanson, Mr Brokenshire said: ‘Overtime costs incurred by HM Passport Office were as follows: July £2,065,021, August £2,537,957, September £2,148,872.’ The summer holiday application backlog sparked long queues of people outside the passport offices . Passport Office Chief Executive Paul Pugh was grilled by MPs over his organisation's failure to get a grip on the backlog and was later forced from office . Labour frontbencher Mr Hanson accused Mrs May of wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' cash. He said: ‘These figures show just how much Theresa May's mismanagement is costing the taxpayer - it's a sign of the complete failure of leadership that she's cut staff only to then spend nearly £7 million on overtime. ‘It was the Home Secretary who made the decision to cut staff and let the crisis in the Passport Office happen, and it's the Home Secretary's decision to keep on wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' money on overtime to cope with it. ‘Staff worked hard to deal with the backlog created by ministers' poor decisions, but the staff cuts they've had to endure have meant they've had no option but to use overtime. ‘A properly managed passport service wouldn't need the constant overtime that this Government continues to rely on and the public will rightly be angered by this continual failure.’","Passport Office paid £6.75m to staff for working overtime during summer .

"The controversial new European Commission President is not a ‘sort of green-eyed federalist monster’, Lord Mandelson claimed today. The former Labour Cabinet minister insisted Jean-Claude Juncker was not pushing for a United States of Europe and feared Britain exiting the EU would be a ‘disaster’. But he warned David Cameron to stop brandishing his in-out referendum like ‘some sort of pistol’ to threaten other EU leaders: ‘Agree with us, or else’. Lord Mandelson, a former Brussels Commissioner, insisted Jean-Claude Junker was not pushing for a United States of Europe . Mr Juncker was confirmed as the new President of the European Commission on Friday, after Mr Cameron became embroiled in bitter row with his EU counterparts. Mr Cameron condemned the decision as a ‘bad day for Europe’. The Tories, Labour and Lib Dems all agreed Mr Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, was the wrong person for the job. It is feared his reputation as a pro-federalist will make it harder for Mr Cameron to claw powers back from Brussels. Lord Mandelson conceded Mr Juncker was not an ‘ideal candidate’ but insisted there were ‘encouraging signs’ that he is open to Britain’s demands. Prime Minister David Cameron said it was a bad day for Europe when EU leaders handed Mr Juncker the role of President of the European Commission . David Cameron's strategy to try to stop Jean-Claude Juncker from getting the Brussels job by a former top diplomat. David Frost, former EU director at the Foreign Office and until last year the government's top trade official, said the strategy 'was, and is, the right thing to try to get someone other than Juncker'. Writing on his blog, Mr Frost added: 'He’s a corporatist, unsympathetic to flexibility and subsidiarity, and doesn’t seem to have much sympathy for the UK’s thinking. 'That’s not what the EU needs just now.' He added: 'On issues that matter in the EU, you are always best stating your case forcibly, politely, but clearly.' Mr Frost warned of 'a bit of bumpiness' in Britain's relationship with Germany, but said it depends on 'whether either Cameron or Merkel think they were genuinely misled by the other in any of their discussions'. Lord Mandelson, a former European Commissioner, met Mr Juncker at a summit in Berlin last week. ‘He explicitly said that he does not advocate a United States of Europe – he’s not a sort of green-eyed federalist monster, as some in Britain have portrayed him,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘Secondly, he strongly agreed with me when I said that, were Britain to leave the European Union, it wouldn’t just be a catastrophe for Britain, it would be a disaster for the European Union as a whole. ‘And the third thing I was struck by was his emphasis on the economy in Europe and the need to drive up our competitiveness and our share in global markets. And that would mean he accepted extending and deepening Europe’s single market. ‘So these are encouraging signs about his policy agenda and we’ve now got to set about working with him in them.’ Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron today insisted he can still secure reforms to Britain's relationship with Europe. 'I am ready to move on and keep fighting for Britain's interests in Europe,' he wrote. Referring to previous claims by Mr Juncker that he was ready to deliver a 'fair deal' for Britain, Mr Cameron said: 'If by a fair deal, we can agree that we are not heading, at different speeds, to the same place - as some have assumed up to now - then there is business we can do.' However, Lord Mandelson warned the Prime Minister against repeatedly using his threat of an in-out referendum by 2017 to get what he wants in Europe. ‘I would just give this advice to the Prime Minister: stop waving around this threat of a referendum in Britain as if it’s some sort of pistol that we’re holding to everyone’s head and saying ‘you’ve got to agree with us, or else’.’ He said Mr Cameron had to come up with reforms of benefit to Europe as a whole and not just give the impression that the only reason that he is advocating these measures is because of divisions in the Tory party. ‘The problem is that the Prime Minister in the way he’s gone about handling Britain’s interests in Europe has rather isolated himself. ‘He makes it more difficult for people to back him, even when they agree with the points he is making. ‘He does find it very difficult now to get others in the European Union to follow him on anything and that, I’m afraid, is a direct result of the way in which he’s conducted his case in Brussels.’","Former Labour Cabinet minister defends Jean-Claude Juncker against critics .

PLaiyng piggyback: Soleh has fed the tiger 5 kg (11 lbs) of meat per day since the animal was three months old . In their natural habitat Bengal tigers are powerful nocturnal hunters that travel many miles to find buffalo, deer, wild pigs, and other large mammals. The tigers use their distinctive coats as camouflage and lie in wait and creep close enough to attack their victims with a quick spring and a fatal pounce. A hungry tiger can eat as much as 60lbs in one night, though they usually eat less. Despite their fearsome reputation, most tigers avoid humans however, a few do become dangerous maneaters. These animals are often sick and unable to hunt normally, or live in an area where their traditional prey has vanished. Females give birth to litters of two to six cubs, which they raise with little or no help from the male. Cubs cannot hunt until they are 18 months old and remain with their mothers for two to three years, when they disperse to find their own territory.","Mulan Jamila, a bengal tiger, lives in Malang, Indonesia's East Java province .

"An outbreak of bubonic plague in Madagascar has now claimed almost 50 victims and is spreading to the island's capital, officials warned today. There have been 138 suspected cases of the disease - similar to the Black Death in medieval Europe - since the start of the year, with  the death toll of 47 expected to rise in the coming months. Two people have been infected in the capital of Antananarivo, one of them dying, and health workers have mounted a pest control campaign through slum areas around the city. Scroll down for video . Warnings: Two people have been infected in the capital of Antananarivo (file picture), one of them dying . Response: Health officials have mounted a pest control campaign through slum areas around the city (file) The health ministry said 200 households had been ‘disinfected’ this month, adding that those who had contact with the infected had been given antibiotics in a bid to arrest the spread the disease. The World Health Organization last week said 40 people had died as a result of plague, which was first identified in August. Plague is spread by fleas and mostly affects rats, but humans can also contract the disease if they are bitten by a disease-carrying flea. The bubonic form prompts swelling of the lymph node, but can be treated with antibiotics. The pneumonic version, affecting the lungs, can be spread from person to person through coughing and can kill within 24 hours. Map: An outbreak of bubonic plague has killed almost 50 people in Madagascar, Africa . The situation in Madagascar is all the more worrying because of a high level of resistance to insecticides targeting fleas, the United Nations health agency said. In Ankasina, a slum outside Antananarivo, the family of the young woman who died from the plague said they have been stigmatised by the community. According to Bernadette Rasoarimanana, the mother of the deceased woman, community members have been giving them ‘dirty looks’ since the death of her daughter. Residents of the poor and overcrowded slum speak of squalid conditions, infested with rats, increasing the risk of infection. ‘Our neighbourhood is really dirty and has been neglected by the state for a long time,’ she said. Plague often breaks out in the vast island nation, and is usually at its worst between October and March. The last case of plague in the capital was ten years ago, said Christophe Rogier, of the island's Institut Pasteur. ‘It is possible that the plague continued to survive in Antananarivo for ten years without touching humans,’ with the virus restricted to its rat population, he said. ‘Rats are a natural reservoir of the plague, and they also survive the plague.’ According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the country has recorded on average 500 cases of plague every year since 2009. The Black Death, otherwise known as the bubonic plague, is estimated to have killed some 25million people across Europe in the Middle Ages. Troubled times: A town crier calls for the dead to be bought out in this drawing of London from 1665 . Bubonic plague killed around 100million people during the 14th century and was known as the 'Black Death'. Drawings and paintings from the outbreak, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers saying 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses. It is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats. The disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'. It kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated, although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive. After the Black Death arrived in 1347, plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century. Bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the developed world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa.","138 suspected cases this year - and death toll is expected to rise .

"When Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Jourdan Dunn stomped down the Burberry catwalk in THOSE blanket coats - a new AW14 style staple was born. The wool blanket . ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, patterned with Apache-style zig . zags were monogrammed with the initials of the model who wore it. Designer Christopher Bailey, known for setting trends, explained that Burberry has a long history of capes and blankets and the Burberry Heritage archive revealed that outerwear capes dated all the way back to the late 1880s. It's the blanket brigade! Cara Delevingne leads the finale at Burberry's AW14 show, which proved that the blanket will be the coolest way to wrap up warm this winter . 'The designs were created for activities including shooting, motoring and cycling, and proved popular due to their warmth, protective qualities and ease of wear. 'An illustration for a cotton gabardine cape also featured in Thomas Burberry’s patent application for the lightweight, weatherproof cloth in 1888,' he said. 'The Burberry Heritage archive presents advertisements for scarves as early as the 1880s in the local Hants & Berks Gazette. 'Now, the iconic cashmere scarf, which lands in store on September 2 and can be personalised with initials, is at the heart of our brand, recognised globally and is one of our most popular products over the AW14 period.' Too hot to wear it? No problem! Just throw it over your shoulder a la Burberry's models who brought back the trend from the Burberry Heritage archives, which have evidence of outerwear capes dating back to the late 1880s . High-end versus high-street: Olivia Palermo is lucky enough to have a monogrammed Burberry version, left, but luckily for mere mortals, ASOS have plenty for a fraction of the price, right . And it wasn't just Bailey who sent blanket coats down the catwalk - Chloe, Prabal Gurung, Sacai and DKNY's models all wrapped up warm in theirs on the runway, too. The new poncho styles seemingly take inspiration from the traditional equestrian blanket, with blanket-stitched edging and a warm and hardwearing textured feel. Vogue's catwalk edit describes them as the new 'wrap stars', with Helen Hibbird advising: 'Exquisite fabrics take this trend from sofa to street; look for double-faced cashmere and silk blends for the perfect drape.' Trendsetters: Supermodel Kate Moss, left, and Hart of Dixie star Jaime King, right, love their blankets . The high street is slowly but surely catching on and as the AW14 collections drop in store, the likes of Zara, Asos, Topshop and Net-a-porter are all offering their own cosy versions. Lisa Haynes, fashion and beauty editor of the Press Association, mused: 'When I saw Cara and co. storming the Burberry Prorsum AW14 catwalk, I had instant bespoke blanket envy. The monogramming, showcased by CD (Cara Delevingne) and SW (Suki Waterhouse), gives the piece massive trophy appeal. 'If you can't afford the £895 Burberry price tag, look to the high street for a blanket poncho homage. 'AW14's 'blankoat' blanket/coat fusion is surprisingly handy for transitioning between the seasons. 'Wear instead of an overcoat as a layering staple. If you're wearing a blanket in Burberry's proportions, keep the rest of your outfit streamlined to balance out your silhouette. 'A step on from last winter's shoulder robing, work it like a Burberry model by draping your blankoat over one shoulder. If the asymmetry feels off make like Olivia P and wear around your neck, like a super-sized scarf. 'Any old blanket from the duvet cupboard just won’t do. Your new season blankoat needs to be colour-blocked, textured and luxe - initials optional.' Will you be wrapping up warm this winter? ASOS are offering cosy blankets for £35, left, while designers are such as Michael Kors, right, are jumping on the cosy bandwagon with this £250 plaid offering from Net-a-Porter .","Burberry first unveiled monogrammed blankets at show in February .

"After a life-long love of Batman, 29-year-old Sydney man Zac Mihajlovic spent two years building a Batmobile in his backyard. The superhero enthusiast made a 6.2 metre Batmobile modelled in accurate detail on the one used by Batman in the 1989 movie - the only one in the world with full street registration. With a passion for the winged comic character, in 2009 Mr Mihajlovic bought a few spare parts from the actual Batmobile used in the movie and put them away. 'I'm a car and bike guy so I love all that sort of stuff,' he said. 'It doesn't get much better, if you can build anything what would you build? For me it was a Batmobile,' he told MailOnline. Scroll down for video . Zac Mihajlovic, 29 from Sydney, built a replica batmobile in his backyard after a life of loving the Batman franchise . The 6.2 metre vehicle is the only Batmobile in the world that has full street registration. It took Zac Mihajlovic several years to complete the car . Mr Mihajlovic let the parts sit around while he built a Batbike and it was not until 2010 that he got in touch Warner Brothers Australia to see if there were any licensing issues for building a Batmobile. Getting the all clear, Mr Mihajlovic started working on the Batmobile with his grandfather John Greene, a retired mechanical engineer and Scott Cox. 'I could see at that point why nobody else had done it before,' he said. Mr Mihajlovic, who lives with his grandparents and has no formal mechanical training built the Batmobile at home and at Mr Cox's workshop. 'About 30 per cent is made from the parts used in the film and the rest was moulded and made,' he said. 'It started with my grandfather who said ""any fantasy can become a reality"", so we took that to the next level.' Mr Mihajlovic first built a bat chopper (motorbike) before he enlisted the help of his grandfather, a former mechanic, to help him build the Batmobile, a much more challenging project . Mr Mihajlovic dresses up like Batman and uses his car and bike to support charities like Make A Wish Foundation . The vehicle was finished at the end of 2011 and sat in Mr Mihajlovic's garage for one-year until he decided what he wanted to do with at the end of 2012. At this point Mr Mihajlovic wanted to get Batmobile registered, but with movie cars not designed for safety, he said it took about a full year to get it passed as roadworthy. As part of this process, Mr Mihajlovic took the car to Queensland to work on it with an engineer for nearly three months to make changes needed to get the car registered. The Batmobile was finally registered in December 2013 and Mr Mihajlovic said it was a moment of validation. 'Before it had plates people thought it was just a plastic prop,' he said. The car does not feature machine guns, grappling hooks, or oil slick dispensers like Batman's, but it does have a working front turbine and afterburner. The car does not have some of the features of the movie Batmobile, such as machine guns, grappling hooks, and oil slick dispensers, but it does have a working front turbine and afterburner . Mr Mihajlovic bought a few spare parts from the actual Batmobile used in the movie in 2009 and stored them away in the hope of one day expanding his fleet of Batman inspired vehicles . 'I've always been a movie fan. Batman has the coolest vehicle and he's the only one without super powers,' he said. Mr Mihajlovic lives in Cobbitty in south west Sydney and has seen his life change since finishing and getting the vehicle registered in December last year. 'There are between 10 and 12 in the world and this is the only one in Australia, besides a prop at Movie World,' he said. 'As far as I know, it's the only one in the world with full street registration,' he said. 'Some have conditions to parades and that sort of thing. 'When the Roads and Traffic Authority came to the house to inspect it and they were impressed with the quality.' Work in progress: Mr Mihajlovic built the car with his grandfather over several years. It has now been approved for use by the RMS . Mr Mihajlovic used some original parts from the Batmobile used in the 1989 film and some that he and his grandfather built themselves to make the car . 'They were a bit concerned at first but then they were happy when they realised it was all legitimate,' he said. But because of the crowds the car attracts, Mr Mihajlovic can't use it for personal use. 'I've taken it to do the groceries one or two times - the reaction was crazy,' he said. 'I have to go get fuel separately otherwise it gets mad with people looking at it and takes me three hours to fill it up.' On a recent trip to The Rocks in Sydney's CBD, Mr Mihajlovic said he required a police escort. 'I couldn't get out of there it was that crazy,' he said. Mr Mihajlovic said the vehicle's high value presented some unique obstacles. 'It's so high-risk and the insurance is high', he said. 'It's too risky to drive around on the roads in case it gets hit,' he said. But he added the vehicle had also attracted some unexpected propositions. 'I've been offered close to a million dollars for it from a few people, a businessman in Sydney made and offer and someone on behalf of a sheik in Dubai made an offer as soon as it was registered.' 'I would say that they were fair offers but I had had zero enjoyment with it at that time so I was not considering selling it and it now provides me an income. 'An offer in the high hundreds of thousands is what I would say that it is worth with street registration on it.' Mr Mihajlovic worked on the car with his grandfather John Greene, who is a retired mechanical engineer and Scott Cox . The car has attracted offers of close to a million dollars from a businessman in Sydney and a sheik in Dubai . But in the six months since the vehicle has been registered, the Batman enthusiast has been busy using the car professionally and for charity work, which he now considers his full time work. 'I do a lot of charity work - I've done more than 40 Make-A-Wish wishes, I've also dropped men off at their weddings and sometimes partners organise surprise rides,' he said. 'It's the opportunity to be involved with charities like Make-A-Wish, that's the best thing, 100 per cent. 'Some of the younger kids don't quite get what it is, but kids above 10 get really into it, especially all the superhero stuff, they love.' Completing the Batman theme, Mr Mihajlovic wears a specially designed Batsuit, designed by David Pea of Universal Designs and based in Canada. But his love of all things Batman is so strong, Mr Mihajlovic has also built a Batbike from scratch. 'Everything apart from the gearbox and motor is handmade from aluminium,' he said. Taking shape: The Batmobile has been used to brighten up the lives of sick kids, as Mr Mihajlovic visits them in his Batman suit and Batmobile through the Make A Wish Foundation . About 30 per cent of the car was made using parts from the original Batmobile featured in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film, with the rest moulded and made by Mr Mihajlovic and his team . Despite the popularity of the Batmobile, Mr Mihajlovic plans to permanently garage it in the future. 'I just did not expect how crazy the response would be - I'm putting it away in a year or two,' he said. 'I was heading to a Make-A-Wish Foundation event and was on the freeway from Brisbane to the Gold Coast and I heard a buzzing noise - it was a news helicopter.' Mr Mihajlovic is planning on building and selling Formula 1 cars. 'I'm a decent way along in the designing. I'm going to start in a few weeks hand building F1-style cars people can register and drive,' he said. Like-minded Batman enthusiasts can join Mr Mihajlovic for joyrides through a Groupon deal to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the 1989 Tim Burton Batman film.

"The estranged wife of a pastor from suburban Chicago has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to poison her three daughters and stabbing two of them so they could 'meet Jesus Christ.' Pamela Christensen, 47, from Montgomery, was ordered held on $1million bail Thursday in connection to the September 25 knife attack. Police officers who responded to the Christensens' home in the 2300 block of Patron Lane after getting two 911 hang-ups were met at the door by the mother of three, whose white shirt was splattered with blood. Mother charged: Pamela Christensen, 47, is accused of trying to stab two of her three teenage daughters after a failed attempt to poison them . Grisly welcome: When police responded to the family's home in Montgomery, Illinois (pictured), they were met by Mrs Christensen in a white shirt drenched in blood . The 47-year-old dropped to her knees in front of the officers and told them she had tried to kill her daughters, according to court documents. Two of the girls were found upstairs with stab wounds to the chest. Their mother also knifed herself in the chest and abdomen. Mrs Christensen was taken to an area hospital for treatment, where she remained until Wednesday. Following her release, the married mother of three was charged with first-degree attempted murder, aggravated battery and aggravated restraint. She is due back in court October 16. Court records obtained by Chicago Sun-Times indicate that during her interview with police, the woman admitted to making a poisonous cocktail containing dishwashing detergent, which she was hoping to give her daughters so they would fall asleep, but the girls refused to drink the concoction. Rapture: Pamela Christensen said she had received messages from her estranged husband, Pastor Vaughn Christensen, telling her the end of the world was near and instructing her to get her kids ready to meet Jesus . When interviewed by police, Christensen’s daughters, ages 12, 16 and 19, told investigators that their mother held them at knifepoint and asked if they accepted Jesus Christ as their savior. Two of the three girls suffered knife wounds. According to court documents, Pamela Christensen said she was sending her children to 'meet Jesus Christ.' When police discovered the children just before 11am on September 25, all three were dressed in white. The girls were taken to a hospital for treatment and later released. Pamela Christensen told detectives that her husband, Pastor Vaughn Christensen, had left messages on her phone telling his wife that the end of the world was coming and instructing her to prepare their children to meet Jesus. According to court records, the couple are in the midst of a messy divorce. In August, the wife obtained an order of protection against her clergyman husband, claiming that he had become erratic and increasingly violent towards the family, threatening to harm the children, as well as himself. Police said they had received several calls from the Christensen residence over the past few months about suicide threats. The Christensens’ three daughters have been released into the custody of Pamela's father. Man of God: Mr Christensen, seen here delivering a sermon at Heritage of Faith Church, is allegedly in the process of divrocing his wife, who had obtained an order of protection against him citing violent behavior .","Pamela Christensen, 47, charged with first-degree attempted murder .

"Cristiano Ronaldo will cost a staggering £785million should a club wish to buy him from Real Madrid. That's the buy-out clause placed in the 29-year-old superstar's contract and the astronomical price his agent, Jorge Mendes, insists he is worth. The  one billion euro tag underlines why Manchester United and other suitors will find it near impossible to prise him away from the Santiago Bernabeu. Cristiano Ronaldo's buy-out clause is a whopping £785million, a price his manager says he is worth . Ronaldo's manager Jorge Mendes says the figure means it will be impossible to take him from the Bernabeu . Ronaldo in action for Portugal against France on Saturday night in a friendly international . Sportsmail reported last month how, despite their affection for the player, United were not willing to break the bank for such a deal and Mendes said: 'I no longer get calls from anyone asking about Cristiano because they know that it is impossible to get him out of Madrid, so it's not worth them calling to ask for it. 'The price is that stated in his release clause – €1bn (£785m). 'United are in his heart and he is very respectful of people who show him affection but he is in Madrid to the end.' The buy-out clause dwarfs that of Barcelona's Lionel Messi which is set at £331million and Mendes says the valuation is justified due to Ronaldo's standing in the game. 'In addition to being the best footballer in history, he is the greatest athlete of all time. You cannot compare him with anyone,' Mendes told AS. 'He is the best player in the biggest sport in the world, in which there is more competition than in any other. For that reason, he is the best athlete in the world. There will be no-one like him for the next 500 years.' Ronaldo, celebrating a Champions League final penalty, is the 'greatest athlete in the world', says his manager . Ronaldo's rival for world's best player, Lionel Messi (here for Argentina against Brazil in China on Saturday), has a buy-out clause at Barcelona of £331million . Ronaldo got a warm welcome from fans when at Old Trafford in March 2013, but won't go back there . Mendes also believes the Portugal captain will be able to break his own personal record of 60 goals in a single season provided he can stay fit in 2014-15. 'I'm sure that he will beat his personal record if he does not have any physical problems,' he added. 'He is phenomenal. For Cristiano, nothing is impossible. He is going to continue evolving and improving until he is 40. When he finishes it will be impossible for anyone to beat his records. 'Notice how Cristiano is a winger, he's not a striker, and his numbers are outrageous. He plays very far from goal and has to make significant efforts to arrive into the box. For that, he deserves even more credit for what he achieves.' And Ronaldo's next step? 'He always wants more and more. His dreams are short term and his dream is to win another Champions League.' Madrid, meanwhile, are continuing to monitor David de Gea's impressive form at United. There has been increasing clamour in Spain for 23-year-old de Gea to replace the under-fire Iker Casillas in the national side and Madrid are considering a similar move at club level. Real Madrid is looking at Manchester United's in-form Spanish keeper David de Gea . De Gea (centre) is seen as a possible replacement for Spain team-mate Iker Casillas (bottom) United though are planning discussions over an improved contract with their goalkeeper and hope to ratify a new long-term deal soon. De Gea, who was player of the year for the club last season, signed for £17.8m in June 2011 and his deal runs out in 2016. Although initial conversations took place last year, talks had been put on hold as United strengthened their squad in other areas. Louis van Gaal still wants another goalkeeper to provide competition for De Gea with Anders Lindegaard looking for a new club. Meanwhile, Ryan Giggs will be given the Legend of Football Award at the HMV Football Extravaganza on Tuesday at the London Hilton Hotel on Park Lane. Giggs follows last year's recipient Pele while other former winners include Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona.","Real Madrid's buy-out clause for Cristiano Ronaldo is £785million .

"The director of a reality show in which a Brazilian woman auctioned her virginity could be charged with sex trafficking offences. Catarina Migliorini is set to earn £490,000 from the online auction which closed last Wednesday. The physical education student  was taking part in a documentary by Australian film-maker Justin Sisely, entitled Virgins Wanted. Catarina Migliorini, 20, who sold her virginity online for $500,000 to a Japanese bidder named Natsu . The winning bidder is a Japanese man called Natsu. The pair will  reportedly sleep together on a plane between Australia and the US in a bid to avoid prostitution laws. But yesterday Brazil’s attorney general, Joao Pedro de Saboia Bandeira de Mello Filho, ordered an ‘urgent’ investigation, claiming the auction amounted to ‘people trafficking’. In a letter to Brazil's Foreign Minister he said Mr Sisely should be stopped from ‘executing the crime’ and called on authorities in Australia, where Miss Migliorini lives, to revoke her visa and deport her back to Brazil for ‘the exercise of prostitution’. He said: 'In prinicipal this looks to me like the crime of people traficking, whose repression is provided for in international treaties.' Natsu fended off strong competition from American bidders Jack Miller and Jack Right, and Indian big-spender Rudra Chatterjee, to secure a date with the 20-year-old. Miss Migliorini vehemently denied being a prostitute on the basis she was only selling her body the one time . Catarina's decision to sell her virginity sparked outrage across the globe, with many claiming she was little more than a prostitute. She also caused controversy when she revealed she would be followed every step of the way by an Australian crew for a documentary film called Virgins Wanted. The intercourse itself will not be filmed and Natsu will retain a right to be anonymous, without his picture appearing in the media.","Catarina Migliorini will earn £490,000 from the online auction .

"Temperatures in China have plunged to their lowest in almost three decades, cold enough to freeze coastal waters and trap 1,000 ships in ice, official media said at the weekend. Since late November the country has shivered at an average of minus 3.8 degrees Celsius, 1.3 degrees colder than the previous average, and the chilliest in 28 years, state news agency Xinhua said on Saturday, citing the China Meteorological Administration.

"James Bond is known for his ability to make the best of a bad situation, but a crow called 007 has also proved to be a top notch problem solver. The cunning crow has solved one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever to be constructed. And did so in less than three minutes on camera - a world first. Scroll down for video . The programme shows 007 the crow completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes. The individual processes are detailed in this diagram . An experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, aren’t just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with. Scientists said that, while having very different brain structures, both crows and primates use a combination of mental tools, including imagination and the anticipation of possible future events, to solve similar problems. Other experiments involving the same family of birds found that Caledonian crows can use up to three tools in sequence to obtain food, which the University of Oxford’s Behavioural Ecology Research Group said is the first demonstration of spontaneous sequential tool use in a species other than humans. A study also found that rooks can use stones to raise the level of water in a vessel in order to bring a floating worm into reach. Urban-living carrion crows have been witnessed learning to use road traffic for cracking nuts. Amazingly the problem-solving creature performed the series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult set up of the course beforehand. The wild crow learned to use individual props during its three months of captivity but had to work out the order in which to use them to complete the challenge and get an inaccessible treat. The animal was later released. The experiment, which was devised by Dr Alex Taylor, a Lecturer in Evolutionary Psychology based at The University of Auckland, New Zealand, features in BBC Two programme ‘Inside the Animal Mind – The Problem Solvers’. It shows 007 completing the eight stage puzzle in approximately two-and-a-half minutes. First the crow pulls a string attached to the branch it is perched on towards itself to reach a short stick dangling below. The crow picks up the short stick in its mouth and stage one is complete. Problem-solving crow, 007, performed a series of tasks without seeing the fiendishly difficult course up beforehand. Here, the crafty creature uses a short stick to drag a stone from a box with bars. It then used the collected stones to access another longer stick from a weighted container . 007 then immediately makes its way to a narrow container containing a meaty treat and tries to use the stick to reach it – but it is too short. The bird keeps hold of the stick and makes its way to the first of three boxes, which each contain a stone unreachable without the stick behind wooden bars. 007 then uses its stick to drag a stone from the first box and picks it up in its beak to complete stage two. But then it drops the stone, seemingly temporarily stumped as what to do with it. However, the persistent creature picks up the stick again and retrieves a stone from the second of the boxes and then seemingly has a brainwave to place it in a separate perspex container. 007 picks up the stone it has already retrieved and posts it into the clear container too, before retrieving the final stone from the final box. A previous experiment by the University of Cambridge has proved that members of the crow family, known as corvids, aren't just among the cleverest birds, they are smarter than most mammals and can perform tasks that three and four-year-old children have difficulty with . When it posts the last of the stones into the perspex box, their weight pushes down a compartment, which allows the crow to access a long stick and complete stage eight. Armed with the long stick, the crow immediately uses it to poke inside a narrow box treat containing a treat and drag the morsel towards itself. The clever bird is rewarded for its hard work and mental agility in completing the series of eight challenges. Wildlife presenter Chris Packham, who presents the programme, said: ‘That was remarkable. I’ve never seen anything like it. ‘Of all the bird behaviour I’ve seen, nothing matches that. ‘Inside the Animal Mind’ last aired on Tuesday 4 February ad can be seen on BBC iPlayer. In the programme, Mr Packham explores the minds of the cleverest animals on the planet, discovering their astonishing abilities, including how bees navigate, cockatoos can pick locks and an intelligent octopus.","A cunning crow called '007' has  solved one of the most complex tests of the animal mind ever to be constructed .

"At 50st, Pauline Potter became the world's heaviest woman . After entering herself into the Guinness Book of Records, her ex wanted her back . She has lost a stone a month thanks to their marathon sex sessions . After divorcing her husband three years ago, Pauline Potter - already a whopping 46stone - piled on so much extra weight that she became the heaviest woman in the world. But at a staggering 50stone, her ex-husband Alex (a svelte 11stone), couldn't resist her and set out to win her back and reignite their sex life. The couple now have marathon sex sessions of up to seven times in one day and Pauline maintains that the 'sexercise' is what's keeping her slim. Pauline and Alex Potter on their wedding day, the couple have since reignited their love . The 'sexathons' with Alex, who has visited her twice a month for four days at a time, have had a dramatic effect on her size, helping her shed a stone each month by sweating off the calories. 'I can't move much in bed, but I burn 500 calories a session-it's great exercise just jiggling around,' she told Closer Magazine. Even though one of Pauline's legs weighs more than Alex does, the couple are able to enjoy sex using different positions. And although Pauline isn't yet confident enough to buy sexy lingerie, she drapes a nice sheet over her to achieve the same effect in the bedroom. The 47-year-old, who as a 19-year-old son Dillion from a previous marriage, met Alex in 2002 online and they married three years later. After their marriage hit the rocks, the daycare centre worker moved to California in 2008 with Dillion and that is when she hit rock bottom and her weight spiraled out of control. At a staggering 50st, Pauline weighed in at the world's heaviest woman after gorging on a diet of 10,000 calories each day . Pauline was so low that she turned to food, often binging on four bowls of cereal for breakfast, half a box of cookies and a bag of crisps with cheese as a mid-morning snack. McDonald's was her lunchtime venue, where she opted for a Big mac, chips and nuggets followed by three portions of spaghetti bolognaise for dinner and a pint of ice cream for dessert. Gorging on 10,000 calories each day, Pauline was so fat that her son had to accompany her to the toilet. After reaching her highest weight ever, with a BMI on 93 (the healthy range for a women her age being 18/5-25), Pauline's health suffered greatly. She couldn't leave the house without a motorised scooter and she suffered lymphedema, which got so bad that she eventually became immobile. The drive behind her weight loss desires came last September when, at a whopping 52st, she was crowned World's Fattest Woman. In July she made a dramatic move and entered herself into the Guinness Book of Records to shame herself into dieting. It was when Alex saw she had clinched the Guinness World Record for her enormous size, that he rushed to move back in with his former partner in Sacramento, California. She is now motivated to reach her target weight of 38st in order to become mobile enough to move in with Alex, who currently lives in Arizona. She told Closer: 'I still eat Big Macs, but I'll choose between fries or nuggets. 'I tell Alex he needs to visit more so he can help me shed the pounds quicker!'","At 50st, Pauline Potter became the world's heaviest woman .

More than 70 per cent of bosses claim that the rising trend among Britons - especially teenagers - of adding inflections to the ends of sentences is ‘particularly annoying.’ While almost 85 per cent said that when non-Australian people use this language trait it is a 'clear indicator of insecurity’ and could hinder their chances of a promotion or payrise. Publisher Pearson polled 700 managers about the trend of young Britons using 'Australian Question Intonation'. Over 70% said the inflections are 'annoying', while 85 per cent said that when non-Australian people speak this way it is a 'clear indicator' of insecurity and could hinder their chances of a promotion . Australian . Question Intonation (AQI) is a language trait seen most commonly in the Australian and American accents. It is also known as a a . high-rising terminal (HRT). AQI is the act of raising a voice at the end of a sentence to make the statement sound like a question. The origins of Australian Question . Intonation are not clear, but previous studies suggest its roots may lie . in New Zealand or from the west coast of the United States. The comedian Stephen Fry famously . described it as the 'language of the Sunny Delight generation', and said . he 'barely knows anyone under 20 who doesn't use it.' The language trait is known as a high-rising terminal (HRT), commonly referred to as ‘Australian Question Intonation’ (AQI). It is the act of raising a voice at the end of a sentence that makes the statement sound like a question and is common in Australian and American accents. According to UK publisher Pearson, the use of AQI has recently grown rapidly among teenagers and graduates in the UK. The firm surveyed 700 men and women in managerial, executive and ownership roles. The majority (71 per cent) agreed that AQI is a 'particularly annoying trait', with 85 per cent adding the use of the trait is a ‘clear indicator of a person's insecurity or emotional weakness.’ More than half said AQI would hinder the prospects of promotion and a better pay grade in their own organisation. While 57 per cent believed AQI has the potential to damage a person's professional credibility by revealing an inability or reluctance to speak their mind. Of the respondents responsible for . interviewing job applicants for senior roles, only . 16 per cent said they would be willing to gloss over AQI and focus . purely on an applicant's strengths and aptitude. The rising trend of young people in the UK using Australian Question Intonation (AQI) is being linked with the popularity of TV shows including Neighbours, Kath and Kim and MasterChef Australia, hosted by George Calombaris and Gary Mehigan, pictured left to right . In some cases, 44 per cent of respondents admitted they would mark down an applicant by as much as a third based purely on the candidate's irritating speech. However, this was only found to be the case when a British applicant used AQI, and didn’t apply when Australian or American people naturally spoke in that way. The survey was conducted on behalf of Pearson to mark the release of Speak For Yourself - a guide to effective speech and communication due to be released later this month. Author Harry Key, a voice techniques expert, said: ‘HRT is becoming increasingly common in the UK - especially among teenagers - but the results of this research suggest that using it in a business or workplace setting is definitely to be avoided. 'Based on the feedback we received, using HRT when making statements has the very real potential of jeopardising job prospects and, even, career paths in some organisations.' Key added: 'Speaking in definite or indefinite tones doesn't just sound different, it feels different and will affect the way the speaker is perceived. 'The message is clear: if you know what you're talking about, and want to be respected for it, then you need to sound like you know it.'","Inflections added to the end of sentences are called high-rising terminals .

"The costumes may have been bright, but the weather was anything but. Rain and freezing temperatures tried to dampen the spirits of New Orleans' famous Mardi Gras celebrations, held earlier yesterday. Revelers wore flamboyant colors and costumes despite the dreary weather -- while many others were photographed wearing raincoats, plastic hoods and carrying umbrellas.

Mardi Gras crowds in the French Quarter are seen from the balcony of the Royal Sonesta Hotel in New Orleans -- and are sporting heavy jackets and hats to protect from the chilly temperatures . Celebrations were scheduled throughout south Louisiana and in coastal Mississippi and Alabama, sharing the traditions brought by French colonists in the 18th century. In Louisiana's bayou parishes, riders on horseback would go from town to town, making merry in what is called the Courir du Mardi Gras. The merriment must come to a halt at midnight, when the solemn season of Lent begins. New Orleans police were expected to sweep down Bourbon Street at midnight in the annual ritual of letting revelers know the party is over for another year. At 4pm, the temperature hit 39 degrees -- one degree away from the coldest Mardi Gras ever, on February 14, 1989, according to the National Weather Service. The highest Mardi Gras on record was on February 20, 1917 when temperatures hit 83 degrees.

"Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling has spoken movingly about the girl she helped to rescue from an institution in Moldova – and then reunite with her family after a five-year absence. She said she cried on meeting the teenager, who was returned to live with her mother last year by the international children’s charity Lumos, which was set up by Ms Rowling. In a Tweet about meeting her for the first time last week, Ms Rowling – founder and president of the charity – wrote: ‘Many tears shed as a 14-year-old called Dumitrita shares her experience of life in an institution... She is now in mainstream education and back with her mother.’ Scroll down for video . Charity work campaigners: JK Rowling (centre) spoke movingly after meeting Dumitrita (left), 14, for the first time in a year after she had reunited her with her family in Moldova after five years . Since leaving the grim confines of the home where where the girl had languished since she was nine, Dumitrita has blossomed into a confident young woman and is now an active promoter of inclusive education for all children. Ms Rowling is committed to shutting down all orphanages and children’s institutions because she says they do more harm than good. She argues that infants who spend longer than six months in them suffer developmental and emotional difficulties throughout their childhood. ‘Locking children away, often in atrocious conditions, has a Grimm’s fairytale quality about it,’ she told government officials and diplomats from around the world at a conference hosted by Lumos, in Central London, last week. JK Rowling is calling on UK and US leaders and other aid donors to bring an end to children being placed in institutions. Here she is pictured smiling to abandoned baby Maria Dinescu in Bucharest, Romania, in 2006 . ‘It is my dream that by the time my life ends, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world. ‘There is a wealth of scientific proof that institutions cause measurable and irreparable harm. Institutional children are far less likely to be educated, to be physically or mentally well. The effects on infants are particularly chronic, with many failing to thrive or dying. ‘Having no dedicated career can cause stunting, psychological delays and sometimes trauma. Damage is done very early and it is lasting.’ Disabled children in institutions are 100 times more likely to die there than their able-bodied counterparts. Dumitrita is disabled and has learning difficulties. Her family were poor and could not afford the education and care she needed, so they were forced to send her away to a government facility far away from her home. Deprived of individual parental love, care and attention, she failed to grow and thrive. She is not only incredibly small for a 14-year-old but had not received a proper education. The children's charity Lumos was founded nearly a decade ago by Ms Rowling. In the past four years it has helped some 12,000 children move out of large institutions and orphanages into family and community care . After working with the authorities to close down the institution she was in, Lumos helped provide new services that would allow the children to return and live with their families. Dumitrita has now developed her abilities, participating in decision making and public speaking. She is, says the charity, a true example of how deinstitutionalisation can bring positive changes to children’s lives. Ms Rowling said there is still much to be done to transform the lives of the eight million children in institutions worldwide, including challenging the misconception that orphanages are ‘good’ for children in adversity. She said that when these children return to the world, ‘their chances of a happy life are greatly impaired’ and they are often ‘unable to find employment... and are more likely to enter a lifetime of poverty and dependency’. ‘Supporting children to stay with their own families in their communities was, in nearly all cases, significantly cheaper for societies than funding institutions,’ she told the conference, saying that every youngster had a legal and moral right to a family life, arguing that no institution can ever provide the love children need to reach their potential. Lumos is the charitable extension of the Harry Potter franchise that made Ms Rowling’s fortune and is a nod to the spell used to generate light at the end of the young wizard’s wand. It was founded nearly a decade ago after Ms Rowling saw a harrowing picture in a newspaper of a caged child and an article about disabled children in the Czech Republic being restrained in beds. The next day she started the process that led to her setting up Lumos, which works in countries such as the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine. Ms Rowling funds the running costs, meaning all donations are spent on the charity’s work – with its stated aim of ending the practice of institutionalising children in orphanages worldwide by 2050. Ms Rowling is also helping to launch Lumos’s online social media campaign, #LetstalkLumos, aimed at raising awareness of the plight of children who are living in orphanages and institutions. The campaign will raise funds for an education unit in a mainstream school in Moldova to demonstrate that children with complex disabilities can be educated alongside their peers without disabilities. Since the start of last year, Lumos claims to have saved the lives of 646 children suffering from malnutrition and neglect, and to have trained thousands of social workers, health professionals, teachers and policy-makers. In the past four years, it has helped 12,000 children move out of large institutions and orphanages into family and community care.","Harry Potter author spoke about girl she saved from Moldova 'care home'

"A daring robotic mission to Jupiter's watery moon Europa could take place by 2025. Nasa announced the plans this week in its 2015 budget proposal which would remain essentially flat at $17.5 billion (£10.5 billion). The space agency has set aside $15 million (£9 million) in its budget proposal to start planning some kind of mission to Europa. Scroll Down for Video . Nasa is making preparations to plan a robotic mission to Jupiter's watery moon Europa, a place where astronomers speculate there might be life . Nasa’s chief financial officer Elizabeth Robinson said the high radiation environment around Jupiter and distance from Earth would be a challenge. When Nasa sent Galileo to Jupiter in 1989, it took the spacecraft six years to get to the fifth planet from the sun. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute astronomer Laurie Leshin said it could be ‘a daring mission to an extremely compelling object in our solar system.’ Past Nasa probes have flown by Europa, especially Galileo, but none have concentrated on the moon, one of dozens orbiting Jupiter. President Barack Obama's 2015 Nasa budget plan includes funding for a robotic mission as well as space taxis to the ISS . The proposed 2015 federal budget  allocated $17.5 billion (£10.5 billion) to Nasa. The space agency has set aside $15 million (£9 million) to plan a robotic mission to Jupiter’s moon, Europa. Nasa’s budget also includes funding for a commercial ventures to fly to the ISS. The agency could have $1.1 billion (£600 million) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis that would do this. The new budget also includes $3.1 billion (£1.9 billion) for Nasa to operate the ISS. It provides $2.8 billion (£1.7 billion) to continue development of the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket and Orion capsule for future human missions to the moon, asteroids and Mars. Planning for the so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission gets a boost to $133 million (£80 million) in the 2015 budget proposal, up from $78 million (£47 million) in 2014. The proposed budget keeps the Hubble Space Telescope successor program - an infrared observatory known as the James Webb Space Telescope - on track for launch in 2018. It also lets Nasa begin planning for a new telescope to probe the mysterious force known as ‘dark energy’ that is driving the universe apart at faster and faster rates. Astronomers have long lobbied for a mission to Europa, but proposals would have cost billions of dollars. Last year, scientists discovered liquid plumes of water shooting up through Europa's ice. Flying through those watery jets could make Europa cheaper to explore than just circling it or landing on the ice, said Nasa Europa scientist Robert Pappalardo. Nasa will look at many competing ideas for a Europa mission, so the agency doesn't know how big or how much it will cost, Dr Robinson said. She said a major mission goal would be searching for life in the strange liquid water under the ice-covered surface. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb said going to Europa would be more exciting than exploring dry Mars. ‘There might be fish under the ice,’ he said. Aswell as a mission to Europa, President Barack Obama's 2015 Nasa budget includes funding for a commercial ventures to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. The agency could have $1.1 billion (£600 million) next year to help at least two companies develop commercial space taxis to fly astronauts to and from the space station. The research outpost, a project of 15 nations, flies about 260 miles (420 km) above Earth. Since the space shuttles were retired in 2011, the U.S. is dependent on Russia to fly crews to the space station at a cost of more than $65 million a seat. Currently, Nasa is supporting space taxi designs by, privately owned Space Exploration Technologies and privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp which has developed the Dream Chaser (pictured) For now, escalating U.S. tensions with Russia over the crisis in Ukraine have not affected the space partnership, Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden told reporters on a conference call. ‘We are continuing to monitor the situation,’ Mr Bolden said. ‘Right now, everything is normal in our relationship with the Russians’. Currently, Nasa is supporting space taxi designs by, privately owned Space Exploration Technologies and privately owned Sierra Nevada Corp. The agency intends to select at least two companies for a final round of development funding this summer. Obama wants to have U.S. options for flying astronauts to the station before the end of 2017. The so-called Commercial Crew program is receiving $696 million (£417 million) for the 2014 fiscal year ending September 30. The proposed funding increase would add as much as $400 million (£240 million) to the program for fiscal 2015. Planning for the so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission gets a boost to $133 million (£80 million) in the 2015 budget proposal, up from $78 million (£47 million) in 2014 . The new budget also includes $3.1 billion (£1.9 billion) for Nasa to operate the station and provides $2.8 billion (£1.7 billion) to continue development of the Space Launch System heavy-lift rocket and Orion capsule for future human missions to the moon, asteroids and Mars. One of the first operational Orion missions would send astronauts to an asteroid that has been robotically relocated into a high orbit around the moon. Planning for the so-called Asteroid Redirect Mission gets a boost to $133 million (£80 million) in the 2015 budget proposal, up from $78 million (£47 million) in 2014. As currently envisioned, hiking spending on the asteroid initiative means cutbacks in other programs, warns the Coalition for Space Exploration, a Houston-based industry advocacy organization. ‘We remain concerned and opposed to the annual effort to drain funds from our nation's exploration programs,’ the group said in a statement. The proposed budget keeps the Hubble Space Telescope successor program - an infrared observatory known as the James Webb Space Telescope - on track for launch in 2018. It also lets Nasa begin planning for a new telescope to probe the mysterious force known as ‘dark energy’ that is driving the universe apart at faster and faster rates.

"About 5,000 chemical weapons were recovered or destroyed in Iraq following the 2003 invasion but the Pentagon chose to keep the findings top secret, it has emerged. An investigation by The New York Times has revealed that U.S. forces happened across the hidden caches of warheads, shells and aviation bombs between 2004 and 2011. But the information wasn't made public as embarrassingly the weapons, many of which had been built in close collaboration with the West, had been sitting dormant since the 1980s and so didn't support President George W. Bush's rationale for going to war. At least 17 American troops were also seriously injured discovering and attempting to destroy the deteriorating shells filled with nerve and mustard agents. Scroll down for video . Cache: Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal technicians prepare unexploded ordnance for demolition at a safe disposal area near Baghdad in 2003.  5,000 chemical weapons were found in Iraq but the public was never told . Hidden: Between 2004 and 2011 soldiers found thousands of rusty chemical munitions throughout Iraq, most of them buried . Prior to the 2003 invasion by coalition forces, President Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair had said the mission was 'to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people.' But all the weapons found had been developed before 1991. Most of them were mustard agents in 155-millimeter artillery shells or 122-millimeter rockets developed by Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war which raged between 1980 and 1988. Another reason for the cover-up, according to The Times, was that five of the six chemical weapons encounters involved weapons  designed by the U.S. ''Nothing of significance' is what I was ordered to say,' said Jarrod Lampier, a now-retired Army major who was present when forces found 2,400 nerve agent rockets in 2006 - the largest chemical weapons discovery of the war. Secrets: In 2002 President George W. Bush said Hussein was developing a program of chemical weapons but no evidence of such weapons was ever found . Soldiers were also loathe to report finding the caches as documenting chemical weapons added hours of extra work to their load. Chemical warfare specialists had to be called in, and waiting for them to arrive put coalition forces in dangerous positions. 'I could wait all day for tech escort to show up and make a chem round disappear, or I could just make it disappear myself,' one ex-soldier told The Times. The mustard shells could be put in with other explosives that needed to be destructed and then detonated. However, handling chemical weapons lead to many injuries, which were not taken seriously by military doctors at the time. Many explosive ordnance disposal personnel were not aware that the shells they were handling contained chemicals, believing them to be regular old artillery. Weaponry: This file picture dated 31 December 2000 shows Iraqi President Saddam Hussein holding up his rifle during a military parade at Baghdad's Nasr square . At least 17 American military personnel and seven Iraqi police were sickened by poisons - usually sarin and mustard gases. Many of the shells would leak liquid during transportation, exposing the soldiers to the potentially-lethal fumes. Symptoms ranged from disorientation and nausea to blindness and huge, seething blisters. Jarrod Taylor, a former Army sergeant on hand for the destruction of mustard shells that burned two soldiers in his infantry company, joked of 'wounds that never happened' from 'that stuff that didn't exist'. 'I love it when I hear, ‘'Oh there weren't any chemical weapons in Iraq'',’ he said. 'There were plenty.' President Bush, together with strong support from then British Prime Minister Tony Blair, left, claimed that Sadam was in possession of weapons of mass destruction in 2003 . In March 2003, President Bush received a mandate from the U.S. Congress to lead an invasion of Iraq, asserting that Iraq was in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1441. With strong support from British P.M. Tony Blair, the Bush administration claimed that Sadam and his forces were in possession of weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to U.S. security and that of allies including the U.K. and Australia. After investigation following the invasion, the U.S. led Iraq Survey Group concluded that Iraq had ended its nuclear, chemical and biological programs in 1991 and had no active programs at the time of the invasion, but that they intended to resume production if the Iraq sanctions were lifted. Although no active chemical weapons program was found, at least 17 U.S. troops and 7 Iraqi police officers were burned or wounded when chemical devices exploded. President Bush later said that the biggest regret of his presidency was 'the intelligence failure' in Iraq, while the Senate Intelligence Committee found in 2008 that his administration 'misrepresented the intelligence and the threat from Iraq'. The U.S. completed its withdrawal of military personnel in December 2011, during the ninth year of the war. The rise of ISIS means that the U.S. will send an army headquarters to Iraq for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the fundamentalist group.

"The hunt for one of the world's most wanted terrorism suspects known as 'The White Widow' has gone cold after it emerged she has undergone plastic surgery to evade capture. Kenyan detectives admitted yesterday they were struggling to find fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite - but revealed she faces life imprisonment in the country when eventually caught. The 30-year-old Muslim convert from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire has spent the past two and a half years on the run and has been repeatedly linked to terrorist plots in East Africa. Scroll down for video . The 'White Widow': Samantha Lewthwaite has spent the past two and a half years on the run . The mother-of-four - who is the widow of one of the 7/7 suicide bombers - is charged with plotting a bombing campaign across Kenya at Christmas in 2011. The Kenyan investigation team chasing Lewthwaite were summoned to a court in Mombasa yesterday to explain why she had not been caught since Interpol issued an international Red Notice arrest warrant on September 25 last year. In a statement, Police chief inspector Abednego Kilonzo said she had constantly changed her appearance, name and location while on the run. In answer to a question in court, he confirmed they believed she had undergone plastic surgery. He said: 'She keeps on changing her face all the time. He added: 'She is a person with multiple identification. She keeps on moving from one place to the other. She makes many faces and that is why it is difficult to arrest her.' Mr Kilonzo also produced the Red Notice, which showed that Lewthwaite was faced extradition to Kenya from whichever country she was arrested in. A photo of Samantha Lewthwaite taken from her fake South African passport released by Kenyan police in December 2011 (left) Samantha Lewthwaite, the so-called White Widow, has written poetry praising Osama bin Laden, according to computer files seized by police from her previous home in Mombasa . The notice read: 'If found guilty of the offence, the maximum penalty possible of the offence is life imprisonment.' Lewthwaite, who converted to Islam at the age of 17, has been identified as a main recruiter for Al Qaeda in East Africa and is an official spokesman for terror group Al Shabaab. The group admitted to a string of attacks in Kenya including last September's assault on Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall last year that claimed at least 67 lives. She is wanted in Kenya on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony dating back to December 2011. After giving Kenyan police the slip in Mombasa in 2011, she has been on the run ever since, reportedly using a false South African passport and alias. Lewthwaite is the widow of Jermaine Lindsay, one of four Islamist suicide bombers who blew himself up along with 26 passengers on a Tube train near King's Cross Station in London in 2005. Following the tragedy, she portrayed herself as another victim of the tragedy and called it 'abhorrent'. Kenyan Police have previously revealed Lewthwaite, also financed Woolwich murderer Michael Adebolajo's trip to East Africa for terror training. She has even written poetry praising Osama bin Laden, according to computer files seized by police from her previous home in Mombasa.","Kenyan detectives are struggling to find fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite .

They are satisfied that the anterior cruciate damage to his left knee sustained in January – causing Falcao to miss eight months including the World Cup - is healed. But predictably after such a long lay-off, he has suffered other injuries since joining United to huge fanfare in the summer. United agreed to pay his club Monaco an initial £6million loan fee with the option of making a £50million move permanent later on. Falcao is being monitored closely by Louis van Gaal who can't afford any passengers as he bids to take United back to the summit of English football within his three-year contract. Van Gaal is anxious to see if Falcao can get back to the level of match-sharpness he believes is required in English football and says he will have no hesitation picking the superstar forward for under-21 development games if necessary. 'You have to be fit. That’s why players have to play in the second team, like Falcao, in spite of his name,' said the United boss. The player, meanwhile, has been spending extra time in the gym with physios and doing pilates to improve his physical condition. Wayne Rooney (top) and Ander Herrera (right) celebrate a goal in United's home win against Hull . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal praised the influence Wayne Rooney has had as captain . While injuries have decimated his defence and midfield, van Gaal and United are spoilt for choice further up the field. Even with Robin van Persie facing criticism after some games, Wayne Rooney has responded well to the captaincy and big things are expected of teenager James Wilson. The Dutchman says he has been pleasantly surprised by the dedication shown by Rooney, who he knew only by reputation before taking the United job. 'From the first day he was not the Wayne Rooney that people have talked about him. He is my captain now, because he is the right example in training,' said the manager. 'I have the impression that he lives for football, and that he likes being captain of Manchester United and this team. 'I have to remind you that I put him first as captain. (Roy) Hodgson followed my advice! 'I can make him even better. I'm sorry, but I can make every player better. That’s arrogant but I can.' Van Gaal has also thrown down the gauntlet to midfielder Anderson who has not played since United's goalless draw at Burnley in August. The club are prepared to write off the £18million midfielder in January but will not pay up his contract to see him go, meaning other clubs will have to match his £60,000-a-week wages, something Brazilian clubs are loathe to do. Van Gaal said that midfielder Anderson has returned to training and that he wants him to get fitter . Van Gaal (centre) pictured alongside assistant Ryan Giggs (right) and Hull manager Steve Bruce (left) Van Gaal has said Anderson has not been fit enough for him to be considered for selection but revealed he has returned to training with the first-team and has to show better stamina and energy levels on a consistent basis. The midfielder has been criticised in other quarters for his lifestyle off the pitch and has been the subject of jokes of other United players about his eating habits. Van Gaal said: 'He’s now coming back. He was injured but he’s training now with the team. I cannot say what had happened last year but in my four months here, he’s had a lot of injuries. 'So I cannot judge him but when he trains he trains at a good level. He’s not always fit and that is more his problem now. 'I can't pick him now because you have to be fit. For the first three months the culture of a trainer is fitness. That is the smallest thing you can demand. Professional league fitness. Fitness is the most important thing. First you have to show your fitness. Not for just one day but for several weeks.'","Radamel Falcao returned from injury as Manchester United beat Hull 3-0 .

"Professor: The American Dream does not  exist, according to Gregory Clark (pictured), an economics professor at the University of California, Davis . It has powered the hopes and dreams of U.S. citizens for generations. But the American Dream does not actually exist, according to one economics professor. Gregory Clark, who works at the University of California, Davis, claims the national ethos is simply an illusion and that social mobility in the country is no higher than in the rest of the world. 'America has no higher rate of social mobility than medieval England or pre-industrial Sweden,' he said. 'That’s the most difficult part of talking about social mobility - it's shattering people's dreams.' After studying figures from the past 100 years and applying a formula to them, Mr Clark concluded that disadvantaged Americans will not be granted more opportunities if they are hard-working. Instead, they will be stuck in their social status for the rest of their lives - and their position will, in turn, affect the statuses of their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, he said. 'The United States is not exceptional in its rates of social mobility,' the professor wrote in an essay published by the Council on Foreign Relations. 'It can perform no special alchemy on the disadvantaged populations of any society in order to transform their life opportunities.' Speaking to CBS Sacramento, he added: 'The status of your children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, great-great grandchildren will be quite closely related to your average status now.' However, not all of Mr Clark's students agree with his findings, with some pointing out that although parents' wealth has an effect on a child's life, 'it is not the ultimate deciding factor'. In his essay, the professor also commented on the high number of people uprooting to the U.S., saying there is reason to believe they will 'have a much more difficult time' than previous immigrants. 'Recent evidence suggests that, in reality, social mobility rates are extremely low,' he wrote, adding that immigrating to the U.S. 'rarely changes one’s social status'. Video courtesy of The RSA . 'An illusion': Mr Clark claims the national ethos is simply an illusion and that social mobility here is no higher than in the rest of the world, saying: 'America has no higher rate of social mobility than medieval England' 'Widening social inequality': In an essay published by the Council on Foreign Relations, the professor cited figures (pictured) showing tdescendants of Latino immigrants are dropping out of high school at high rates . He even went so far as to say that immigrants - particularly, illegal immigrants (of whom, four out of five are Latinos) - are widening social inequality in America. He cited 2009 figures relating to the educational attainment of 25 to 34-year-olds in the U.S., which show descendants of Latino immigrants are dropping out of high school at significantly high rates. These rates are far more excessive than those of descendants of the domestic population and  other immigrant groups, Mr Clark said. FOrmula: After studying figures from the past 100 years and applying this formula (pictured) to them, Mr Clark concluded that disadvantaged Americans will not be granted more opportunities if they are hard-working . They show, he said, that although America strives to portray itself as a country of opportunity that can transform citizens' lives, it is actually no different in terms of social mobility than anywhere else. Concluding his essay, Mr Clark added: 'The truth is that the American Dream was always an illusion. Blindly pursuing that dream now will only lead to a future with dire social challenges.'","Gregory Clark, of UC Davis, claims American dream is simply an illusion .

"Azad Miah, 44, is said to have 'hounded' and 'stalked' girls to have sex for money . A takeaway owner who allegedly ran a brothel above his restaurant hounded girls as young as 12 to become prostitutes and told one of his child victims that ‘age is just a number’. Azad Miah, 44, branded the  vulnerable girls ‘fresh meat’ and harassed them over weeks and months before offering to give them drugs, alcohol or money in return for sex, a court heard. Miah targeted the girls in ‘a cold, clinical, calculated exploitation of the desperate and therefore vulnerable’, Carlisle Crown Court was told. Tim Evans, prosecuting, said: ‘Most worryingly, he would stalk some of them, following them home in particular.’ One of the girls, who was just 14 at the time and addicted to heroin, was paid £100 for sex with him, it is claimed. The girl, now 21, told detectives she had sex with Miah ‘hundreds of times’. When another girl refused his advances he called her ‘white trash’.Miah is accused of paying for the sexual services of a child, inciting child prostitution and of keeping a brothel above The Spice of India, in Carlisle city centre, between 2005 and 2011. Opening the case, Mr Evans said: 'This is a case in which this defendant sought to persuade a variety of young girls, some of whom he knew were under 16, to have sex with him for money via the provision of drugs or drink. 'Those requests were either made face to face when girls either came into the The Spice of India in Botchergate or were made by telephone calls and texts. 'The attempted persuasion was persistent. He would hound young girls for periods of weeks or months face to face or over the phone. Perhaps most worryingly, he would stalk some of them, following them home. 'Some of the girls that he had made approaches to did indeed have sex with him for money.' Mr Evans said many of the alleged victims aged from 12 to 16 were told by Miah that their friends were also having sex with him for money. He told the jury it would hear 'in essence' that The Spice of India, since closed, not only operated as a takeaway restaurant but as a brothel 'where women attended and prostituted themselves'. Court: Requests were either made face to face when girls either came into the The Spice of India in Botchergate or were made by telephone calls and texts, the jury heard . The prosecutor said many of the girls involved in the case were addicted to drugs or came from troubled backgrounds. 'It is the Crown’s case that the defendant deliberately targeted girls who fell into that category or who had other problems with the law,' he said. 'The defendant believed that such girls would be more likely to give in to his persistent offers... and they may find themselves less likely to be believed if they complained to the police against a responsible, respected restaurateur of the city.' Mr Evans said it may be that Miah’s defence team would portray the alleged victims as 'the sort of girls who will lie'. He continued: 'On the facts of this case you may think that far from being an argument for the defence, the character and background of these girls is a powerful part of the prosecution case.' 'It supports the argument, the Crown say, that this was cold, clinical, calculated exploitation of the desperate and vulnerable; drug addicts very often.' Miah denies eight counts of paying for the sexual services of a child between 2005 and 2009, eight counts of inciting child prostitution between 2007 and 2011 and one count of keeping a brothel between 2005 and 2011.

"Joe Allen has defended Brendan Rodgers amid the fierce criticism aimed at Liverpool's boss for fielding a weakened team against Real Madrid. The Wales midfielder also thinks criticism of Rodgers' selection is 'disrespectful' to those who were picked to play in Madrid, including him. Rodgers left seven first-choice stars out of his line-up at the Berneabeu despite the severe threat to Liverpool's hopes of progression into the Champions League group stages. Brendan Rodgers (right) gets on the ball in Liverpool training on Thursday after a controversial week . Steven Gerrard (right) was one of Liverpool's star names left out of the line-up at Real Madrid . Raheem Sterling (left) and Glen Johnson (right) were also omitted from the starting line-up . Asked if he felt criticism of the tactic was disrespectful, Allen told the Liverpool Echo: 'Yes I think it probably is.' Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli were the three most high-profile names left out of the starting line-up in Madrid. Rodgers suggested after the game that he had made the controversial selections to keep certain players fresh for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash against Chelsea at Anfield, and that is a concept Allen agrees with. 'You sometimes can’t win with a squad rotation policy but that is the only way to go,' he said. 'With the added demands we have this season, that has to be the way to do it. That is definitely going to get us results over the course of the season. Karim Benzema scored the only goal of the game as Madrid beat Rodgers' second-string team . Joe Allen (left, with Adam Lallana in training on Thursday) has leapt to the defence of Rodgers . 'The game plan in the summer was to recruit and get that bigger squad. We knew we had to deal with the demands of the Champions League as well as the Premier League, so now I think we have shown everyone the quality we have throughout. 'Everyone is genuinely competing for spots now and that is exactly what you need if you want to be successful.

"A starving dog savaged a  pensioner to death in his back garden after being attracted  by the smell of a meat stew  he was cooking, a court heard yesterday. Clifford Clarke, 79, suffered  horrific injuries in the 15-minute attack by the bull mastiff-type dog, which had not been fed or watered for two days. As the retired hospital porter screamed: ‘Get off me, get off me’, neighbours ran to the scene. One armed himself with a golf club and, leaning over a fence, tried in vain to beat the animal off.Police marksmen eventually shot it dead. The court was told the dog, called Charlie, was so crazed that it tried to bite the end of a policeman’s rifle and, after being shot once, it got up and tried to attack again. Prison: Della Woods (left) and Hayley Sulley (right) arrive at . Liverpool Crown Court where they have been jailed for 12 months after . their dog Charlie, a Presa Canario, mauled neighbour Clifford Clarke, 79, to death . Mauled: Clifford Clarke, from Clubmoor, . Liverpool,  was savagely attacked in his garden by his neighbours' starving dog Charlie after he left his back door open while cooking meat. The dog hadn't eaten for 45 hours . Mr Clarke, a former athlete, of Clubmoor, Liverpool, died later in hospital of multiple injuries and blood loss. Yesterday the dog’s owners, Hayley Sulley, 30, and her partner Della Woods, 30, were jailed for 12 months. The dog was one of three penned into a neighbouring back garden without shade, food or water while Sulley and Wood went to a barbecue. Tests later revealed it had not been fed or watered for at least 45 hours before the killing on a hot day in May last year. Liverpool Crown Court was told that the couple’s dogs were so hungry they had tried to eat their plastic food bowl and ate cigarette butts, bird food and dirty water. Eventually the dogs broke free and Charlie charged into the garden of Mr Clarke, who had left his back door open. The court heard that the ‘out of  control’ Presa Canario-cross – a breed not banned in the UK – attacked the former soldier, tearing one arm off and mauling the other. One police officer described the incident as ‘the worst thing I have  ever seen’. Caught on camera: A neighbour captures the moment the dog was shot dead by police (top left). It was so crazed that it tried to bite the end of the rifle and after being shot once, it got up and tried to attack . again . Killed at home: Clifford Clarke with his brother Kenny. Neighbours called police when they heard screaming coming from Mr Clarke's garden. The dog had entered through a gap in the fence . Judge Mark Brown said Mr Clarke suffered a ‘very shocking, appalling’ death. He told Sulley and Woods that they were fortunate not to have been charged with manslaughter under new legal guidelines that have been brought in since the incident. These could have seen them face up to 14 years in jail. The maximum sentence he could have imposed was two years. Judge Brown said he had taken into account their guilty pleas. Sulley and Woods admitted a charge of allowing a dog to enter a place where it injured a person and three counts of  causing unnecessary suffering. They were also banned from owning dogs. The court heard that Sulley, who has a seven-year-old daughter, and Woods, who has an eight-year-old son, were extremely remorseful. Guilty: Woods (second left) and Sulley (second right) had left the dog unattended in the garden on a hot day last May without water and shade while they went to a barbecue . Mr Clarke's house where he was attacked. The court heard . that Charlie and another dog had escaped from Sulley’s garden minutes . before and had wandered into Mr Clarke’s garden and attacked him . Judge Brown added: ‘He suffered a horrific death and you have taken away from his family the love and companionship he would have provided.’ After the case Mr Clarke’s brother, Kenny, 71, said: ‘It must have been the most horrific death in peacetime. ‘But while I can’t bring my brother back I think we must make sure this does not  happen again.’ Figures released recently show that the number of dangerous dogs seized by the police have risen 50 per cent in just two years in some police force areas. Tougher penalties were introduced in England and Wales in May following a series of horrific deaths by out-of-control dogs. The maximum prison sentence for allowing a dog to carry out a fatal attack on a person has been increased to 14 years from  two years. Allowing a dog to cause injury can now be punished by five years in prison, up from a  previous maximum of two years. Attack: The Presa . Canario cross-breed (file picture of the breed) was shot dead by armed police . Location of the attack: Mr Clarke's house in Richard Kelly Close, Clubmoor, is around three miles from Liverpool city centre.

"Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard’s future looks increasingly uncertain as discussions over a new contract drag on. Fears are growing at Anfield that the Kop legend’s career at the club is drawing to a close, with the American owners unwilling to match the 34-year-old’s current £140,000-per-week contract. The former England captain’s deal expires in the summer, when he could leave on a free transfer. Gerrard came on as a 75th-minute substitute in Saturday’s 1-0 win over Stoke City, the 16th anniversary of his debut. He is believed to be open to offers from January when he can hold talks with overseas clubs. A cut in wages is likely to be a significant factor in whether Liverpool and Gerrard can agree fresh terms. VIDEO Scroll down for Brendan Rodgers: I didn't realise it was Gerrard's 16th year .

"Not many people can claim to have shattered a major American record aged just 13 years, 10 months and 27 days. But chess prodigy Samuel Sevian can now do just that. The teenager has been crowned America's youngest-ever Grandmaster, easily besting the country's previous record holder by more than a year. At a tournament in St Louis last weekend, he won all four of his games to push his World Chess Federation rating past 2,500 points - enough to secure Grandmaster status. Chess prodigy Samuel Sevian pushed his World Chess Federation rating past 2,500 points at a tournament in St Louis to achieve the elite status of Grandmaster, aged just 13 years and 10 months . 'I feel really good and somewhat relieved. This was one of my best tournament performances,' the teen told AFP, noting that he had beaten three Grandmasters during the event in only 20-25 moves. His father Armen - a scientist born and raised in Armenia who later emigrated to the United States - is bursting with pride. 'He really outplayed his opponents in three games. But the fourth, it was really back and forth, it wasn't clear,' he said. 'It was like a blitz, it came down to the last seconds. Both players were shaking.' The previous record for the youngest US Grandmaster was held by Ray Robson, who achieved the title two weeks before he turned 15. American legend Bobby Fischer also once held the record. At an August tournament, Samuel had put the record within reach, getting to within 14 points of the 2,500 needed for the elite Grandmaster title. At age nine, Samuel became the youngest-ever American chess master receiving a rating of 2,201 . The young chess wizard is well accustomed to setting US records, having become the youngest American Expert (another ranking) shortly before his 10th birthday. At 12 years and 10 months, he became the country's youngest International Master. Samuel's next target is to get to 2,600 points, which would secure him invitations to the most prestigious tournaments. His ultimate dream is to become world champion; the question is when he will be ready to tackle the challenge. 'It's way out in the future and I don't want to busy my head with it now. First, I would need to improve my game,' he said. 'After my big win in St Louis, my confidence level is high. This definitely helps.' The chess star's father said he is the sixth-youngest Grandmaster in the world. The youngest person to win the status is Russia's Sergey Karjakin, who became a Grandmaster when he was just 12 years and seven months old. Samuel, who lives in the Boston area, said he was overcome with emotion when he realized he was about to achieve elite status in the chess world. 'The pressure was enormous when I played my fourth game, which I needed to win to go over the 2,500 mark,' he said. 'I'm suddenly a Grandmaster and felt overwhelmed.' In the coming weeks, Samuel will spend three days in New York at the Garry Kasparov Foundation. The chess legend is one of Samuel's regular trainers and will be present for the three-day visit. The foundation hailed his achievement, saying he is 'the world's first Grandmaster born in this millennium.' After celebrating his 14th birthday on December 26, Samuel will participate in another tournament in the Netherlands. Samuel's target is to get to 2,600 points, which would secure him invites to the most prestigious tournaments . 'We want to go more to Europe. There's stronger competition over there,' said Armen Sevian, himself a former high-level player. Samuel started his chess career in Orlando in August 2006 and he learned to play the game aged five earning a modest rating of 315 from his first tournament. By the time his family moved to California in 2007, when he was seven years old, his rating had risen to 1614, higher than most adults. He earned a spot on both the 2009 and 2010 All-America Chess Teams and in 2009, at the age of eight, Sevian defeated his first National Master in tournament play. In January 2010 with a FIDE rating of 2119, he became the highest rated chess player in the world for his age and also qualified for the 2010 World Youth Chess Championship. Former world champion Gary Kasparov achieved the highest ever chess rating at 2851. Bobby Fischer is the highest rated US player in history at 2785.","Samuel Sevian pushed his World Chess Federation rating past 2,500 points .

"At just 12 years of age, Samuel Brinton had no idea he was not supposed to be attracted to other boys. So when he told his father, a Southern Baptist missionary from Iowa, that friends had found a Playboy magazine - and that he didn't get excited like they did because he only felt that way about his best friend, Dale - he could never have predicted the torture that was to follow. After being knocked out cold by his father, so hard that he had to be rushed to the Emergency Room, Samuel was repeatedly beaten up before being subjected to months of excruciating aversion therapy. Scroll down for video . Reflective: Samuel described in detail the horrors he experienced in conversion therapy as a young boy . He was initially told he had AIDS and that he was the only gay person left in the country - because the government had killed all the rest of them and would come after him too if they found out he was alive. Freezing ice cubes were placed in his hands while he was shown pictures of men hugging - so that he would associate pain with intimacy between men. He was then repeatedly burned when shown similar images but untouched when images of men and women together were shown. 'The Month of Hell consisted of tiny . needles being stuck into my fingers and then pictures of explicit acts . between men would be shown and I'd be electrocuted' Eventually, he was subjected to what was called the 'Month of Hell'. Tiny needles were stuck into his small fingers and he was electrocuted repeatedly while shown explicit pictures of men. After being excommunicated by his family almost a decade later, Samuel has spoken about the ordeal he suffered as a child at the hands of his Southern Baptist community. Samuel was interviewed as part of a series of gay, lesbian bisexual and transgender stories from across America found by a group called I'm From Driftwood. The forum's founder and executive director Nathan Manske travelled the country with two colleagues to discover the many untold stories of struggles faced by gay teens in small towns and cities. Samuel, who now studies at Kansas State University, described in detail the abuse he suffered as a result of the innocent admission he made to his father when he was a child. He speaks of being hospitalised by his father six times before the therapy even began, before describing in detail the 'treatment' to which he was subjected. 'The Month of Hell consisted of tiny needles being stuck into my fingers and then pictures of explicit acts between men would be shown and I'd be electrocuted,' he said. After months of torture he considered suicide, climbing onto the roof of the three-storey building where he lived. His mother's attempt to lure him down consisted of her saying: 'I'll love you again if you just change.' Fighter: Samuel was raised in a Southern Baptist community and was not accepted for being gay . Story: Samuel has told of his ordeal to help others who may be going through similar experiences with parents who don't accept their sexuality . 'It's not the thing to say to someone standing on the edge of a building,' Samuel said.

"Arsenal are set to make an £8million bid for Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings in January if they lose out to Manchester United in the chase for   German international Mats Hummels. Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund are holding out for £32million for their World Cup-winning centre back. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has long targeted Hummels but the fee could be excessive for Arsenal, more so than Louis van Gaal's side.

Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels (left) is also a target for Arsene Wenger (right) Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal wants to strengthen his defence with Hummels in January . Mings, who started his career at Southampton, is regarded as one of the best young defenders outside the Premier League. He can play at both left back and centre half and could well be the player Wenger opts for to bolster his defence in January. The news that Charlie Austin is not being rushed into signing a new deal worth in excess of £60,000 a week at QPR has alerted both Liverpool and Tottenham. QPR striker Charlie Austin is being considered by both Liverpool and Tottenham as he ponders a new deal . Meanwhile, West Ham are saying publicly they want to keep Andy Carroll, but an offer of £20m for the enigmatic striker will see the Hammers sell. Carroll's £85,000-a-week wages remain a sticking point in any potential move away from Upton Park. West Ham midfielder Alex Song, who is on loan from Barcelona for the season, will be a target for both Manchester City and Liverpool next summer. West Ham would be willing to sell Andy Carroll (left), pictured in action against Newcastle, for £20million . I AM HEARING: . That one leading Premier League club is paying parents between £1,000 and £2,000 a month to lure their sons - some as young as eight years old - to join their academy rather than a rival one. I AM ALSO HEARING: . Dennis Bergkamp is under consideration to succeed Liam Brady as head of development and the academy at Arsenal. Former Arsenal forward Dennis Bergkamp could become head of the club's academy . I BET: . Chelsea are 1-6 on with Coral to win the Premier League. That's about as done and dusted as you get. But there is value in backing the Blues to achieve a league and Champions League double - Paddy Power offer 11-2 . For Jose Mourinho's side to to the treble of Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup, William Hill offer 25-1. Diego Costa, pictured in action against Sunderland on Saturday, has fired Chelsea to the top of the league . BTW: . The immediate pressure on David Moyes at Real Sociedad was lifted on Friday night when his new club beat Elche 3-0 with former Arsenal striker Carlos Vela scoring a hat-trick. But there seems to be an anti-Moyes agenda judging by how a Spanish film shot a mini fly-on-the-wall 'pastiche' of Moyes the previous week. The footage mocked Moyes for not knowing the names of his players, which seemed a bit unfair. New Real Sociedad manager David Moyes gestures during his side's 3-0 win against Elche on Friday night . But Moyes appeared a fool when he pranced around the technical area and kept shouting to his players when they were on the ball, in Scot–English 'play, play'. 'Play, play?' - as opposed to what? Besides, in any language the instructions sounded more like ranting than coaching. I SAY: . Jack Wilshere has suffered another injury. Is it a weakness in the player that he is susceptible to getting crocked so often? Or is there a deeper problem with Arsenal's 'fitness' regime given the slightest knock seems to sideline many of their players all too frequently? I suspect an obsession with 'sport science' - body fat mass and all that - means that a combative player like Wilshere actually has less 'human sponge' to project his joints and muscles than say Ray Parlour, who was a trojan for Gunners. Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has suffered another ankle injury and will be out for at least three months .","Arsenal line up £8million bid for Ipswich defender Tyrone Mings .

"Sick craze: Ben (not pictured) admits to taunting relatives and friends of a girl who had committed suicide by posting vile messages on her Facebook memorial page . What started as a simple wind-up on a discussion forum has evolved into something altogether more distressing for the unsuspecting victims he targets. Ben, an unemployed 19-year-old, is what some are now calling an 'RIP troller' - a web user who gets their kicks from taunting grieving relatives online. He admits to once posting the message 'How's it hanging, guys?' on the Facebook memorial page of a young girl who had taken her own life. But he doesn't care. 'I've pretty much lost all hope for humanity anyway,' he said. 'I don't believe that anything can save people.' Ben, who has asked to use a pseudonym, first embarked on the craze in 2008 when he took to the online forum 4Chan to provoke people discussing religion by claiming to have disproved all that they had argued. 'It just makes me happy when I can make someone angry,' he told news.com.au. 'It sounds weird, but I kind of feed off their anger. The angrier I can get them, the better I feel.' He is certainly not alone as there's thought to be a whole community of like-minded people out there. Distressing: The rise of trolling has led to calls for tougher sentences for harassment or stalking online to act as a deterrent (posed by model) They don't always target the pain of loss, however. Another troller who's come forward is Sarah, a 23-year-old mother from South Australia, who confessed to setting up a Facebook page aimed at taunting another mum who had posted near-naked pictures of herself on a breastfeeding forum. 'She started getting negative replies and deleted the pictures, but I saved the pictures and uploaded them to a Facebook group where she was humiliated,' Sarah said. Sarah later deleted the photos after being threatened with expulsion from the site. 'I randomly targeted a lady for no reason, humiliated her for no reason - just to be a b****,' she said. 'Looking back now it was petty. I'm one of those remorseful trolls, I suppose.' In one of the sickest cases of RIP trolling, 25-year-old unemployed loner Sean Duffy was jailed for 18 weeks after targeting the Facebook tribute page of a dead teenage girl. Lauren Drew, 14, had been found by her mother dead in her bed after suffering a suspected fit during the night. But if her mother, Carole, thought her pain could not get any more profound, she was cruelly mistaken. Feeding on grief: The Facebook memorial page of Lauren Drew (left), who died in her bed, was vandalised by sick troller Sean Duffy (right) At first, she derived some comfort from the thousands of people who posted their condolences on RIP pages set up in memory of Lauren on Facebook. Then a few weeks later, she saw a posting that was to mark the beginning of a new nightmare. It was an image of a horse and cart pulling her daughter’s coffin, with the words ‘Happy Mother’s Day’. Day after day, for nearly a month, the awful messages kept on coming. Each one was more carefully crafted than the last, twisting the knife deeper into Carole’s heart. One picture of Lauren carried the plea: ‘Help me, Mummy. It’s hot in hell.’ Duffy was eventually tracked down by police and prosecuted. Cyber-researcher Karyn Krawford told news.com.au that the sick craze may be a sign of mental illness. 'This lack of empathy caused people to become emotionally immune and desensitised to images they're not seeing in real life,' she said. And psychologist James Heathers, of the University of Sydney, believes it is also down to the feeling of being anonymous, known as 'deindividuation' 'Social distance can cause a 55-year-old climate change sceptic with a job and a mortgage to behave like a spastic donkey with strange malicious behaviour,' he said. Earlier this month, a major study by the National Centre for Cyberstalking Research at the University of Bedfordshire concluded that police needed more powers to investigate internet harassment as more abusers move online to target their victims. Current legislation means the longest sentence a perpetrator of harassment or stalking online can face is just six months, which researchers say is not enough of a deterrent.","Once wrote 'how's it hanging?' on Facebook page of girl who had committed suicide .

"At the start of the season two teams dominated most predictions for the Premier League. Yet one of them has probably surpassed expectations and is shaping up to be one of the great Premier League sides, the other is well below par. I am, of course, referring to Chelsea and Manchester City and last week’s action in the Champions League provided a summary of their domestic form. Chelsea were superb but it is the team that impresses. City just got there in the end but only Sergio Aguero is really delivering. When you analyse where it is going wrong for City, there are some obvious areas. Yaya Toure clearly isn’t the player he was last season, for whatever reason. We can’t know for sure but it might have been the loss of his brother, who tragically died in the summer. It certainly seems to have gone downhill ever since there was that silly row about his birthday after the summer trip to Abu Dhabi. Only now are some people realising quite how important he was to the whole team. Chelsea have been hugely impressive in the Premier League this season, and are still unbeaten . But Premier League champions Manchester City, and particularly Yaya Toure, have been disappointing . David Silva was also in sensational form last season but he’s been injured of late and hasn’t quite hit the heights of last season. For me, those two were the heart of the midfield; exceptional players who, with Aguero in front of them, made the difference. Jesus Navas and Samri Nasri look like players who come alive when the rest of the team are playing well. Up front, Edin Dzeko has missed some games through injury and hasn’t shared the scoring burden, with only two goals in the Premier League and don’t forget they haven’t got Alvaro Negredo. They let him go after his form tailed off in the closing months of last season but by this stage last year he had already scored 12 goals for City; seven in the League. Last week they were very fortunate to stay in the Champions League with CSKA Moscow’s last-minute goal and Bayern going down to 10 men. A lot of things happened to keep them in the frame. It won’t be like that if they make the last 16 — they will have to earn wins the hard way. Pellegrini won both the league and League Cup in his first season but looks unlikely to repeat that feat . Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side are capable of going toe-to-toe with the best sides in European football . It’s going to be difficult for City to spend their way out of this downturn, as they have in the past. It looks as though they have been caught out a little by the severity with which UEFA imposed their Financial Fair Play rules. Possibly there was a feeling that if they did stumble a little bit, they could go out to buy somebody. Now the rules have changed so that is a difficulty. Of course, they still have an incredible squad and resources so I wouldn’t feel too sorry for them but they have to watch what they spend in January or at least balance the books. Chelsea did that magnificently in the summer, even making a profit on their dealings. For me, the biggest change there is that you can see Jose Mourinho’s hand in all the transfers. There was a suspicion in the past that it wasn’t necessarily football people making the decisions about who should be bought, certainly not when Fernando Torres came in. Chelsea's 5-0 demolition of German side Schalke shows they have what it takes to win the Champions League . Sergio Aguero celebrates the third goal of his stunning hat-trick against Bayern Munich . But all the major transfers since Mourinho has arrived have brought balance to the team and added quality. The players who have made the difference this season have been Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic, who was signed in January, and Thibaut Courtois, who returned from his loan in Spain. All that was done by the manager. He’s moulded the team into what he wanted. Reading between the lines, it seems as though Jose appreciated what the owner, Roman Abramovich, wanted in terms of more stylish football, while the owner appreciates what Mourinho brings to the side. Their partnership fits hand in glove. Chelsea can be sensational to watch even if, like at Sunderland, they can also be quite tight and just take what’s on offer. Their work ethic allows individuality to thrive. You can’t see this Chelsea side not winning the Premier League title, only injuries to key players might stop them. What will be intriguing is how they fare when the Champions League resumes in February. I know they won the tournament in 2012 playing on the counter-attack but in reality we haven’t really had a team in England in recent years who could genuinely go toe-to-toe with Europe’s very best. Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona are certainly the strongest at the moment. If Chelsea can maintain this kind of form, they might just be the team to challenge those giants.","Chelsea have been hugely impressive in the Premier League this season .

"Darren Wilson has officially resigned from Ferguson police following the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. His decision to quit the force comes five days after a grand jury chose not to indict him for the killing of the 18-year-old in the Missouri city. The 28-year-old has been on administrative leave since August 9 following the incident and hopes the community will now be able to 'heal' as a result of his departure. Wilson's attorney Neil Bruntrager announced that he would be stepping down and his resignation would be effective immediately. Scroll down for video . Darren Wilson has officially resigned from Ferguson police following the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown . His resignation letter states that his decision was based on his own 'free will' and claimed part of the reason was because he was a 'risk' to his colleagues and Missouri residents . He told the St. Louis Dispatch that he was resigning because of his 'own free will' and didn't want to put his colleagues at risk by staying. Wilson said stepping down is the 'hardest thing I've ever had to do' and said being a cop is the only thing he ever wanted to do. In his resignation letter, the recently-married Wilson said his presence put the residents and officers of Ferguson at risk.  He now hopes the community will be able to 'heal' following weeks of violence and protests. In an interview with CNN last week, Bruntager said he told Wilson it would be too dangerous for him to go back to his job, saying that his first job would lead him to a back alley where he would be 'executed'. The Justice Department continues to pursue two investigations, one into potential civil rights violations by Officer Wilson when he shot  Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and one into the practices of the Ferguson Police force. The news of Wilson's resignation didn't seem to appease a small group of protesters who stood outside of the Ferguson police department on Saturday night. 'I've been protesting out here since August,' said Rick Campbell, who added that he didn't care that Wilson had resigned. Several other protesters who were asked to comment shrugged their shoulders or expressed disinterest. During an interview with ABC earlier this week, Wilson said he is confident that a federal criminal probe into Brown's death would clear him, just as a grand jury did . The Brown family left a chair empty with a t-shirt saying 'gone too soon' while they sat down for their first Thanksgiving without their son (right) 'We were not after Wilson's job,' civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a statement to AP. 'We were after Michael Brown's justice.' During his interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Wilson insisted he had never been accused of acting in a racist manner during his law enforcement career. However Wilson has said he is confident that a federal criminal probe into the shooting will find 'nothing' and clear him just as a Missouri grand jury did earlier this week. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement following the conclusion of the grand jury proceeding, that the federal inquiry has always been independent of the one in the St. Louis County, and will remain so. 'While the grand jury proceeding in St. Louis County has concluded, the Justice Department's investigation into the shooting of Michael Brown remains ongoing,' Attorney General Eric Holder , 63, said. 'In addition, the Department continues to investigate allegations of unconstitutional policing patterns or practices by the Ferguson Police Department.' Wilson, speaking to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos on Tuesday, admitted that he's worried about there being a federal criminal investigation, but is confident investigators will find 'nothing' to suggest he broke the law. 'I stand by what I did,' he said. 'I stand by my training, and just have to wait and see what they determine.' Stephanopoulos asked Wilson: 'You're confident that no charges will be brought?' Wilson responded, 'Yeah.' I, Darren Wilson, hereby resign my commission as a police officer with the City of Ferguson effective immediately. I have been told that my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow. For obvious reasons, I wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before I officially made my decision to resign. It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me. It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal. I would like to thank all of my supporters and fellow officers throughout this process. [Source: St. Louis Dispatch] . The decision not to indict Wilson on criminal charges following the shooting drew mass demonstrations in Ferguson - some violent - that have continued through Black Friday . Demonstrators have been staging 'die-in's across the country, disrupting the holiday sales . Mail Online revealed earlier this week that Wilson could have a $1million 'war chest' from donation funds set up by his supporters. A woman who founded the movement, who chose not to be named, said she had been subject to a torrent or 'vile' online abuse. He has not incurred huge legal fees as his lawyers were all from the police force union and the force is likely to have covered the cost of hiding him until the grand jury verdict was announced. There had been reports that he had been paid up to six figures for the ABC News interview. Wilson however strenuously denied the claim suggesting: 'I wouldn't jeopardize me integrity for dollar.' Wilson got married on October 24 to 37-year-old Barbara Spalding during a ceremony in Overland, Missouri. He also revealed that he is going to be a father for the first time and just wants a 'normal life' for his family. Wilson began his career in nearby Jennings before moving to the Ferguson job a few years ago. He had no previous complaints against him and a good career record, according to Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who called Wilson 'an excellent police officer.' A few months before the shooting, Wilson had received a commendation for detaining a suspect in a drug case.

"Sergio Aguero is English football’s man of the moment following a hat-trick against Bayern Munich that grabbed headlines around the world. But Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini does not want all the Argentine striker’s efforts to be in vain without at least one major trophy to show for them this season. It has been Pellegrini’s policy not to get too downcast by some of his team’s poor results, most notably defeats at West Ham and at home by CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. Sergio Aguero is English football’s man of the moment following a hat-trick against Bayern Munich . Manuel Pellegrini has been praising the Argentine striker and said he has always known how good he is . Now he is in the different position of trying to dampen Sergio-mania ahead of their Premier League match at Southampton, who are second, one place above the champions. Aguero has scored half of City’s 24 Premier League goals and five of their seven in the Champions League. But having won the Premier League and Capital One Cup in his debut season in English football, it is silverware rather than personal endorsements that interest Pellegrini. Asked if Aguero is in the best moment of his career, the Chilean said: ‘I don’t think so. An important career for a player is when you achieve something and Sergio has had a lot of important moments in his career. 'For me, the most important thing Sergio has done so far was scoring the goal to give this club the title [in 2012].’ Pellegrini does, however, accept that Aguero, 26, is improving with age. ‘Maybe at 22 or 23 you are too young to decide the correct things at a lot of moments in the game,’ he said. Aguero gets the better of Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to put City 3-2 against Bayern on Tuesday . Aguero is mobbed by his Manchester City team-mates after he scores what turned out to be the winning goal . ‘In every game he plays he is growing and he has at least five more years where he is at his top performance.’ Pellegrini is playing a smart psychological game. He does not need to big up Aguero when the evidence is clear he is the best player in England. The way he destroyed one of Europe’s best teams was enthralling and might have helped to turn around City’s season. Certainly he will be uppermost in Southampton’s minds. The City manager knew about Aguero well before he moved to the Etihad. A decade ago, when he was manager of River Plate in Argentina, he heard all about an emerging 16-year-old striker with one of the country’s other leading clubs, Independiente. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has refused to rule out making new signings in January . City have the Premier League's top scorer in  Aguero but other star players have failed to perform this season . He said: ‘From the start, everyone saw he would be a very good player. It wasn’t normal for someone so young to play so well. And when I went to Spain with Villarreal, I tried to buy him [in 2006] but Atletico Madrid got him. He was just 18.’ Despite lagging behind Chelsea, Pellegrini knows title races can swing at any time, just as it did last season when Liverpool were favourites until they lost at home against Chelsea in late April. And the win against Bayern has proved City have the capability of going to the south coast and winning. ‘Every time you beat an important team like Bayern, the confidence and trust of the squad rises,’ said Pellegrini. ‘At this moment last year, we were six points behind Arsenal and no one was talking about us. We were fourth or fifth and everyone was saying Arsenal were the team who were going to win the league — and at the end they were fourth.’","Manuel Pellegrini has sent out a warning to Manchester City's players .

"Swedish furniture giant IKEA is now expanding its reach into a new frontier - warzones. With its innovative flat pack shelters, now even refugees will be experiencing IKEA's self-assembly living. Through its charitable arm, the IKEA foundation, it has developed an alternative to the basic refugee tent. It is hoped they will make desperate conditions for refugees around the world more bearable. Scroll down for video . Upgrade: IKEA has developed its own version of refugee shelters, featuring solar panels for electricity and proper standing room inside . IKEA, along with other refugee aid organisations, believe the flat pack camps could be the solution for the world's shifting refugee populations. The new structure comes equipped with solar panels, insulation and a ceiling high enough for people to stand up in. Paul Spiegel, an official with the UN Refugee Agency, said: 'This is a better solution than tents. It has potential to be better in the elements and the weather.' Many of the current refugee camps have a life span of as little as six months before the impact of sun, rain and wind means they need to be replaced. However, refugees usually stay in camps for several years. The . foundation has teamed up with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and Refugee . Housing Unit to design and build a better home for refugee families. Once assembled, they look like a canvas shed. Efficient: The shelters are intended to withstand years of harsh environments as opposed to the flimsy tents refugees currently have to live in . Prototype: More than 50 of these shelters will be tested in the harsh conditions of Ethiopia, Iraq and Lebanon . UNHCR estimates that 3.5 million refugees, or 10 per cent of the world's refugee population, live in tents, many of which offer no electricity and cannot provide adequate insulation from the heat or the cold. The IKEA solar panels offer enough electricity for lighting and the shelter's walls and roof are composed of a laminated material that offers UV protection and insulation. The small square tiles are integrated into a fabric net that covers the structure, reflecting the heat in the daytime and pulling in heat at night for warmth. Johan Karlsson, a representative with . the Refugee Housing Unit, explained how it worked: 'It is designed this . way, like an IKEA bookshelf, to be easy to transport and to be easy to . set up in the field.' He said the housing panels are very lightweight and durable and last up to three year. Familiar sight: IKEA's flatpacks will be sent to far-flung corners of the world to improve the lives of refugees . According to the IKEA foundation, more than 23,000 people are estimated to have to involuntarily leave their homes every day because of war, poverty, climate change and politics. The test tents are currently being used by Somali refugees living in UN refugee camps at Dollo Ado in Ethiopia, as well as refugees in Iraq and Lebanon. After receiving feedback from those who are using them, the IKEA Foundation will fund further improvements before they are put onto the market via the 'open source' method, where any commerical organisation can come along and buy the design, to sell to the UN Refugee Agency. Mr Spiegel said added: ""We're not there yet, we're in the testing stage now, but this is already very huge, and we will be testing in a lot of different locations and gather data about changes.Then we hopefully go full scale."" He the cost will depend on the amount of production that is eventually needed.","Innovative flat pack refugee shelters from IKEA will be headed for war zones .

"Diego Costa was once again the talking point as Chelsea extended their unbeaten run at the top of the Barclays Premier League table. But it wasn't for the usual goal scoring reasons as the Blues were held to a 0-0 draw by a stubborn Sunderland side at the Stadium of Light. Costa instead was the centre of attention following two incidents which could have led to the dismissal of the Spanish striker in the North East. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Sunderland 0-0 Chelsea . Diego Costa of Chelsea (right) catches Sunderland's Wes Brown with an arm while battling for a header during the second half . Diego Costa of Chelsea appears to elbow Wes Brown of Sunderland for which he receives a yellow card . Costa looks on having caught Brown with the arm which led to his yellow card during Chelsea's 0-0 draw at Sunderland . The first involved a tangle with John O'Shea in the first period with the 26-year-old appearing to kick out at John O'Shea following a heavy challenge from the Sunderland defender. The Spain international wasn't cautioned for the retaliation, with the incident sparking debate over the similarities between that and a similar reaction shown by Gaston Ramirez the previous weekend, which saw the Hull midfielder sent off against Tottenham. Costa was eventually booked in the second half, but again he caused a debate over whether he was luck to stay on the pitch over the use of his arm in the 54th minute. Costa is booked by match referee Kevin Friend as Cesc Fabregas leads the Blues protests with Sunderland's Santiago Vergini looking on . Costa checks the condition of Brown as Chelsea's John Terry and Sunderland's Anthony Reveillere argue over the incident . Chelsea's top scorer, who has netted 11 goals this term, appeared to swing a limb at Wes Brown while battling for a header, and although the referee clearly saw the incident, he chose to only book the striker. The yellow card means Costa will miss the Blues' London derby with rivals Tottenham, and the striker was later substituted in the 76th minute to be replaced by Didier Drogba. Former Chelsea player and manager Ruud Gullit admitted the striker was lucky to only be booked. 'He's lucky. I think he's lucky to get away with it,' Gullit told Sky Sports. 'The first time you see it you think ""Oh my God has something happened there"". You can interpret it in two ways.

"Paul Scholes believes Steven Gerrard will have been unhappy to find himself rested and on the bench for Liverpool's Champions League clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday. Seemingly with an eye on Saturday's Premier League clash with Chelsea at Anfield, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers decided to rest a number of key players for the trip to the Bernabeu, including skipper Gerrard. However, former Manchester United midfielder Scholes believes Gerrard retired from England duty in order to play in Liverpool's big European nights and told ITV: 'I think that's probably why he gave up international football, to play in games like this. I don't think he'll be happy tonight. Steven Gerrard won't have been happy starting on the bench against Real Madrid, according to Paul Scholes . Captain Gerrard was one of a number of first-teamers left out including Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson . Scholes, who played over 130 games for the Red Devils in Europe, added that 34-year-old Gerrard is more than capable of playing in the Spanish capital on Tuesday before taking on Jose Mourinho's Blues in the Premier League four days later. 'I think Steven Gerrard is capable of playing in this game and on Saturday (against Chelsea). It is Tuesday night, he'll have two-day recovery, train Friday, play Saturday and he's got a nice little two weeks off.' Asked what Liverpool' best plan of action was against the might of Madrid, Scholes replied before the game: 'Avoid a doing. Although it's highly likely with this team. Lee said Marcelo and Arbeloa are the weak links but they won't have to do much defending. Then you have (Toni) Kroos and (Luka) Modric controlling the game in the middle with (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Karim) Benzema upfront.' Martin Skrtel, captaining the side in Gerrard's absence, stops Cristiano Ronaldo in his tracks on Tuesday . Meanwhile, Lee Dixon admitted Rodgers' decision to rest so many first-teamers was risky and hinted that those left out should probably have been left in England. 'It seems they are definitely prioritising for the Chelsea game,' said the former Arsenal defender. 'Rodgers is trying to find the right balance between giving a performance and getting a result but it could be a risky prospect. 'If I'm a player I want to rest at home and rest properly rather than travelling.

"Ten thousand-year-old remains of human settlements have been found in Bolivia and is now the oldest archaeological site in the Amazon region. The find came as a surprise to experts as it was thought the previously unexplored area had been rarely occupied by communities due to poor environmental conditions. Swiss archaeologists made the discovery after analysing forest islands - small forested mounds of earth - which are found throughout Amazonia.

Dashed lines and the grey arrow highlight the onion-like growth of the midden. The black triangles above mark the coring locations used to examine the contents of the mound . Just by looking as these mounds scientists are able to show the history of the region and ancient human activity. In this study, the authors, from the University of Bern, found three of these islands were shell middens or mounds of shells that were left by settlers in the early Holocene period, around 10,400 years ago.

"Felipe Massa has described last week’s Japanese Grand Prix as the ‘worst race of my life’. The Williams driver was speaking at a sombre press conference ahead of Formula One’s inaugural visit to Russia which came only five days after Jules Bianchi’s horror crash at Suzuka. The 25-year-old Frenchman remains in a stable but critical condition at Mie University Hospital after he suffered a severe head trauma following his freak collision with a recovery vehicle during the closing stages of Sunday’s rain-hit race. Felipe Massa was very emotional during Thursday's pre-race Russian Grand Prix press conference . Fans show their support for Jules Bianchi who remains in intensive care following his crash at Suzuka . ‘For me I think it was the worst race of my life,’ said Massa, who finished seventh, but revealed afterwards that he was ‘screaming’ about the difficult conditions in the laps leading up to Bianchi’s accident. ‘It was a really bad race, worse than the race of my accident - because I didn't remember,' he added. Massa was alluding to his life-threatening crash during qualifying for the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. Driving for Ferrari, he was struck on the helmet by a spring which had fallen off Rubens Barrichello’s Brawn. The Brazilian had surgery on a fractured skull and was ruled out for the remainder of the 2009 campaign. But he made a full recovery and returned to fitness in time for the opening race of the following season. Massa is lifted from his Ferrari following the crash during qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix back in 2009 . The Brazilian was flown to hospital but miraculously went on to make a full recovery . ‘It's a very difficult weekend for all of us,’ Massa added. ‘Maybe tomorrow it will get a little bit better because at least you are working, at least you have something to think about, some issue to put inside your brain.’ Still trying to cope with Bianchi's accident, the majority of the grid said they had to be professional and focus on the race, despite the dark cloud hanging over this weekend's event in Sochi. ‘All our thoughts are with Jules,’ said Fernando Alonso, whose Ferrari team will carry the words ‘Forza Jules’ on their car this weekend. ‘I have a huge respect for our sport but when big accidents happen, there are no words to describe the feeling. ‘It's going to be emotionally very difficult, we will race for him, in our minds we are with him, praying.’ Bianchi, a graduate of the Ferrari academy, was diagnosed with a diffuse axonal injury after his Marussia slid off the track in rainy conditions and ploughed into a crane picking up the Sauber of Adrian Sutil, who had crashed out at the same spot only minutes earlier. Sutil, who witnessed Bianchi's accident, said: ‘We have to pray, that's all we can do. Although there is a grey cloud over us, we have to try to be professional and race for him.’ Massa was joined in the press conference by Adrian Sutil (top right), Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso .","Williams driver was speaking at sombre press conference on Thursday .

"A Wisconsin man says he still loves his ex-fiance, despite the fact that she offered $1,000 and sex to a hit man to have him killed. John Schellpfeffer, 50, of Merrill, told ABC News that his ex-fiance's murder-for-hire plot was a result of her mental illness and she needs help. 'I do love [her] to this day,' Schellpfeffer told '20/20' in an interview airing tonight. In February, Jessica Strom, 33, planned a meeting with a former classmate to offer him a 'business proposal.' Plot: Jessica Strom, 33, offered a hit man $1,000 and sex to kill her ex-fiance . The proposal was this: to shoot her fiance, Schellpfeffer, in his law office and fly the body to Door County in exchange for $1,000 -- and sex. What Strom didn't know was that the former classmate she hired to kill her ex-fiance and boyfriend of six years was actually an informant working with the local police department. The mother-of-three was arrested later that evening and is now serving three and a half years in prison, ABC reports. Prison: In August,  Strom was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for solicitation to commit first-degree intentional homicide. Schellpfeffer and Strom have reportedly had their ups and downs during their six years together. Both claim that the other was abusive, according to ABC News. WSAW reports that, Strom has had five straining orders against Schelpfeffer. At one restraining order hearing, Schelpfeffer reportedly proposed to Strom, and she accepted -- then dropped the order. After all of that, Schelpepper is still standing by his girl. Love: John Schellpfeffer says he still loves Strom, even though she tried to have him killed . '[It was] a mental drama in her mind, all put together from that mental illness,' Schellpfeffer told ABC News. 'Instead of three years in prison, she should, with effective legal counsel, have been placed in a specialized mental health facility.' Schellpfeffer blamed Strom's plot to have him killed on a 'hidden mental illness that, with certain triggers, will cause her to also lash out at a loved one,' Schellpfeffer wrote in a Facebook post. 'I am not embarrassed to say I still love her even though I have now accepted that we will never be together again as I realize that I am a trigger for her abusive acts,' Schellpfeffer wrote. Schellpfeffer was shown the video recording of Strom orchestrating his murder, but told ABC News that he believes his life was never in any danger and that Strom would have never gone through with the plan. Strom told authorities that what they thought was a murder-for-hire plot was simply a misunderstanding. Strom told ABC news that she did offer the 24-year-old man money and sex to kill her ex-fiance, but she 'said it in a joking sense.' Strom told authorities that she had contacted her former classmate, who works in Information Technology, to get technical help with some computer issues. But, Strom denied being serious about the proposal to have Schellpfeffer killed. '[Schellpfeffer] was frustrating me early that week,' Strom told '20/20.' 'I do know that I said something like, 'Well, you could kill him if you wanted to,'' Both Schellpfeffer and Strom have said that the relationship will not continue when she is released from prison, but both confessed that they still love each other.

"Kimberly-Clark Corporation is being sued for $500million by a Southern California law firm that claims the its surgical gowns do not protect against Ebola. The suit claims Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures Kleenex among other personal care products, misrepresented the protection provided by surgical gowns manufactured by its healthcare brand. Law firm Eagan Avenatti said it filed the class-action lawsuit Wednesday, stating that the company's MICROCOOL Breathable High Performance Surgical . Gowns failed industry tests and did not meet certain standards. Scroll down for video . Unprotected?: A lawsuit claims that wearers of Kimberly-Clark's surgical gowns are not fully protected from the Ebola virus . Attorneys claim the company misled regulators and workers and placed them at 'considerable risk,' as the gowns are not completely watertight and could allow wearer to contract the virus. 'Kimberly-Clark needs to immediately recall these gowns and . come clean with the FDA, CDC, healthcare professionals and the . general public,' said lead attorney Michael Avenatti in a . statement. The firm says that the lawsuit is being brought on behalf of lead plaintiff Dr Hrayr Shahinian and 500,000 others. 'We anticipate seeking over $500 million, which represents at a minimum the amount of revenue that KMB has received from the sales of these gowns,' added Avanatti. The gown was first introduced in 2011 and since then Kimberly-Clark has sold millions of units, according to the suit. The Ebola crisis in Africa, combined with the first diagnosis in the United States, has increased demand for protective garments, Judson Boothe, Kimberly-Clark Health Care's senior global manufacturing director told ABC earlier this month. Impervious: The company claims on its website that its gowns are 'impervious' and the lawsuit states Kimberly-Clark has represented the products as being suitable for protecting against Ebola . The MICROCOOL gowns are produced under the Kimberly-Clark Healthcare brand, which is in the midst of being spun off into its own company. Stocks for the new company, which will be called Halyard Health, will go on sale starting on Monday. The company did not comment on the litigation, though its shares did not seem affected by the news.","Law firm Eagan Avenatti says the company's MICROCOOL surgical gown failed industry tests and does not meet standards for Ebola protection .

"When you step foot into the control room at the U.S. Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas, the first thing that hits you is the smell, writes Brittany Hughes for CNSNews.com . Hovering somewhere between urine and unwashed humanity, the air is thick and hot. The sound inside the circular, glass-enclosed control room is like that of a beehive, humming with the noise of hundreds of voices mixed with buzzers and footsteps. 'This is where we do the processing,' the border patrol agent tells us. Scroll down for video . Inhumane: Illegal aliens inside temporary housing facility in McAllen, Texas . The border patrol officer gestures to a series of white, cinderblock rooms that form a ring around the enclosed control area. Each small space is sealed by a thick gray door, which is kept locked until an officer motions for the switchboard operator to open it. Beside each door, dozens of tanned faces press against glass windows, watching the movement on the open floor around them. Dozens more lie on the hard floor in the middle of the rooms, or on the wide benches attached to the walls. Most of the visible faces belong to young children or teens; the adults are usually clustered in the back or tending to toddlers and infants. The scene is devastating, and it’s only one of several windows into the illegal immigration crisis that’s sweeping across the Rio Grande Valley Sector of the U.S.-Mexico border. Since October 2013, more than 181,000 illegal immigrants have already crossed this 250-costal-mile area alone, and the McAllen, Texas station has been the hardest hit. Border patrol officers are doing the best they can, but they simply aren’t equipped to handle the masses that have flooded their facilities. Location of the Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas. The station has been the hardest hit from a surge in illegal immigration . Natural border: Rio Grande River near McAllen, Texas where many illegal aliens cross into the United States . Awful: An illegal alien child drinks from a plastic bottle behind a security fence door inside a bus depot/housing facility in McAllen, Texas . The people – all Latinos, as far as I can tell – are divided into several groups: family units are crammed into several rooms, teens 14 and under in the next, teens 15 and older in another, and single men and women in separate holding areas on the other side of the circle. People of all ages and genders – anywhere from young children to old men – are systematically brought out of their rooms to be 'processed,' which involves taking down any identification, background, where they say they’re headed, anything they can provide. It’s usually not much. 'This is where they start,' the agent explains over the noise. 'When they’re picked up at the border, they come here. Once we’ve processed them, they’re taken to the sally port.' That’s where we head next. The sally port is a converted bus depot attached to the border patrol station. Typically able to hold upwards of 4 buses at a time, the large, cement-floored space has been converted into a makeshift shelter to house the thousands of illegal immigrants that have been flooding the system since February. Normally, the border patrol detains people anywhere from 12 hours to three days before turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or the Department of Health and Human Services, in the case of unaccompanied minors. But a backlog of people is now forcing them to house people for sometimes more than a week, agents said. Sweltering heat: Illegal immigrants bake all day with almost no shelter from the brutal summer weather . The view from the U.S. side of the Rio Grande River: Looking over at Mexico, where people are standing on the shore and where some illegals were taken to the U.S. side by Jet ski and dropped off in the brush at the riverside . 'We’ve gotten pretty good at logistics,' one agent told us. 'But we’re still only working with what we’ve got.' The McAllen station is authorized for 380 people, he explains. It’s currently housing more than 1,100.They won’t let us in the sally port – the 'folks in Washington' require a scheduled visit for that, they tell us. But they say we can stand outside the locked gates at the bus entrance and look. I’ve been outside for all of thirty seconds, but sweat is already starting to bead on my neck by the time I approach the gate to peer inside. If the scene inside the station’s control room is bad, the view into the sally port is appalling. At first, there doesn’t appear to be a floor. Then I realize that’s only because I can barely see it through the mass of bodies strewn across the massive space. There are people everywhere – lying down, standing, sitting, stepping over others in a strained attempt to move around. Border patrol agents mill about with clipboards, talking to various people and administering basic medicine. Off to one side, next to a row of blue porta potties, a group of four young girls are curled up together on the floor, resting on one another’s limbs. All four are caked in mud to the knee, most likely from their trip across the border. They remind me of a litter of kittens I once saw, scrunched together in a little ball. From a distance: The former bus depot turned into a housing facility for illegal immigrants in McAllen, Texas. Illegal aliens are behind the chained-fence doors. The floor is cement, there are temporary toilets, and large fans blow air across the room . Filthy: The smell of urine permeates the holding cells overflowing with illegal immigrants . There’s a simple strip of yellow crime scene tape that ropes off a small section of the space, the only barrier that separates the healthy from those who have been diagnosed with scabies. In the 'sick ward,' a mother sits with her back against the locked gate, cradling a small child in her arms. She wipes the sweat from her own forehead before placing a half a dozen wet wipes on the little boy’s face and chest, trying to cool him down. A second toddler sits beside her, sucking on a bottle filled with something that looks like orange juice. Even standing under the force of five jumbo fans and a strong Texas breeze, the stench of unwashed bodies and well-used toilets hangs heavy, stagnating under the sweltering 100-degree heat and making it hard to breathe. A border patrol bus pulls up to the gate. The doors open and a dozen more immigrants, mostly children, pile out, having come straight from the banks of the Rio Grande where smugglers ferried them from the Mexican bank to the United States.  An agent ushers them through the door and into the processing room. This isn’t a dream, and it sure doesn’t look like Ellis Island.","The temporary holding cells were built in an old bus station in McAllen, Texas .

"A deadly brain-eating bacteria has been found thriving in a Louisiana parish water supply serving more than 12,000 people. Though no illnesses have been reported, the Naegleria fowleri amoeba has been found in the system running to Reserve, Garyville, and Mt. Airy, according to the  the state's Department of Health and Hospitals in a statement released Wednesday. Infections with the bug are extremely rare - perhaps 132 cases have been reported from 1962 to 2014 - but of those who've fallen victim only three survived. Scroll down for video . The Lions water treatment plant, serving more than 12,000 people, has been found to carry the deadly Naegleria fowleri amoeba in its water . The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that the state surveillance program was sampling Water District No. 1 when it discovered the system was not in compliance for minimum disinfectant levels that would control the bacteria. Louisiana required a higher disinfectant level after a 4-year-old boy from Mississippi was infected with the amoeba and died in September 2013 after visiting St. Bernard Parish. The amoeba can survive in untreated fresh water, hot springs, and hot water heaters, as well as untreated swimming pools, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quoted by NBC News. 'Families can take simple . steps to protect themselves from exposure to this amoeba, the most . important being to avoid allowing water to go up your nose while bathing . or swimming in a pool,' Louisiana State Health Officer Jimmy Guidry told reporters. 'It is important to remember that the water is safe to . drink; the amoeba cannot infect an individual through the stomach.' The water is being treated with chlorine, but any entrance into the nasal passage could still result in infection in the brain. The bacteria is incredibly deadly, claiming all but three of the 132 people reportedly infected since 1962 . The New Orleans Times-Picayune reports that in response to the amoeba detection, the St. John public school systems is turning off water fountains at all schools. A 60-day chlorine burn has also been imposed on the St. John water system. The water lines will be infused with the chemical, creating a stronger and quicker effect than the normal process of using a combination of chlorine and ammonia. Once the burn is complete, the state will perform another test. The parish Utilities Department is taking immediate actions to fully . chlorinate the water system and eliminate the threat,"" Parish President . Natalie Robottom told reporters. 'As more information becomes available, it will . be released to the public.' This is Louisiana's third water system to test positive for the amoeba. The St. Bernard Parish as found to have it in 2013, and the 2011 deaths of two people in DeSoto Parish were found to be because of amoeba infection.","Naegleria fowleri amoeba found in the water supply of Louisiana water system serving more than 12,000 people .

"British holidaymakers have been warned of the dangers of wildfires which have forced thousands from their homes on the Canary Islands. The Foreign Office yesterday told tourists and expats to take extra care because of the blazes raging in Tenerife and the neighbouring island of La Gomera. Some 2,200 people fled their homes in the north west of Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands, as roads and power lines were cut off by the blaze. Hundreds of firemen continued to battle the flames from the air. On this satellite image, taken by Nasa's satellite Terra, of the Canary Islands including La Gomera island (centre), a column of white smoke can be seen from space.

"Exorcisms are being performed on Asians across the UK as a method of treatment for mental illnesses such as bi-polar disease, epilepsy and schizophrenia, an investigation has found. Hundreds of British Asians are operating as healers, blaming the supernatural for mental health problems and charging sometimes thousands of pounds a session to remove evil spirits from bodies believed to be possessed. An exorcist operating in east London has said the demons can ‘deceive doctors’ and research by BBC’s Newsnight has found that some communities are finding it more acceptable to be possessed than mentally ill. Exorcism: Mudasar Khan, pictured, believes a Jinn is causing his panic attacks and depression. An exorcism is pictured being performed where the exorcist reads passages from the Qur'an . The evil spirit – commonly known as a bad Jinn in Asian communities – is removed by a healer reading passages from the Qur'an. There is a theological grounding for Muslim's belief in evil spirits as the concept of Jinn is in the Qur’an – though what Jinn actually is, is not universally agreed upon. An exorcism is the religious practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person which they are believed to have possessed. Communities of British Asians are blaming the supernatural for mental health problems, according to research by Warwick University. The supernatural is also being blamed in some cases for criminal activity and even not getting a job. The research coincides with the conviction in September of four members of the same Asian family who murdered a young woman believed to be possessed. Experts have raised concerns that spiritual help is being treated by many as just as valuable as medical treatment, with one Asian comparing his exorcism to ‘like a dose of medicine.’ Abou Mohamed, an exorcist operating in Walthamstow, east London told BBC’s Newsnight: ‘We don’t want to interfere with the job of doctors of medical professionals. ‘Could be psychological problem but the one behind it is the Jinn because the Jinn can play with us, can deceive us and the Jinn can even deceive doctors.’ The belief in evil spirits is ‘widespread’, according to the BBC, and it can refer to concepts like black magic, but in the more extreme, that the body can be possessed causing physical harm. Abou Mohamed, pictured, an exorcist operating in Walthamstow, east London told BBC¿s Newsnight that the Jinn could deceive doctors . Professor Swaran Singh, at the Warwick University medical school said ‘a lot of people’ seeing mental health being treated as possessions. He said: ‘Any group of clinicians working in the city area they will all have seen this. It is an everyday experience. It is not necessarily a problem of social class or education. ‘It is a lot of people.’ He said spiritual healing can be helpful as long as it is not used instead of medical care. He added: ‘I think it is a combination of how cultures make sense of people and how stigma just prevents them from recognising what it really is. 'Quite often people see abnormal behaviour as somehow being caused by some bad influence rather than a sign of mental illness and the badness becomes external malevolence. Mudasar Khan, a letting agent in Walthamstow, suffered from panic attacks and depression. He claimed medication has not worked for him and instead, said he was possessed by a Jinn, a supernatural being. He visits exorcist Mohamed in a back room, where he pays £60 for sessions to remove the evil spirits from his body. He told BBC’s Newsnight after one session: ‘It will give me a boost, it is like a dose of medicine. Evil spirits: An investigation has found hundreds of Asian healers are performing exorcisms on people to remove the Jinn . He added: ‘If there’s a fairy how can I explain the things that I’m going through.’ Many ‘healers’ were said to ‘operate in the shadows’, being heavily protected by the communities they seek to help. Nazir Afzal, a chief crown prosecutor in the north west, said: ‘They do operate in the shadows. They are protected by others within their communities or within their faiths or within their place of worship. ‘We are becoming very aware of it.' One 20-year-old, who was not named, said he visited a healer who tried to remove a Jinn inside of him but later discovered he suffered from schizophrenia. He said: ‘I am actually happy that we did go through the spiritual help at first’. In September a man and three members of his family were jailed for at least 56 years after being convicted of murdering his pregnant wife claiming she was possessed by evil spirits. One of the four smothered 21-year-old Nalia Mumtaz while the others held her down, apparently in an attempt to drive out the ‘jinn’ spirit from her body. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, family friend Tony Mehdi said: ‘The thinking behind her in-laws was that they would have the body released – take it back home to Pakistan.’ The killers included her husband, Mohammed Tauseef Mumtaz – who later claimed she suffocated herself – his parents, Zia Ul-Haq and Salma Aslam, both 51, and his brother in law Hammad Hassan.","Hundreds of Asians are operating as healers and removing evil spirits from bodies believed to be possessed, according to BBC Newsnight investigation .

"Tripped up by technology: Craig Evans who accidentally sent a sex text to all his contacts and ended up in jail . Craig Evans must have thought things couldn’t get any worse after he accidentally sent a saucy text message intended for a lover to every contact in his phonebook. How wrong he was! The 24-year-old swimming coach ended up in prison for sex offences after the text also found its way to two young schoolgirls. Evans had typed an intimate invitation to his girlfriend asking her if she would like to engage in sex with him ‘skin on skin’. Excruciatingly, a slip of the fingers on his BlackBerry smartphone resulted in it going out via BlackBerry Messenger to all the numbers on his phone. But as well as having to deal with the humiliation of his family reading the message, Evans’s mistake led to far more serious consequences. Among the recipients of the text were two girls aged 13 and 14, which led to Evans, who teaches swimming in a leisure centre, being arrested and charged with causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He was jailed for 18 months at Birmingham Crown Court in July. The story unfolded in court this week when his lawyers went to the Court of Appeal in London to have his conviction overturned. They argued that Evans’s ‘misguided use of his BlackBerry’ made it ‘difficult to conclude that he was targeting anyone’. Bad mistake: A slip of the fingers on his BlackBerry . smartphone resulted in it going out via BlackBerry Messenger to all the . numbers on his phone . In the message, Evans, of Birmingham, . asked an unknown lover if they would have sex with him ‘skin on skin’ and whether they would prefer it to be ‘fast or slow’. Granting . the appeal, Lord Justice Elias said the circumstances were ‘unusual’ and agreed that Evans had been ‘evidently misguided’ in the use of his . phone. He added: ‘The facts . of this case are rather unusual. Messages... were sent to every single . contact in his phone, including members of his own family.’ Quashed: Mr Evans walked free from the Court of Appeal in London after judges accepted his 'misguided use of his BlackBerry' He added: ‘The fact that they were repeated shows that he was evidently misguided in the use of his BlackBerry. ‘It is difficult to conclude that he was targeting anyone. ‘There were a number of mitigating factors in this case.’ The . judge, sitting with Mr Justice Coulson and Mrs Justice Thirlwall, added . that the sentence, which he also reduced to nine months, would be . suspended ‘given the unusual circumstances’ and freed Evans.","Craig Evans, 24, had been jailed for 18 months for inciting a child to engage in sexual activity .

"When a Tennessee lawyer asked the IRS for tax-exempt status for a mentoring group that trained high school and college students about conservative political philosophy, the agency responded with a list of 95 questions in 31 parts, including an ultimatum for a list of everyone the group had trained, or planned to train. 'Provide details regarding all training you have provided or will provide,' the IRS demanded. 'Indicate who has received or will receive the training and submit copies of the training material.' That question was part of the tax collection agency's February 14, 2012 letter to Kevin Kookogey. founder of the group Linchpins of Liberty. He had submitted his application 13 months earlier. 'Can you imagine my responsibility to parents if I disclosed the names of their children to the IRS?' he asked MailOnline. It's 'an impossible question to answer fully and truthfully,' he said, 'without disclosing the names of anyone I ever taught, or would ever teach, including students.' Three of the more than 90 questions the IRS posed to Linchpins of Liberty, including (#24) the demand for a list of everyone the organization had trained, or planned to train - all of whom would be students in college and high school . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney faced hostile media questions on Tuesday, including many about the fast-brewing IRS scandal. He maintained that the White House had no knowledge of the IRS's practice of targeting conservative groups . Like the leaders of many tea party-affiliated groups whose tax-exemption applications have become the subject of angry complaints, Kookogey called the IRS's inquisition an overreach, 'especially considering that my organization mentors high school and college students.' It 'should send chills through your spine,' he told MailOnline, 'that the government would ask me to identify those I teach, and to provide details of what I teach them.' The 13-month delay, while burdensome, was far shorter than those some other groups endured. According to a report released late Tuesday by the IRS's Office of Inspector General, the average delay at one point was 574 days. But Kookogey said a $30,000 grant was canceled as a result of the IRS's months-long radio silence, when he couldn't tell his donor that Linchpins had earned its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. That money would have made a significant difference to the group, judging from its public filings in Tennessee. In 2011, Linchpins of Liberty reported collecting just $3,460 in contributions, and spending $7,328 on its programs. Kevin Kookogey said his group, Linchpins of Liberty, should never have been caught up in the IRS's anti-conservative dragnet. The IRS Inspector General issued a report on Tuesday largely clearing upper-echelon officials in the Obama administration . The group's online materials refer to it as 'an American leadership development enterprise.' Its stated purpose is to mentor high school and college students, placing an emphasis on Western civilization and an old-style core curriculum - what previous generations called the 'great books.' 'Our ideas are opposed to the Obama administration, but we’re not tea party,' Kookogey told The Tennessean. It's that lack of a tea party connection, he said, that makes his predicament so maddening. He told MailOnline that nothing about his group - 'not our name or our description or our website, or anything' - should have placed it among the organizations the IRS chose to scrutinize closely by using key words like 'tea party,' '9/12,' and 'patriots' as qualifiers. 'I'm not a Tea Party group. I'm not a Patriot group by name' he told NewsChannel 5 in Nashville. 'We mentor high school and college students in conservative political philosophy. It's a one on one relationship.' Attorney General Eric Holder said Tuesday that he ordered a Justice Department investigation into the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups for extra tax scrutiny. He will face questions on Wednesday from House Republicans in a Judiciary Committee hearing . Kookogey summed it up in an interview with MailOnline as 'unethical, unconstitutional, and unfair,' later asserting in an email that '[w]e were targeted by the IRS based on our political beliefs and the content of our speech.' The American Center for Law and Justice, which represents 27 conservative groups including Linchpins of Liberty, is planning to file suit against the IRS. Jay Sekulow, that organization's chief counsel, wrote on Tuesday that 'the IRS abuse is ongoing.' 'Even though the IRS admitted wrongdoing,' Sekulow wrote in an essay for FoxNews.com, even though the Inspector General’s report indicates that wrongdoing was widespread, the IRS still hasn’t withdrawn its overbroad and unconstitutional questions, and it still hasn’t granted the exemptions it should grant, despite the fact that some applications have been pending for more than two years.' The Inspector General's report includes a list of 'the seven questions' the IRS asked right-wing groups that were later 'identified as being unnecessary.' Its request for the list of students trained by Linchpins of Liberty was not among them. The report also largely exonerates political appointees in the Treasury Department and at the top of the IRS, instead blaming mid-level bureaucrats for providing 'ineffective management' and using 'inappropriate criteria' to red-flag conservative groups. It makes no mention of anyone in the White House directing the IRS to play political favorites. But The Washington Post has reported that 'senior IRS officials' in Washington, D.C. were notified of the practice in 2011. The IRS Inspector General identified just seven questions that were 'unnecessary,' among the hundreds asked of tea party groups and other conservative organizations that sought tax-exempt status . In December of that year, Kookogey says, he called the IRS's nonprofit evaluation arm in Cincinnati, Ohio, to find out why his group's application had taken so long. The agent on the other end of the line, he said, told him, 'We are waiting on guidance from our superiors as to your organization and similar organizations.' Attorney General Eric Holder has said that he ordered the FBI to initiate a criminal probe on Friday, when he learned about the IRS's practices. The IRS's actions, he said, were, 'certainly outrageous and unacceptable, but we are examining the facts to see if there were criminal violations.' Holder is expected to testify in a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday in Washington. On Friday the House Ways and Means Committee will hear testimony from acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller and Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George. Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio has called for Miller to lose his job. Jay Sekulow (R) is threatening to sue the IRS on behalf of his conservative clients, while Sen. Marco Rubio (L) has asked Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to fire the acting IRS commissioner . 'At a bare minimum, those involved with this deeply offensive use of government power have committed a violation of the public trust that has already had a profoundly chilling effect on free speech,' Rubio wrote Monday in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. 'Such behavior cannot be excused with a simple apology.' 'It is clear the IRS cannot operate with even a shred of the American people’s confidence under the current leadership,' Rubio continued. 'Therefore, I strongly urge that you and President Obama demand the IRS Commissioner’s resignation, effective immediately.' On Friday, Sekulow demanded that the IRS immediately approve the tax-exempt status applications of his organization's 10 legal clients, including Linchpins of Liberty, that are still waiting. He issued the agency an ultimatum: Grant the requests by noon on May 17, or prepare to fight in court. 'We are demanding that the IRS grant our remaining clients tax-exempt status immediately,' Sekulow said in a statement. 'If that does not occur by Friday, we will advise our clients of their right to sue the IRS for the redress of their grievances.'","Federal government demanded a list of everyone a Tennessee organization had ever trained, or planned to train .

"Laura Lyons, 29, created website Are They Safe, which runs comprehensive searches on people, after she found out her husband had a history of violence against previous partners . A woman who was unaware her new husband had a history of violence against previous partners has set up a website offering £200 background checks to try to stop others suffering a similar fate. The website, called ‘Are They Safe’, is thought to be the first of its kind, with its founders offering to undertake comprehensive searches of public records to verify someone’s identity, marital history, finances, and uncover any criminal convictions. Anyone worried about a prospective or current partner, a potential son or daughter-in-law or a business partner, can pay a fee and be supplied with a report of the kind usually compiled by private detectives at much greater cost. But there have been warnings that the new site goes much further than the ‘Clare’s Law’ checks for domestic violence currently available to police, and could be used by people embarking on anonymous ‘fishing expeditions’ to uncover information that could be used maliciously. AreTheySafe.co.uk has been created by Devon businesswoman Laura Lyons, 29, together with experienced investigators and private security specialists. Ms Lyons had been the victim of violent domestic abuse at the hands of her husband, Farouk Ali, before she left him last year. When she married Ali, Ms Lyons was unaware he had abused previous partners and had two assault convictions. And in September, he pleaded guilty to bigamy, saying he had another wife in Bangladesh. ‘If something like this service had been available to me, I would have avoided years of violence and misery,’ Ms Lyons said. But Professor Liz Kelly of London Metropolitan University, an expert in the field of domestic violence, said the numbers of women who would be helped might be limited. She said: ‘If you’ve fallen for someone, you may not want to check them out at an early stage. I’m not convinced enough people will use it for it to be truly preventative.’ She said there could also be privacy issues, while if a former perpetrator had successfully undergone a ‘perpetrator programme’ to modify his or her behaviour, disclosing their past would be unfair to them. She added: ‘I also have concerns that victims will come to be seen as responsible for stopping violence – that makes me uncomfortable.’ The information supplied by Are They Safe is derived from legal, subscription-only databases of the sort used by private investigators and insurance companies. For £195, the site offers to verify an individual’s personal information, marital details, criminal history and will also reveal any credit warnings or county court judgments against them. The Are They Safe site searches public records to verify someone’s identity, marital history, finances, and uncover any criminal convictions . When Ms Lyons (right) married Farouk Ali (left), she was unaware he had abused previous partners and had two assault convictions . An ‘enhanced background check’ costing £350 involves further financial checks, disclosure of current and previous company directorships, and property ownership. It will even reveal if the subject of the search appears on international lists of wanted criminals and terrorists. Some of this information is already available to prospective partners via the police, under the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme, known as ‘Clare’s Law’ because it was introduced after Salford woman Clare Wood was murdered by her partner, George Appleton, in 2009. However, Avon and Somerset Assistant Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe, the national police lead on domestic violence, admitted yesterday that Clare’s Law searches usually take weeks. Are They Safe promises results within a single week, a period which it says will soon be cut to 24 hours. There are concerns that the site could be used for anonymous ‘fishing expeditions’ to uncover information that could be used maliciously . Ms Rolfe said: ‘Are They Safe appears to offer a similar service [to DVDS] at a significant cost when disclosure through DVDS is free.’ But she added that she did not wish to criticise the new service, adding: ‘Victim safety is our absolute priority.’ Ms Lyons said many people felt wary about using Clare’s Law, as it requires someone to go to a police station in person and make a statement to an officer. Are They Safe is not only available to people in or thinking about entering a relationship, but could be used by suspicious relatives, neighbours or friends. The website asks: ‘How well do you know your partner or potential partner’s past? Are you worried about your son or daughter’s new partner? Is something not adding up? Are they who they say they are? Have they ever been convicted of a criminal offence? Do they have a record of domestic violence? We will uncover this for you.’ Ms Lyons accepted that some clients would not be able to afford the fees, but said she hoped to introduce a ‘heavily subsidised’ service for people on low incomes and benefits. She said: ‘I don’t want anyone to be excluded. I’m not doing this to make money, but because I want to prevent people becoming victims.’ However, Hazel Blears, the Labour MP who led the campaign for Clare’s Law, said she feared it might allow people to go on ‘fishing expeditions’ which undermined a person’s right to privacy. She added: ‘I would also be concerned if people were accessing their partners’ details without the necessary support being in place.’ This was because if a check persuaded someone they ought to leave their partner, ‘the point when a relationship ends is also the point of maximum risk’. According to a Home Office study published in 2006, almost 70 per cent of domestic violence perpetrators held by police have been arrested before. In cases where clients are shown to be at serious risk, Are They Safe will also provide advice on security, and on working with police. ‘We will provide exactly the kind of support Hazel Blears is talking about,’ Ms Lyons said. London student Joanne, 28, last week became one of the first to use Are They Safe. Of her partner, she said: ‘He didn’t like me using social network websites, and he didn’t like my job. He’d insist on holding my phone. I decided to check him out.’ She learned he had been charged with rape and convicted of assault. ‘It explained a lot,’ Joanne said. She left him, and within days he started to text her death threats. On Are They Safe’s advice, she went to police. He was not arrested, but the threats have stopped, for now.","New website Are They Safe checks criminal records of people's partners .

"The title of the first Bridget Jones novel in 14 years has been announced - Mad About The Boy. The book is author Helen Fielding's third about the hapless singleton, following Bridget Jones's Diary, which was published in 1996, and sequel The Edge Of Reason in 1999. The books sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries and were adapted for the movies starring Renee Zellweger in the lead role, Colin Firth as Mark Darcy and Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver. Dating dilemmas: The Bridget Jones books sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries and were adapted for the movies starring Renee Zellweger (pictured) in the lead role . Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy, which will be published on October 10, is set in present day London and 'represents a totally new phase in Bridget’s life'. An extract released by publishers showed that Jones is still prone to mishaps. She writes after sending a text message: 'You see, this is the trouble with the modern world. If it was the days of letter-writing, I would never even have started to find his address, a pen, a piece of paper, an envelope, a stamp and gone outside at 11.30pm to find a postbox. 'A text is gone at the brush of a fingertip, like a nuclear bomb or Exocet missile. Dating Rule No 1: Do not text when drunk.' Comeback: Author Helen Fielding pictured in 1999 during her book tour for The Edge of Reason . A statement from publishers Jonathan Cape said: 'Bridget is older, she is still keeping a diary, but she is also immersed in texting and experimenting with social media, with an emphasis on 'social!'' Jonathan Cape publishing director Dan Franklin said: 'As a comic writer, Helen is without equal. Over 15 years ago she gave a voice to a generation of young women with the original Bridget book. 'Now they’ve grown up and she’s doing it again....this time with all the joys and complications of social media.' Jones, who filled the pages of her diary with her failed efforts to find love and measured her life in the amount of cigarettes she smoked, units of alcohol she drank and number of calories she lost or gained, started life as a weekly column in The Independent in 1995. Best-selling English author Fielding recently wrote that the dating scene had become even more difficult for women thanks to the advent of email, Twitter, Facebook and texting. Writing in the margins of her novel Bridget Jones' Diary for a charity book sale, she said that she thought that finding a partner is 'so much worse now'. Oscar-winning actor Firth recently dashed hopes that a third Bridget Jones film would be hitting the big-screen soon. 'Unfortunately, it might be a bit of a long wait. I wouldn't say that it's completely dead in the water, but the way it's going you might be seeing Bridget Jones' granddaughter's story being told by the time we get there,' he quipped.",Author Helen Fielding's third instalment will be published on October 10th .

"He is one of William and Harry’s closest friends and widely regarded as their ‘court jester’. But Guy Pelly’s latest outrageous stunt may well have proved a joke too far. A promotional video for his London bar Tonteria features close-ups of semi-naked dancers ‘twerking’ – with Buckingham Palace as a backdrop. It’s a choice of location that could put Pelly at odds with the Royal Family and has most certainly put him on the wrong side of the law – as filming outside Buckingham Palace without permission is illegal. A photo advertising Guy Pelly's bar Tonteria shows a scantily clad woman posing outside the famous gates of Buckingham Palace . Still images taken from the video promoting the bar also show bizarrely dressed men and women cavorting in front of Buckingham Palace (pictured) The video also shows the actors and dancers gyrating and twerking . Neither Prince William nor Prince Harry were involved in the zombie-themed video, now on YouTube, featuring actors cavorting orgy-style near the Victoria Memorial outside the Palace’s famous gates. Later, the bizarrely dressed dancers moved on to the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye and Harrods, where they were chased away by security staff who claimed they were scaring shoppers. The mood portrayed in the video – filmed earlier this month – is not far removed from what actually takes place in Tonteria, a Mexican-themed bar where topless men wearing giant skulls patrol the club with sparklers. A large bottle of champagne costs £28,000 and for guests who guarantee to spend at least £1,000 behind the bar, drinks are served by skimpily clad dancers gyrating to thudding music, and shots of tequila are delivered by an electric train suspended from the ceiling. Friends of Pelly, 32, acknowledge the Stowe-educated entrepreneur was well aware that his choice of Buckingham Palace for filming was trading on his Royal friendships. As The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year, Prince Harry is often ushered in and out of Tonteria via a discreet side entrance, and the club is where William hosted Pelly’s stag party in May before he married American heiress Lizzy Wilson. Prince Harry (left), and his friend Guy Pelly (right) with masked waitresses from his exclusive Mexican-themed bar Tonteria . One regular at the Sloane Square venue, present during the filming, said: ‘We broke a lot of rules and we are expecting the video to be banned. Guy obviously knows people will assume he’s giving a cheeky nod to the fact Harry goes to his club.’ The filming location outside Buckingham Palace comes under Royal Parks control. A Royal Parks spokesman confirmed that no permission had been sought for filming, adding: ‘A breach of Royal Parks regulations is a criminal offence. ‘Under the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997 it is an offence to take photographs of still or moving subjects in connection with a business or trade without written permission. Enforcement is a matter for the police.’ 'Muertos Mondays' launches on Monday 1st December.","Princes' close friend Guy Pelly pulls outrageous stunt for his London bar .

"From bunnies to fluffy baby chicks, Easter is synonymous with all things cute. But while chocolate Easter eggs are a relatively modern phenomenon, as these stunning vintage cards reveal, an appreciation for all things adorable is not. The Easter cards, which date from the early years of the 20th century, are festooned with delicately drawn rabbits, multicoloured chickens and rosy-cheeked cherubs galore. Others feature traditional Spring motifs such as daffodils and chicks, while more still include vividly coloured Easter eggs - not all of which are of the chocolate variety. Colourful chicks: This vintage Easter card featuring a country scene and five fluffy chicks would have certainly warmed the heart of its lucky recipient . Cracking: An rosy-faced cherub crawls out of an Easter Egg in this eye-catching card. Sadly, little angels such as this one are rarely spotted on modern cards . They blight the land and have caused chaos on farms, so it's no wonder Australians have chosen to swap bunnies for bilbies. First introduced in 1968, the Easter Bilby comes in chocolate form and decorates festive packaging. Originally intended to raise awareness of the endangered marsupial, bilbies are a firm favourte of Australian children come Easter. Although the origins of Easter are firmly rooted in Christianity, not every creature to appear on the cards can say the same. The Easter Bunny, for example, was associated with the Saxon goddess Ēostre and has its roots in pre-Christian festivities laid on to welcome the Spring Equinox. The exchange of Easter eggs also pre-dates Christianity, with elaborately decorated ostrich eggs discovered in 60,000-year-old African burial sites while 5000-year-old eggs made from gold and silver unearthed in the graves of ancient Sumerians and Egyptians. In Greece, the only eggs available are red-painted chicken eggs, some of which also bear a gold cross, and commemorate the early Christians of Mesopotamia who dyed eggs blood red to mark Jesus' sacrifice. But eggs and rabbits aren't the only way to celebrate Easter. Around the world, a variety of different customs have been adopted to mark the big day, with everything from whipping to iguana suppers included. In Colombia, the traditional Easter lunch includes roasted iguana and turtles, while women in Hungary risk being splashed with lucky water as they celebrate the big day. Easter Greetings: A charming Easter postcard showing an idyllic countryside farmhouse, which three adorable chicks and their mother appear intent on reaching . Traditional: The image of three angels holding an Easter Greetings banner is a much more traditional card that reflects the religious roots of the festival . Vintage: A pair of traditional Bavarian postcards dating from 1912 and featuring a pair of little girls enjoying their Easter Eggs . Other unusual traditions include a fertility ritual unique to the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which sees women submit to being whipped with willow switches in the belief it makes them more beautiful and promotes fertility. An altogether more British tradition is that of the hot cross bun; a part of national life for more than two millennia and which, according to Anglo-Saxon chronicler, Bede, is linked to the goddess, Ēostre - the deity who also gave Easter its name. Once a year-round treat, in 1592 the London Clerk of Markets proclaimed that the buns could only be eaten on Good Friday, at Christmas and at funerals and their consumption was restricted further by James I. Despite his best efforts, the bun remains popular today. Thought to bring good luck, according to traditional superstition, the bun should be kissed before being eaten and if shared with a friend, will cement the relationship for the year to come. Bog off bunny! While Easter Bunnies such as this vintage example reign supreme in Europe and the USA, Australia has swapped the rabbit for the native bilby (above) Cute: Friends and relatives would have spread Easter joy by sending cards such as this hilarious scene of a driving coach steered by chicks and pulled by bunnines . Sweet: Estimated to date from the first decade of the 20th century, this card is less colourful than others but nods to the long history of rabbits and Easter . Charming: One of the earliest cards in this collection, this period piece dates back to 1890 and combines spring flowers, the Easter egg and the Easter bunny . Feast: Two fluffy (and beautifully dressed)friends munch their way through their own tasty-looking Easter feast in this late 19th century greeting card .","Earliest examples date from late 19th century and reveal that daffodils, chicks and rabbits have always been popular .

"The boarding school where Boris Johnson was taught is being sued by former students over claims of widespread sexual abuse. Two teachers are accused of subjecting children between the ages of seven and 13 to 'horrific' attacks in the 1970s. Ashdown House preparatory, which is known as a feeder school for Eton, is now facing a wave of compensation claims from its former pupils. Mayor of London Boris Johnson's former school has been embroiled in a child sex scandal . An email was circulated this month warning those who attended the school that the abuse had been covered up. The note, written by former pupils now suing the school, stated: 'The reason why we have decided to do this so late on is that it has come to light that sexual and physical abuse was rife between 1970 and 1980, and from more than one teacher at the school. 'To make matters worse it is now apparent the school was aware of these events, albeit not fully, but chose not to do anything about it. 'The effects of this abuse has damaged a number of pupils long into adulthood and it is felt among us that, as part of the healing process, it is important for us to take our power back and take action against such damaging and horrendous actions.' Ashdown House, which was also attended by Homeland actor Damian Lewis, 42, charges almost £8,000 per term for boarders. The prep school is in the village of Forest Row in East Sussex teaches around 140 pupils aged between seven and 13. Homeland star Damian Lewis was another former pupil at the East Sussex school . Ashdown House is in the village of Forest Row in East Sussex. It teaches around 140 pupils aged between seven and 13 . Mr Johnson was taught at the school with his brother Jo, now a Tory MP, and sister Rachel, who was the first girl boarder at the traditional English all-boys prep school. Mr Johnson was at the school when he was awarded a scholarship to study at Eton College. Ashdown House is first thought to have faced a police investigation after a complaint about abuse in 2003, but no one was prosecuted. The former students who are seeking legal action are demanding a 'sincere and meaningful apology' and said they are taking action to prevent abuse from carrying on at the school. 'The abuse that occurred continues to have a dramatic effect on a number of lives, with regards to ongoing relationships, career and treatment for dealing with the psychological damage it has caused. Therefore we are seeking compensation with regards to a civil case against the school, the email added. The alleged victims have instructed London lawyers Slater & Gordon. Liz Dux, from the firm, said it was 'very early days for this complex and difficult case'. Mr Johnson's sister has said of her time at the school: 'In those days, the three Cs - the cane, cricket, and classics - were fetishistically followed. 'Despite all this, however, I was happier there - shaggy, plump, and entirely the wrong sex - than I'd ever been.' She claims she was threatened with the cane but the headteacher spared her because she was a girl. This, apparently, led to beating being abolished at the school. Cothill Educational Trust has owned Ashdown House since 2009. A spokesman said: 'We are aware that Sussex police were officially informed in 2003 of an allegation of sexual abuse relating to a period in the mid-70s. 'We understood that the police were dealing with the investigation. The Trust would like it to be known that it takes its safeguarding responsibilities very seriously indeed.'

"TV presenter and Sheffield United patron Charlie Webster has said she will quit her role at the club if they re-sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. Miss Webster, a member of the Justice Ministry's Victims' Panel, said she had a 'responsibility' and 'duty' to oppose the player's return and spoke out against his 'lack of remorse'. But she was immediately branded a 'hypocrite' by Evans' sister Kylie, who retweeted a message the presenter posted last month saying she wanted to get a photograph with former heavyweight boxing champion and convicted rapist Mike Tyson. Ched Evans' sister Kylie (left) and TV presenter Charlie Webster (right) have been in a spat over the striker's possible return to Sheffield United . Miss Webster, a member of the Justice Ministry's Victims' Panel, said she had a 'responsibility' to block Evans' return to the Blades . On September 10, the presenter tweeter her regret at not getting a photo of convicted rapist Mike Tyson . Evans' sister Kylie called the Sky Sports presenter a 'hypocrite' for the tweet about the former boxer . The 25-year-old former Sheffield United player and Welsh international was released from jail this week after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel. Webster, who has said that she was sexually assaulted as a teenager, told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'You will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal. Not under my name, under my club or community.' She added: 'He says he is innocent, he has shown no remorse. 'Very few people would be able to walk back into the same job as they did before being a convicted rapist.' She went on to say on Sky News: 'He hasn't accepted responsibility for what he's done. Even if he doesn't think it's rape, his behaviour was still morally wrong and he still hasn't said sorry to the victim. 'I am concerned about what message it sends out to the community and society to re-sign a convicted rapist.' Miss Webster, who was sexually assaulted as a teenager, said: 'You will have young people cheering him on when he scores a goal. Not under my name, under my club or community' The convicted rapist's girlfriend, Natasha Massey (left) and Kylie Evans (right) continue to defend the footballer . In reply Evans' sister, who also maintains the footballer's innocence, pointed to a tweet which Miss Webster posted on September 10. It reads: 'Just bumped into Mike Tyson in the hotel lobby as I was randomly talking about him! I chickened out on asking for a photo...damn.' Ms Evans tweeted: 'This is the same Charlie Webster that's just threatened to leave United. Hypocrite.' Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992 after an incident the previous year and subsequently served three years of a six-year sentence. Responding to the Mike Tyson tweet, Miss Webster said: 'I am not going to stand her and say she said this, I said that. I am not going to comment on her but I have apologised and find it very sad that's taken away from what I said this morning. 'I did not think about that tweet at the time and I'm not proud of that tweet but the response has been another example of berating someone for speaking out against rape. 'But I am not thinking about Mike Tyson. I am thinking about Ched Evans. The reason people don't stand up to rape is because they get abused on Twitter for it. 'The victim has had to take on a new identity and had a hate campaign against her. Nobody should have to go through that. I would ask the community to get behind the victim.' The former Sheffield United striker was jailed in April 2012 for raping a woman in a Rhyl hotel room . Evans, a former Manchester City youth player, was jailed in April 2012 for raping the woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The striker denied raping the woman but was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. He admitted having sex with her, but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident. The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse. His friend, Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, also admitted having sex with the victim but was found not guilty of the same charge. An appeal against Evans's conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. Since leaving Wymott Prison near Leyland in Lancashire a statement released on Evans' behalf says that he will make a 'very personal and profound statement' on the issue next week. Last night, an online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted more than 150,000 signatures. The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to 'refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player'. Yesterday, a steady stream of well-wishers called at his family home ahead of an expected celebration, with relatives having flown in from all over the world for the reunion.","TV presenter Charlie Webster will quit her role as Sheffield United patron if Ched Evans re-signs for the club .

"Paintings' re-emergence coincides with planned auction of other expedition memorabilia, including Scott's last letter . The evocative ‘lost’ paintings produced by a polar explorer who later perished alongside Captain Scott on his doomed expedition to the South Pole have emerged 100 years on. Dr Edward Wilson sketched the unforgiving landscapes of Antarctica while the party spent months waiting at base camp before they could set off for the Pole. The artist was unable to use his watercolour paints outdoors as they would have frozen in the bone-chilling temperatures of -70F. Desolate: A sunset from Hut Point on April 2nd 1911 by Dr Edward Wilson, from a series of paintings that have only recently reemerged after 100 years . Instead he made pencilled notes about what colours to use on the drawings and then painted them in the comparative warmth of their base hut at Cape Evans. The paintings produced from April to June 1911 show a snow-covered wilderness shrouded in darkness that only a handful of men had visited before. One, painted from a hilltop, shows a desolate snowy scene with two tiny figures from the expedition team walking along the sea ice. Other paintings are of two explorers exercising ponies they took with them and a handful of men heaving sledges across the ice. Snow on snow: Dr Edward Wilson's sketch of Mount Erebus, one of many landscapes he painted that had only been visited by a handful of men before . Recording memories: Dr Wilson at work on one of his paintings at the explorers' camp in the Antarctic winter . There is a painting of Henry ‘Birdie’ Bowers checking a thermometer under moonlight. He also went on to die on the ill-fated Terra Nova mission. Another illustration shows a cluster of Emperor Penguins at an ice barrier at Cape Crozier that Dr Wilson spent six weeks travelling to in order to gather rare eggs. The 17 paintings were recovered from the base hut and published in Scott’s Last Expedition Diaries in 1913, the last time they were assembled together. Dr Wilson painted explorers on the slopes of Mount Erebus, including Henry 'Birdie' Bower reading the thermometer on the ramp . Observing the conditions: Dr Wilson painted many different geological features of the Antarctic landscape, including a cave in the ice barrier at Cape Crozier (left) and a melted ice at Hut point, sketched from Observation Hill (right) Walkies: Dr Edward Wilson sketches men on the expedition exercising two of the ponies they had taken with them to the Antarctic . Only one or two were printed in later editions of the book. Nine of the original paintings were donated by Dr Wilson’s family to a museum in Cumbria, but they have only recently gone on display for the first time. The 17 images have now been printed in their entirety in a new edition of Scott’s diaries. Dr Peter Lloyd Jones, chairman of the Captain Scott Society, said: ‘Wilson was a tremendous graphic artist and was considered to be the perfect person to send on the mission. ‘As an illustrator to the expedition and is one of the best artists to have ever gone to Antarctica. ‘He produced some very evocative images under very difficult circumstances. They are pensive and thoughtful images, not incredibly exciting but very reflective.’ Recreation: Mr Ponting lecturing some of the explorers on Japan, during their long wait at base camp before setting off for the South Pole . Hard work: Six of the explorers pull sledges across the harsh landscape in one of Dr Wilson's paintings . Recorded for posterity: Captain Scott and three explorers make their way across the desolate landscape in a photo showing conditions similar to those painted by Dr Edward Wilson . Endless ice: Dr Wilson's sketch of the Great Ice Barrier, looking east from Cape Crozier . Dr Lloyd Jones added that the pictures have not been distributed widely and until now have been seen by very few people. While the photographs taken on the expedition have become increasingly accessible, the sketches have not, he said. After seeing out the austral winter of 1911, Captain Scott’s ‘Polar Party’ of 16 men set off in the November to be the first people to reach the South Pole. The supporting party of 11 men returned as planned at various stages during the 800 mile trek, leaving Captain Scott, Dr Wilson, Captain Lawrence Oates, Petty Office Edger Evans and Lt Bowers. Desolate: Dr Wilson looks out west from Cape Evans on to a snow-covered wilderness. Although the conditions were harsh, it was considerably warmer than the conditions the explorers would experience when they began their expedition to the South Pole . Colour breaks through the white landscapes: Iridescent clouds looking north from Cape Evans where the explorers waited for months . Depicting the landscapes: 'Paraselene' and 'Lunar Corona' produced in 1911 by Dr Edward Wilson before the team set off for the South Pole . Ray of light: The sun lights up the summit of Mount Erebus as the rest of the landscape remains in darkness . Brooding skies: An April sunset from Hut Point, painted by Dr Wilson not long after the explorers arrived at base camp in Antarctica . The men made it to the South Pole on January 17, 1912 only to find Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them to it a month before. On their return journey, the five men endured dreadful conditions and suffered from a lack of food and frostbite. PO Evans died on February 17 and a flagging Captain Oates famously died on March 16 after walking out of the tent into a blizzard to give the remaining three a chance of survival. Captain Scott, Dr Wilson and Lt Bowers died in the tent on or about March 29. Their bodies were found eight months later by a rescue party. Meanwhile as the prints have been reprinted, the centenary of Scott's journey is also being marked by a Polar Sale at Bonhams, which will see items from the voyage and other commemorative pieces go under the hammer. Scott's final letter, written to Sir Edgar Speyer includes the line  'We have seen the Pole and we shall die like gentlemen'. It was found eight months later by a search party and forms part of the sale to be held on March 30. A collection of Dunn Bennett bone china from the ward room of the Terra Nova expedition ship will also go on sale, as well as a watch inscribed to Peter Scott in memory of his late father Captain Scott.

Still got it: Pirlo impressed for Italy in the World Cup despite their disappointing group stage exit . Vision: Pirlo's technically ability is one of the best from across the world . ‘He has everything he needs to be successful,’ the Juventus’ playmaker added. ‘He gave his team a new identity in just a few days, and that was very difficult after such a devastating World Cup. ‘He needs time, one match isn’t enough to evaluate a team, but Conte and his staff are working to create a national team that makes the fans proud and happy to watch their games.’ Pirlo is currently the fourth most-capped player in ltaly history with 112 appearances but is currently sidelined with a hip injury.","The midfield maestro has revealed he will play on for Italy .

"A Los Angeles man claims he had a terrifying encounter with the man named as the alleged Zodiac killer in a book released last year. Publicist Chris Harris said he was stunned when he picked up a copy of The Most Dangerous Animal of All, believing he had encountered the alleged murderer in a diner in the 1970s. In the book Gary Stewart, who was adopted at birth, claims the search for his real father, Earl Van Best Jr, led to the discovery that the antique bookseller was the serial killer who terrorized San Francisco in the 1960s. His mugshot looked strikingly similar to a sketch issued by police during the hunt for the killer - and Mr Harris claimed he spoke to that man. Scroll down for video . Encounter: A Los Angeles man believes he met Earl Van Best Jr, the man suspected of being a Zodiac killer in a book released last year. The Zodiac killer slayed at least five people between 1968 and 1969 . Publicist Chris Harris said he was stunned when he picked up a copy of The Most Dangerous Animal of All (left), believing he encountered the alleged murderer in a diner in the 1970s . He was making a documentary about the killer at the time which meant he had to go and visit Napa, California, the scene of one of the murders. He told ABC 7: 'He turned round and he said ""Do you have any idea what it's like to know you have to kill."" I didn't say a word. I sat there in terror. This is the man that was in that diner. His associate, Cory Skyler Drouillard, said there is more evidence Van Best is the killer. He says that prints from the right index finers of both the Zodiac killer and Van Best clearly have a scar. The Zodiac killer murdered at least five people and injured two more between 1968 and 1969 in the San Francisco Bay Area. Stewart claims to have 'legally sound' and 'forensic evidence' that proves that Van Best is the man responsible for one of America's biggest unsolved crimes. Van Best had a criminal record for rape and fraud, and his mug shot, found by the author, clearly resembles the Zodiac Killer's police sketch, down to the eyeglasses. Stewart's father died in Mexico City in 1984. Similarities: The sketch released by police during the hunt for the Zodiac killer bears an uncanny resemblance to Best's mugshot . Harris' associate Cory Skyler Drouillard, added there is more evidence that Best is the killer. He says that finger prints from the right index of both the Zodiac suspect and Best clearly have a scar . Stewart claims that his main breakthrough came when he solved one of the Zodiac killer’s ciphers sent to the newspapers during his spree. The Zodiac boasted at the time that if police cracked the code then his identity would come out. The killer sent cryptograms to media outlets, some of which remain unsolved. In a letter written to the San Francisco Examiner he had written ‘in this cipher is my identity”. Stewart found the words 'EV', 'Best', and 'Jr'. After his discovery he also claimed that another expert found 'Earl Van Best Junior' written backwards in another code. The book claims that the chances of his father’s name being in two ciphers is 'astronomical'. Cryptic: GaryStewart, the author of  The Most Dangerous Animal of All, discovered Van Best's name in one of the cyphers he sent to the media during his killing . Victims: From left are San Francisco cab driver Paul Stine, who was shot to death, Cecilia Shepard, 22, a student who was stabbed to death, and Bryan Hartnell, 20, who was stabbed but survived . Stewart then went onto match fingerprints taken from his father’s arrest and those from the crime scene. Both have a diagonal scar on them, he claims. He then had a handwriting expert match the writing from the letters with his father’s signature from his wedding certificate. Again he claims that he has an expert who would willing to stand up in court that they were a match. Stewart claims that all this is enough to solve the case but that the San Francisco Police Department may be reluctant because it would cause embarrassment .","Publicist Chris Harris picked up copy of The Most Dangerous Animal of All .

The Russian planes were identified as two IL-78 refueling tankers, two Mig-31 fighter jets and two Bear long-range bombers. NORAD said that they entered the United States' air defense identification zone (ADIZ), an area beyond sovereign U.S. airspace. On Thursday, at 1:30 a.m. two Canadian CF-18 fighter jets intercepted two of the long-range bombers about 40 nautical miles off the Canadian coastline. Jazdyk said in the past five years, jets under NORAD's command have intercepted more than 50 Russian bombers approaching North American airspace. A spokesman for NORAD and NORTHCOM added: 'We do not see these flights as a threat.' NORAD, a bi-national American and Canadian command is responsible for air defense in North America.

"In a shot eerily similar to a scene from the blockbuster film Independence Day, an unidentified flying object hovers over the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest. The man who took the photograph of the flying saucer in Romania's capital has spoken of his shock at his brief encounter. Cosmin Garlesteanu described getting a strange feeling while taking a picture of the imposing government building, and was stunned when he looked back at his snap to see a strange green and blue light beaming down on it. Strange sighting: A photographer captured this UFO hovering above the Romanian parliament in Bucharest . Inside the beam there appears to be two elliptical shapes hovering above the grand structure. The image mirrors a famous scene from Hollywood's Independence Day,  starring Will Smith, where a spaceship appears above the White House in Washington and blows it up. The photograph, taken on February 4, has attracted global interest after Mr Garlesteanu uploaded it onto a photo-sharing website. Viewers around the world have been coming up with a host of theories about what the unusual sight could be. Some are convinced it is an alien spacecraft, while others dismiss it as a simple trick of the light. The amateur photographer said: 'I was walking after work and decided to take some photos. It was a very cold and windy and there was a cloudy sky. 'It was the first time I've taken pictures of the Houses of Parliament at night and I was not dissapointed by the result. 'I took five or six pictures but when I took the last one I got a strange feeling. I looked again and again and couldn't believe my eyes. I didn't know what the strange light was. Welcome to earth: The photo mirrors a famous scene featuring the White House from Independence Day . 'I saw it when I viewed my picture. I can't explain it. I showed the picture to my friend and he said it looked like a scene from Independence Day. It was very unexpected. 'It's a strange light with a form I can't really describe, it looks like a UFO. I always think miracles can happen.' Mr Garlesteanu's spot follows a spate UFO sightings over Bucharest. In January, a triangle UFO formation of three unexplained lights in the sky above the city were captured on video. Also last month, another person reported sighting a large black disc, believed to have a four miles diameter, with multiple lights above Bucharest. The spotter describes seeing the UFO at 2.30am with a group of friends, which 'sat still for four minutes with lights on'. They describe seeing more lights turning on 'rapidly in a sequence and after few seconds it just went up, turning the whole disc and disappeared in a fraction of a second to the east side of the city'.","Photographer describes getting a strange feeling as he took the picture .

"Six seniors at a Long Island high school are under investigation and facing disciplinary action after posting a photo of them wearing t-shirts saying 'RAPE?'. The students from Commack High School posed for the image next to the athletics track yesterday after their annual class picture and uploaded it to Twitter. It was then spotted by angry students online who then started to share the photo on social media. First image: The students from Commack High School posed for the image next to the athletics track after their annual class picture. It was then posted on Twitter and spotted by fellow students . The first image shows five of the students in a line, with the word written in gold letters, followed by a question mark. In the second image, the question mark is replaced with a period while another student joins the pose. He is seen lying on the floor with his hands tied together and tape covering his mouth. Student Danielle DiFrancisco told ABC News: 'When they showed me the picture, I thought 'this is ridiculous, I go to this school, and I've been here for three years. These kids are older than me - have some respect!'' says , 'It doesn't just affect them, it affects the whole school, too.' Senior Ali Salam knows the students who posted the picture. He told the station: 'They were actually doing it off a book called The Fault in Our Stars - on the cover it says ""OK"" with a question mark, and then ""OK"" underneath it with a period. Controversial: In the second image, the question mark is replaced with a period and another student is also seen lying on the ground with his hands and mouth tied up . 'And that's what they're using to defend themselves, but it's still pretty wrong.' In a statement, school administrators said the students 'showed an inexcusable lack of judgment,' and have now launched a 'comprehensive investigation to determine the full scope of this matter and whether or not this was an isolated incident.' They added: 'We deeply regret the turmoil caused by the actions of these students and know that it does not reflect the values of the rest of Commack High School or the Commack community.' The students in the photo were reportedly in school on Friday. The group's photos come in the wake of high-profile high school rape cases that have involved the use of Twitter. During the Steubenville Rape Case in 2012, the victim's attackers posted the images on social media. Then, star football players Trent Mays, 16, and Ma’lik Richmond, 17, were found guilty of raping a drunk 16-year-old girl in a night of back to back house parties in August last year as a result.

"Remarkable new images have emerged showing the haunting beauty of a mysterious Siberian crater. The photographs were released as it was revealed scientists are monitoring satellite images to check for other similar holes in northern Russia in a desperate attempt to understand their origin. And, for the first time, Siberian scientists have used climbing gear to reach a frozen lake 34ft (10.5 metres) deep in the hole to carry out tests. Scroll down for video . When frozen, the accessible parts of crater (pictured from below) are around 54ft (16.5 metres) deep, and scientists captured these latest remarkable images by using climbing gear to reach a frozen lake 34ft (10.5 metres) at the bottom. It is thought the crater was formed when heating from underground fissures released gas hydrates causing the dramatic blowout . When this crater - on the northern Yamal Peninsula - was discovered earlier this year, theories ranged from a man-made hoax, to aliens, a meteorite, and even a stray missile from Vladimir Putin's military. One of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo. This is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land. When the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled. The other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground. The . Yamal Peninsula is rich in natural gas, and a mixture of water, salt and gas could result in . an explosion. The other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite, but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters. These have each been discounted, and the favoured explanation is that heating from underground fissures combined to release gas hydrates causing the dramatic blowout on the surface in July. Scientists claim the phenomenon may be similar to eruptions underwater in the Atlantic Ocean causing the Bermuda Triangle. Another popular theory is that the feature is a 'pingo'. This is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts. The Siberian Times revealed today that space images are now to be examined for other craters in the north of Russia, where three others have been found so far. Because the ground is now frozen, the experts were, for the first time, able to climb inside the large chasm. Attempts to reach the base of the crater in summer ended in failure. Leader of the new mission, Vladimir Pushkarev, director of the Russian Centre of Arctic Exploration, said: ‘We managed to go down into the funnel; all was successful. ‘We used climbing equipment, and it is easier to do this in winter, than in summer, with the ground now hard. ‘We took all the probes we planned, and made measurements. Now scientists need time to process all the data and only then can they draw conclusions.’ When frozen, the accessible parts of the crater are around 54ft (16.5 metres) deep, not including an ‘earthen rampart’ formed during the blowout. Estimates suggested the hole was up to 200ft deep (61 metres) deep in warmer weather. Because the ground is now frozen, the experts were able to climb inside the large chasm (pictured) Attempts to reach the base of the crater in summer ended in failure. Leader of the mission, Vladimir Pushkarev said: ‘We took all the probes, and made measurements.

When the crater (pictured) was discovered earlier this year, theories ranged from a man-made hoax to aliens, a meteorite, and even a stray missile from Vladimir Putin's military. These have all since been discounted and investigations continues into the strange hole . Another popular theory is that the feature is a 'pingo'. This is a large chunk of ice located underground that creates a hole when it melts . ‘The depth of the mini-lake is about [34ft] 10.5 metres, but it can be deeper. We are waiting for the exact information from readings taken by the scientists,’ said Mr Pushkarev. The research into the largest of known holes - all recently formed - in northern Siberia was initiated by the Russian Centre of Arctic Exploration, and included leading Russian experts from a number of institutes. ‘They did radiolocation tests at a depth of 200 metres, took probes of ice, ground, gases, and air,' Mr Pushkarev said. ‘Now they have all gone back to their institutes and laboratories and will work on the material. ‘The next stage is processing all of the gathered information. ‘Then we plan to explore the surrounding area, comparing images from space, and even those taken in the 1980s, to understand if there are - or were - some similar objects.’ Russian scientist Igor Yeltsov, the deputy head of the Trofimuk Institute, earlier suggested the phenomenon could be similar to the Bermuda Traiangle. ‘There is a version that the Bermuda Triangle is a consequence of gas hydrate reactions,’ he said. ‘They start to actively decompose with methane ice turning into gas. 'It happens in an avalanche-like way, like a nuclear reaction, producing huge amounts of gas. ‘That makes the ocean heat up and ships sink in its waters mixed with a huge proportion of gas.’ The impact on the atmosphere of the rising gas makes it ‘extremely turbulent and leads to aircraft crashes’. The so-called Bermuda Triangle stretches from the British Overseas Territory in the North Atlantic Ocean to the Florida coast, to Puerto Rico. However, the leader of the latest expedition was cautious. ‘I have heard about this idea of a phenomenon like the Bermuda Triangle, but I repeat, our scientists need to work on their materials first and only then draw some definite conclusions. 'At the moment we do not have enough information,’ said Mr Pushkarev. Mr Pushkarev is a climber, rescuer and explorer who led the experts to the scene in temperatures of minus 11ºC (51ºF). ‘We have not worked with other funnels yet. We do plan to do this, but first of all we need to understand completely the nature of this funnel. Experts from the Russian Centre of Arctic Exploration carried out radiolocation tests in the crater, took probes of ice (pictured), ground, gases, and air. They are now planning to explore the surrounding area and compare images from space to establish if they are similar objects . The crater is located 27km (17 miles) from the Bovanenkovo gas field in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, an area better known for reindeer hunting, in the far north of Siberia. It has a diameter of 98ft (30 metres) and is the largest of three known craters in the Russian region (marked) The name Yamal means 'the end of the world', which is also a description applied to the Bermuda Triangle for those lost on boats and planes. A climber descending into the crater is picture . ‘We need to study it well to understand with what should we compare the other funnels. ‘We need some model to compare other funnels with, to say - yes, they are similar or no, they are two different things.’ He added: ‘We still do not see anything dangerous which can be connected with the sudden appearance of such holes. TheYamal Peninsula is rich in natural gas, with its resources extensively tapped by Russia, and a mixture of water, salt and gas could have resulted in an explosion. Experts added there might be another factor that could have provoked the air clap. Each of the factors added up and gas exploded, leading to the crater . The expedition (pictured) was carried out in temperatures of minus 11ºC (51ºF). The crater is located on the intersection of two tectonic faults, and although the Yamal peninsula is 'seismically quiet', the experts said the area where the crater is, is quite active . Gas hydrates are ice-like forms of water containing gas molecules, notably methane. They exist in permafrost regions such as northern Siberia, but also under the oceans in some parts of the world. ‘It turned out that there are gas hydrates both in the deep layer which on peninsula is several hundred metres down, and on the layer close to the surface,’ said Vladimir Potapov, a Fellow of the Institute of Petroleum Geology and Geophysics in Novosibirsk, before the latest expedition. ‘There might be another factor, or factors, that could have provoked the air clap. ‘But certainly we need to study this phenomenon, because it can turn out that we should be afraid of them.’ Gas hydrates are ice-like forms of water containing gas molecules, notably methane. They exist in permafrost regions such as northern Siberia, but also under the oceans in some parts of the world. ‘The main element - and this is our working theory to explain the Yamal crater - was a release of gas hydrates. ‘It turned out that there are gas hydrates both in the deep layer, which on the peninsula is several hundred metres down, and on the layer close to the surface,’ said Vladimir Potapov, a Fellow of the Institute of Petroleum Geology and Geophysics in Novosibirsk, before the latest expedition. ‘There might be another factor, or factors, that could have provoked the air clap. 'Each of the factors added up and gas exploded, leading to appearance of the crater.’ He stressed: ‘The crater is located on the intersection of two tectonic faults. 'Yamal peninsula is seismically quiet, yet the area of the crater we looked into has quite an active tectonic life. That means that the temperature there was higher than usual.’ The name Yamal means 'the end of the world', which is also a description applied to the Bermuda Triangle for those lost on boats and planes.

"Tragic: Imam Sheik Abdullah was killed during an attack carried out against a mosque with a petrol bomb in Anderlecht . A Belgian mosque leader was killed last night as he tried to save a worshipper set alight in a brutal petrol bomb attack. Father-of-four Abdullah Dadou, 46, died from smoke inhalation after a man burst into a Shiite mosque in the Brussels suburb of Anderlecht at 7pm. Witnesses said the man, who had no ID . papers, turned up at the building, pulled out a knife and axe, poured . petrol over the floor and then set it alight. He then shouted Sunni slogans - sparking speculation that the attack was linked to tensions between them and the Shiites. Worshippers detained him and locked him in a room before he was arrested. But Adbullah failed to escape, and remained trapped in the blaze. The man was arrested - a Muslim who said he was born in 1978. No other . people are being sought in connection with the attack, which also injured one other person. As investigators sought to determine whether the arson attack was an isolated incident or a deliberate assault on the Shiite community, Belgium's Interior Minister Joelle Milquet suggested inter-religious strife may be to blame. She said: 'This person went in (the mosque) hurling statements linked to the Syrian conflict. It appears to be a problem between Sunnis and Shiites. 'Belgium will not tolerate this type of act and the importing of this type of conflict on its territory.' Islam's Sunni and Shiite movements have fuelled violence in several Muslim countries, from Iraq to Yemen and Pakistan. Scroll down for video... Ruined: The entrance of the Mosque which was set on fire last night . Destroyed: The Mosque is a shadow of its former self (left) as a lone sandal sits on the destroyed floor (right) The area around the Brussels mosque, one of four Shiite centres of worship in the city's overwhelming majority Sunni Muslim community, has a large immigrant Muslim population. Azzedine Laghmich, an official at the mosque, said the attacker was 'a Salafist', who sprayed petrol inside the mosque before setting it alight and shouting Sunni slogans on his way out - cries related to the conflict in Syria. Isabelle Praile, another senior official in Belgium's Muslim community, said the mosque 'had already been placed under police protection several years ago,' because of threats from members of the ultra-conservative Salafist movement. More than 100 men gathered near the Rida mosque after the fire, shouting Shiite slogans behind a police tape as some prayed and others hugged or cried over the death of imam Abdallah Dadou, a 46-year-old father-of-four. Grief: Women react outside of a Shi'ite mosque in Brussels on following an arson attack in which the local Imam died of suffocation in a room inside . Investigation: Police and members of a forensics team stand at the entrance to a Mosque following petrol bomb attack in Brussels . 'I brought my eight-year-old son here with me so that he can see blind hate, what it can do,' said Ismael Ben Mohammad, 40. The mayor of the city's Anderlecht ward, Gaetan Van Goidsenhoven, appealed for calm at an overnight press conference, saying it was 'not only necessary to live side-by-side, but also to allow justice and the police to do their work.' The imam was described by worshipper Abdel Adouzeyneb, a 39-year-old real estate agent, as 'a person who was loved by everybody -- he was open, well integrated, smiling and happy.' Anger: Women mourn outside of the  mosque following the arson attack. One man has been arrested in connection with the attack . Anxious: People wait in the street after the petrol bomb attack. A witness saw a man setting fire to the mosque in Anderlecht, killing the mosque's imam Sheik Abdullah and injuring another person. Prosecutor Jean-Marc Meilleur said the arson suspect was detained by police after people inside locked him inside the mosque. 'At the moment, there is only one suspect,' Meilleur said, adding that it was too soon to know whether it was a one-man attack or a wider plot. The last time an imam was targeted in Brussels was in 1989 when Saudi-born Abdullah Muhammad al-Ahdal was shot dead. He served as imam in the Grand Mosque of Brussels and was killed on March of that year by an armed man inside the mosque. His killing was claimed by a small pro-Iranian group in Lebanon who accused him of being too moderate and of having rejected the death fatwa slapped on writer Salman Rushdie.

"An Iraqi policeman has been hailed a hero after throwing his arms around a suicide bomber to shield others from the blast. The bomber struck in Khales, northeast of Baghdad, killing five people and wounding 10 on a Shia pilgrimage, a police colonel and a doctor said. But the toll would almost certainly have been higher were it not for the officer's selfless actions, police said. Shia pilgrims march to Karbala for Arbaeen in Baghdad's southern district of Dora. A police officer saved the lives of dozens of pilgrims after throwing himself on a suicide bomber in the latest of a series of attacks . The police hero was named as Ayyub Khalaf, 34, who was married and had two children, aged six and nine. 'Ayyub was martyred while defending pilgrims,' his friend Saad Naim said. 'His name will be an eternal symbol because he saved the lives of dozens of innocents. We will take revenge on the Al-Qaeda terrorist organisation,' he added. Khalaf's cousin Hassan Jassem also praised his actions. 'My cousin Ayyub Khalaf stood in the face of terrorism as he saved... pilgrims from death,' Jassem said. 'We are proud of him.' And Jaafar Khamis, one of Khalaf's colleagues in the police, commended the bravery of his friend. 'Ayyub was my friend since the school days. He was a brave man who loved his country and sacrificed himself for it,' he said. 'I . am proud of him, because he faced terrorism and was able to silence the . voice of infidelity and injustice by sacrificing his body and soul.' Targeted: An Iraqi man cleans the site of a suicide bombing in Baghdad's southern district of Dora . British forces were involved in training up police officers in the years following the fall of Saddam Hussein, but it not known if Mr Khalaf was among them. A spokesman for the MoD said: 'UK forces were involved in training Iraqi Security Forces in Basrah up until mid-2009 so, if this individual had moved around, it is possible we could have been involved in his training.' He said most of the Iraqi Security Force training in the Baghdad area was conducted by US forces. The Khales bombing on Wednesday was the latest in a series of attacks targeting Shiite pilgrims. Two in Baghdad province killed at least eight pilgrims on Tuesday, and two car bombings took the lives of at least 24 on Monday. Hundreds . of thousands of people, many of them on foot, make pilgrimages to the . holy city of Karbala during the 40 days after the annual commemoration . marking the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, known to Shiites . as Imam Hussein. The 40th day, known as Arbaeen, falls on December 23 this year. Under siege: Violence has reached a level this year not seen since 2008, when Iraq was just emerging from a period of brutal sectarian killings . Sunni militants, including those linked to Al-Qaeda, frequently target members of Iraq's Shiite majority, whom they consider to be apostates. The United Nations envoy to Iraq issued a statement on Wednesday sharply criticising attacks on pilgrims. 'Such terrorist acts are particularly despicable and unjustifiable, all the more so since practising religious duties is revered in all various faiths,' Nickolay Mladenov said in the statement. Also on Wednesday, a roadside bomb in the northern city of Mosul killed two people and wounded two others, and gunmen killed two soldiers and wounded two in an attack on a checkpoint, officials said. Violence has reached a level this year not seen since 2008, when Iraq was just emerging from a period of brutal sectarian killings. More people were killed in the first eight days of this month than in all of December last year. And more than 6,550 people have been killed since the beginning of 2013, according to AFP figures based on security and medical sources. Experts say that widespread discontent among Iraq's minority Sunni Arab community is a major factor fuelling the surge in unrest. The civil war in neighbouring Syria, which has bolstered extremist groups, has also played a role. While the government has made some concessions aimed at placating Sunni Arabs, including freeing prisoners and raising the salaries of anti-Al-Qaeda fighters, underlying issues remain unaddressed.","Bomber struck in town north of Baghdad, killing five and wounding 10 .

"The Indian military has spent six months investigating 'Chinese spy drones' violating its air space - only to discover they were in fact Jupiter and Venus. The planets were apparently mistaken for unidentified flying 'drones' after repeated sightings in the skies above eastern Ladakh near the disputed Himalayan border area between India and China. The military documented 155 air violations of the border - known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC) which India shares with China - by 'unidentified flying objects' between April 2012 and February 2013. With tensions increasing between the two countries, India feared that China was making nocturnal sorties across the border. Sightings: The Indian military spotted 155 air violations above Ladakh, pictured, near the Indian-Chinese disputed border, by unidentified 'flying objects . Two astronomers from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, were tasked with discovering what exactly the army had been witnessing. Astronomer Tushar Prabhu told the Calcutta-based Telegraph: 'Our task was to determine whether these unidentified objects were celestial or terrestrial.' The astronomers identified the two planets from their movements across the sky in relation to the stars. The Telegraph suggested the soldiers who spotted the 'drones' ought to be let off lightly for the mix-up as planets can appear much brighter as a result of the different atmosphere at altitude and the increased use of surveillance drones by both sides. But the suspicions will have done nothing to help ease Indian-Chinese bilateral relationships which is already on tenterhooks with India frequently accusing its neighbour of making incursions onto its territory. The situation reached a heated three-week-long stand-off in April after Chinese troops were accused of setting up a camp on the Indian side of the LAC boundary. Growing tensions: Chinese troops ventured across the Line of Actual Control and 19km inside Indian territory in the Depsang valley near Daulat Beg Oldi in April . Indian officials have reported several minor incursions since then, including three in the past week, when Chinese troops entered the Indian side in the Leh region of northern India adjacent to southwestern China. India and China have separately held 16 rounds of talks since 2003 to resolve their border dispute, without making much progress. China claims around 90,000 square kilometers (35,000 square miles) of land in India's northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, while India says China is occupying 38,000 square kilometers (15,000 square miles) of territory on the Aksai Chin plateau in the western Himalayas. The two nations face tensions in other areas as well. China is a longtime ally and weapons supplier to Pakistan, India's bitter rival. The presence in India of the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama and the self-declared Tibetan government-in-exile irks Beijing. China is also suspicious of New Delhi's growing ties with the United States. Despite the tensions, trade between India and China has soared, with China becoming India's biggest trading partner. Two-way trade jumped from $5 billion in 2002 to nearly $75 billion in 2011, but declined slightly last year because of global economic conditions. India is concerned, however, that trade remains heavily skewed in China's favor.","Military recorded 155 air violations above the disputed Himalayan border it shares with China between April 2012 and February 2013 .

"Toyota has been forced to recall 885,000 cars to fix a problem which could see drivers' airbags activated at random. One of the models which needs repair is the Camry, which is the best selling car in the United States, having already sold 318,990 cars so far this year. The fault is caused by a water leak in the air conditioning unit which could cause water to seep into other parts of the car causing circuits to short and unexpected malfunctions to occur. Popular: The Toyota Camry, above, is America's most popular car. Almost 319,000 have been sold in the US this year but its is one of Toyota's models that have now been recalled . Toyota said that the airbag control module is one area which could be affected with the safety device becoming 'disabled or could inadvertently deploy'. In a few cases the power steering function could be disabled, they said. As well as Camrys made in the last two years, any models of the Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza which were made in 2012 and 2013 are also being recalled. Of the massive number which need fixing, 847,000 are in North America with the in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. According to Toyota, they have received news of two minor injuries being caused by the faults, but there have been no crashes due to the error as yet. Sporty: More than 50,000 versions of the Toyota Avalon have been sold in the USA this year. Those which were made in 2012/13 have been recalled . Problematic: The auto manufacturer has recalled Camrys, Venzas (pictured) and Avalons, as well as their hybrid counterparts, in the U.S. that were built from 2012 onwards . The Japanese car company have already issued two major recalls in recent months, asking for the return of around around 2.2 million vehicles. In September, the company called back around 780,000 Lexus and Rav4 models. That was a second recall of the same models after an initial call back in 2012 did not fix problems with the cars suspension systems.

The company have had to issue recalls for more than 2 million cars in the past in recent weeks . Last month, they also recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US after a problem with the gear box was discovered. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. A statement on the car maker's American site, said: 'Owners of the involved vehicles will be notified by first class mail to return their vehicles to a Toyota dealer for the repair.'

"Future: Footballer Ched Evans, pictured with girlfriend Natasha Massey, is set to be offered a £5,000-a-week deal with former club Sheffield United . Rapist footballer Ched Evans is set to be offered a two-year contract by his former club worth more than £500,000, it has been claimed. Evans, an international striker for Wales, was released from Wymott prison yesterday having served half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old girl in his home town of Rhyl. But it seems the 25-year-old might now get his career on track - just one day after his pre-dawn release from jail. A source told The Sun that the 25-year-old had been offered a deal, worth £5,000-a-week, and was expected to sign it. The source said: 'Sheffield United are the only club to have made him an offer and have been waiting for him to be released before announcing it. 'He's going to be loyal to them because the club's stuck by him.' It is understood that as a condition of the contract, Evans - who continued to maintain his claims of 'absolute innocence' of rape yesterday - must make a public apology. The source added that, despite considering himself an innocent man, the footballer will apologise as 'he knows saying sorry will help his public image'. If it goes through, the deal would mark a significant paycut for the footballer, whose last contract with the League One club, which expired in June, was worth £20,000-a-week. And it could see the player return to training at the Yorkshire club as early as next week, according to The Sun. Sheffield United today issued a statement that said the club had not offered Evans a formal contract. The revelation came as it emerged that fans who are caught chanting songs during matches that 'celebrate' Evans' crime or ridicule his victim will face serious punishment. If reference is made to his crime, in particular the name of his victim, then police would act against any person involved. Revealing the name of a rape victim is a criminal offence. The Football Association told the Daily Mirror: 'If supporters chant songs that praise the offender or ridicule, or possibly identify the victim, the FA will contact the club to discuss what measures they can take to prevent this. 'These include messaging supporters through local media or directly through the club's communication channels.' Fans can be banned for life from football clubs if they use foul, abusive or racist language at matches. Earlier this week, Sheffield United claimed publicly that they were still wrestling with the moral dilemma of having a convicted rapist in their team. Their co-chairman, Jim Phipps, said that they were 'puzzling' through the problem and said that they would not necessarily reach a decision any time soon. While their manager Nigel Clough said this week that he would leave the decision to his employers. New deal: The striker, who scored 48 goals in 113 games for Sheffield United before he was jailed, could begin training with the Yorkshire club as early as next week, according to a report in The Sun . Today, Sheffield United's co-Chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps released a brief, joint statement. It said: 'Sheffield United has become aware of speculative media coverage concerning the immediate future of its former player Ched Evans. 'An article in The Sun today that Sheffield United has offered a contract to former player Ched Evans is false and damaging to the Club. 'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans.' Secrecy: Earlier this week a club spokesman refused to comment on the fact they continued to pay Evans's £20,000-a-week wages for more than three months after he was jailed. Above, Evans with girlfriend Natasha . The Club offered no further comment. Earlier this week a club spokesman refused to comment on the fact they continued to pay Evans's £20,000-a-week wages for more than three months after he was jailed. The club released him at the end of a contract that expired on June 30, but they chose not to sack him. Judy Finnigan sparked fury during her debut as a panellist on Loose Women this week when she suggested Evans should be allowed to return to his club because the victim was 'drunk' and the rape was 'unpleasant' but 'not violent'. Today, the veteran broadcaster said that she has horrified by the online backlash suffered by her husband, daughter and herself. Writing in the Daily Express, Ms Finnigan said that 'the stuff the debased and degenerate human beings unleashed' against her 27-year-old daughter Chloe 'astonished and frightened her'. She said that rape threats were made against her and her daughter. Ms Finnigan added that she hoped 'there is a special place in hell reserved for trolls'. The striker had a successful career with Sheffield United before he was jailed, scoring 48 goals in 113 games. Evans, who has been capped 13 times by Wales, cost £3million when Sheffield United bought him from Manchester City in July 2009. The club's manager and co-owner Kevin McCabe visited Evans in jail in April, reportedly to invite him back to training on his release. And there has been a suggestion dialogue continued throughout his imprisonment between Evans's family and his representatives and the club. Wales boss Chris Coleman has said he would have to look at Evans' selection 'in great detail' with Football Association of Wales (FAW) officials 'because of the magnitude of the situation'. Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, a Sheffield MP, warned the football club against re-employing a convicted rapist and Richard Caborn added his voice to the debate. Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg warned club bosses they cannot 'wish away' the rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans. On the official Ched Evans website, his supporters insist he is a role model who will 'make a personal and profound statement by video' next week. Evans was jailed for five years in 2012 after being convicted of raping a drunken 19-year-old after a former team-mate invited her back to a hotel room in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales. Release: News of the deal comes just over 24 hours after Evans was released from jail before dawn yesterday, pictured above. It is understood that he needs to release a public apology as part of the agreement . He admitted having sex with her, but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident. Last night, an online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted more than 150,000 signatures. The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to 'refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player'. Yesterday, a steady stream of well-wishers called at his family home ahead of an expected celebration, with relatives having flown in from all over the world for the reunion. His girlfriend Natasha Masssey, who has been the victim of Twitter trolls for choosing to stay with the football player, was also expected to attend. An appeal against Evans' conviction was rejected in 2012. Yesterday his family said they were confident an application to the Criminal Cases Review Committee for a second appeal would succeed.","Ched Evans set to be offered £5,000-a-week contract with Sheffield United .

"It is a fitting farewell from the astronaut who has become a global online star. Astronaut Chris Hadfield has recorded a cover of David Bowie's Space Oddity while floating weightless aboard the International Space Station. The Canadian is shown playing an acoustic guitar and singing Bowie's classic song from 1969 as a farewell message to Hadfield's Twitter fans as he astronaut prepares to return to Earth on Tuesday as his five-month mission as commander of the station comes to . an end. Scroll down to video . Commander Chris Hadfield records a cover version of David Bowie's 1969 Space Oddity as a farewell message to Twitter fans. Hadfield has been aboard the International Space Station since December and is due to return to Earth on Tuesday. He has posted stunning photos of space during his five-month stint, and recorded videos showing how astronauts brush their teeth and how to throw up in space . The music video cover of David Bowie's Space Oddity shows Commander Chris Hadfield in various locations around the International Space Station. Hadfield recorded the video as a farewell message before he returns to Earth on Tuesday. When Hadfield tweeted the video, David Bowie replied with: 'Hallo Spaceboy' Commander Hadfield has built up more than 790,000 followers on Twitter by posting photographs of the Earth from space. The astronaut wrote on Twitter: 'With deference to the genius of David . Bowie, here's Space Oddity, recorded on Station. A last glimpse of the . World.' David Bowie then replied with: 'Hallo Spaceboy.' Chris' fellow Canadian, Emm Gryner, who was a part of Bowie's live band in 1999 and 2000 said on her blog: . 'I came up with a piano part. 'I then enlisted my friend, producer and fellow Canadian Joe Corcoran to take my piano idea and Chris' vocal and blow it up into a fully produced song. 'We also incorporated into the track ambient space station noises which Chris had put on his Soundcloud. 'I was mostly blown away by how pure and earnest Chris' singing is on this track. 'And voila! An astronaut sings Space Oddity in space! I was so honoured to be asked to be a part of this. 'You wouldn't get too many chances to make a recording like this and not only that, to make music with someone who - through his vibrant communications with kids in schools to his breathtaking photos to his always patient and good-humoured demeanor - has done more for science and space than anyone else this generation. David Bowie released the original Space Oddity song in 1969, taken from the album of the same name. The album was originally called David Bowie, yet when it was re-released in 1972 it was renamed Space Oddity because of the popularity of the single. The song won the 1969 Ivor Novello Award for Originality . 'Planet earth IS blue, and there's nothing left for Chris Hadfield to do. Right. Safe travels home Commander!' The original Space Oddity was released in 1969, taken from the album of the same name. The album was originally called David Bowie, but was changed to Space Oddity in 1972 upon its re-release. The song won the 1969 Ivor Novello Award for Originality. Before going into orbit, Commander Hadfield said playing music was important . in taking care of the 'psychological side' of living in space. In February he sent a message from space to veteran wildlife broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. The astronaut asked: 'If you had an evening to spend here on the space station, how would you spend it?' Sir David replied: 'I'd just sit and watch the Earth go by - it's a perspective I've never had.' During his time on the Space Station, Hadfield has also posted videos on how to throw up in space, how astronauts brush their teet, and how to make a peanut butter sandwich. Last week, the team on board the International Space Station took a breathtaking image of the sun beginning to rise over the South Pacific Ocean. The incredible image was captured by the crew on the station passed a few hundred miles east of Easter Island. It shows the brightness of the sun and the incredible blue of the atmosphere, and is the latest in a stunning series of pictures captured from the orbiting outpost. The sun is about to come up over the South Pacific Ocean in this colorful scene photographed by one of the Expedition 35 crew members aboard the Earth-orbiting International Space Station .

Although Nasa has not revealed who took the picture, Canadian Chris Hadfield who has gained a cult following on Twitter for his images of the Earth from space is thought to be a front-runner. He is set to return to Earth later this month, and has tweeted a series of videos and pictures showing everything from how to cry in space to how astronauts cook. A previous shot, which bears . striking resemblance to the beginning of the opening credits of a . Universal film, was posted last week. The . image was shot over southwestern America and will be one of Hadfield's . last tweets from space after he announced that his return to earth will . commence later this month.

Mirror image: The image bears striking resemblance to the start of the iconic opening sequence of a Universal film . Commander of the International Space Station, Chris has gained an army of followers on Facebook and Twitter with his daily updates from space which feature beautiful pictures and news on the progress of the various missions he and his colleagues carry out. Hadfield has been taking the Twitterverse by storm from aboard the ISS, which orbits the Earth at 8km a second, since he arrived back on December 21. The collection of images he has posted from space feature locations as diverse as San Francisco's glittering lights and breathtaking cloud formations over Africa. He has also captured large parts of the UK from space including Manchester, London and Bournemouth. But his latest shot of the US at dawn is perhaps his best post yet. Snapper: The stunning image of the Earth at dawn was the latest picture from space captured by Commander of the International Space Station Chris Hadfield . Beautiful: Chris Hadfield has posted dozens of pictures from space online since he arrived at the ISS in December including this taken over Africa . Bright lights: As well as aerial shots from all over the Earth, Commander Hadfield has taken pictures of much of the UK. This image shows Birmingham at night . Unmistakable: The Thames can be clearly seen snaking its was through the giant urban sprawl of London in this picture . The astronaut, who has also posted a variety of amusing videos showing what it is like to shave, vomit and brush your teeth in space, uses a long lens camera to capture the stunning detail of the Earth. Among his favourite places to photograph is the Sahara in Africa and he explains that he waits until the sun is directly over the desert to get the best shot. He says: 'The beauty of space station, though, is if it's not here this time, tomorrow it might be, or maybe a month from now. 'There's not a race to get a picture. You can be patient, like a hunter.' He says that it’s not Instagram, it’s 'Space-a-gram' and that the key steps are: 'Focus, frame, and fire'. Ferry cross the Mersey: Among Commander Hadfield's images taken in space and posted online is this night time shot of Liverpool . Seaside shot: Most of Commander Hadfield's pictures of the UK were taken at night, but this one shows the beautiful blue sea surrounding the coast of Bournemouth in Hampshire . Emerald Isle: The silhouettes of Ireland and Wales were captured in this beautiful picture taken from the ISS by Commander Hadfield . Green green grass: It may look tiny, but this expanse of UK land encompasses Exeter and Cornwall all the way to Land's End . He added: 'We orbit 400km above the earth, so if you want to get a good detailed picture of something you need a long lens. I have one velcroed to the wall.’ Chris uses a special setting on his camera to deal with the bright glare of light from the Earth against the pitch black backdrop of space. He takes pictures in as high a resolution as possible, so his camera's memory card gets full very quickly. The first Canadian to walk in space, Commander Hadfield, 53, a former air force fighter pilot, has previously flown two Space Shuttle missions in 1995 and 2001. Hadfield has amassed 226,000 fans on Facebook and 740,000 followers on Twitter. He announced that his 'fiery fall' to earth will commence on May 13 after the arrival of a new Russian commander.

"Most parents can’t wait to fill their Facebook pages with endless snaps of their newborn baby or tiny toddler. And now taking pictures of your child has never been easier, thanks to the new Baby Selfie app created by software developer and doting father Matthew Pegula. Attracting your baby’s attention with rattling sounds you can custom yourself, and animal pictures, once the smartphone is picked up and touch detected, it takes the picture in colour and stores it on your phone. Software developer Matthew Pegula used his six-month-old daughter (left) as the 'face' of his Baby Selfie smartphone app (pictured here) Matthew Pegula, pictured here with his baby daughter, created the Baby Selfie app . Pegula, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a software developer and founder of photo sharing app Hitchedpic, used his six-month-old daughter as the face of Baby Selfie. He tells Charlotte Lytton of The Daily Beast that he wanted to facilitate a . 'mash up' of his roles at work and home by creating the app. 'Baby . Selfie started out as a much more ambitious project that was going to . try to determine when a baby was smiling, and report back to parents . what the baby liked,' he says. The Baby Selfie app attracts the baby with sounds and pictures, then automatically snaps and stores a photo . 'But as I was working on that, the much . simpler idea of Baby Selfie arose, and seemed like a good starting point . to gauge interest.' The . app, which costs 60p to download to any Smartphone with a front-facing . camera, describes itself as ‘peek-a-boo with a camera twist' and uses customisable drawings and fun . sounds to grab your baby's attention and 'surprise' them. The images and sounds capture the baby’s reaction, producing what Pegula says will be a 'unique, unexpected photo that you’ll love to . share.’ Using rattling sounds, which you can custom design using the smartphone’s settings, animated pictures of owls, puppies and other animals will appear to attract the baby’s attention. Once they touch the screen, the camera identifies where your baby is and takes a quick snap. A message then pops up on your homescreen so you know how many photos were taken, and where they are stored (Baby Selfie automatically saves them to your phone’s gallery). Pegula told the Washington Post that he expected some ‘eye-rolling’ from cynics. 'Hopefully people realise it’s all in good fun and can provide parents with some fun photos,' he said. 'I think it’s good because it engages parents and babies with the screen, it’s not really something where you can park your kid in front of it and walk away.' In an age where we are seemingly obsessed by selfies (and pet selfies, butt selfies, exercise selfies...), it was only a matter of time before the Baby Selfie was invented. But Pegula is quick to point out that the app is more of a hobby for him than a solid investment. 'No one is getting rich off of Baby Selfie,' he told The Daily Beast. 'We've sold enough to buy my daughter a box or two of Pampers so far, so I'm happy with the results of my little weekend project.' Baby Selfie may be the first tool for photo-loving youngsters, but it's just part of the growing trend of apps to help ease pregnancy and parenthood. Bellabeat Global, . a 'pregnancy social platform,' is currently being developed in the US . and will allow users to share their baby's heartbeat. Meanwhile Oogababy . the self-proclaimed 'Instagram for babies,' allows parents to chart . everything from new pictures to their child's weight, height and head . circumference.","Matthew Pegula, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, created the 'Baby Selfie' app .

"Patients are being put at risk because of a ‘shocking’ shortage of hospital beds, say experts. Britain has the second lowest number of hospital beds per head of population among 23 European countries after removing more than 50,000 in the last decade alone. An international report has found that France has more than twice the number of beds per head, while Germany has almost three times as many. The UK has the second lowest number of hospital beds per head of population according to a new report by the OECD compared to 23 European nations . Only Sweden – which has invested strongly in community care – has fewer hospital beds per head, says the study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Britain’s ratio is only slightly better than China’s. The OECD, which represents industrialised nations, compared countries based on how many hospital beds they had per 1,000 people in 2011 – the most recent year for which figures are available. The UK came 29th out of the 40 countries surveyed or 22nd out of the 23 European countries on the list. Britain’s figure was 2.95 beds per 1,000 people – compared with 6.37 in France, 8.27 in Germany and 13.4 in Japan. The ratio was far lower than in former Communist countries such as Russia (9.37 beds per 1,000 people) and Poland (6.55)  – and lower than the OECD average of 4.83. In Europe, only Sweden was lower than the UK, with a ratio of 2.71. Some 50,000 hospital beds have been lost from the system over the past decade according to a new OECD report . Britain’s figure was only marginally higher than the ratio in China (2.75) and Turkey (2.54), only a small part of which is in Europe. Experts warn that the bed shortage puts at risk the ‘quality and safety’ of NHS care, with the possibility that waiting times could start to surge. They say elderly people are being forced to endure long waits on trolleys for a bed to become free, while operations are too often cancelled because there us no bed available. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘These figures are shocking. This again shows a system stretched to breaking point. ‘It is consistent with stories we hear such as people being moved from one ward to the other to create bed space, patients being left waiting in corridors for hours, or being cared for on the trolleys while waiting for a bed leading to unsafe and undignified care. ‘There is overcrowding in the wards and corridors, which increases the risk of infections. ‘We have also heard about people being discharged inappropriately – sometimes in the middle of the night – again to free up beds. ‘The figures are indicative of how poorly the UK is prepared for the needs of its ageing population. This situation must change and we cannot put the safety of patients at risk. It is ultimately the patient who suffers.’ Former communist states such as Russia and Poland have a greater number of hospital beds per head of population compared with the UK . The OECD report also reveals potentially dangerous levels of overcrowding on Britain’s wards, putting the NHS at risk of superbug outbreaks. The ‘bed occupancy’ rate – the proportion of hospital beds occupied at any one time – has increased in the past decade. By 2011, it had reached 84 per cent – one percentage point behind the level at which experts say there is a danger of infection being spread because beds are not cleaned often enough. The OECD average is 78 per cent. Figures from the Department of Health show that since then the rate has increased even further to 86 per cent. The number of hospital beds has fallen by 50,000 in England alone since 2001. The reduction is because of budget cuts and a move away from having patients stay overnight in hospital. Last night Chris Hopson, chief executive of the Foundation Trust network, which represents NHS hospitals, said: ‘These figures show that NHS hospitals are operating at near full capacity all the time. ‘There is no slack in the system and trusts are constantly juggling their resources to meet patient demand.’ But a Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Bed numbers are not an accurate marker for good care. The NHS is treating people quicker than ever, and more care is being delivered in the community, so far fewer need to stay overnight – which is often better for patients who prefer being at home. ‘Hospitals are also better managing bed capacity to cope with balancing peaks in demand for routine and emergency care.’","Britian has lost an estimated 50,000 hospital beds over the past decade .

"Ancient graffiti belonging to a relative of Walt Disney has been discovered etched into the wall of Warwick Castle's prison. Experts believe the 372-year-old piece of writing scrawled on the walls by Edward Disney proves how close Mickey Mouse may have come to never being created if Walt Disney's relative had been executed. Edward Disney was captured by the Parliamentarian Army after the Battle of Edgehill during the English Civil War and held prisoner at Warwick Castle in 1642. Ancient graffiti belonging to a relative of Walt Disney has been discovered etched into the wall of Warwick Castle's prison . Experts believe the 372-year-old piece of writing scrawled on the walls by Edward Disney proves how close Mickey Mouse may have come to never being created if Walt Disney's relative had been executed . Historians at Warwick Castle found the evidence of Edward¿s capture last month in a hidden room within the 900-year-old tower . The distant relative of Walt would have awaited execution in the castle’s Guy Tower but because he was a wealthy noble he narrowly avoided being beheaded. Historians at Warwick Castle found the evidence of Edward’s capture last month in a hidden room within the 900-year-old tower. The faded lettering simply states 'Edward Disney 1643' and is etched into an arrow slit within the prison’s living quarters. Experts say proof of the narrow escape shows how hundreds of iconic cartoons such Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Peter Pan and Snow White were almost never brought to life. Sleeping quarters in Guy's Tower at Warwick Castle where Walt Disney's ancestor was held captive during the English Civil War . Living quarters in Guy's Tower. Aaron Manning, head of historical interpretation at the castle, said: 'The name of Edward Disney first appears in a room that was used to house prisoners during the Civil War' If Edward had been executed like most other prisoners the succession of the Disney line would never have existed. Instead, it is believed Edward was sold back to his family for a hefty ransom to raise money for Oliver Cromwell’s Parliamentarians. Aaron Manning, head of historical interpretation at the castle, which was built by William the Conqueror in 1068, said: 'The name of Edward Disney first appears in a room that was used to house prisoners during the Civil War. 'Guy’s Tower is where only the most important visitors and prisoners were housed. 'We had known of one name written into the wall with 1642 next to it but for a while we thought it was a joke. 'But when we opened up the second room last month, which we think is a bedroom, as there was a second name of Edward with 1643 and one other name next to it we realised it was an authentic bit of graffiti. Walt Disney and his wife with Mickey Mouse. Experts say proof of Edward Disney's narrow escape shows how hundreds of iconic cartoons such Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Peter Pan and Snow White were almost never brought to life . 'We have been looking into it and have confirmed it really was Edward by checking records. 'We think he was here at the castle for a least six months to a year. 'The names of other people with Edward in the tower certainly make it a very plausible case. 'In fact, we came across a second piece of graffiti bearing Edward’s name when we invited staff into some of the locked rooms for the first time so that they could have a look round. 'All that we have been able to find out about him for sure is that he was called to muster for the Bishops War under King Charles I and that he is thought to have been one of the Norton Disneys. 'Just think, had Edward been executed then it is a possibility that Mickey Mouse might never have been born. 'It is tremendously exciting when you make a find like this. 'The rooms in which Disney’s name . have been found are securely locked, and will not be opened to the . public in the foreseeable future, allowing for us to carry out more . detective work.” Mr . Manning said that among the recently unearthed etchings on the tower’s . walls included a Hail Mary which dates back to the 1400s. He added: 'It was done about the time of the Hundred Years War and Agincourt. 'We have no indication of who did it, but the engraving was painstakingly done and must have taken a very long time to finish. The distant relative of Walt would have awaited execution in the castle¿s Guy Tower but because he was a wealthy noble he narrowly avoided being beheaded . It is believed Edward was sold back to his family for a hefty ransom to raise money for Oliver Cromwell¿s Parliamentarians . In 1642, civil war broke out between King and parliament and Royalist forces laid siege to Warwick Castle. But its defences had already been enhanced from January to May 1642 in preparation for the attack. The garden walls were raised, barricades mount artillery were constructed and gunpowder and wheels for two cannons were obtained - Royalist forces failed in their attempt to take Warwick. The Battle of Edgehill in 1642 was a bloody clash close to Warwick, which was a stronghold of Oliver Cromwell’s Parliamentarians. Following the first pitched battle of the English Civil War – prisoners were held in Caesar's and Guy's Towers. This was not the first time that royalist prisoners had been held at Warwick. King Edward IV was incarcerated in the castle by Richard Neville in the fifteenth century. During the Second English Civil War prisoners were again held at the castle, including those from the Battle of Worcester in 1651. 'Our best guess is that it was a guest of the Earl or a member of his family. 'This . part of the tower was reserved for important visitors, and whoever did . it didn’t just inscribe the words of the prayer but carved out the stone . around each letter. 'It is a beautiful piece of work. 'The 13th Earl of Warwick, Richard Beauchamp, went out to France to fight for Henry V, and it was he was responsible for the execution of Joan of Arc. 'He was in charge of the occupation in Rouen. 'He put Joan on trial, signed her death warrant and arranged for her to be burned at the stake.' Historical records show Edward had been fighting for ill-fated King Charles I but was captured after defeat at Edgehill. The battle was a bloody clash close to Warwick, which was a stronghold of Oliver Cromwell’s Parliamentarians. It is believed Edward survived the Civil War as a letter dated in the 1660s between him and a lord has been found previously. The first Disney to arrive in England was Robert d’Isigny, from Normandy in France, who came to the country with William the Conqueror in 1066. The family’s surname became Anglicised into Disney and they settled in a Lincolnshire village which was named Norton Disney after them. Walt’s great-grandfather, Arundel Elias Disney, born in Ireland in 1801, was a descendant of Robert d’Isigny and the movie legend spent much of his life trying to trace his family, a recurrent theme in his films. When Walt came to Britain in the late 1940s, trying to piece together his family tree, he headed straight to Norton Disney. Fading photographs taken in the village show Walt absorbed in the search for facts about his family name. He is pictured studying the tombs and gravestones and with the vicar, leafing through reams of ancient church registers.","Writing was scrawled on the prison walls 372 years ago by Edward Disney .

"This teenager is lucky to be alive after he was impaled on a tree branch. Had the branch pierced his stomach just one millimetre the other way, he would have bled to death or be paralysed, doctors said. Declan Clark, 13, slipped while climbing a tree and a branch pierced his bowel in a neighbour’s garden in Rosyth, Dunfermline, Scotland. Lucky to be alive: Declan Clark, 13, made a lucky escape after this tree branch impaled his stomach and burst his bowel when he slipped while climbing the tree . Bleeding profusely, he was rushed to hospital for a three and a half hour operation which saved his life. He is now fitted with an external stoma bag while his bowel recovers. His father John, 44, said: ‘It wasn’t until afterwards that the surgeon explained if the tree had been one millimetre to the left he would have bled to death. ‘If it had went a millimetre the other way he would have been in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. ‘It was a very lucky escape. Hopefully . the bowel will repair itself and at the end he will only have a big scar . from his naval up to his chest.’ Life-saving surgery: Had the branch pierced his stomach one millimetre the other way, Declan could have bled to death or paralysed. Instead, he now has an external stoma bag while his bowel recovers . Miraculously, the branch shot straight back out of Declan’s stomach so none of it was still in his body as he was taken to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy on July 20. Mr Clark, a joiner, said Declan had been playing with other children and jumped off a railing onto the fir tree. He said: ‘It was a million-in-one chance as he must have been at the right angle to go straight down and crush the top of the tree. ‘We reckon if it had been my younger son he wouldn’t be here, as when Declan landed his legs were just at the right height to touch the ground. Brave boy: Declan gave his parents John and Tracey (pictured) a real scare but he has hardly shed a tear according to his father . ‘He fell forward and the tree sprang back out, it burst his bowel but they never found any part of the tree in his body. ‘They took him to Kirkcaldy to get prepped for going to Edinburgh but they had to operate immediately.’ He spent seven days in hospital after the operation and now must use the stoma bag for six months while his bowel heals. Mr Clark said: ‘I can’t praise my son enough, he’s hardly shed a tear. ‘I can’t thank the people at Victoria Hospital enough as well, they were just amazing.’ The offending tree has been cut down.","Declan Clark pierced his stomach after he slipped while climbing a tree .

"A Ukrainian opposition activist who went missing last week says he was kidnapped, crucified and had part of his ear cut off in the latest attack on an anti-government protester. Dmytro Bulatov, 35, a member of Automaidan, a group of car owners that has taken part in the protests against President Viktor Yanukovych, went missing January 22. He was discovered outside Kiev yesterday and told rescuers that his kidnappers kept him in the dark for more than a week, beat him severely, nailed him to a cross and sliced off a piece of ear, before eventually dumping him in a forest.

Dmytro Bulatov's badly swollen hands appeared to show nail marks from his alleged crucifixion . Opposition leader Petro Poroshenko (right) rushed to the hospital where Bulatov (left) was taken . 'They crucified me, they nailed down my hands. They cut off my ear, they cut my face. There isn't a spot on my body that hasn't been beaten...Thank God I am alive,' Bulatov told Ukraine's Channel 5. Footage shows his face and clothes covered in blood and his swollen hands showing nail marks. Opposition leader Petro Poroshenko rushed to the hospital where Bulatov was taken last night. 'Dmytro asked to pass his greetings to everyone and to say that he has not been broken and will not be broken,' Poroshenko told Channel 5. 'That he is full of energy and despite the fact that he body was been beaten, Dmitry's spirit is strong.' Police said they have opened an investigation and said the car he was driving when he disappeared had been found.

Lutsenko was kidnapped from a hospital, where he had brought a fellow protester, Yuri Verbitsky, to be treated for an eye injury. Verbitsky was also beaten severely and was later discovered dead. The disappearances prompted an outcry from protesters, who accused the government of intimidating the opposition.

"Man's best friend: Researchers found having a dog made people feel less isolated (file picture) They are known as man’s best friend – but having a dog can help you socialise more with people too, says a study. Researchers at the University of Chicago found having a dog made people feel less isolated, while other pets including cats, lizards and hamsters, had no effect. Professor John Cacioppo told the American . Association for the Advancement of Science’s conference: ‘We find that . dogs are associated with less loneliness. ‘Unfortunately for cat owners, cats, reptiles and rodents aren’t associated with a difference.’ He added: ‘We didn’t determine what it was about a dog – but one of the things that dogs require that other pets don’t is that you have to walk them. ‘When you take them out and walk them you get exercise and you meet your neighbours. I don’t know about you, but I’ve met neighbours over the years through my children and my pets.’ He added: ‘I think my dog also likes me and that may be part of it. But it may not. I think this getting out, walking, talking to people could be sufficient for a dog’s health benefits relative to other pets.’ Chris Laurence, former veterinary director of Dogs Trust, said that when one dog stops to ‘talk’ to another dog, the owners stop to chat too. He added: ‘If you are out with your dog, most people who are walking a dog will say “hello” at least, but other people without dogs just walk past. Findings: Researchers at the University of Chicago (pictured) found having a dog made people feel less isolated, while other pets including cats, lizards and hamsters, had no effect . ‘In terms of reducing loneliness, dogs are more of a spur to people. You don’t take your cat to a training class. ‘Animals like rats are very intelligent and interact, but they don’t induce interactions with others.’ Mr Laurence, who is also a former director of the Feline Advisory Bureau, also echoed the professor’s comments about dogs being more loving than cats. He said: ‘There is the old adage that you don’t own your cat – it owns you. Cats tend to interact when they want to, whereas dogs tend to interact when you want them to.’ 'We find that dogs are associated with less loneliness. Unfortunately for cat owners, cats, reptiles and rodents aren’t associated with a difference' Professor John Cacioppo . There are other health reasons why dogs are man’s best friend. For instance, a review of research by the American Heart Association suggested that pet owners have healthier hearts than other people – and dog owners particularly benefit. This may be because of the necessity to go for walks, whatever the weather. Studies show that dog owners walk more than other people, making them more likely to meet government guidelines on physical activity. For instance, an Australian study found that dog owners walked for an average of five hours a week - compared with less than three hours for others.","Scientists find that having dog makes people feel less isolated .

"It's not going to happen... promise! The Pentagon has issued a new policy to head of fears that autonomous robots will be designed to kill humans . The U.S. military has made clear that any future robot weapons systems will always need manual authorisation before opening fire on human targets. The Department of Defense issued a new policy directive saying that any semi-autonomous weapons systems will be designed so they need human authorisation to open fire. The promise comes after a Human Rights Watch report called for an international ban on 'killer robots', which the group warned could be deployed within 20 years. Soon after that report was published, . Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter signed a series of instructions . 'to minimise failures that could lead to unintended engagements or to . loss of control' of armed robots. Policy directive 3000.09 says: . 'Semi-autonomous weapon systems that are onboard or integrated with . unmanned platforms must be designed such that, in the event of degraded . or lost communications, the system does not autonomously select and . engage individual targets or specific target groups that have not been . previously selected by an authorised human operator.' In order to make sure this is the . case, the Pentagon asks that the hardware and software controlling robot . weapons comes equipped with 'safeties, anti-tamper mechanisms, and . information assurance'. They must also be designed to have proper . 'human-machine interfaces and controls'. Above all, they must 'allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgement over the use of force'. The Pentagon's promise comes after a joint Human Rights Watch and Harvard Law School report raised the alarm over the ethics of allowing robots to take decisions as to when to open fire on humans. Although no U.S. drone is yet able to pull the trigger without a human operator's direction, the report warned that militaries worldwide are 'very excited' about machines that could one day be deployed alone in battle. Death from above: A U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone takes off from Kandahar, Afghanistan . Automatic firing: Raytheon's Phalanx gun system, which searches for enemy missiles and automatically destroys incoming projectiles . There are already precedents for such . machines. Raytheon's Phalanx gun system, already deployed on U.S. Navy . ships, can search for enemy fire and destroy incoming projectiles by . itself. The Northrop Grumman . X47B is a plane-sized drone able to take off and land on aircraft . carriers, carry out air combat without a pilot and even refuel in the . air. And in South Korea, . Samsung have developed an automated machine gun sentry robot that is . able to spot unusual activity, challenge intruders and, when authorised . by a human, aim at targets and open fire. Faced . with such worrying developments, the Losing Humanity report called for . 'an international treaty that would absolutely prohibit the development, . production, and use of fully autonomous weapons.' Automatic death: Samsung's machine gun sentry robot, which is already in use in South Korea, can spot unusual activity, challenge intruders and, when authorised by a human controller, open fire . Steve Goose, arms division director at . Human Rights Watch, added: 'A number of governments, including the . United States, are very excited about moving in this direction, very . excited about taking the soldier off the battlefield and putting . machines on the battlefield and thereby lowering casualties.' A centre for 'Terminator studies', where leading academics will study the threat that robots pose to humanity, is set to open at Cambridge University. Its purpose will be to study the four greatest threats to the human species - artificial intelligence, climate change, nuclear war and rogue biotechnology. The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) will be co-launched by Lord Rees, the astronomer royal and one of the world's top cosmologists. Rees's 2003 book Our Final Century had warned that the destructiveness of humanity meant that the species could wipe itself out by 2100. The idea that machines might one day take over humanity has featured in many science fiction books and films, including the Terminator, in which Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a homicidal robot. While . Mr Goose admitted such 'killer robots' do not exist as yet, he warned . of precursors and added that the best way to forestall an ethical . nightmare is a 'preemptive, comprehensive prohibition on the development . or production of these systems.' The Pentagon's latest promise could offer some relief for those worried about the possibility of automating warfare, with the new policy mandating a team of senior officials to certify that any weapon meets stringent conditions before agreeing to its development or purchase. However, the directive does leave the way completely open for increased autonomy in a range of military robots that aren't intended as killing machines. It '[d]oes not apply to autonomous or semi-autonomous cyberspace systems for cyberspace operations; unarmed, unmanned platforms; unguided munitions; munitions manually guided by the operator (e.g., laser- or wire-guided munitions); mines; or unexploded explosive ordnance,' the policy says. That means the Pentagon does not need to apply similar safeguards when developing computer viruses, bugs or surveillance drones. As Wired puts it: 'While everyone’s worried about preventing the Rise of the Machines, the machines are getting a pass to spy on you, under their own power.'","Department of Defense policy directive calls for autonomous weapons to be designed so they always need human authorisation to open fire .

While the president may not enter into legally binding treaties without backing from two-thirds of the Senate, he and climate negotiators intend to sidestep the Constitutional rule by agreeing to what they call a 'politically binding' deal. It's a move that has already infuriated congressional Republicans in coal and gas producing states. Scroll down for video . Sidestepping Congress: Barack Obama is pursuing a sweeping international climate change agreement that would compel the U.S. and other nations to cut emissions, all without getting the okay from Congress . Backlash: 'This would be just another of many examples of the Obama administration's tendency to abide by laws that it likes and to disregard laws it doesn't like,' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told the Times. Meanwhile, Tuesday's New York Times report on the proposed deal comes just as a United Nations report on the imminent and irreversible damage of man-made climate change was leaked widely to the press. 'If you want a deal that includes all the major emitters, including the U.S., you cannot realistically pursue a legally binding treaty at this time,' Clinton administration climate change official Paul Bledsoe told the New York Times. Instead, Obama's deal would blend legally binding conditions the US already agreed to in a 1992 treaty with voluntary pledges to enact carbon-cutting domestic laws. In essence, the Times reports, the deal would be an update to the treaty 'and thus, negotiators say, not require a new vote of ratification.' For Republican leaders, it was another tiresome example of Obama's willingness to use executive power to work around Congress. 'Unfortunately, this would be just another of many examples of the Obama administration's tendency to abide by laws that it likes and to disregard laws it doesn't like — and to ignore the elected representatives of the people when they don't agree,' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told the Times. The deal would require nations to enact new policies but only pledge to specific emissions cuts and to send funds to poorer countries in order to help them cut their own emissions. According to an international science report, the time is now or never to curb global emissions if 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems' are to be avoided. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday sent governments a final draft of its synthesis report, which combines three earlier, gigantic documents by the Nobel Prize-winning group. There is little in the report that wasn't in the other more-detailed versions, but the language is more stark and the report attempts to connect the different scientific disciplines studying problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas. The 127-page draft, obtained by The Associated Press, paints a harsh warning of what's causing global warming and what it will do to humans and the environment. It also describes what can be done about it. Whose affected? The move could disproportionately affect states where the economy is largely dependent on coal and other fossil fuel production . 'Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,' the report says. The final report will be issued after governments and scientists go over the draft line by line in an October conference in Copenhagen. Depending on circumstances and values, 'currently observed impacts might already be considered dangerous,' the report says. It mentions extreme weather and rising sea levels, such as heat waves, flooding and droughts. It even raises, as an earlier report did, the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food. And ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life, it says. Without changes in greenhouse gas emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century,' the report says. In 2009, countries across the globe set a goal of limiting global warming to about another 2 degrees Fahrenheit above current levels. But the report says that it is looking more likely that the world will shoot past that point. Limiting warming to that much is possible but would require dramatic and immediate cuts in carbon dioxide pollution. Impacts: Reports of the administrations proposals emerged Tuesday just as United Nations group report on the dire need to curb carbon emissions in order to avoid the 'severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts globally' of man-made climate change . The report says if the world continues to spew greenhouse gases at its accelerating rate, it's likely that by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. And by the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 6.7 degrees warmer (3.7 degrees Celsius). 'The report tells us once again what we know with a greater degree of certainty: that climate change is real, it is caused by us, and it is already causing substantial damage to us and our environment,' Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann wrote in an email. 'If there is one take home point of this report it is this: We have to act now.' John Christy of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, is in the tiny minority of scientists who are skeptical of mainstream science's claim that global warming is a major problem. He says people will do OK: 'Humans are clever. We shall adapt to whatever happens.' While projections show that the world will warm and climate will change, there's still a level of uncertainty about how much, and that makes the problem all about how much risk we accept, said MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel. If it's soon and only a little risk, he said, that's not too bad, but when you look at the risk curve the other end of it is 'very frightening.' The report used the word risk 351 times in just 127 pages.","Obama and his negotiators plan to update a 1992 agreement in order to avoid a Congressional vote on a new treaty .

"Councils in England paid more than £200,000 to teachers after they were attacked by their pupils . Teachers who have been attacked by their own pupils were handed more than £200,000 in payouts last year. There were 17 incidents in 2013, which involved punching, biting and headbutting, and led to councils across the country paying teachers compensation. The Sun on Sunday revealed a Dorset teacher received £43,000 after suffering injuries inflicted by a student. One female teacher was handed £3,000 after a pupil bit her on the head in Croydon, south London. Another teacher received £3,500 after being hit by glass that was thrown by a student. The figures come after 16-year-old Will Cornick was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years last week after stabbing to death 61-year-old Mrs Maguire at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April. Christopher McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, told the Sun on Sunday: 'Schools should be places of learning, not battlefields.' The NASUWT teachers' union, which records reports of attacks, says: 'Staff are entitled to work in an environment free from violence and disruption and to appropriate access to training and support on behaviour matters.' 'Pupils are entitled to a safe and orderly learning environment, together with effective teaching and support, to assist them in achieving their full potential.' Numbers of students suspended for attacks in school have been rising for the past few years. Earlier this year, a 14-year-old boy attacked seven teachers in school in a terrifying rampage after he was told off for chewing gum. Schoolboy Will Cornick, 16, pictured left, stabbed his 61-year-old teacher Ann Maguire, right, in the classroom . The pupil headbutted one teacher up to 15 times, body-barged another and kicked out and punched others as they tried to calm him down, a court has heard. He also picked up a chair and attempted to throw it across the classroom, emptied cupboards and upturned drawers from a desk. The pupil, who has been allowed to stay at the school, also kicked a glass panel in the foyer. Staff at the school in Oldham, Greater Manchester, including the headmistress, attempted to restrain the boy but he began to kick out and threaten them. The teachers - six of whom were women - were able to remove his shoes before he could cause serious injury and police were called to the school to arrest him. Last year, a teacher whose arm was knocked into a filing cabinet by a pupil received almost £400,000 in compensation. The secondary school worker was putting a confiscated football into the cabinet when the child smashed his arm in the drawer. The victim was unable to continue working after developing ‘complex regional pain syndrome’ – described by the NHS as a ‘burning pain’ - and was handed £382,930 in compensation.","Councils paid out after incidents of biting, punching and headbutting .

Poppy Lovatt, from Stoke-on-Trent suffers from the Epidermolysis Bullosa disorder (EB) which makes her skin fall off at the slightest touch. The toddler has to be lifted by parents Kim, 30, and Paul, 38, by her bottom because touching her arms causes her flesh to tear. Standing proud: Poppy Lovatt, a two-year-old girl from Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire,  can't cuddle her parents without being in agony due to a rare condition which has left her skin as fragile as a butterfly's wings . The Lovatt family: L-R Paul, 38, Jacob, seven, Poppy, two, and Kim 30 . Poppy has to have her wounds dressed twice-a-day but her parents can't comfort her with too many hugs in case it causes more sores. Blisters often form on the skin on the toddler's hands and feet as well as on most of her joints leaving her in agonising pain. Mr and Mrs Lovatt also have to avoid picking their daughter up regularly and even the friction from her clothing can cause her skin to flake off. She has been nicknamed, 'the butterfly girl' because the condition leaves her skin as delicate as the insect's wings. The couple said despite living in almost constant pain Poppy never stops smiling.

They also spoke of their heartache at not being able to pick up their daughter sometimes when she wants a hug. Mr Lovatt, a project buyer, said: 'We knew a bit about the disease because looking back, a lot of Kim's family members suffered from it, but it had always been very mild. 'Unfortunately though, when Poppy was born, she got it quite severely. 'She has to be quite heavily bandaged up but we try not to treat her any differently from her brother Jacob. 'We do have to be careful with her, especially when she falls over, because her skin is very fragile and she can blister within minutes, but we just want to try and make sure she leads as normal a life as possible.

'When she falls over it is awful. If there's any trauma or she catches anything, the skin comes off and blisters. 'You always go to pick her up under her arms but it blisters and scars and it is not nice. But she is a little fighter and a very happy child considering. 'You have good weeks and bad weeks. Some weeks it's not too bad but you have other weeks where you can't pick her up at all. 'And thats very hard when she's wanting a hug and you can't just give her a big squeeze and tell her it's going to be OK. 'That is just heartbreaking.'

Poppy is just one of 5,000 people in the UK with Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa and there is no known cure for the disease. Her parents, who also have a seven-year-old son Jacob, have to spend 30 minutes applying special creams and bandage Poppy twice every day to make sure her skin is protected. Mrs Lovatt, a health visitor said: 'Poppy was born with no skin on her legs and feet so for the whole of her life she has had to take pain killers and regularly get her skin dressed. 'She is at the point now that she is falling over all the time and she's always got a few scrapes so she is in pain. 'It can be difficult when we change her dressings because if she's quite bad it can be distressing for her. 'We have to be careful how we handle her too, we have to pick her up under her bum because if we touch her under her arms too much her skin just flakes away and it hurts.

The couple are now planning to raise awareness of the condition by taking part in London's Bupa 10k run in aid of DEBRA on May 25. The charity supports families of the disease as well as funding vital medical research. Mrs Lovatt added: 'We are quite actively involved with DEBRA so when we saw this event advertised we thought we'd give it a go. 'We haven't done anything like it before but we wanted to try and raise some money to help Poppy and other children like her.' A spokesman for DEBRA said: 'Epidermolysis Bullosa is a group of genetic disorders that result in fragility of the skin and, in some cases, other internal membranes and organs. 'Blisters, open wounds and sores form as a result of the slightest touch, rub or trauma. 'Certain types of EB can be fatal in infancy and others are severely life-limiting.

"A bug in the processor that powers the popular Tesco Hudl tablet could be leaving private data at risk. Investigations carried out by security researchers and the BBC discovered that they could retrieve ‘deleted’ data from second-hand models of the device. Experts typically advise carrying out a factory reset to remove data from any gadget, but the investigation has revealed this technique may not always work on the supermarket’s tablet. Investigations carried out security researchers and the BBC discovered that they could retrieve ‘deleted’ data from second-hand models of Tesco's Hudl tablet (pictured). Using free software, a security expert obtained unlock codes, Wi-Fi and site passwords, and browsing history . The investigations involved second-hand gadgets bought on auction sites, including eBay, and included 10 Hudls. Earlier this year, researchers from Avast found they were able to pull tens of thousands of photos, emails, text messages and more from used phones being on eBay that previous owners had thought they had 'wiped' clean. Aside from 40,000 photos and 250 ‘compromising’ selfies of men, the company was even able to discover the identity of several sellers, and one person’s completed loan application. Only one phone had third-party security software installed, and it actually gave up the most personal information of all. In response to the findings, Google said: 'This research looks to be based on old devices and versions (pre-Android 3.0) and does not reflect the security protections in Android versions that are used by the vast majority of users. 'If you sell or dispose of your device, we recommend you enable encryption on your device and apply a factory reset beforehand; this has been available on Android for over three years.' The BBC, with help from Ken Munro, security expert at Pen Test Partners, said the Hudl was vulnerable because of a bug in its Rockchip processor’s firmware. Using free software, Mr Munro discovered that the flaw in the firmware meant he could read data stored on it, as well as write to it. He uncovered data including unlock codes, Wi-Fi and site passwords and browsing history. Tesco said that devices returned to the stores have personal data wiped, and advised customers to use data wiping software, as well as carrying out a factory reset, to make sure the information is removed. Sven Boddington, vice president of global marketing and client solutions at computer firm Teleplan told MailOnline: ‘To say it's worrying to find tablet devices are being sold with data still on them is an understatement. ‘This is not the first instance, we’re constantly seeing this kind of story in the news. ‘It’s not good enough to delete the personal data to only a ‘basic standard’ or worse still, not at all as there is an obligation to comply with data protection laws.’ Earlier this year, researchers from Avast found they were able to pull tens of thousands of photos, emails, text messages and more from used phones being on eBay that previous owners had thought they had 'wiped' clean.

"Many people are careful to protect their pin numbers, and are vigilant about giving smartphone apps access to their microphone in case they could be listened in on. But now there’s a new snooping threat, and it comes from a smartphone's gyroscope. Experts say gyroscopes can be turned into crude microphones that can pick up on phone conversations with the aid of specialist software. Gyroscopes are used by smartphones for everything from screen orientation to gaming, and unlike with the phone’s microphone, no explicit permission is needed from third parties to access them. Always listening: Experts say that gyroscopes - which are used to steer cars in smartphone games such as Need for Speed (pictured) - can be turned into crude microphones that can pick up on phone conversations with the aid of specialist software . Computer scientists from Stanford University and Israeli defence research group Rafael told Wired that gyroscopes can also pick up the frequency of soundwaves around them. Android software, for example, reads movement at 200Hz, which means its sensors can detect vibrations within the range of human voices - typically 80 to 250Hz. Apple limits this frequency range to the minimum needed for the app. During tests, vibrations were decoded using voice recognition software, making it possible for experts to eavesdrop on phone conversations - albeit less clearly than if they tapped into a phone’s microphone. When tested, the scientists found the custom-build software could identify around 65 per cent of numbers spoken in the same room as a hacked phone. The technology is not yet honed enough to pose as great a threat as a microphone. But, experts said advancing speech recognition algorithms could soon mean it could be an equally effective eavesdropping tool. Raj Samani, CTO EMEA, McAfee, part of Intel Security, told MailOnline: 'The headlines will certainly raise alarm amongst smartphone users and certainly the refinement of the hack could represent a significant threat. 'At present however, the speech recognition capability of the software does not support the ability to capture all of what is said. The research will certainly need to be closely monitored, as better analytics software support the ability to capture more audio. 'For now, users should ensure they review permissions requested from apps, particularly those that request access to microphone which remains the most efficient means to capture conversations.' The team will showcase their technique at the Usenix security conference in San Diego, California, next week. Around 88 of UK workers believe their calls and texts are being listened to, according to a survey of 1,000 Britons by Swiss-based private communications firm Silent Circle. When asked if they’d buy a phone, or subscribe to a service, that protected calls and texts from eavesdroppers, almost a quarter of Britons said they would. Vic Hyder, chief of revenue for Silent Circle suggests, ‘These figures confirm that many consumers recognise that mobile communications are no longer private. It’s also reassuring that almost a quarter of the UK respondents…are willing to pay for privacy. This is a trend we’re seeing dramatically increase as individuals start to realise that they do have an option to privacy erosion.’ Using vibrations to gain access to smartphones and computers has become a focus for many computer scientists and security experts in recent years. Using a mobile phone, experts have previously been able to record the hum and whirs made by a computer's CPU (pictured) as secure information was being decrypted . Scientists have previously used an iPhone to record what was being typed on a nearby computer keyboard. Researchers at Georgia Tech tapped into its accelerometer - the internal device that detects when and how a phone is tilted - to sense keyboard vibrations. They used it to complete sentences with up to 80 percent accuracy . Patrick Traynor, assistant professor in Georgia Tech's School of Computer Science, said: 'We believe that most smartphones made in the past two years are sophisticated enough to launch this attack' - and it could be assumed that the number has risen because the study was done three years ago. The technique works by using mathematical software that detects pairs of keystrokes, rather than individual letters. Hackers can then determine whether the pair of keys pressed is on the left or right side of the keyboard, and whether they are close together or far apart. After the system has determined these characteristics for each pair of keys pressed, using probability it compares the results against a pre-loaded dictionary. Using vibrations to gain access to smartphones and computers has become a focus for many computer scientists and security experts in recent years. Last year, it was proven that hackers can steal data simply by recording the sounds a PC makes. Using a microphone in a mobile, scientists were able to record the hum and whirs made by a computer’s central processing unit (CPU) as secure information was being decrypted. By then identifying the certain parts of information that each of these unique sounds related to, they were able to extract the content of private emails. This method could, in theory, also be used to steal passwords, logins or any other secure information entered into a web page. German computer scientists have proved that malware can travel between machines using sound waves that are inaudible to unsuspecting humans. Using built-in microphones and speakers in laptops, the researchers managed to transmit passwords and small amounts of data between machines 65ft (20metres) away from each other. They came up with a hack using sound to steal data from protected machines and suggested that noise could be used to pass data between target computers and the ‘hacker’ machine.","Computer scientists from Stanford University and Israeli defence research group Rafael have turned a phone gyroscope into a crude microphone .

"Even if the debris spotted floating 2,500 kilometres off the Australian coastline belongs to the missing Malaysian Airlines plane, the mystery of what happened on doomed flight MH370 might never be unlocked. That's the warning from the world's leading crash investigation bureau - which investigated the 2009 crash of Air France flight 447 - for the 29 planes, 18 ships and six helicopters currently involved in the painstaking search of 600,000 square-kilometres of ocean. It would mean the wait is far from over for the heartbroken families of the passengers aboard the Malaysian flight. Rémi Jouty - head of France's Air Accident Investigation Bureau - said it might take years to recover the plane’s black box, if it can be recovered at all. Scroll down for video . The head of the French air crash investigation bureau, Rémi Jouty, (left)  has warned that the mystery of doomed flight MH370 might take years to unlock, with search parties (right) yet to find the plane's black box . The search for debris thought to belong to flight MH370 has now resumed, with 29 planes, 18 ships and six helicopters involved . ‘The only thing I can say is it will be most difficult and the recovery is not guaranteed,’ Remi Jouty, told the Financial Times. The French bureau has dispatched a three-strong team of investigators to Malaysia to assist local authorities in retrieving the plane's black box recorder, which records sound along with logging the flight's data, and would unlock the mystery of flight MH370. The Royal Australian Air Force are dropping marker buoys to measure currents and tides to help track the wreckage . The search is focused 2,500km off  Australia's west coast, where satellite images revealed two pieces of debris floating in the open ocean . All three were involved in the investigation into the crash of Air France flight 447, which went down in the South Atlantic. Mr Jouty said despite finding that wreckage within 24 hours of the crash, it took officials two years to retrieve the flight’s black boxes from the ocean floor. The devices were eventually recovered from a depth of 4,000 metres – approximately the same depth as the section of the Indian Ocean where search parties are working to locate debris believed to belong to flight MH370. Search teams working to recover the debris from the 2009 Air France crash . It took investigators two years to recover the black box recorder from the Air France crash . Mr Jouty said the 2009 investigation was hampered by the size of the search area, with French authorities unable to locate the recorders despite having a relatively sure idea of where they might be. But the search area for MH370 will be substantially larger, given the debris may have been drifting  since the flight's disappearance on March 8, and there’s no way of knowing whether the plane’s black boxes are anywhere near the rest of the wreckage. Investigator Alain Bouillard, who headed the French bureau’s 2009 search, told the Sydney Morning Herald that the search MH370 would be ‘far, far harder than what we had looking for Air France 447.’ ‘Firstly we had many more clues,' he said. 'We knew that the Air France plane had a problem, thanks to 24 ACAR messages sent over four minutes; we knew its precise location four minutes before impact, which allowed us to reduce our search zone to only 40 nautical miles. ‘That is nothing compared to the surface area of today's search.’ A Royal Australian Air Force P3 Orion takes off from Pearce air base to help continue the search . The 63-year-old said merely finding the debris would be the first step in a long investigation into locating the plane's black box recorder, which could be up to 150 miles away from the wreckage. 'Objects that have drifted for two weeks will have traveled a long way in that time,' he said.'if you have currents at four knots, that mean four nautical miles per day and a considerable distance in 14 days.' But the crash expert said the debris would at least begin to paint a picture of what happened aboard Malaysian flight MH370. 'After you have identified and examined some debris, you can piece together how the plane broke up,' he said. 'Was it in the air, was it during a sea landing, or did it hit the ocean surface? From that you can build up a scenario.'","French air crash body warns mystery of doomed flight still years away from being solved .

"When Alex de Campi rescued Cathy from a kill shelter, the Pitbull was emaciated, had a severe eye infection and was covered in cigarette burns.

"Chat show host Meredith Vieira has revealed her tragic experience of domestic abuse in a discussion of the Ray Rice scandal. In a preview clip of Wednesday's episode of The Meredith Vieira Show, the 60-year-old TV veteran revealed why she chose to stay in the physically abusive relationship. ''I was scared if I tried to leave something worse could happen to me,' Vieira said. Scroll down for video... Candid: Meredith Vieira revealed why she remained in an abusive relationship in a preview for the Wednesday episode her talk show . Vieira came forward with her account, as she responded to a current Twitter campaign called #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft, where women who have been abused share their stories online. The mother-of-three revealed she was in an abusive relationship when she was younger, and she struggled to leave. 'It started out, I loved this guy, it started out we’d have a fight and he’d just sort of grab my arm,' she said. 'I didn’t think a lot about it and then it turned into pushing me into a wall and then it went beyond that to actually taking his hand and grabbing my face and saying, ""I could ruin your career if I wanted to and no one would want you."" 'Now, this is going on, I’m a smart woman, a lot of people say, ""Well, who would stay in that situation? Somebody who doesn’t have the wherewithal to get out, the means to get out."" I had that. I had a job at the time,' she added. Vieira's shocking story was previewed Tuesday, as the NFL Players Association filed an appeal over Rice's supension, asking for an independent party be brought in to access the Baltimore Ravens' player's punishment. ''We . have asked that a neutral and jointly selected arbitrator hear this . case as the Commissioner and his staff will be essential witnesses in . the proceeding and thus cannot serve as impartial arbitrators,' the union said in their appeal. Turned violent: The 60-year-old said her ex grabbed her face, saying '""I could ruin your career if I wanted to and no one would want you""' Finding the courage: Vieira finally ended the relationship when she moved to another state for a job . She said after much reflection, she realised she remained in the relationship out of fear. 'I was scared of him. I was scared if I tried to leave something worse could happen to me,' she said. She also blamed herself for the abuse, a common response from victims of domestic violence. 'Part of it was guilt because every time we would have a fight he would then start crying and say, ""I promise I won’t do it again"" and I would feel like maybe I contributed somehow to this and they are saying this about Ray Rice’s wife, that it takes two to tango. 'Then there was the night, we shared an apartment, and he threw me into a shower, naked with scalding water and then he threw me outside into the hallway, we lived in an apartment building and I hid in the stairwell for two hours until he came again crying, ""I promise I won’t do this again,""' he said.' Sparking debate: The issue of domestic violence has made headlines following Ray Rice's suspension from the NFL for beating his wife Janay, pictured together in May . Adding her voice: Vieira was responding to a current Twitter campaign called #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft, where women who have been abused share their stories online . Opening up: Thousands of women have revealed why they remained in an abusive relationship . She finally found the courage to end the relationship when she moved to another state for a job. 'So, when people talk about domestic violence it is really really a complicated issue. It’s not so easy to just get away. You think it would be but it’s not. Having said that, if my daughter Lily who is now 21 was in an abusive relationship, even if she thought she loved this man I would say go. Just go. 'We didn’t have shelters when this was happening to me, there was no hotline. I would say call the hotline.' Rice hit his then-fiancée Janay Palmer while they were riding an elevator in Atlantic City earlier this year. They were married just one month later. Happy ending: Vieira has been married to Richard M. Cohen for 28 years, pictured in NYC in 2012 . Vieira added: 'If you are going through this get yourself to a shelter, by all means tell somebody what’s going on, let somebody know. 'That’s . just my experience with it and I know it’s rampant in this country and . we all have to accept the fact that it’s not just an issue with the NFL, . it’s an issue with all of our lives and until we take it seriously more . and more women are going to get abused.'

The latest State of the Internet Report by researchers Akamai found the average user in the UK realistically gets just 8.4Mbps and this average puts Great Britain in ninth place globally in terms of speeds. The latest Akamai State of the Internet Report compared web speeds in 129 countries. South Korea came top with an average speed of 13.3Mbps. The UK tied with Sweden to sit at the bottom of the top 10 because the average user gets speeds of just 8.4Mbps . This chart shows how the UK compares to other countries in terms of average speeds. In positive news, speeds in the country did rise by 48 per cent in the past year . In the report, the UK is shown in tenth on the list because it tied with Sweden for speed but comes after Sweden alphabetically. Ahead of the UK is South Korea, on 13.3Mbps, Japan, Switzerland, Hong Kong, Latvia, Netherlands, Czech Republic and the United States. However, the UK did see the highest speed increases year-on-year, with averages jumping by almost 50 per cent. The figures from uSwitch also found more than a quarter of UK postcodes still struggle to get 3Mbps and at these speeds it would take around six hours to download a high-quality film. Focusing on the UK's biggest towns . and cities, uSwitch found Telford tops the list with average download . speeds of 22.99Mbps, while people in Hull get around half this speed, at . 10.49Mbps. London came in . at 26 with average download speeds of 17Mbps, with almost a fifth of . broadband users getting speeds lower than 3Mpbs. This chart shows how web speeds compare across the UK's largest postcodes. The research by uSwitch found not a single town or city in Great Britain has speeds classed as superfast, which is 24Mbps or higher. London came in at 26th place . In urban areas, Hull has made the . least progress with speeds increasing just 26 per cent, compared to . speeds in Leeds that have rocketed by 87 per cent. Norwich is also making progress, with speeds up 75 per cent since last year, yet it’s still one of the slowest UK cities for broadband with over a third  not seeing their average speeds break the 3Mpbs mark. Back globally, South Korea who came out on top with average speeds of 13.3Mbps dropped 6.4 per cent from the previous year. New figures from uSwitch found that not a . single UK town city has what's classed as superfast download speeds, . which is 24Mbps or above. This . is despite the major networks offering contracts that promise speeds of . between 50Mbps and 100Mbps, including Virgin, BT and Sky. Additionally, the government has set a target to offer superfast broadband to 95 per cent of Britain by 2017. Government agency Broadband Delivery UK has a budget of £530 million to invest in public broadband. In the U.S, the District of Columbia had the fastest average speeds at 11.4Mbps - up 17 per cent from the previous year. Connecticut was in tenth place with 10Mpbs. Speeds were much more consistent across American districts and in some instances varied by just 0.1Mbps, on average. Utah lost 0.4 per cent, compared to the previous quarter, to 10.3 Mbps, Delaware lost 3 per cent to 10.8 Mbps, and New Hampshire lost 7.9 per cent, down to 10.7 Mbps. Additionally, Vermont saw a 27 per cent quarter-over-quarter loss that dropped it not only out of first place, but also out of the top 10 entirely. The slowest state was Arkansas with 4.5Mbps, despite a 5.6 per cent quarterly increase. Akamai is a cloud company that specialises in internet use and compiles its State of the Internet Report at various points throughout the year. It looks at speeds, as well how many people use the internet, security and mobile use in 129 countries. Average connection speeds across the world based on surveyed . mobile network providers ranged from a high of 9.7 Mbps down to a low of . just 0.5 Mbps. Yet traffic doubled over the past year. Marie-Louise Abretti, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'Urban speeds in the UK are around three times faster than rural speeds, but even download speeds in Britain’s 50 biggest cities still aren’t superfast. 'The Government’s blinkered focus on bringing superfast connections to 95 per cent of Britain by 2017 is all very well but, if they pull it off, it’s only half the battle won. 'If people don’t actually use super-fast broadband because it’s too expensive, or they don’t know they can get it, then what’s the point? Uptake will be heavily dependent on both price and awareness.'","Average global speeds increased at the start of the year to 3Mbps .

"'Rope-a-dope': Sen. McCain's reference was to heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali's successful 1974 strategy of stretching out his fight against George Foreman, by feigning weakness in order to exhaust the older fighter over the long-term . Senator John McCain today said he fears that President Obama is a victim of a 'game of rope-a-dope' being played by Russia's Vladimir Putin 'as the slaughter goes on'. McCain, who has alternated between supporting Obama's course and publicly lamenting its weakness, spoke out after the president's landmark national address last night in which he agreed to bow to Russian plans to broker a handover of Syria's chemical weapons. 'I'm worried that we have a game of rope-a-dope for a while, and the slaughter goes on,' McCain said Wednesday morning at a Wall Street Journal breakfast in Washington. 'I think if you were sitting in Putin's seat, you would feel pretty good today,' McCain added later. TheArizona Republican has expressed puzzlement at why the president hasn't insisted that any diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons crisis end with Assad's removal from power. Meanwhile, aides to members of Congress told MailOnline today that the chief fear swirling around Capitol Hill is that in the hands of Putin, an apparent deal to separate Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad from his chemical weapons could be a giant stalling tactic. A staffer to a senior member of that committee said Wednesday afternoon that by relegating U.S. military muscle to backup-plan status, the president 'all but guaranteed that Putin will think he has a really long leash.' 'Not that we'll be in a position to pull it anyway,' the aide added. Who's the boss? Putin now appears in charge, while Obama's embrace of a diplomatic path in Syria has limited America's options . The A-Team: Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov (R) and his Syrian counterpart Walid al-Moualem (L) turned John Kerry's gaffe into a diplomatic triumph that leaves Obama on the outside looking in . Obama said Tuesday that 'It’s too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.' 'But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force,' he added, 'particularly because Russia is one of Assad’s strongest allies.' 'I have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path.' 'I . devoutly wished last night that the president had said what he told . [Sen.] Lindsey Graham and me in the Oval Office,' McCain said Wednesday . morning. 'And that was that he supported efforts ... to bring about . negotiations which would lead to the departure of Bashar Assad.' Speaking during his daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday that Obama's initial threat of military force in Syria 'was not designed to precipitate regime change.' 'I expect that this will take some time,' Carney acknowledged. 'But we also are not interested in delaying tactics.' Only hours before Obama's speech, in a hearing of . the House Armed Services Committee, Secretary of State John Kerry . insisted Tuesday that any proposal for a Russian-brokered deal with Assad 'has . to be swift, it has to be real, it has to be verifiable. It cannot be a . delaying tactic.' But another congressional aide who works for a Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee said one reason why the White House has recently backed off from its earlier calls for regime change is that 'Obama knows this thing will take years, not weeks, to play out.' 'The U.S. will see its own regime change in 2017, and odds are Assad will still be in power then,' the aide predicted. Out of breath: Kerry was in London on Monday and testified in Washington on Tuesday. On Wednesday he took counsel from former Sec. of State Henry Kissinger before boarding a plane for Geneva, Switzerland to meet with Russia's foreign minister . Back to work: Hours after concluding his 15-minute speech on Syria, Obama was volunteering to pack food donations on the 9/11 anniversary near the nation's capital . Winner: Syrian president Bashar al-Assad stands to lose much of his chemical weapons stockpiles but will likely remain in power, fighting his civil war with conventional weapons sent from Russia by the boatload . Syria's tentative agreement to allow . Russian and international officials to locate and remove its chemical . weapons caches had its genesis in what Sen. McCain called a 'queasy' moment of last-minute, accidental diplomacy. Kerry answered a reporter's question during a London press conference on Monday, quipping that if Assad were to 'turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week,' he could avoid U.S. military strikes. 'He isn't about to do it,' Kerry quickly added, 'and it can't be done, obviously.' But the Russian and Syrian foreign ministers saw an opening and played it to the hilt, emerging with an agreement that cut Obama out of the loop – and started a ball rolling that will likely take a long time to find its resting place. 'We'll never see this Russian plan put into action as it's the sort of thing that takes years to negotiate,' French diplomacy expert Philippe Moreau-Defarges told Bloomberg News. Moreau-Defarges, a researcher at the French Institute of International Relations in Paris, said Putin's true goal 'is to play for time, to push off the talk of strikes as long as possible.' 'The longer he pushes them off, the less likely they are. I'd say the chances now of strikes are about 5 percent.' Assad has continued to demonstrate that even without chemical weapons, his conventional arms can wreak havoc on rebel-controlled regions of Syria. Heavy artillery shelling caused this destruction in Barzeh, a district of Damascus, on Tuesday . David Cameron, the British prime minister, has also observed in Parliament that any Putin-Assad deal would need to include safeguards 'to make sure that this isn’t some delaying tactic, that this isn’t some ruse.' Some in Congress are naturally suspicious of Putin, compounding their existing qualms about U.S. foreign policy in the hands of Obama and Kerry. Kansas Republican Rep. Mike Pompeo, a one-time West Point valedictorian who sits on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, observed after Obama's Tuesday evening address that 'I hope this works.'

"A pizza boy who raped a woman on the Upper West Side 'because he was horny' as her seven-year-old daughter slept beside her will spend 13 years in prison. Cesar Lucas, 18,described by some as 'showing no remorse' admitted to sneaking into Kia Walker's apartment in September of 2012 after delivering pizza to an apartment on the same floor but tried to claim she was 'very drunk.' Lucas also stole an iPhone and $20 from Graves' 7-year-old daughter's wallet on his way out. Scroll down for video . Cesar Lucas, 18, who raped a woman as she slept in bed with her child will serve 13 years behind bars . 'Your honor, he has violated me​​ and my family. He turned my life around,' Kia Graves - who has waived her anonymity and spoken to the media - told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber, as convicted rapist Cesar Lucas kept a stoic expression. Graves held back tears as she addressed her teenage rapist in the courtroom. 'They say time heals everything but I’m still waiting. I’m not ready to make nice and I’m not ready to back down. I’m still angry, sad and hurt, your honor,' Graves said, reading from a notebook. 'He deserves everything the court is sentencing him to today.' Lucas was only 16 when he raped Graves, and two years later when he was addressed in the court room by a judge who asked him if he had anything to say he said, 'no thank you.' The New York Post reported that Lucas also handed in a written confession that claimed Graves was 'drunk' at the time of the attack. It also stated he felt 'this type of feelings he had never felted before which led him to do things he would never think he would do in his life.' 'I unrap her from all the coushing she had on top of her . . . She also started to feel horny, you can say,' his poorly written statement said. 'She was completely drunk. I really was pretty scare because she was drunk and I kind ah took advantage of her,' the letter continued. Even though Lucas failed to claim responsibility for his actions and instead claims the victim 'wanted it,' his lawyer Gary Villanueva says Lucas is a good kid. 'He’s a remorseful young man from a caring, decent and solid family,' said Villanueva. Graves says she wants to move on with her life but that it will be very difficult. 'I feel sorry for him, but I must forgive him to move on with my life. Thank you,' she said. 'To forgive sounds good. To forget — I’m not sure I could.' Kia Graves spoke up in january of this year and revealed that her life has been utterly turned upside down since the night Lucas slipped into her apartment and had his way with her while out on a run for his father's 10th Avenue pizza restaurant. 'I have nightmares thinking that he’s getting out of jail, and I wake up all the time making sure my door is locked,' said the shell-shocked mom. Unfortunately, her door was not locked that September night. Cesar Lucas was working as a delivery . boy at Sal’s Pizza in the same Manhattan . neighborhood as the woman’s luxury apartment building. Cesar Lucas, 18, claimed Graves was 'very drunk' when he raped her and he attributed his actions in a poorly written confession to his 'disea' He was delivering a pizza to the next-door flat when he noticed that the door was slightly ajar and allegedly entered the apartment. Graves, a former actress turned model agency employee, had gone to bed with her daughter an hour and a half before the alleged incident. It was the last time Grave says she's had a normal night's sleep. 'I sleep with one eye open, basically,' she told the New York Daily News. 'I have panic attacks and I wake up in sweats.' Graves no longer works and lives each day crippled by her memories of the attack. 'I don’t know what to do,' she said. 'I’m just seeing my doctor and hoping for the best.' In addition to her professional life, Graves said her social life has been left in shambles. 'I . used to go out sometimes after work,' she told the Daily News. 'We used . to have parties or go out. I used to date. I wasn’t a social butterfly, . but I had a normal social life, definitely.' Convicted: Pizza delivery boy Cesar Lucas, who was 16 at the time, has pleaded not guilty to rape in court but confessed to 'sexual intercorse' with the 35-year-old in a handwritten note released by police . Graves still lives in the apartment where she was raped--a building in which she grew up and where her mother also lives to this day--and her deepest fear is that her attacker, who knows where she lives, will somehow come to find her. 'I’m scared that my rapist will get out of jail and he knows where I live,' she said. 'There’s constant fear and anxiety.' Meanwhile, Graves is suing the night doorman who was there the evening of the attack and was subsequently fired. She's also suing Sal's Pizza, her condo building and management company. Lucas described a type of 'disea' which made him enter the victim’s flat after midnight on September 29, 2012. Disturbing: The then 16-year-old was on a delivery for his father's restaurant Sal's Pizza on Manhattan's West Side. He'd been charged with breaking into apartments before . ‘I screamed,’ the Graves told the Daily News at the time. ‘It took him about 30 seconds. I said, “Get off of me,” and I pushed him. He said “I’m sorry,” and ran out,’ she said. Lucas . was picked up by police at Sal's Pizza a short time later and charged . with rape and burglary. He allegedly told police he was 'feeling horny'. ‘Cesar . got type of disease in a way he never had felted before,’ the poorly . written note reads. Continuing . to refer to himself in the third person, Lucas Cesar then describes the . sexual assault, claiming he had sexual intercourse with her for two . minutes before leaving the apartment – but not before rummaging through . her daughter’s purse and stealing $20, according to the New York Post. Upon his arrest, Cesar Lucas initially denied raping the woman, but admitted he had broken into the flat . ‘What's going on? Why are you arresting me? I've been arrested before for the same thing. I broke into an apartment. It's still pending. I have to go to court,’ he said according to police statements released to the New York Post. Lucas was referring to his arrest in August for breaking into a 39-year-old woman's apartment while making a delivery and stealing her wallet. He was charged with burglary, criminal possession of stolen credit cards and theft of service, to which he has pleaded not guilty . Lucas was taken into custody on September 29 where he eventually made the horrific and grammatically appalling confession to rape. He put all the blame on his ‘disea’, adding in the note that ‘Cesar didn't realized what kind of things he was about to do or make.’","Cesar Lucas, now 18, is convicted of raping 35-year-old former actress Kia Graves as she slept in her Manhattan apartment in 2012 .

A California private prep school teacher is facing multiple criminal charges after he drunkenly threatened three of his students at knife-point while demanding they drive him to Jack-in-the-Box, police say. John Edward Maust must have really wanted a burger Saturday night when three of his 17-year-old students at Arroyo Pacific Academy recognized him and on an Altadena street corner and he asked for a ride. The boys reported they were initially frightened enough by their 34-year-old teacher's behavior to pull over and jump out of the car.

"One of the opera world's leading figures has backed a singer branded 'dumpy' and 'unsightly' by male critics. Mezzo-soprano Tara Erraught's appearance was savaged by reviewers after she first appeared at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival in the comic opera Der Rosenkavalier. Award-winning opera star Dame Kiri Te Kanawa has now spoken out in support of the embattled singer, who she insists is 'absolutely gorgeous'. Scroll down for video . Famous opera singer Dame Kiri Te Kanawa (left) has hit out at critics of Tara Erraught (right) after the rising star's appearance was savaged in reviews . Miss Erraught (left) starred as Octavian alongside Teodora Gheorghiu in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier at the Glyndebourne Opera Festival . The Irish singer was called 'stocky' and 'unappealing' by male reviewers after performing as Octavian in Der Rosenkavalier - a male role traditionally played by a female performer. Dame Kiri, who recently made a guest appearance in hit show Downton Abbey, insisted Miss Erraught was in fact the victim of a 'costume disaster'. Asked what she would say to Erraught, Dame Kiri told Radio 4's Today programme: 'I’d say burn the papers, don’t listen to a single person, go and sit with friends who are absolutely lovely and love you...don’t talk about this and get on with your life'. She also pleaded with critics 'please don’t destroy her, it’s cruel'. Newspaper reviews of Miss Erraught's performance provoked a furious backlash after writers praised her singing but made disparaging remarks about her shape. Rupert Christiansen of the Daily Telegraph said Miss Erraught is ‘dumpy of stature and . . . her costuming makes her resemble something between Heidi and Just William’. Friends of Miss Erraught (left) hit out after reviewers praised her voice but criticised her appearance . Dame Kiri said Miss Erraught was the victim of a 'costume disaster' and urged the young star not to read the reviews . And Richard Morrison of The Times, described her as ‘unbelievable, unsightly and unappealing’. Mr Morrison later said his description of her character had been taken out of context. Writing in today’s paper, he said he had been talking about 'the characterisation of Octavian, not the woman playing her'. But . he went on to say: 'Several musicians I count as close friends (yes, I . still have a few) tell me that what I wrote would have upset greatly the . promising young singer who took the role of Octavian. I regret that.' Miss Erraught (right) starred as Octavian in the performance, a male role traditionally played by a female performer . Daily . Telegraph critic Mr Christiansen said he was ‘distressed to learn that . Miss Erraught has been upset by the hoo-ha’, but said he stands by every . word he wrote. He defended his review, saying he felt she had been cast ‘against type’ in a ‘principal boy’ role. He added that Miss Erraught is ‘a very pretty girl with a delightful smile and endearing stage presence’. Irish-born Miss Erraught's family and fellow singers have rallied around her since the attacks. Her mother Brianain, 50, said: 'Tara has such inner strength. She takes the view that what's said is said, it’s out there now, and it would be much worse if they were criticising her singing rather than her body. 'She is getting tremendous support from everyone around her. She is a professional and is just getting on with it. 'We’ve never had to face this before. She’s been reviewed in a lot of places and there’s never been an issue like this before.'","Young star Tara Erraught was savaged after performance in male role .

"In light of Thailand's changing surrogacy laws following the emergence of baby Gammy's story, Australian parents with children born to surrogate mothers are being turned away from Thai airports. An Australian couple, the biological parents of a young baby born via a Thai surrogate mother, were sent home from Bangkok Airport on Sunday, Fairfax Media reported. This comes as dozens more parents are waiting anxiously for any news, trying to determine whether the closure of one of Thailand's biggest IVF clinics and possibly many more to come will have an impact on their unborn children. Scroll down for video . In light of Thailand's changing surrogacy laws following the emergence of baby Gammy's story, Australian parents with children born to surrogate mothers are being turned away from Thai airports . The couple in question were reportedly detained for more than eight hours by immigration officials, who tried to get them to sign a waiver which stated they had not paid and money for a surrogate or egg donor. When they refused, they were told they had to remain in Bangkok as they were not allowed to leave the country with the child - whose future is now uncertain. Officials in Thailand have been sweeping the country shutting down clinics, such as All IVF in Bangkok which could see as many as 50 Australian couples left in limbo, with no information about their children being carried by Thai surrogate mothers. Permanent secretary of Thailand's Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said his focus is to make sure no children are abandoned during the process. On Sunday Australian biological parents were detained at Bangkok airport and asked to sign papers stating they had not paid for surrogacy . 'My concern... is to ensure that any legislation the Thai authorities are considering takes into account those Australians who already have arrangements in place', he told SMH. Thailand is preparing to fast-track legislation to outlaw commercial surrogacy, banning agencies acting as brokers, or accepting financial or other benefits. Advertising for women to act as surrogates for commercial purposes would also be illegal. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Saturday called on the Thai government to allow a transitional period for 'humanitarian reasons' before the ban, to enable Australians to receive children still being carried by surrogates. Thailand is attempting to fast-track changes to its surrogacy laws after the saga surrounding Down syndrome baby Gammy's surrogate family and biological Australian parents, pictured with Gammy's twin sister Pipah . The Australian families have already paid thousands of dollars to agents and the surrogate mothers for the procedure, and the fate of any stored embryos is unknown. There are also rising concerns about the surrogate mothers who may abort their babies as they now have no support from the clinics. Thai authorities cracked down on the growing surrogacy business after the plight of Gammy, a seven-month-old baby with Down syndrome, whose Australian biological parents allegedly left him behind in Thailand but took his twin sister to Bunbury in Western Australia. Human trafficking laws carrying a sentence of up to 10 years will be enforced while a surrogacy bill is in parliament, according to the head of Thailand's Department of Health Services Support, Boonruang Triruangworawat.","Australian couple were turned away from Bangkok Airport on Sunday .

"Do you dream of having a white wedding, but despair at the lack of a man in your life to share the big day with? You're not alone - a new trend is cropping up in the Far East for solo weddings. As women become financially independent, they are putting off settling down with partners until later on in life. But they still want the all-about-me no-expense-spared party that comes with getting hitched, without actually having to tie the knot. Want to get hitched but don't have a man in your life? A Japanese company is selling 'solo weddings', where girls can experience the thrills of getting married without the need for a husband . Travel company Cera Travel in Kyoto, a city in southern Japan, has started a new service called 'Solo Wedding.' It lets single women enjoy all the fun and glamour of the day, including spending the honeymoon night in a fancy hotel. The two-day trip sees the clients get dress fittings, choose their own bouquets, get their hair and make-up done and even choose a man to accompany them for a photo shoot. The service started in June and is aimed at single, working women who have decided to pursue careers instead of follow the traditional Japanese route of getting married. The solo wedding arranges for clients to get dress fittings, choose their own bouquets, get their hair and make-up done and even choose a man to accompany them for a photo shoot . It is also being marketed at women who have been divorced but want to feel special again. So far ten women have taken up the offer, which costs around £1,700 ($2,750). A spokesman for the company said: 'It is a truly unique experience and one that we are very proud of. 'All the details are taken care of by wedding professionals and for those who don't want a traditional white wedding dress we offer our Geisha service, which sees the brides going on an historical photo shoot dressed up as Geishas.' After the big day, the women then head back to a 'honeymoon suite' Businesswoman Nagi Daisen, 43, said: 'I've been in a relationship for years but we've never got round to actually getting married. 'So I decided to do this for myself and it was amazing fun. 'I always wanted to wear a wedding dress and to be pampered like this and now I have been. It was great.' The honeymoon night does not include the model used for the photo shoot, although the company said the women mostly invited their boyfriends to join them in the honeymoon suite after the 'wedding' was over.","Japanese company started the service for career-women and divorcees .
